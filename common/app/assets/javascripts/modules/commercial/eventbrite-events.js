It doesn't even have to be your own story. No longer the sole province of the nostalgic famous, a memoir doesn't have to cover a whole life - it can explore the details of a personal triumph, a serious illness, a relationship, a divorce, or a job.</P>\r\n<P>Through an intensive weekend of talks and practical workshops, you'll learn the all-important craft of knowing what to share, and what to leave out, and how to hone your writing style to build an intimate bond with your readers. You'll end the course understanding the challenges of writing a memoir, but with the skills you need to pour a life onto the page.</P>\r\n<H2>Tutor profile</H2>\r\n<P><STRONG>Mark McCrum</STRONG> has published fifteen books, including five top ten bestsellers.

From prize-winning creative non-fiction like Dave Eggers 'A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius' to celebrity tell-alls and confessional misery-lit, in recent years memoirs have attracted critical adulation, controversy and some serious sales.</P>\r\n<P>Having a story to tell is the first step in writing a memoir. It doesn't even have to be your own story. No longer the sole province of the nostalgic famous, a memoir doesn't have to cover a whole life - it can explore the details of a personal triumph, a serious illness, a relationship, a divorce, or a job.</P>\r\n<P>Through an intensive weekend of talks and practical workshops, you'll learn the all-important craft of knowing what to share, and what to leave out, and how to hone your writing style to build an intimate bond with your readers.

Are you wondering how to survive and thrive in this new visual world?</P>\r\n<P>This course aims to inspire, instruct and empower those who want to work in the exploding field of video journalism. We will look at how modern video journalism can both break with the conventions and constraints of traditional broadcast TV, and rise above the amateurism of home-shot footage. We will look at how to maximise the power of video, taking you through the planning, shooting and editing process involved in making compelling short films.</P>\r\n<P>Part of the course will take place in our working studios, and will be delivered by video journalists who have been at the Guardian since the launch of its multimedia department in August 2007.</P>\r\n<H2>Course content</H2>\r\n<P>The course will cover:</P>\r\n<P>\u2022 How good online video can be distinct from other forms<BR>\u2022 Planning and execution of multimedia reporting<BR>\u2022 How to find stories, characters and scenes<BR>\u2022 Filming with a smartphone<BR>\u2022 Non-news coverage - how can we show sport and culture in a different light?<BR>\u2022 Editing - how to turn your raw footage into a powerful storytelling<BR>\u2022 Pitching ideas<BR>\u2022 Practical session: editing an actual Guardian video<BR>\u2022 Practical session: how to best film a case study<BR>\u2022 Practical session: editing your footage</P>\r\n<P>The course is a mixture of theoretical and practical. It is for anyone who wants to work in video journalism in some capacity: print journalists who want to learn video skills; those who work in marketing wanting to expand PR ideas; journalism/media graduates who want to add inside knowledge, tips and experience; and those with broadcast experience who want to change the way they work to fit a multi-skilled online environment.</P>\r\n<P>Some basic filming experience (even on smartphone) and basic editing knowledge (Final Cut, Adobe, Avid or iMovie) is preferred but not essential. There is no need to bring any equipment. Sony EX1R cameras and Final Cut Pro editing software will be supplied/used for exercises. We will not be teaching in-depth manual camera operation, or using or instructing on DSLR cameras. The principles covered on the course will apply to films shot on any camera.</P>\r\n<H2>Tutor profiles</H2>\r\n<P><STRONG>Cameron Robertson</STRONG> joined the Guardian's video department in 2007 after 12 years as a print reporter and has since contributed video from the US, Russia and western Europe.

It will principally focus on the importance of good visual storytelling, offering advice and guidance on how data can be found, analysed and matched with what your chosen audience needs. It will also look at how the design and presentation of graphs and charts can make a huge difference to their impact and memorability. In addition, it examines the work of some of the leading practitioners in the field, including Edward Tufte and David McCandless.</P>\r\n<P>There will be a data visualisation challenge in which we ask participants to apply what they have learnt to a specific dataset.

But writing about science, health or the environment is a difficult task. The fields cover a vast array of different disciplines, new discoveries can be prone to over-hyping, and your success depends on explaining complex information to a lay audience, meaning digging out and making the most of good stories is hard work.</P>\r\n<P>This evening course is the perfect primer for anyone interested in a career in science journalism or communication, as James Randerson, Guardian Environment and Science News Editor, shows how science stories make it from the lab bench to the media.</P>\r\n<P>Through a series of talks and practical exercises, Randerson will teach you how to spot and write a potent, informative news story, and how to pitch it to editors. You'll learn about the major common sources journalists use to find stories about science, health and the environment. You'll also learn about the ways science journalism can go wrong, and how inaccurate stories make it into print. Perhaps most importantly, you'll also learn how to avoid falling into the churnalism trap of reporting bad science and ensure your writing is both accurate and authoritative.</P>\r\n<P>Sections on the best ways to employ digital media, and how the internet is changing the reporting of science means this is ideal for journalists and bloggers alike.</P>\r\n<H2>Tutor profile</H2>\r\n<P><STRONG>James Randerson</STRONG> is the Guardian's environment and science news editor.

We've been doing it since we lived in caves. We do it automatically when we tell tales to children. We shape our memories into coherent narratives. We gossip and tell jokes and dream. We live in a world of stories brought to us in books, plays and film.</P>\r\n<P>But when we try to write, so much gets in the way: doubts about our own creativity; abstract notions about what constitutes good writing; anxieties about our ability to come up with good ideas. The words themselves trip us up \u2013 how can I get them to say what I want them to say? And how can I create a convincing character? And even the love of books can be such a burden - how dare I write a single sentence when Dickens wrote Great Expectations? And so the blank pages remain blank.</P>\r\n<P>This class aims to clear away such doubts and anxieties, to plunge into the messy, playful, difficult, joyous, imperfect process of discovering stories that have their own energy and form. It will explore the power of memory, the magic of ordinary objects, the relationships between words and visions. It will nourish confidence in your ability to discover your own stories and to write them in your own voice.</P>\r\n<P>By the end of the two days you should be well under way with at least one new story, and you'll have a fund of ideas for more. Although Almond is known mainly as a children's writer, this is not a class in 'writing for children'. It is for anyone who wishes to write well.</P>\r\n<H2>Tutor profile</H2>\r\n<P><STRONG>David Almond</STRONG> was born in Newcastle, grew up in Felling-on-Tyne and now lives in Northumberland. He is the author of Skellig, My Name is Mina, The True Tale of the Monster Billy Dean, Clay, The Boy Who Swam With Piranhas, and many other novels, stories and plays. His work is translated into over 40 languages, and has been widely adapted for stage and screen. His many awards include The Hans Christian Andersen Award 2010, the world's most prestigious prize for children's authors.
