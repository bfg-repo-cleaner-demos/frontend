# Prolonged Content API outage 

- date: 2013-08-28
- duration: 1:45pm to 4:45pm (~3 hours)
- environment: PROD

## Summary

An upgrade to the Content API infrastructure resulted in an afternoon of instability for frontend.

## User-facing consequences

- Approximately 25% drop in traffic for the duration of the outage, largely articles.
- Deployments to production were blocked all afternoon and feature development slowed down.
- We doubled cache times and disabled 'related links' and auto-refresh features to ease up on backend traffic.

# Thoughts

- The dashboard (radiator) and alerting felt useful during this time. I received a single Pager Duty call and Pingdom bounces all afternoon.
- The Content API do not support their infrastructure, so had no idea of the problem. They were all out of office during the upgrade.
- This reaffirms our reliance on a stable backend. Over the last month or so most of the downtime has been caused by an API outage of some description. 

# Actions 

- Talk (again) about how to decouple the bulk of our requests from the API stability. The roll out of a new & improved API is happening during our gradual ramping up of traffic on frontend.
