        "body":"<h2>24 HOURS</h2><p></p><p>If only they'd appointed 'Arry; words on the nation's collective lips at all times, but especially today. Would that he had only been in the England dressing room on Tuesday night to offer his nuanced \"run around a bit\" tactical guidance. Instead, Mr Roy, who can read and everything, used the benefit of his vast intellect to determine that a convoluted analogy, containing within it a popular and historical racial slur, was the most effective way of telling Chris Smalling to pass Andros Townsend the ball. More effective than \"Oi, Chris! Pass Andros the ball! By the way, I'm reading John Williams at the moment!\"</p><p></p><p>Curiously, Hodgson then approached Townsend \"straight away\" to dispense a quick \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6wOhtk3C3A&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\" title=\"\">no offence</a>\", but clearly one of his players remained offended, deciding to pass details of the incident to a newspaper, evidently not sufficiently at ease to raise it himself. There followed an ignorance of largely white men espousing what should and shouldn't be deemed offensive by those who have suffered a long, painful discrimination. Most pertinently, sociology's Wayne Rooney was on hand to inform everyone that he'd seen the story on \"Roy\" and that \"this is ridiculous\". Though it is, of course, possible, that he was simply taking the opportunity to brag about being on first-name terms with the manager.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Townsend was forced to endure questions on the subject, by now known as \"space monkey joke\" – or \"legitimate space tale\" if you ask Stan Collymore, expert in legitimacy, space and tales. Townsend, of course, handled himself with dignity, and explained that there was no issue whatsoever – though in the past, plenty of people in his position have felt obliged to assert ambivalence, for fear of offending those with the power to affect their lives.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Mr Roy – \"a man of the highest integrity\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/17/roy-hodgson-fa-greg-dyke-space-monkey\" title=\"\">according to a statement issued by the FA</a> – apologised once more, mortified by the suggestion that he could possibly have offended in such a way. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/08/luis-suarez-calmer-liverpool-return\" title=\"\">\"very self-critical\" Luis Suárez</a> was unavailable for comment.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p></p><p>\"On confronting us Mr Ince asked why he had been sent to the stand. I explained to Mr Ince the reason why he had politely been asked to leave the technical area. It was then a clearly frustrated Mr Ince had said 'and where's your busy [effer] of a fourth?'. Mark Pottage, the fourth official, was stood behind Mr Ince at the time and said 'I'm here'. Mr Ince then turned around and violently shoved Mr Pottage with two hands in to the chest. Stewards then quickly stepped in and tried to usher Mr Ince to the dressing room area. As this occurred Mr Ince, being restrained by stewards and players of Blackpool, was repeatedly shouting in an aggressive manner 'I'll knock you [effing] out you [cee]' to Mr Pottage\" – ref Oliver Langford's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/17/paul-ince-banned-foul-mouth-rant-blackpool\" title=\"\">evidence from an FA hearing into Paul Ince's conduct</a> after Blackpool's win over Bournemouth is released.

        "body":"<p>The Football Association's chairman, Greg Dyke, has issued a statement backing Roy Hodgson over a \"space monkey\" joke the England manager told at half-time during Tuesday's decisive World Cup qualifying victory against Poland.</p><p></p><p>Hodgson told the joke to encourage players to pass to Andros Townsend, and the Tottenham Hotspur winger has made clear that he has no problem with the manager's remarks. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/17/roy-hodgson-space-monkey-kick-it-out-investigation\" title=\"\">The anti-racism campaign Kick It Out asked the FA to investigate, however</a>, after the Sun's front-page report of the incident.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.thefa.com/News/thefa/2013/oct/greg-dyke-statement-roy-hodgson.aspx\" title=\"\">Dyke's statement said</a>: \"Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team. He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association.</p><p></p><p>\"He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken.</p><p>\"Roy has spoken with Andros Townsend and a number of the players since the game and he has been assured there are no problems within the squad whatsoever. Additionally, the FA has not had a complaint from any squad member or player representative, and we have today talked extensively to the squad.\"</p><p></p><p>The joke is one that became popular at Nasa, the US space agency, in the 1960s and 1970s after it sent monkeys into space before humans. One version of the joke is that the first time Nasa sends a man up into space a monkey goes with him and does all the skilled technical jobs inside the rocket. Finally the astronaut gets frustrated and radios Nasa to ask what he should do. Nasa replies: \"Don't touch anything – just feed the monkey.\"</p><p></p><p>In his earlier statement, Hodgson said: \"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p></p><p>Townsend, whose father, Troy, works for Kick It Out as its mentoring manager, insists he was not offended and cannot understand why it has generated so much coverage, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andros_townsend/status/390770514849181696\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> the player said: \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p></p><p>Wayne Rooney tweeted: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420265064|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|0a6316cf673b2bc28061dc424a5b55535a9ec84b -->",

        "headline":"With a bit of planning England could have been seeded ahead of the Swiss",
        "body":"<p>So it's official, England will not be seeded in the World Cup draw. <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html\" title=\"\">Fifa's latest world rankings</a>, in which the world's top seven will join Brazil as seeds, puts them only 10th. But the frustration is that they might have made it, had they only tried. The difference between success and failure in this race lies not only in results on the pitch, though they obviously help, but in a bit of thought being put in off it. Sure, had England held on to their half-time lead in Montenegro in March, or beaten Ukraine last month, a place in pot one would have been theirs, but the easiest way for the Football Association to have made sure their team got seeded wasn't by getting them to actually play well – which is an awfully complicated business – but by occasionally making sure they didn't play at all.</p><p>This is going to get mildly complicated, so bear with me. The basic facts to start with: in the latest Fifa rankings there are 58 ranking points between England and Switzerland, the last of the seeded teams. England's performances this year have contributed 485.46 towards their total, the number of points won on average per match played. Switzerland have averaged 669.63 points per match this year. The Swiss had a kind qualifying draw, and played their hand admirably well, but the key difference between the teams, the reason why the Swiss will be seeded and the English will miss out, is that England have played five friendlies in the last year (W2 D2 L1), and Switzerland only three (W2 D1).</p><p>Fifa's ranking system heavily rewards competitive fixtures – a European team will get 2.5 times more points for a result in World Cup qualifying than the same result against the same team at the same time in a friendly. The most points it is possible to win in a friendly – by beating the world's No1 team – is 600, which is still below Switzerland's average. If even winning a friendly can hurt a top team's ranking, imagine the damage that drawing or losing can do.</p><p>For example, against Sweden last November England were leading 2-1 with 15 minutes to play, made a stream of second-half substitutions and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/14/england-sweden-friendly-repor-zlatan\" title=\"\">eventually lost the match 4-2</a>. The match earned them no ranking points. Had they simply not played that game they would currently be 48.55 points better off. Six months later England won a feeble 161 points by drawing with the Republic of Ireland. Had that game also never been scheduled, England would currently be ranked by Fifa as the sixth best team in the world.</p><p>A combination of pride and commercial imperatives have forced the FA to schedule a string of prestige friendlies – against the best sides on the planet, whose excellence means they are most likely to cause England to fail, or against other British or Irish nations, who will be hugely motivated by the occasion. If a place among the seeds in the World Cup finals is a priority then, in the key year before the finals draw, an association should schedule as few friendlies as possible, and if they really must arrange one they have to win it.</p><p>Play the percentages: England would have got 543 points had they won at the Maracan&atilde; in June, but there were just 181 on offer for a draw while defeat would have left them with nothing. Meanwhile you can get 483 points for beating Peru at home, or 468 for beating Honduras. In this context the FA's decision to schedule an away friendly against Brazil, or for that matter Sweden, in the year of a World Cup finals draw is unjustifiable. Even if all their other results had been unchanged, had England played no friendlies at all in the last 12 months they would be 181 ranking points better off, and officially the fourth best team in the world.</p><p>They could also have scheduled their competitive games better. Even in qualifiers a victory against one of the very worst sides in Europe, such as San Marino, is worth just 375 points. In other words, being drawn against a rank no-hoper during qualification is severely detrimental to a team's chances of being seeded once qualified. The only way of limiting the damage is by scheduling both matches against them more than a year before the finals draw, because Fifa's system massively prioritises results over the most recent 12-month period. Matches you might well lose should also go here, while games more likely to bring hefty returns – against average-to-good nations, especially at home – should never be among the first qualifiers played. .</p><p>(As an aside, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/14/france-world-cup-seeding-ranking\" title=\"\">France recently complained that they were disadvantaged by being in a five-team group</a>, which gave them two fewer qualifiers and therefore fewer chances to accumulate ranking points. This is total nonsense – the addition of a feeble sixth team to their group would have enormously reduced their point-scoring potential. Had they finished qualifying with a 100% record, and taking their opponents' rankings at the point the draw was made, their matches would, on average, each have brought 1,173.62 points. The addition of San Marino, Andorra or Malta would have reduced this average by 159.72. The truth is that theirs would have been the best group of all, had they only played better.)</p><p></p><p>There is also an element of luck, because points are calculated according to a team's ranking at the moment the match takes place, which has nothing to do with the opponent. For example, when the qualifying draw was made in July 2011 Moldova had a world ranking of 85, meaning that at that moment England could have earned a handsome 862.5 points by beating them. But their ranking had been inflated by a couple of rogue victories in previous qualifying campaigns.</p><p>These results became less important as time passed, and when England actually got round to playing them for the first time, in September 2012, they had dropped down to 141, and the maximum points available for a win was a miserable 442.50.</p><p>If, when the draw was made, Armenia rather than Moldova had been placed from pot five into England's group, and if England had beaten them home and away, they would be 62.44 points better off and, even without changing their friendlies or any other results, would have usurped the Swiss as world No7. The best possible qualifying group has plenty of decent teams, with absolutely no terrible ones. The current system massively benefits the South American sides, who play more qualifiers (normally 18) than the Europeans and face no side currently ranked below 71 in the world. Whoever gets through that group is all but guaranteed a points bonanza, and the continent will duly have four seeded teams next summer.</p><p>So if England do find themselves in the group of death when the draw is made on 6 December lessons should be learned. Recent, painful history has taught us that a team of England's quality will always mess up in matches, whoever's sitting on the bench. But Fifa's system hands great power to the administrators, and gives whoever schedules matches – or refuses to – the chance to give their team a significant boost. Next time, the FA should take it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420261808|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|580660245c9e38152c9fc0cafc6a87b31dc382f6 -->",

        "headline":"José Mourinho interview: I want players who are made in Chelsea",
        "body":"<p>Early Wednesday afternoon at Cobham and José Mourinho, having taken refuge from the chill of an incessant autumn drizzle, was impatient to crack on. The international window had rather dragged, a manager left with only a handful of first-team players to drill forced to break up the tedium by paying a fleeting visit to Belgrade to see Branislav Ivanovic and Serbia defeat Japan, and then an evening at Wembley watching England qualify for the World Cup.</p><p>In between there was an enjoyable weekend spent with his family, but the days still felt \"empty\" without league fixtures to demand his attention. \"I got bored,\" he said. \"I'm not the kind of person to tell my assistants to stay here and train the four or five guys we have in while I go on holiday. I don't do that. I can't do that. I was here at the training ground all the time, and that frustrated me because I like to work with the players and I could not. So I prepared, for Cardiff this weekend, for Schalke next week. I went to watch Ivanovic last Friday, England on Tuesday. I watched every match my players were in on television. But you always want to get back to it, for it all to start up again.\"</p><p>The two-times European Cup winner's enthusiasm and intensity are retained, with the latest early-season hiatus unwelcome. Mourinho, at 50 and back where he feels he belongs, is already consumed by the new kind of project he has accepted at Chelsea. Where his task first time around had been to establish this club's reputation as winners, breaking a league title drought that had extended for half a century, now the Portuguese is rising to another challenge. This team has claimed London's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/19/bayern-munich-chelsea-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">first European Cup</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/15/chelsea-benfica-europa-league-final-live\" title=\"\">Europa League </a>under interim managers over successive seasons, fine achievements given they have either felt like a squad in constant transition or a side too often reliant upon pragmatism to secure success against classier opposition. Mourinho must bring style and panache to the party.</p><p>He is aiming to ally work-rate with pizzazz, establishing an industrious flamboyance, and his players are buying into what is required, even if the likes of Juan Mata and Kevin De Bruyne have already been subjected to some tough love en route. That is all part of the process, with results on the pitch solid rather than spectacular to date. It would have been folly to expect anything else. The restored manager points regularly to a lack of key personnel at the peak of their powers, in an age bracket from 26 to 30. Instead he has inherited, or seen purchased, prospects with burgeoning reputations who are eager to prove their pedigree while an older generation work to maintain their own standards and help guide the youngsters through the clutter of an English calendar.</p><p>Figures such as Frank Lampard and John Terry were mainstays of Mourinho's initial Chelsea lineups in that glittering first spell at Stamford Bridge and, where they might otherwise have faded into the background, are restored to prominence now. The midfielder has featured in all matches bar a League Cup tie at Swindon this season. Terry has started each of the club's Barclays Premier League fixtures and should maintain that record against Cardiff City on Saturday. The older heads remain pivotal to the project.</p><p>Take Terry. The centre-half  has endured much since Mourinho departed back in 2007, the list of controversies, plenty of them self-inflicted – from twice losing the England captaincy to being banned over the Anton Ferdinand affair, to the nagging injuries and missing the Champions League final through suspension – trip off the tongue too easily. At times he felt like a bit-part player under Rafael Benítez's stewardship last season, and even the veteran club captain is not immune to self-doubt.</p><p>Now, though, he is revived. \"He's recovering his self-esteem,\" said Mourinho. \"In the last few years he was not playing a lot, he had problems on the pitch, he had problems outside the pitch, he had suspensions for different reasons, he had injuries, he had managers who didn't trust him enough. And it looked like, at a certain moment, his career was going in the wrong direction.</p><p>\"Even I was questioning, from far away, what was happening to this guy: physical problems, psychological problems, what is going on? I'm happy he's proving he's still a top player. He plays in a position where age doesn't make a huge difference. It's a position where players rely more on positioning, on reading the game, and being in the right place at the right time. Experience helps. Look at how many top teams have experienced players at centre-half: go to Barcelona and Carles Puyol is there; go to Manchester United and there's Rio Ferdinand; Jamie Carragher at Liverpool was playing until last season and was important for them. You go to many clubs and top clubs and central defenders are 30 to 34. John is proving his quality. With what he did at Chelsea in the last decade, I think he deserves to be back on track.\"</p><p>Then there is Lampard, the club's record goalscorer whose box-to-box style, all late charges into the penalty area to catch opponents unawares, is being tweaked as time overtakes him. The onus these days is to transform a player capped 102 times by his country into an English Andrea Pirlo, a deep-lying distributor and an asset in possession. Personalised drills are aimed at coaxing different qualities from his game. \"Of course Frank can become that,\" said the manager. \"He has to adapt and learn every day how to play with this 'new body'. A player can still learn new skills at his age, for sure. I'm 50 and have been a manager since 2000, and I'm learning every day, every match, with every experience. You can always learn new skills, especially if the player has an open mind like he does.</p><p>\"He's a player who can keep the side's balance, a player who thinks about the game and can work with kids around him. For him, it was very good that I'm back because the trust is so big. He knows that every decision I make on him is for my team – because that's the most important thing – but also for him. So if, one day, I bring him off at 70 minutes, or if I leave him on the bench or give him a rest and don't select him, it's for his own good. He knows, without me speaking to him every day – which I don't do with my players – that I'm doing it for him, and that I might need him round the corner to play often. The trust and friendship is so big that he is happy, he's calm, he's cool. At this moment of his career, it was very important for him to have somebody like me around. For him, it's very good.\"</p><p>That pair, along with Ashley Cole, are out of contract next summer and yet, even now, the glowing praise for their early-season endeavours suggests the experienced English heartbeat in the midst of Mourinho's latest Chelsea lineup might be retained beyond this term.</p><p>\"I like that local core, not just in England but when I've worked in Portugal, Spain and Italy,\" said Mourinho. \"You owe some respect to the country and the national team, so to give some options for them is important. To keep the culture of the country in your own team's style is also very important, and you cannot lose characteristics of the local football. Sometimes people think: 'Ah, we want to play like this or like that team, like a Barça or a Bayern.' But, first of all, you have to play like the culture of the country you're in.</p><p>\"I like that loyalty. I also like the fact the foreign players arrive and find a spine in place, a nucleus of local players who can tell them and explain to them where they are, how things work here, the way they have to behave, and even the way they have to play in this league. They have to understand what they've joined. For example, an English player knows what it's like to play eight matches in three weeks at Christmas time. For a foreigner, that can come as a shock, so you need locals around who can explain what it means to people, why you can't complain and why you have to buy into it. Ideally it's not just about having British players either, but having players who are made in Chelsea. In three or four years' time, if we don't have other Englishmen to replace this nucleus of players – when Lamps is 39, John is 36 – I will be very sad. Every club needs that.</p><p>\"So we are working on that [new generation]. We have some players on loan, like [Nathaniel] Chalobah, and we have some others working and growing in the under-21s. Their standard is improving. Before, these age groups in England did not have a good level of competition at that age, but now there is a national championship, an under-19s Champions League, and it's improving them. The conditions in our academy cannot be better – the facilities and coaches are amazing – but while the quality of the coaching and the philosophy can be excellent, you really need competition to develop the kids.\"</p><p>Such observations will presumably be noted in Mourinho's testimony to the Football Association's commission when Greg Dyke's nominees come calling. The Portuguese is ever eager to impart his opinion and, having worked successfully across Europe, his experience should be tapped.</p><p>Mourinho enjoys his role as an educator these days. The manager was speaking after a Barclays community event at the training ground where grassroots coaches had been given the chance to question him on his coaching philosophy as part of the sponsors' initiative to thank community heroes this season. Those coaches who had taken their seats temporarily in the media suite lapped up his anecdotes, whether he was addressing modern-day tactical trends or the highlights of his time spent as Sir Bobby Robson's interpreter in Portugal and Spain.</p><p>\"Hopefully, one day when I have finished my managerial career, I will have time just to do that, to tell those stories and help the next generation,\" said Mourinho. \"I've always been happy talking to coaches, and my office door is open. I like doing it, especially with kids who want to be something, or with people who might have other jobs but who are really just in love with the game. I understand their curiosity. They want to know details and to try and learn from your experience.\" Some of those in his audience at Cobham were clad in Chelsea kit. Others piped up expressing alternative allegiances, even if they still hung on his every word.</p><p>The Premier League has welcomed Mourinho back. His return has helped offset the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, providing Chelsea supporters with a hero to cleanse the discord from last term, and opposition fans with a pantomime villain to heckle. \"I don't think the Premier League, or the country, missed me,\" he said. \"The country is too strong in relation to football, and the Premier League is too strong to miss somebody. It's not a question of 'missing'. But it's certainly a question of me loving it here and people know that.</p><p>\"I enjoy playing at home, feeling the Chelsea fans' passion, that they are happy to have me on their side; but I also enjoy playing away and feeling the opponents support their own team, giving me that 'hostility'. It's a 'pure hostility'. It's not aggressive. If Chelsea fans at Norwich are singing: 'José Mourinho', and the other guys sing: 'Fuck off Mourinho', I don't think it's aggressive hostility. It's better than them ignoring me. If, one day, I was Norwich manager, they'd be singing my name too. It's pure. You go, for example, to countries like Spain and when they say: '<em>Hijo de puta Portugues</em> [Portuguese son of a bitch]', you know it's a deep feeling. A real hatred. They mean it. Here, even the hostility is different. More tongue in cheek. When I'm not winning I'm 'not special any more'. I understand that and I like it.</p><p>\"It is good to be back. I feel as if I belong here. Take Tuesday, for example, at Wembley. I did not celebrate [England's qualification] by jumping up or drinking because that's not in my nature, but inside I was celebrating. I was happy. A World Cup without England is not a World Cup. They're one of the big football countries and, even if at any particular moment the national team is not at a high level, England has to be always in a World Cup. Of course, part of me was also happy that my players won't have the pressure of the play-offs in November and can play two friendly matches instead, rather than worrying if they would go to Brazil. They deserve to be there. The tournament will be better for having them there.\"</p><p>Yet, with that next international window a month away, Mourinho will plunge himself back into club matters with relish. His players returned from their national set-ups to discover the manager had armed himself with new statistical resources while they had been away. Fine-tuning is being taken to extremes. There really is no hiding from the analysis any more. \"This week we finished work with my staff comparing the way we defend when some players are in the team, and the way we defend when some are not playing. It was all trying to bring more of a scientific approach to everything. I wanted to see if my eyes were seeing exactly what the numbers suggest they should be.\" And are they? \"Yes. Oh yes.\" That was said with a smile and then, with a shake of the hand and work to be done, he was gone.</p><p><em>José Mourinho was speaking at a Barclays community event.

I explained to Mr Ince the reason why he had politely been asked to leave the technical area. It was then a clearly frustrated Mr Ince had said 'and where's your busy fucker of a fourth?'</p><p>\"Mark Pottage, the fourth official, was stood behind Mr Ince at the time and said: 'I'm here.'</p><p>\"Mr Ince then turned around and violently shoved Mr Pottage with two hands in to the chest. Stewards then quickly stepped in and tried to usher Mr Ince to the dressing room area.</p><p>\"As this occurred Mr Ince, being restrained by stewards and players of Blackpool, was repeatedly shouting in an aggressive manner: 'I'll knock you fucking out you cunt,' to Mr Pottage.\"</p><p>In an examination during the hearing, Langford added that \"Mr Ince's eyes were bulging\" as he squared up to Pottage.</p><p></p><p>Giving his own evidence Ince, who denied using the word 'cunt' said: \"As I turned around, Mr Pottage stepped forward and was 'fronting me up' in my face. I felt intimidated, so I instinctively pushed him away.</p><p>\"The push was not aggressive; only enough to move him away from where I was, only in order to avoid a real possibility of a one-to-one confrontation. However, I know I should not have pushed him and I wholeheartedly apologise.\"</p><p>The FA, though, found all three breaches of the Rule E3 were proven and imposed a five-match stadium ban on Ince as a result.</p><p>Ince had told the Blackpool Gazzette on Wednesday that he thought the ban was \"very, very harsh\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420257610|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|9d9bc6f2329a61746876ec79c4266aadd03531b2 -->",

We have come a long way, with the debt being paid down, commercial revenues are increasing. We have more [deals] coming and are confident. However, nothing works unless we have success on the pitch.\"</p><p></p><p>Some fans had earlier staged a small protest outside the stadium entrance. The Black Scarf Movement carried a banner reading \"kick greed out of football – where has our Arsenal gone?\" and handed out leaflets highlighting the differences between the running of Arsenal and European champions Bayern Munich, plus copies of a letter sent to Kroenke in September <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/14/stan-kronke-arsenal-agm\" title=\"\">calling for direct meetings</a> with the American tycoon.</p><p>Wenger also spoke to the shareholders, where he focused on how the current side would build on impressive displays to deliver long-term success.</p><p>Wenger highlighted how last season's victory over Bayern Munich in the away leg of their Champions League tie, which they lost on aggregate, proved pivotal in developing the belief of the squad.</p><p>\"From the end of March to today, we have lost just one match, that created a huge emotion,\" Wenger said. \"We have huge ambition to win the league this season. We were restricted financially and had to be strict, but we have come out of that.</p><p>\"However, we have to defend our style of play and values, that comes from developing our own players, with youth policy and that should be core of our club.\"</p><p>\"We will also look to buy proven quality – we did not need to scout to buy Özil, it was just money. I am pleased we have shown you we are not afraid to spend.\"</p><p>Wenger concluded his speech by adding: \"We are top [of the table] in a very strong position, but the end of November will give a much clearer indication of where everyone lies. I am confident that at the end of May we will all be happy.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420255256|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|2fb4f914b7489feb46c97d2e085f0f014f8a7d01 -->",

        "body":"<p>Andros Townsend has defended Roy Hodgson after the England manager was forced into making an apology over a joke he made about a space monkey and the Tottenham Hotspur winger.</p><p>Hodgson has been embroiled in the bizarre race row after it was reported on Wednesday night that he told the joke at half-time during England's 2-0 win against Poland on Tuesday, in an attempt to encourage right-back Chris Smalling to pass more frequently to Townsend.</p><p>Hodgson has been mortified that the remark could be perceived as racist and issued a statement to apologise for any offence that had been caused. Townsend has since tweeted to say: \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p>\"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time,\" said Hodgson. \"There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room.</p><p>\"I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p>Hodgson gained further support on Thursday from Wayne Rooney, who insisted the manager had his players' full support, despite the Sun claiming that at least one player had been offended.</p><p>The Manchester United forward wrote on Twitter: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><p>The supposed joke is one that was popular at American space agency Nasa. It goes:</p><p><blockquote>\"Nasa decided they'd finally send a man up in a capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions. They fire the man and the monkey into space. The intercom crackles: 'Monkey, fire the retros.' A little later: 'Monkey, check the solid fuel supply.' Later still: 'Monkey, check the life support systems for the man.' The astronaut takes umbrage and radios Nasa: 'When do I get to do something?' Nasa replies: 'In 15 minutes – feed the monkey.'\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Stan Collymore, the former England striker, said it was ridiculous for anyone to complain about the joke. \"Someone leaked it and I bet 100 per cent confident that no player was offended, not one,\" Collymore wrote on Twitter. \"If they are, do explain why. Racism is hard enough to keep on the agenda as it is without making everyone think a legitimate space tale should be a cause for offence.\"</p><p>However, Piara Powar, the executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare) organisation, suggested Hodgson was wrong to use the term. He wrote on Twitter: \"Hodgson used very silly term within a diverse team environment. He should know better. Assume it wasn't a Freudian slip, no evidence to suggest it was. Some players will see it as reflection of the crude language still used by some coaches and attitudes that still prevail.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420230579|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|11daab32f309f2e564c9c732bbf1cd372bb02472 -->",

        "body":"<p>The anti-racism group Kick It Out have deemed the furore surrounding Roy Hodgson's 'space monkey' joke to have been \"concluded\" following the Football Association's investigation into the comments made by the England manager.</p><p>Kick It Out had called on the FA to investigate the joke made by Hodgson despite the England winger Andros Townsend's attempts to play down the issue.</p><p>The England manager has apologised to anyone offended by the joke made at half-time during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/15/england-poland-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Poland at Wembley</a>, which was intended to convey the need for England to play the ball more regularly to Townsend. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/17/roy-hodgson-apologises-space-monkey-joke\" title=\"\">The Tottenham Hotspur player says no offence was meant or taken</a> and the FA has issued a statement backing Hodgson, with Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, describing him as a man of \"the highest integrity\". Kick It Out have subsequently deemed the matter over.</p><p>A statement read: \"Kick It Out, football's equality and inclusion campaign, is pleased that The Football Association (FA) has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately. If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded.\"</p><p>Townsend, whose father, Troy, works for Kick It Out as its mentoring manager, insists he was not offended and cannot understand why it has generated so much coverage, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andros_townsend/status/390770514849181696\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> the player said:  \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p>In a statement, Hodgson said: \"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p>The joke is one that became popular at Nasa, the US space agency, in the 1960s and 1970s after it sent monkeys into space before humans. One version of the joke is that the first time Nasa sends a man up into space a monkey goes with him and does all the skilled technical jobs inside the rocket. Finally the astronaut gets frustrated and radios Nasa to ask what he should do.</p><p>Nasa replies: \"Don't touch anything – just feed the monkey.\"</p><p>It is believed Hodgson was trying to illustrate the need for England's defenders to play the ball early to Townsend while he was in space on the flanks.</p><p>Piara Powar, executive director of the European anti-discrimination group Fare, said the England manager should be more careful. \"Hodgson used a very silly term within a diverse team environment. He should know better,\" said Power on Twitter.</p><p>Wayne Rooney insists Hodgson did \"nothing wrong\" and that the incident had been blown out of all proportion. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WayneRooney/status/390737351326306304\" title=\"\">The England striker tweeted</a>: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Stan Collymore said the row undermined efforts to tackle racism in football. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StanCollymore/status/390608021111726080\" title=\"\">The former England striker  tweeted</a>: \"Demeans every anti racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH who said NOTHING WRONG. Makes campaigners seem over PC &amp; petty. They're not.\"</p><p>The FA has been especially sensitive to any allegations of racism after John Terry was stripped of the England captaincy and later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/27/john-terry-verdict-chelsea-guilty\" title=\"\">banned for four matches</a> for racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand in a Chelsea match in October 2011.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246078|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|2d31ef4baed41e549d159d4061b401907e9bd2f0 -->",

He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association.</p><p></p><p>\"He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken.</p><p>\"Roy has spoken with Andros Townsend and a number of the players since the game and he has been assured there are no problems within the squad whatsoever. Additionally, the FA has not had a complaint from any squad member or player representative, and we have today talked extensively to the squad.\"</p><p></p><p>The joke is one that became popular at Nasa, the US space agency, in the 1960s and 1970s after it sent monkeys into space before humans. One version of the joke is that the first time Nasa sends a man up into space a monkey goes with him and does all the skilled technical jobs inside the rocket. Finally the astronaut gets frustrated and radios Nasa to ask what he should do. Nasa replies: \"Don't touch anything – just feed the monkey.\"</p><p></p><p>In his earlier statement, Hodgson said: \"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p></p><p>Townsend, whose father, Troy, works for Kick It Out as its mentoring manager, insists he was not offended and cannot understand why it has generated so much coverage, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andros_townsend/status/390770514849181696\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> the player said: \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p></p><p>Wayne Rooney tweeted: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420265064|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|0a6316cf673b2bc28061dc424a5b55535a9ec84b -->",

That progress was timely given the FA chairman, Greg Dyke, has warned that the national side could slide into irrelevance unless urgent action is taken to improve the flow of young English talent, with his commission to report back by March having taken soundings from high-profile figures in the game.</p><p>Mourinho and Arsène Wenger, the only other serving manager to have won the Premier League title, are  expected to be contacted before the end of the month for their thoughts. \"If they want to speak with me, I will be open,\" said the Chelsea manager, a two-times European Cup winner who would be able to offer perspective from his time coaching in Portugal, Italy and Spain. \"I&nbsp;will give them my opinion. But if you concentrate on just the here and now – not on the future, in three or four years' time, but on the group of players at Roy Hodgson's disposal to play the World Cup – then England have players more than good enough  to make a good national side.</p><p>\"In the end, they deserved [to qualify]. It was a group without a big national team [as a rival], but it was a group with balance, with three or four teams who could take points off you. So it was a difficult group, and I think with the pressure of these last two matches – OK, they were at Wembley, in London, they had to win, and they did it – they coped well. They showed with the group of players they have that it's not the drama that some people want to make us believe it is. You see the players, and the players on the bench on Tuesday night: look at which clubs they play for, which competitions they play in … You are speaking about some of the best players in the world.\"</p><p>The make-up of the commission has still to be concluded but  includes the former England right-back Danny Mills, Dyke and the FA vice‑chairman Roger Burden, the former England manager Glenn Hoddle, the League Managers Association chairman, Howard Wilkinson, the new Professional Footballers' Association chairman, Ritchie Humphreys, the Football League chairman, Greg Clarke, and the Crewe Alexandra director of football, Dario Gradi.</p><p>The England captain, Steven Gerrard, and his deputy, Frank Lampard, are also expected to be consulted by the panel as it focuses on what is blocking the progress of junior players to senior England level and whether coaching has been undervalued.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420255393|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|8141b512cfcd468f8cf1e480160218f9d3b97bf5 -->",

I felt intimidated, so I instinctively pushed him away.</p><p>\"The push was not aggressive; only enough to move him away from where I was, only in order to avoid a real possibility of a one-to-one confrontation. However, I know I should not have pushed him and I wholeheartedly apologise.\"</p><p>The FA, though, found all three breaches of the Rule E3 were proven and imposed a five-match stadium ban on Ince as a result.</p><p>Ince had told the Blackpool Gazzette on Wednesday that he thought the ban was \"very, very harsh\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420257610|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|9d9bc6f2329a61746876ec79c4266aadd03531b2 -->",

We have come a long way, with the debt being paid down, commercial revenues are increasing. We have more [deals] coming and are confident. However, nothing works unless we have success on the pitch.\"</p><p></p><p>Some fans had earlier staged a small protest outside the stadium entrance. The Black Scarf Movement carried a banner reading \"kick greed out of football – where has our Arsenal gone?\" and handed out leaflets highlighting the differences between the running of Arsenal and European champions Bayern Munich, plus copies of a letter sent to Kroenke in September <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/14/stan-kronke-arsenal-agm\" title=\"\">calling for direct meetings</a> with the American tycoon.</p><p>Wenger also spoke to the shareholders, where he focused on how the current side would build on impressive displays to deliver long-term success.</p><p>Wenger highlighted how last season's victory over Bayern Munich in the away leg of their Champions League tie, which they lost on aggregate, proved pivotal in developing the belief of the squad.</p><p>\"From the end of March to today, we have lost just one match, that created a huge emotion,\" Wenger said. \"We have huge ambition to win the league this season. We were restricted financially and had to be strict, but we have come out of that.</p><p>\"However, we have to defend our style of play and values, that comes from developing our own players, with youth policy and that should be core of our club.\"</p><p>\"We will also look to buy proven quality – we did not need to scout to buy Özil, it was just money. I am pleased we have shown you we are not afraid to spend.\"</p><p>Wenger concluded his speech by adding: \"We are top [of the table] in a very strong position, but the end of November will give a much clearer indication of where everyone lies. I am confident that at the end of May we will all be happy.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420255256|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|2fb4f914b7489feb46c97d2e085f0f014f8a7d01 -->",

        "headline":"José Mourinho interview: I want players who are made in Chelsea",
        "body":"<p>Early Wednesday afternoon at Cobham and José Mourinho, having taken refuge from the chill of an incessant autumn drizzle, was impatient to crack on. The international window had rather dragged, a manager left with only a handful of first-team players to drill forced to break up the tedium by paying a fleeting visit to Belgrade to see Branislav Ivanovic and Serbia defeat Japan, and then an evening at Wembley watching England qualify for the World Cup.</p><p>In between there was an enjoyable weekend spent with his family, but the days still felt \"empty\" without league fixtures to demand his attention. \"I got bored,\" he said. \"I'm not the kind of person to tell my assistants to stay here and train the four or five guys we have in while I go on holiday. I don't do that. I can't do that. I was here at the training ground all the time, and that frustrated me because I like to work with the players and I could not. So I prepared, for Cardiff this weekend, for Schalke next week. I went to watch Ivanovic last Friday, England on Tuesday. I watched every match my players were in on television. But you always want to get back to it, for it all to start up again.\"</p><p>The two-times European Cup winner's enthusiasm and intensity are retained, with the latest early-season hiatus unwelcome. Mourinho, at 50 and back where he feels he belongs, is already consumed by the new kind of project he has accepted at Chelsea. Where his task first time around had been to establish this club's reputation as winners, breaking a league title drought that had extended for half a century, now the Portuguese is rising to another challenge. This team has claimed London's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/19/bayern-munich-chelsea-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">first European Cup</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/15/chelsea-benfica-europa-league-final-live\" title=\"\">Europa League </a>under interim managers over successive seasons, fine achievements given they have either felt like a squad in constant transition or a side too often reliant upon pragmatism to secure success against classier opposition. Mourinho must bring style and panache to the party.</p><p>He is aiming to ally work-rate with pizzazz, establishing an industrious flamboyance, and his players are buying into what is required, even if the likes of Juan Mata and Kevin De Bruyne have already been subjected to some tough love en route. That is all part of the process, with results on the pitch solid rather than spectacular to date. It would have been folly to expect anything else. The restored manager points regularly to a lack of key personnel at the peak of their powers, in an age bracket from 26 to 30. Instead he has inherited, or seen purchased, prospects with burgeoning reputations who are eager to prove their pedigree while an older generation work to maintain their own standards and help guide the youngsters through the clutter of an English calendar.</p><p>Figures such as Frank Lampard and John Terry were mainstays of Mourinho's initial Chelsea lineups in that glittering first spell at Stamford Bridge and, where they might otherwise have faded into the background, are restored to prominence now. The midfielder has featured in all matches bar a League Cup tie at Swindon this season. Terry has started each of the club's Barclays Premier League fixtures and should maintain that record against Cardiff City on Saturday. The older heads remain pivotal to the project.</p><p>Take Terry. The centre-half  has endured much since Mourinho departed back in 2007, the list of controversies, plenty of them self-inflicted – from twice losing the England captaincy to being banned over the Anton Ferdinand affair, to the nagging injuries and missing the Champions League final through suspension – trip off the tongue too easily. At times he felt like a bit-part player under Rafael Benítez's stewardship last season, and even the veteran club captain is not immune to self-doubt.</p><p>Now, though, he is revived. \"He's recovering his self-esteem,\" said Mourinho. \"In the last few years he was not playing a lot, he had problems on the pitch, he had problems outside the pitch, he had suspensions for different reasons, he had injuries, he had managers who didn't trust him enough. And it looked like, at a certain moment, his career was going in the wrong direction.</p><p>\"Even I was questioning, from far away, what was happening to this guy: physical problems, psychological problems, what is going on? I'm happy he's proving he's still a top player. He plays in a position where age doesn't make a huge difference. It's a position where players rely more on positioning, on reading the game, and being in the right place at the right time. Experience helps. Look at how many top teams have experienced players at centre-half: go to Barcelona and Carles Puyol is there; go to Manchester United and there's Rio Ferdinand; Jamie Carragher at Liverpool was playing until last season and was important for them. You go to many clubs and top clubs and central defenders are 30 to 34. John is proving his quality. With what he did at Chelsea in the last decade, I think he deserves to be back on track.\"</p><p>Then there is Lampard, the club's record goalscorer whose box-to-box style, all late charges into the penalty area to catch opponents unawares, is being tweaked as time overtakes him. The onus these days is to transform a player capped 102 times by his country into an English Andrea Pirlo, a deep-lying distributor and an asset in possession. Personalised drills are aimed at coaxing different qualities from his game. \"Of course Frank can become that,\" said the manager. \"He has to adapt and learn every day how to play with this 'new body'. A player can still learn new skills at his age, for sure. I'm 50 and have been a manager since 2000, and I'm learning every day, every match, with every experience. You can always learn new skills, especially if the player has an open mind like he does.</p><p>\"He's a player who can keep the side's balance, a player who thinks about the game and can work with kids around him. For him, it was very good that I'm back because the trust is so big. He knows that every decision I make on him is for my team – because that's the most important thing – but also for him. So if, one day, I bring him off at 70 minutes, or if I leave him on the bench or give him a rest and don't select him, it's for his own good. He knows, without me speaking to him every day – which I don't do with my players – that I'm doing it for him, and that I might need him round the corner to play often. The trust and friendship is so big that he is happy, he's calm, he's cool. At this moment of his career, it was very important for him to have somebody like me around. For him, it's very good.\"</p><p>That pair, along with Ashley Cole, are out of contract next summer and yet, even now, the glowing praise for their early-season endeavours suggests the experienced English heartbeat in the midst of Mourinho's latest Chelsea lineup might be retained beyond this term.</p><p>\"I like that local core, not just in England but when I've worked in Portugal, Spain and Italy,\" said Mourinho. \"You owe some respect to the country and the national team, so to give some options for them is important. To keep the culture of the country in your own team's style is also very important, and you cannot lose characteristics of the local football. Sometimes people think: 'Ah, we want to play like this or like that team, like a Barça or a Bayern.' But, first of all, you have to play like the culture of the country you're in.</p><p>\"I like that loyalty. I also like the fact the foreign players arrive and find a spine in place, a nucleus of local players who can tell them and explain to them where they are, how things work here, the way they have to behave, and even the way they have to play in this league. They have to understand what they've joined. For example, an English player knows what it's like to play eight matches in three weeks at Christmas time. For a foreigner, that can come as a shock, so you need locals around who can explain what it means to people, why you can't complain and why you have to buy into it. Ideally it's not just about having British players either, but having players who are made in Chelsea. In three or four years' time, if we don't have other Englishmen to replace this nucleus of players – when Lamps is 39, John is 36 – I will be very sad. Every club needs that.</p><p>\"So we are working on that [new generation]. We have some players on loan, like [Nathaniel] Chalobah, and we have some others working and growing in the under-21s. Their standard is improving. Before, these age groups in England did not have a good level of competition at that age, but now there is a national championship, an under-19s Champions League, and it's improving them. The conditions in our academy cannot be better – the facilities and coaches are amazing – but while the quality of the coaching and the philosophy can be excellent, you really need competition to develop the kids.\"</p><p>Such observations will presumably be noted in Mourinho's testimony to the Football Association's commission when Greg Dyke's nominees come calling. The Portuguese is ever eager to impart his opinion and, having worked successfully across Europe, his experience should be tapped.</p><p>Mourinho enjoys his role as an educator these days. The manager was speaking after a Barclays community event at the training ground where grassroots coaches had been given the chance to question him on his coaching philosophy as part of the sponsors' initiative to thank community heroes this season. Those coaches who had taken their seats temporarily in the media suite lapped up his anecdotes, whether he was addressing modern-day tactical trends or the highlights of his time spent as Sir Bobby Robson's interpreter in Portugal and Spain.</p><p>\"Hopefully, one day when I have finished my managerial career, I will have time just to do that, to tell those stories and help the next generation,\" said Mourinho. \"I've always been happy talking to coaches, and my office door is open. I like doing it, especially with kids who want to be something, or with people who might have other jobs but who are really just in love with the game. I understand their curiosity. They want to know details and to try and learn from your experience.\" Some of those in his audience at Cobham were clad in Chelsea kit. Others piped up expressing alternative allegiances, even if they still hung on his every word.</p><p>The Premier League has welcomed Mourinho back. His return has helped offset the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, providing Chelsea supporters with a hero to cleanse the discord from last term, and opposition fans with a pantomime villain to heckle. \"I don't think the Premier League, or the country, missed me,\" he said. \"The country is too strong in relation to football, and the Premier League is too strong to miss somebody. It's not a question of 'missing'. But it's certainly a question of me loving it here and people know that.</p><p>\"I enjoy playing at home, feeling the Chelsea fans' passion, that they are happy to have me on their side; but I also enjoy playing away and feeling the opponents support their own team, giving me that 'hostility'. It's a 'pure hostility'. It's not aggressive. If Chelsea fans at Norwich are singing: 'José Mourinho', and the other guys sing: 'Fuck off Mourinho', I don't think it's aggressive hostility. It's better than them ignoring me. If, one day, I was Norwich manager, they'd be singing my name too. It's pure. You go, for example, to countries like Spain and when they say: '<em>Hijo de puta Portugues</em> [Portuguese son of a bitch]', you know it's a deep feeling. A real hatred. They mean it. Here, even the hostility is different. More tongue in cheek. When I'm not winning I'm 'not special any more'. I understand that and I like it.</p><p>\"It is good to be back. I feel as if I belong here. Take Tuesday, for example, at Wembley. I did not celebrate [England's qualification] by jumping up or drinking because that's not in my nature, but inside I was celebrating. I was happy. A World Cup without England is not a World Cup. They're one of the big football countries and, even if at any particular moment the national team is not at a high level, England has to be always in a World Cup. Of course, part of me was also happy that my players won't have the pressure of the play-offs in November and can play two friendly matches instead, rather than worrying if they would go to Brazil. They deserve to be there. The tournament will be better for having them there.\"</p><p>Yet, with that next international window a month away, Mourinho will plunge himself back into club matters with relish. His players returned from their national set-ups to discover the manager had armed himself with new statistical resources while they had been away. Fine-tuning is being taken to extremes. There really is no hiding from the analysis any more. \"This week we finished work with my staff comparing the way we defend when some players are in the team, and the way we defend when some are not playing. It was all trying to bring more of a scientific approach to everything. I wanted to see if my eyes were seeing exactly what the numbers suggest they should be.\" And are they? \"Yes. Oh yes.\" That was said with a smile and then, with a shake of the hand and work to be done, he was gone.</p><p><em>José Mourinho was speaking at a Barclays community event.

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/16/ravel-morrison-clash-wilfried-zaha-england-under21s\" title=\"\">Ravel Morrison and Wilfried Zaha clashed during the England Under-21 game with Lithuania</a> after the Manchester United forward queried why his West Ham United counterpart was not passing to him.</p><p>Zaha had demanded the ball from Morrison, who scored twice, at various times during Tuesday's 5-0 win at Portman Road and so asked him to explain why he had ignored his pleas. There followed a scuffle in which Morrison, who has appeared to find a renewed focus following several off-field incidents when a United player, grabbed Zaha.</p><p>Yet after the European Championship qualifier the pair shook hands near the team coach and joked about the bust-up, with it being understood there is no continuing ill-feeling between them.</p><p>Gareth Southgate, the new under-21 manager, admitted that he faces a challenge to ensure there is no repeat from any of his players and that he can build unity. \"It's my job to bring them together as a group, which is going to be a test. We spoke about being a team before the game. We know the potential of the group of individuals.</p><p>\"The key now is how we come together as a team and that will take time because there is a lot of focus on individuals. Sometimes there is pressure on individuals and one or two of those had a point to prove and did that very well.\"</p><p>Nathan Redmond, the Norwich City winger who separated Zaha and Morrison, said: \"It was just a bit of a disagreement, nothing else. We got back in the changing room and sorted it out. You get that with teams everywhere, there is just a bit more&nbsp;of spotlight on this incident because it was for England. We sorted it out behind the scenes.\"</p><p>Redmond hinted at the root of the problem Zaha had with Morrison: \"Rav's a class player, sometimes he just has to move the ball a little bit quicker. Sometimes you do get a little bit frustrated with him but you just have to let Rav be Rav because of the things he is capable of.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/31/ravel-morrison-west-ham-manchester-united1\" title=\"\">Morrison was sold to West Ham by United in January 2012</a> after Sir Alex Ferguson decided he would not fulfil his potential while still living in Manchester. The previous year he received a referral order for witness intimidation and shortly after joining <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/22/ravel-morrison-fined-by-fa\" title=\"\">West Ham he was fined £7,000 by the Football Association</a> for making a homophobic comment on social networking site Twitter.</p><p>While the latest episode involving Zaha cannot be compared with those incidents, the 20-year-old, who was the outstanding performer in the game against Lithuania, will be keen not to become embroiled in further controversy.</p><p>\"I'm very happy with the performance,\" Morrison told West Ham TV. \"I thought the team performance was good and I thought my performance was good&nbsp;too.\" Of what was only his second appearance for the under-21s, he said: \"I've found it great. I've come in and the lads have treated me well and I've got on with everybody. It's a lot different when you're older, everything has been more calm.\"</p><p>On Saturday Manchester City, are at Upton Park for the late kick-off. \"I'm very excited because I used to play for Manchester United but I never played against their first team so I'm really looking forward to it. Of course we can cause a shock. We're a great team and we should have had a lot of goals this season but for some reason we haven't.\"</p><p>West Ham did <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/tottenham-west-ham-premier-league\" title=\"\">win their last league game 3-0 against Tottenham Hotspur </a>at White Hart Lane and Morrison said: \"Against Tottenham we managed to get the goals which have been missing which was pleasing. The defence has been solid so if we carry on doing what we're doing we can cause an upset.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420177972|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|e3a74a65bd8cd60a8e4c418746822214a0ad1c3a -->",

        "body":"<p>The father of Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj has reacted angrily to comments made by the Belgium coach, Marc Wilmots, in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/09/adnan-januzaj-international-england-belgium\" title=\"\">continuing clamour for the talented teenager's international allegiance</a>.</p><p>The Belgian-born 18-year-old has made a formidable impression for David Moyes's side and there has been speculation that he could represent England in 2018 on residency grounds. Belgium believe they have the strongest case and Wilmots reacted to questions from broadcaster RTBF about Januzaj's desire to play for his side, newly qualified for next summer's World Cup finals in Brazil.</p><p>\"It is impossible to negotiate with me,\" he said. \"The boy was born in Belgium, should he say that he wants to play for Belgium – from there, there is no haggling. I'm not going to play that game.</p><p>\"The kid is available? He wants to play? Then perfect, OK, show me.</p><p>\"If you're at the top level in Manchester or elsewhere, show me your skills and if I need you I will call. I make no promises, to Januzaj or any person.\"</p><p>However, Abedin Januzaj took exception to Wilmots' stance, and says such an antagonistic attitude would only make his son hostile to an approach from his country of birth.</p><p>\"This is shameless,\" he said. \"We never reacted on selections, phone calls or letters from the Belgian FA.</p><p>\"They are requesting his selection, not us. Wilmots' remarks won't make it easier now. We are angry about these comments.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420192667|2013-10-17T16:29:05Z|a1ba15c18c243bcaa958e421f45fa45a5e2282c9 -->",
