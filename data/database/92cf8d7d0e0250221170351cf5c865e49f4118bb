Or, say, if you were to ask about which Mr 15% wants to keep the twinkle, twinkle in his little star's eyes by engineering that dream move to a club that he had never heard of, then, once again, the Mill is your only man. Speaking of which …</p><p>Last summer, <strong>Yohan Cabaye</strong> tried his best to have a dalliance around the back of the bike shed with a couple of clubs that caught his eye, promising them that if they showed just the slightest shot of ankle, he would make it the best day of their lives. But OMG no club bit – or whatever it was Yohan wanted them to do – and Newcastle United, after some relationship crisis talks, took him back through a veil of pain and tears. Since then, the pair have been snapped out in public holding hands, window shopping in Jesmond and even (ooooooooooooh!) looking at rings in Davidsons. But behind the scenes it is a very different story. The relationship has flared up and friends of the couple describe the atmosphere around them as \"fraught\" and \"tense\". Yohan wants out and <strong>Roma</strong> are set to offer him an exit route. Should La Maggica fail to tempt Yohan to the Eternal City, via bags of good food and bags of cash, they will turn their attentions to the <strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong> duo of <strong>Sandro</strong> and <strong>Lewis Holtby</strong>.</p><p>Speaking of the Totts, after Lord Sugar's sour attack on pimpled teenage nerd André Villas Boas (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lord_Sugar/status/397074167767789568\" title=\"\">\"clueless no tactics no plan,\" bodyslammed the Lord Twitter</a>, before performing a delayed vertical suplex and finishing off the Portugeezer with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGUgYF_cYoE\" title=\"\">the Cobra Clutch</a>), the Spurs manager has taken to his room with a pen and paper to work out exactly where his side are going wrong this season. His eureka (!) moment came when he looked in the goals scored column and realised that even Fulham had found the back of the net more than his side this season. Oh the shame, the shame! To combat this then he is going to try get his hands on <del>an experienced striker who can be absolutely guaranteed to do nothing but stand in the box and score 20 goals a season</del> a 21-year-old central midfielder from Barcelona by the name of <strong>Sergi Roberto</strong>. Hmmm, maybe the Shugster has a point.</p><p>Elsewhere, financial fair play's <strong>Monaco</strong> have so much money they could eat steak and lobster and salad (their own choice of dressing, naturally) and jelly and ice-cream all in a single meal every day of the week, every day of the month, every day of the year. They also have so much money they could buy Barcelona's entire first-team squad, triple their wages, buy all of the lads a shiny, new Audi and stick them all in the reserves, never to be seen or heard of again. But their eyes are elsewhere. Their eyes are on the West Midlands. Their eyes are on the The Hawthorns. Their eyes are on £850-a-week's <strong>Saido Berahino</strong>. The youngster has been making <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/premier-league-west-bromwich-crystal-palace\" title=\"\">the sort of waves that would make Carlos Burle hurl in terror and the sort of waves that have led to whispers in dressing-rooms around the country that Berahino might be making Roy Hodgson's next squad</a>. All this excitement has pricked the principality's ears and they want in on the ground floor. But they are not the only ones, <strong>Arsenal</strong> and <strong>Everton</strong> are sniffing around him too.</p><p>Which leads the Mill on to the final rumour of the day. Huzzah! Alto Paraíso de Goiás is known for three things; new age tourism, sightings of flying saucers and Porto's <strong>Fernando</strong>. Everton's <strong>Roberto Martínez</strong> has no interest in the first two (that the Mill knows of anyway) but he most certainly does in rummaging around bargain basements which is where the third one comes into play. Fernando's contract is coming to end this coming summer and the Brazilian is as perky as the average teenage goth about the thought of putting a Porto pen to Porto paper and signing a new Porto deal. But Martínez ain't the only one casting an eye on the one who wants to be castaway, so too are cabal of Italian clubs from <strong>Juventus </strong>to <strong>Napoli</strong> to <strong>Internazionale</strong>. What in the blue Hell is new age tourism by the way?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421682944|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|b8f24a63d4c4f62435db4baac0fb831bab9d52ce -->",

        "headline":"Young Socceroo Jackson Irvine harbours World Cup dream",
        "body":"<p>It does not take an oracle to predict that Jackson Irvine has a big future for the Socceroos.</p> <p>&nbsp;Despite only making a brief appearance against Canada in his recent national team debut, the 20-year-old is already being touted as a potential inclusion for the World Cup squad. And while Irvine would rather live in the moment &ndash; indeed he is still evidently delighted when discussing his first cap &ndash; the Celtic midfielder will no doubt spend the rest of his loan at Kilmarnock trying to earn that ticket to Brazil.</p> <p>&ldquo;My debut was obviously pretty special,&rdquo; Irvine recalls in a smooth Australian accent that nevertheless betrays his time in Scotland. &ldquo;Every kid in Australia growing up dreams of playing for the Socceroos, and myself, well &ndash; I was in Sydney in 2005 against Uruguay, I was in Germany in 2006 for the World Cup. So it was a dream come true to be playing with some of the guys I grew up idolising.&rdquo;</p> <p>Irvine replaced Mile Jedinak in the 83rd minute as the Socceroos recorded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/15/australia-canada-socceroos-match-report\">a comfortable victory over</a> the Canadians, in a great end to a week spent with the stars of Australian football. &ldquo;These guys are such big names and obviously they have all had extremely distinguished careers,&rdquo; the former Frankston Pines player confesses, &ldquo;but at the end of the day they are just blokes from Australia who want to play football for their country. Everyone was really great to me, and they are all there for the same reason &ndash; we want to represent Australia at the highest level.&rdquo;</p> <p>Fast-forward four days however and Irvine had gone from national team glamour to reality at Kilmarnock, where his club side were winless from their first nine Scottish Premier League clashes. Yet buoyed by his Socceroos debut, Irvine capped his incredible week with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQguhCTRvJ8\">spectacular curling effort</a> from outside the box to seal a win against Ross County.</p> <p>&ldquo;It was a bit off the cuff really,&rdquo; the Celtic loanee admits. &ldquo;It may have looked like something off the training ground, but it was just a spur of the moment thing. Nine times out of 10 you&rsquo;ll probably hit those into row Z, but I was lucky enough that it went into the top corner.&rdquo;</p> <p>Irvine has been at Kilmarnock <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23716499\">since August</a>, impressing both as a centre-back and in midfield. His long-term ambitions still lie with the Bhoys though, a club he joined <a href=\"http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/221290,from-victory-to-boca-borussia-and-basel.aspx\">after trialling there</a> at the end of 2009.</p> <p>&ldquo;My whole experience with Celtic has been really good,&rdquo; Irvine said. &ldquo;I played in the youth team for about three years, and then over the last 12 months I&rsquo;ve started to get involved with the first team &ndash; playing in friendlies and I also made my competitive debut. It&rsquo;s a very tough team to break into, being in the Champions League and with the expectation of winning the SPL every year, but overall I am really enjoying my time there.&rdquo;</p> <p>One particular highlight was a friendly against Liverpool this pre-season, with the midfielder earning <a href=\"http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/279111,young-aussie-stars-against-liverpool.aspx\">rave reviews</a> after dominating the Merseyside opposition in a man-of-the-match performance.</p> <p>&ldquo;It was pretty surreal,&rdquo; Irvine said. &ldquo;We had a depleted squad so it was a bit of a fringe first team that played, and I was fortunate enough to start. It was a tremendous experience, we had a massive crowd in Dublin, playing against some of the best players in the world in a very accomplished Premier League team.&rdquo;</p> <p>The lone disappointment for Irvine was his failure to collect Steven Gerrard&rsquo;s shirt post-match, despite <a href=\"http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/279111,young-aussie-stars-against-liverpool.aspx\">media reports to the contrary</a>. &ldquo;There were a lot of pictures taken in the exact moment when I was asking for Gerrard&rsquo;s shirt,&rdquo; the Australian explains, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;d already promised it to someone else.&rdquo;</p> <p>Irvine might have another chance to swap shirts with the Liverpool captain sooner rather than later, with a potential match-up in Brazil not out of the question. Despite having just the solitary cap from his substitute outing against Canada, Irvine has already been touted as a potential World Cup bolter, and is in the squad of at least one <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/football/time-is-no-friend-for-new-coach-ange-postecoglou-as-he-prepares-socceroos-for-brazil-world-cup/story-fni2fopz-1226747180410\">prominent journalist</a>.</p> <p>While the 20-year-old refuses to be drawn on speculation, he admits the chance to play at the World Cup would be a dream come true.</p> <p>&ldquo;To play for the Socceroos in Brazil would be everything, it&rsquo;s what you play this game for &ndash; every young player around the world strives for that opportunity,&rdquo; Irvine comments. &ldquo;If I could manage to get myself in that squad it would be an absolute dream. It&rsquo;s something I can barely even comprehend.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Melbourne native may even find himself jetting to Brazil twice over the coming years, with the combative midfielder eligible for the U23 side that, qualification permitting, will head to Rio de Janeiro in 2016. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still Olyroos age, and we&rsquo;ve got the Olympics coming up in a few years, so there are plenty of national team opportunities,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But obviously you want to take yourself to the highest level, and I&rsquo;d love to stay involved with the Socceroos, especially looking towards the Asian Cup.&rdquo;</p> <p>A composed, articulate and entertaining interviewee, it&rsquo;s immediately clear why Irvine is regarded as a player with leadership potential. It is therefore no surprise that he has captained the Young Socceroos on several occasions and regularly wore the armband for Celtic youth and reserve teams. Irvine will be hoping Ange Postecoglou takes note of these qualities, and perhaps the enterprising midfielder might even one day lead out the Australian national team.</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always nice when coaches view you as a leader, and to captain your country even at youth level is incredibly special,&rdquo; Irvine says. &ldquo;Lucas Neill has done it unbelievably well over the last few years, and it is a quality that not many players possess. I&rsquo;d be very honoured if I was able to captain the Socceroos one day.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421669007|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|2b5d692aa958612f8cbeec66769f1687b66ceea4 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Western Sydney Wanderers are undoubtedly a phenomenal sporting story, and they continue to create firsts in the club’s short history. Tomi Juric’s double against Adelaide United on Friday night ensured the Wanderers collected their first ever come-from-behind victory in the A-League. Coach Tony Popovic admitted his surprise when he was told of yet another mini milestone, but it is an even more surprising first that is worth talking about. Before Friday, Western Sydney Wanderers had never won an A-League match without Youssouf Hersi. So what is it about Hersi that is so important to how the Wanderers play?</p> <p><strong>The Numbers</strong></p> <p>In Hersi’s last 20 matches for the club, the Wanderers have won 18 times and drawn twice, and they have never won in his absence. Amazingly, last season, Western Sydney won 17 straight games in which Hersi played. His five goals and 10 assists so far for the club has helped contribute to their incredible run to win the Premiers’ Plate.</p> <p>But, up until Friday night, their failure to win without their Dutch winger was no coincidence. His combination with right full-back Jerome Polenz is one of the A-League’s best, and the Wanderers are not afraid to use it. So much is their right-sided bias in attack, that <a href=\"http://leopoldmethod.com.au/sydney-derby-bragging-rights-go-west/\">last season 65.6% of the Wanderers’ crosses came from the right</a>.</p> <p>Hersi’s importance to the system can be put down to his phenomenal energy. Without the ball, Hersi is a vital cog in Western Sydney’s high press. Not only applying pressure high up the pitch, Hersi also contributes defensively in deeper areas, dropping back to form an almost impenetrable 4-4-2 defensive block. In attack, his intelligent movement and quick acceleration means he is constantly the first outlet for a pass in a counter attack – with his team purposely picking him out wide on the right. The width Hersi provides on the right is essential to the Wanderers’ attack, allowing Mark Bridge, their top scorer last season, to come inside to finish off counter attacking moves.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f0921680-d5d2-4830-9b0c-e6fad7e4d22d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383614563538/2e727cfd-fb3b-4196-a3c8-340c99388cb5-460x250.png\" alt=\"Hersi’s five goals and 10 assists, as well as winning three penalties, makes him essential to the way Western Sydney play.\" width=\"460\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Hersi’s five goals and 10 assists, as well as winning three penalties, makes him essential to the way Western Sydney play. Photograph: /Guardian</figcaption> </figure> <p>In his absence, Tony Popovic has struggled to find a suitable replacement that can combine such enthusiasm in defence and probity on the right hand side of attack. Popovic has tried both Labinot Haliti and Kwabena Appiah-Kubi, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://leopoldmethod.com.au/wanderers-1-1-sydney-fc-faults-show-in-derby-limelight/\">neither has been able to provide a similar attacking threat</a>&nbsp;– so much so, that Western Sydney only scored 0.17 goals per game when Hersi did not feature, compared to 1.8 per game when he did (prior to Friday night).&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Against Adelaide United</strong></p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-478e46b3-40ab-4af9-b069-962bf443bd61\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383614765355/bf8d30d9-22ea-4b86-8456-2487b9062b68-460x338.png\" alt=\"Analysis of Western Sydney Wanderers' right hand side\" width=\"460\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Analysis of Western Sydney Wanderers' right hand side. Photograph: /Guardian</figcaption> </figure> <p>Hersi is clearly very difficult to fully replace, but against Adelaide, Popovic’s decision to start Brendon Santalab and later replace him with Tahj Minniecon allowed Western Sydney to almost match both the defensive and offensive qualities that Hersi offers. Both players defended admirably, but their attacking movements to the right helped the Wanderers maintain width in attack.</p> <p>Whilst Santalab lacked the guile that Hersi offers with the ball at his feet, his work rate was exceptional as he pulled wide in attack. As shown in the graphic above, Santalab most frequently received the ball off an immediate switch of play from Aaron Mooy. Receiving the ball almost on the sideline, Santalab was able to dribble directly toward Adelaide’s left-back Michael Zullo, whilst Polenz overlapped to create a 2 v 1 situation on the right.</p> <p>Santalab looked to create 2 v 1s, but lacked the confidence to repeatedly take on his man, instead playing a pass inside to support or to Polenz. But Minniecon’s introduction with half an hour to go added another spark to the Wanderers’ right-sided attack. By coupling similar movements (drifting wide to receive the ball, before attempting to isolate Michael Zullo) with his pace and technical skills, Minniecon was pivotal to the comeback win.</p> <p>On two occasions, after picking the ball up on the right thanks to two long-range passes from Mooy, Minniecon demonstrated similar attacking variety to Hersi. Firstly, in the 75th minute, Minniecon received possession on the sideline and ran directly at Zullo before whipping in an inch perfect cross to Bridge in the box. Then, just 45 seconds later, he again received the ball wide on the right. The pass from Mooy allowed Minniecon to run at Zullo, cutting inside to get away a dangerous shot on target.</p> <p>In Minniecon, Western Sydney might have found themselves best replacement yet for Hersi. With Santalab providing 60 minutes of hard work, Minniecon was able to intelligently find himself in space on the right and combine that with unpredictability with the ball at his feet. Ideally for the Wanderers, Hersi will shake off his foot injury and remain fit regularly, but should he be unavailable, they now have a suitable foil in Santalab and Minniecon. And also a monkey off their back.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421666849|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|dfdec6e3b74cdbb31cfe9ecdcb19dc81c707e859 -->",

        "body":"<p>Captain Lucas Neill will survive the first cut as new coach Ange Postecoglou resists a razor gang approach to his debut as Socceroos boss.</p> <p>Neill is expected to be named when Postecoglou announces his squad on Wednesday for the November 19 friendly against Costa Rica. But whether Neill keeps the captaincy, and even his starting central defensive post, remains to be seen.</p> <p>Some pundits expect Postecoglou to anoint Tim Cahill as the new captain in the first step towards regeneration of the Socceroos. But the former Melbourne Victory coach has also pledged to make considered decisions and respect the Socceroos' older guard as he starts his reign.</p> <p>Postecoglou replaced Holger Osieck as coach, the German sacked after consecutive 6-0 away defeats to Brazil and France last month.</p> <p>Postecoglou, the first Australian coach of the Socceroos since Frank Farina's tenure ended in 2005, will name a 23-strong squad. But he is likely to delay crucial decisions until he gathers the squad at a week-long training camp leading into the Sydney friendly.</p> <p>Much interest for the Costa Rica game will also centre on the battle for the starting goalkeeper role between evergreen Mark Schwarzer and the emerging 25-year-old Mitch Langerak.</p> <p>Schwarzer was overlooked for the routs against Brazil and France, given his continued lack of game time for English Premier League powerhouse Chelsea. Langerak, the Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper, could herald wider generational change for next year's World Cup in Brazil if given the first-choice role ahead of the veteran Schwarzer.</p> <p>But Langerak doesn't expect his previous relationship with Postecoglou at Australian under-20 level to work in his favour.</p> <p>\"Ange has got his own ideas and his own players who he thinks he can work with and who he thinks he can develop,\" Langerak told the fourfourtwo magazine. \"It will be interesting to see which direction he takes.</p> <p>\"We're all excited; we're all looking forward to it.</p> <p>\"It's a clean slate for everybody. I'm sure everybody will be given an equal chance under Ange to show what he can do.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421665909|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|644cb40b1c78eeb2baeab4ebe2e289f2c4a1404d -->",

        "body":"<p>New Melbourne coach Kevin Muscat showed he's keen to maintain the attacking principles laid down by his predecessor Ange Postecoglou as the Victory bagged three quick goals in their 3-2 win over Wellington.</p> <p>The scoreline belied Victory's dominance, the home side leading 3-0 thanks to a double from James Troisi and another goal from Archie Thompson before a spirited Phoenix comeback provided late drama.</p> <p>Thompson and Adama Traore exploited the left wing brilliantly for the Victory, with Mitch Nichols and Troisi running rampant through a non-existent Phoenix midfield.</p> <p>It took Victory only nine minutes to find their first goal, with Mark Milligan darting a ball through to Thompson behind the Phoenix back four.</p> <p>Such was the precision, Thompson had time to trap, assess and curl a neat finish past Glenn Moss for his first goal of the season.</p> <p>Victory's forward pressure paid off again 13 minutes later when Andrew Durante's weak header was intercepted by the lurking Troisi who made no mistake from the resulting one-on-one.</p> <p>If the New Zealanders could claim an assist for that attack, they were spectators for Troisi's second.</p> <p>Kostas Barbarouses had the ball on a string before playing in Troisi, who dinked the ball past Moss to make it 3-0 after just 31 minutes.</p> <p>The game won, there was nothing left for Victory to do but attempt to lose it.</p> <p>It was a shock to see Jeremy Brockie in clean possession running towards goal and even more so when he netted after 37 minutes.</p> <p>Victory had a number of chances from set pieces in the second half but couldn't increase their lead, the Phoenix then clawing back the margin to a goal with seven minutes left to play when Paul Ifill pounced on a loose ball.</p> <p>But that was as good as it got for the visitors.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421662357|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1ecc2522532482c716a6f38e388c84b28a8cf72b -->",

        "body":"<p>Gordon Strachan has insisted Celtic can defeat Ajax in Wednesday's crucial Champions League match and offer a boost to his Scotland team in the process.</p><p>Celtic head to the Amsterdam ArenA for a fixture they must realistically take at least a point from if they are to progress from Group H. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/22/celtic-ajax-champions-league\" title=\"\">Neil Lennon's men defeated Ajax 2-1 in Glasgow a fortnight ago</a>.</p><p>Celtic will later host Milan and take on Barcelona in the Camp Nou to complete their group fixtures with Strachan confident about the Scottish champions' prospects.</p><p>\"I think Celtic can win on Wednesday and I think they can beat AC Milan,\" the Scotland manager said. \"That's not just hoping; I definitely think they can beat them.</p><p>\"They're a better team than Ajax at this moment. The Ajax team will develop; they look like a youth team – I don't think anybody has had a shave in that team. When you look at them and the Juventus team Celtic played last season, they were men.</p><p>\"The Ajax team will develop in the next nine months, a year, into an exceptional team again. Ajax's problem, like most clubs, is they keep improving players then somebody buys them.</p><p>\"At the moment I think Celtic have the strength and the knowhow to definitely get a result there, because Ajax are not in the best of form just now. And they can definitely beat AC Milan.\"</p><p>Strachan offered his thoughts as he named his Scotland squad for the upcoming friendlies against the United States and Norway. Three Celtic players – James Forrest, Scott Brown and Charlie Mulgrew – are in that party.</p><p>\"There's absolutely no doubt about it, Celtic's experience in the Champions League has helped Scottish international football,\" Strachan said.</p><p>\"Thinking back five or six years ago when Rangers were on a good run and got to the Uefa Cup final, that added to the Scotland squad as well.</p><p>\"Apart from Celtic, the players don't have European football, which is a pity. I'm sure if they had it, they would definitely get better.</p><p>\"It's not an arrogance, it's a confidence you feel. When you might have thought: 'Am I good enough?' It becomes: 'Yes, I am good enough.'</p><p>\"I would love to get players with that experience staying in Europe longer. How to deal with it, things like travelling all the time and getting used to having less training sessions.\"</p><p>Strachan also explained how he will wait until Darren Fletcher is back in Manchester United's first team before re-selecting him for the international stage. Fletcher, the Scotland captain, has played only 13 matches since December 2011 as he battles a serious bowel condition. The midfielder did feature, though, for United's under-21 team last week and is closing in on a first-team comeback.</p><p>\"I think we just leave him,\" said Strachan. \"The thing I'm looking for is his first game with the United first team and that will signal to us that then we come on board.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421645253|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|79d0576b734dc2b4478e687844ebd373d549dce3 -->",

        "headline":"Neven Subotic happy to go extra mile for Borussia Dortmund and Klopp",
        "body":"<p>Neven Subotic's journey from Bosnia war refugee and struggling teen wannabe in the United States to Borussia Dortmund and the Champions League appears to blur the lines of reality. The 24-year-old Serbia defender has already crammed a lot in but it is where he intends to go next that he hopes will provide the fantasy.</p><p>The heartbreak of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/25/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-champions-league\" title=\"\">Champions League final defeat to Bayern Munich at Wembley last season</a> might never leave him. \"I still haven't watched the game in full,\" he says. \"I know how it turns out and it is not that exciting.\" The delivery is deadpan.</p><p>The recovery is under way. Dortmund are playing well and they are getting results, most recently the 6-1 battering of Stuttgart on Friday. They lurk on Bayern's shoulder in the Bundesliga while the 2-1 win at Arsenal in the Champions League two weeks ago has put them in good heart for thereturn on Wednesday night. Win at the Westfalenstadion and Dortmund would take a significant step towards the last 16 and the broader goal of establishing themselves among Europe's elite.</p><p>They are not there yet, Subotic says, despite their eye-catching achievements over the past three seasons, the headline items of which have been the Bundesliga title in 2011, the league and cup double in 2012 and that wild ride to the Champions League final last time out.</p><p>The foundations are in place. A young team have grown together and, listening to Subotic, it is clear that a deep bond has formed between the players, the manager Jürgen Klopp, and the rocking home crowd. There have been high-profile departures yet the team's core has remained intact while, with an average of 25, the players' prime years appear to lie ahead. Dortmund, on the brink of bankruptcy in 2005, have risen to the big time and consistency can now lever them to the next level. The possibilities are tantalising.</p><p>\"We have grown and so have our expectations,\" Subotic says. \"I don't think we are at the point where if we don't win the national title, it is a terrible season. We have some time until that – first, we have to buy the big players for €60m or €100m.</p><p>\"But we are on the way to establishing ourselves. We always have to be at the top to say we are a top team and we've been very close to it over the last three years. We now want to establish that over the next few years and continue to grow.</p><p>\"I was born in 1988, I'm 25 at the end of this year and I'm in the older half of the team. If you think about the Milans and the Inters, where you are 30 and maybe in the older half of the team, it is definitely something different and special.\"</p><p>Subotic dreams big because he knows from experience that anything is possible. Born in Banja Luka in what was Yugoslavia and is now Bosnia-Herzegovina, he and his family fled to Schomberg in Germany just before the Bosnian civil war began in March 1992.</p><p>His father, Zeljko, who played for Maribor in what is now Slovenia, gave up the game to work as a labourer while his mother cleaned houses and worked in old people's homes. \"For any Bosnian Serb coming to Germany  this is the only type of work you will get as an illegal immigrant,\" Subotic says. \"I just saw my parents work a lot of hours to help their family back in Bosnia.\"</p><p>They moved again in 1999 after the expiry of their residence visa in Germany and rather than be deported to Bosnia-Herzegovina, they followed an immigration programme that set them up in the United States, initially in Salt Lake City. After a year, and because of the promise that his sister, Natalija, had shown at tennis, they relocated to Florida so that she could enrol at Nick Bollettieri's academy.</p><p>Subotic pursued his football, training in the local park, either alone or with Zeljko, and he struggled to find a team. The US system contained rather large cracks and Subotic looked likely to fall through them. \"It is a joke,\" he says. \"You've got one of the kids, who probably doesn't play but his dad ends up being the coach, because nobody wants to coach, and so the kid plays. The system is very leisurely.\"</p><p>His break came after he asked to join in a game at the park; the team's coach turned out to be an assistant for the United States Under-17s. A trial followed and Subotic was accepted on to the national team's residency programme in Bradenton, Florida, the city in which he lived. Things started to happen. Playing for the Under-17s in the Netherlands he came to the attention of a British agent, Steve Kelly, who got him a trial at Mainz in 2006. The  manager was Klopp. Subotic signed and when Klopp moved to Dortmund in 2008, he followed. \"Back in the US, I would never dream about playing for any kind of club in Germany because it was so far-fetched,\" Subotic says. \"I had a lot of luck.\"</p><p>Klopp has been the game-changer for him and Dortmund. Subotic talks of the manager's passion, personable nature and tactical acumen, and it all adds up to a guy that the players want to go the extra mile for. Klopp's basic requirement is a ferocious work ethic that provides the platform for technical quality.</p><p>\"We were one of the first teams to say that we wanted to cover more kilometres than the opponents and work on this pressing game but on a very offensive basis,\" Subotic says. \"He wants us to do our job, plus five or 10% more to really get there. We want to do more than close the opponents down. We want to close them down, get the ball and fight for it.</p><p>\"Stats are very important to him. We never want to run less than the opponent and it's not just more than them, but as much as we can to dominate. As soon as we lose the ball, we are back behind it so the opponent has to play against 10 players – not five because the other five are still at the front and walking back.\"</p><p>Klopp has performed the rare trick of identifying young players with huge potential and developing them in a creative and harmonious environment. The products have been loyalty, spirit and an ultra-competitive mentality.</p><p>\"The core has remained the same for five years and the team has grown together, which is what makes it special,\" Subotic says. \"It's very unique nowadays, in a game where you have players who are here one minute and then, in the winter, they are loaned out. I can look at almost anyone in the team and recount 30 times where he saved my butt or I saved his butt.\"</p><p>Subotic sounds American and if he had pursued his international career with the USA he would be bound for the World Cup finals. Ditto, Bosnia-Herzegovina, who have also qualified. \"But my parents are Serbian,\" he says, \" … and all my family are Serbian. With a large chunk of them living in the Serbian part of Bosnia, it was the only real option. It was a step back to my roots.\"</p><p>Serbia have not qualified and so next summer promises a lull. Subotic has plenty on his mind before then.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421623100|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|6549ca1479aff513c6c2156274d047ee83aecdc0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Arsenal may be boosted by the return of Theo Walcott from an abdominal injury for Sunday's Premier League trip to Manchester United, where the league leaders will seek to stretch their early-season advantage over the champions to an imposing 11 points.</p><p>Walcott has been absent from the first team at the Emirates Stadium since requiring minor surgery, undertaken in Germany, on a stomach problem in September. The player had carried the complaint, the problem a result of wear and tear, before feeling it more acutely in the warmup to a league game against Stoke City. The operation and recovery ruled him out of England's past two World Cup qualifiers and 10 club games across three competitions.</p><p>That period was prolonged after a minor setback in his rehabilitation but, although Walcott will miss an 11th fixture when his club-mates play at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday in their Champions League group game at the Westfalenstadion, the 24-year-old is stepping up his training routine back at London Colney with a view to playing some part at Old Trafford. His involvement would add to Arsène Wenger's attacking options for that game, even if the Frenchman must make do for now with a patched-up squad for Wednesday's game in Dortmund.</p><p>Neither Jack Wilshere nor Kieran Gibbs is expected to travel to Germany. The England midfielder turned his left ankle in training last Thursday and sat out the 2-0 victory over Liverpool that established Arsenal's five-point lead at the top of the Premier League and is unlikely to be fit in time for what has become a critical European game given Dortmund's victory in London last month. Gibbs was replaced near the end of the win over Liverpool after suffering a calf strain but hopes to be fit for the United fixture. Nacho Monreal is expected to deputise. Arsenal top Group F despite that defeat by Dortmund, courtesy of Robert Lewandowski's late winner, but are still also to visit Napoli, meaning that some kind of reward from the trip to last season's beaten finalists is imperative.</p><p>\"I thought we played well enough to get something from the home game,\" Aaron Ramsey told  the club's website. \"The group is wide open again. It is going to be tough, but we are still confident we can qualify. We have been to Dortmund in the past and drew there after conceding a late goal. We have experienced what it is like there, and we know it can be a very intimidating place to play, bu we have the quality and the players to get a good result and put ourselves back in control of the group.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421646776|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|26f5c6f7d897872d39e46abe23ef603d01d56be4 -->",

        "headline":"Yaya Touré racist abuse incident was an overreaction, says CSKA coach",
        "body":"<p>CSKA Moscow's manager, Leonid Slutsky, has branded the fallout from Yaya Touré being racially abused by a section of fans an \"overreaction\" and said the situation had been exaggerated, though he was clear the club is against all racism.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/23/manchester-city-yaya-toure-racist-chanting\" title=\"\">Touré suffered monkey chants during Manchester City's 2-1 win at CSKA in a Champions League group game a fortnight ago</a>. Although the Russian club initially denied that Touré had been the subject of the abuse, Uefa has ruled that a section of their ground should be closed for their next home match in the competition, against Bayern Munich.</p><p>During a press conference in which CSKA tried to keep questions away from the issue, Slutsky was finally moved to make a statement regarding the incident. \"It is normal we are against racism in our team,\" he said. \"We have black players and we give them support. We did not hear any racist chants [so] it is difficult to comment.</p><p>\"The club is categorically against racism but we think the situation has been very exaggerated and there was an overreaction. We have received our punishment – it was up to Uefa to impose it.\"</p><p>Although there was no confirmation that CSKA will not appeal against the verdict, Slutsky indicated the club will abide by the ruling. \"That is a question for the bosses in our club – I do not deal with appeals,\" he said. \"The sooner we finish [speaking about it the better].\"</p><p>Although Slutsky offered no apology the CSKA captain, Sergei Ignashevich, did so. But after first stating only that he was sorry some fans would not be able to attend the Bayern game.</p><p>\"We are very sorry some of the fans won't be at this game but at the moment we are thinking about the [City] game,\" he said.</p><p>When pressed if he was apologetic over the abuse Touré suffered, Ignashevich said: \"We are sorry that such unpleasant incident took place.\"</p><p>When Slutsky was asked how bad it would be if there were a repeat during Tuesday's match at the Etihad Stadium, the club's media officer intervened, saying: \"Let's wait for them to repeat it and then feel sorry for that.\"</p><p>Manuel Pellegrini earlier warned the CSKA fans that there should be no repeat and that they should remember the 2018 World Cup is being held in their country. In light of CSKA's denial that Touré had been subjected to the chants, the City manager was asked how relations were between the two clubs.</p><p>\"I don't know about the relations of both clubs,\" he said. \"The fans of CSKA made an important mistake. The club, I don't know why they denied at the beginning or what their reaction is now but Uefa acted and gave them the punishment they deserve. I hope we can leave it in the past and [the same] for Russian fans because they have a World Cup in their country.\"</p><p>Pellegerini will not say anything special to Touré before the game. \"I think Yaya is an experienced player,\" he said. \"What happened in Russia, maybe he can't forget but tomorrow is a special match for him, not because of that but because Manchester City can go to the next stage of the Champions League. I think he will only be thinking about football.\"</p><p>The City defender Pablo Zabaleta said: \"What happened in Moscow was really hard for Yaya. We are all behind him and any time we see something like that we try to help the players.</p><p>\"Hopefully Uefa is always on it. As players we can do nothing; we just need to give a massive support to the black players when they have some problems like that. Let me talk about football, that is the most important thing.\"</p><p>Is the right-back concerned there may be a repeat on Tuesday evening? \"I don't know. As I said before, I don't want to talk too much about racist chants or problems because I think we need to be more focused on football. That is the most important thing. And let Uefa take decisions about it.\"</p><p>Pellegrini confirmed that Joe Hart will again be left out for Costel Pantilimon but the manager does not believe his decision has affected the England goalkeeper's confidence. \"No, I think Joe reacted very well. He is a professional player,\" he said.</p><p>\"For him, it is also a good thing to have a rest after playing so many matches. He is working without any problem, supporting Costel Pantilimon.</p><p>\"Nobody wants to be out but he thinks it will be useful for him.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421652119|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|42a576d368bf32ec4890b139dcccaf632faae260 -->",

        "headline":"Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj needs better protection says Moyes",
        "body":"<p>David Moyes has demanded greater protection for Adnan Januzaj and told the Manchester United teenager he must learn from Lionel Messi's example of how to handle being \"kicked up and down\".</p><p>Fulham's Sascha Riether was charged with violent conduct by the Football Association on Monday for apparently stamping on the 18-year-old during Saturday's match at Craven Cottage. The German defender is the first player to be charged under a new pilot scheme where three former referees – Steve Dunn, Eddie Wolstenholme and Alan Wiley – review video evidence of \"not seen\" incidents in Premier League games. Riether has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge.</p><p>Moyes missed the controversy in the final minute at Fulham, as did the referee, Lee Probert, but, having reviewed the incident, he believes Riether deliberately targeted Januzaj. The United manager fears that sort of treatment has been reserved for the teenager in other matches, with Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin and José Fonte plus Stephen Ireland and Wilson Palacios of Stoke City booked for fouling Januzaj in recent weeks, and believes referees are not offering sufficient protection.</p><p>Speaking before United's Champions League group game at Real Sociedad, and before confirmation of Riether's charge, Moyes said: \"I hadn't seen it until after the game, the view from the dugout made it impossible to see, but it's a bad stamp and it does look deliberate.</p><p>\"It's over now but I do think Adnan is going to need a little bit more protection or we are going to find he is getting kicked up and down. I do think he deserves a little bit more than he is getting at this time.\"</p><p>Moyes wants Januzaj to learn to ride any roughhouse tactics, however, and not respond with theatrics. He believes Messi offers the perfect example. Moyes said: \"We have spoken to him about it. I have got to say he gets kicked up and down in training every day and gets on with it. He's learned from the good professionals that he's got to get on with it.</p><p>\"He only needs to look at Lionel Messi who is probably the best in the world at getting kicked, getting up and getting on with it and continuing to produce magic all the time. I'm not in any way comparing Adnan to Lionel Messi, so don't be saying that, but I'm certainly saying the way Lionel Messi gets up after being kicked, we hope that's the way Adnan continues to behave too. But he does need a little bit of protection. Somewhere along the line if he is going to continue playing in the fashion and style we want he'll need to get protection. It's up to referees to do what they think is right.\"</p><p>United would move to within a point of qualification for the Champions League knockout phase with victory at Anoeta, and travelled to San Sebastian without the injured defenders Rafael da Silva and Jonny Evans. Michael Carrick, Tom Cleverley and Patrice Evra also have fitness concerns but are in the squad. Real Sociedad are without a point in Group A and could be eliminated but have, like United, improved domestically and moved into seventh place in La Liga with a 5-0 defeat of Osasuna on Saturday, their biggest league win for a decade.</p><p>\"I certainly won't take anything for granted,\" Moyes said. \"I have a lot of respect for Sociedad. We will have to play well if we are going to get those 10 points which will get us over the line, but we have got ourselves in a good position in the group and we have to try to maintain that. I feel we are playing better now and getting some good results to go with it and long may that continue.\"</p><p>United have a poor record in Spain, winning only two of 21 fixtures at La Liga opponents, and Moyes has not taken any advice on improving that sequence from Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography, which he was pictured bringing on the journey to the Basque region. \"I've not read it yet. I've not opened a page,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421651742|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|6cf1d5c57d950dbed4949e8ff5df46602f12c15f -->",

        "body":"<p>Arsenal may be boosted by the return of Theo Walcott from an abdominal injury for Sunday's Premier League trip to Manchester United, where the league leaders will seek to stretch their early-season advantage over the champions to an imposing 11 points.</p><p>Walcott has been absent from the first team at the Emirates Stadium since requiring minor surgery, undertaken in Germany, on a stomach problem in September. The player had carried the complaint, the problem a result of wear and tear, before feeling it more acutely in the warmup to a league game against Stoke City. The operation and recovery ruled him out of England's past two World Cup qualifiers and 10 club games across three competitions.</p><p>That period was prolonged after a minor setback in his rehabilitation but, although Walcott will miss an 11th fixture when his club-mates play at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday in their Champions League group game at the Westfalenstadion, the 24-year-old is stepping up his training routine back at London Colney with a view to playing some part at Old Trafford. His involvement would add to Arsène Wenger's attacking options for that game, even if the Frenchman must make do for now with a patched-up squad for Wednesday's game in Dortmund.</p><p>Neither Jack Wilshere nor Kieran Gibbs is expected to travel to Germany. The England midfielder turned his left ankle in training last Thursday and sat out the 2-0 victory over Liverpool that established Arsenal's five-point lead at the top of the Premier League and is unlikely to be fit in time for what has become a critical European game given Dortmund's victory in London last month. Gibbs was replaced near the end of the win over Liverpool after suffering a calf strain but hopes to be fit for the United fixture. Nacho Monreal is expected to deputise. Arsenal top Group F despite that defeat by Dortmund, courtesy of Robert Lewandowski's late winner, but are still also to visit Napoli, meaning that some kind of reward from the trip to last season's beaten finalists is imperative.</p><p>\"I thought we played well enough to get something from the home game,\" Aaron Ramsey told  the club's website. \"The group is wide open again. It is going to be tough, but we are still confident we can qualify. We have been to Dortmund in the past and drew there after conceding a late goal. We have experienced what it is like there, and we know it can be a very intimidating place to play, bu we have the quality and the players to get a good result and put ourselves back in control of the group.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421646776|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|26f5c6f7d897872d39e46abe23ef603d01d56be4 -->",

The Ajax team will develop; they look like a youth team – I don't think anybody has had a shave in that team. When you look at them and the Juventus team Celtic played last season, they were men.</p><p>\"The Ajax team will develop in the next nine months, a year, into an exceptional team again. Ajax's problem, like most clubs, is they keep improving players then somebody buys them.</p><p>\"At the moment I think Celtic have the strength and the knowhow to definitely get a result there, because Ajax are not in the best of form just now. And they can definitely beat AC Milan.\"</p><p>Strachan offered his thoughts as he named his Scotland squad for the upcoming friendlies against the United States and Norway. Three Celtic players – James Forrest, Scott Brown and Charlie Mulgrew – are in that party.</p><p>\"There's absolutely no doubt about it, Celtic's experience in the Champions League has helped Scottish international football,\" Strachan said.</p><p>\"Thinking back five or six years ago when Rangers were on a good run and got to the Uefa Cup final, that added to the Scotland squad as well.</p><p>\"Apart from Celtic, the players don't have European football, which is a pity. I'm sure if they had it, they would definitely get better.</p><p>\"It's not an arrogance, it's a confidence you feel. When you might have thought: 'Am I good enough?' It becomes: 'Yes, I am good enough.'</p><p>\"I would love to get players with that experience staying in Europe longer. How to deal with it, things like travelling all the time and getting used to having less training sessions.\"</p><p>Strachan also explained how he will wait until Darren Fletcher is back in Manchester United's first team before re-selecting him for the international stage. Fletcher, the Scotland captain, has played only 13 matches since December 2011 as he battles a serious bowel condition. The midfielder did feature, though, for United's under-21 team last week and is closing in on a first-team comeback.</p><p>\"I think we just leave him,\" said Strachan. \"The thing I'm looking for is his first game with the United first team and that will signal to us that then we come on board.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421645253|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|79d0576b734dc2b4478e687844ebd373d549dce3 -->",

He was my manager at Tottenham and I had a lot of difficulties.\"</p><p>César, who fractured a finger in training in September, has not played for QPR this season, after Redknapp made Rob Green his first-choice goalkeeper.</p><p>Gomes said: \"As for being a starter at the national team, they don't think much about that. Júlio César will have a lot of trouble if he stays at QPR. If he has the chance to leave, he has to leave so he can play. I know him very well and I know how good he can be.</p><p>\"The goalkeeper is a position of manager's trust and if [Luiz Felipe] Scolari thinks Júlio César can play the World Cup and surely can, then he has to play at least from January onwards so he will be good and match-fit for the World Cup.
