        "body":"<p>Featuring five premieres from composers based in north-west England, <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolphil.com/277/ensemble-1010\" title=\"\">Ensemble 10/10</a>'s programme was billed as an introduction to the new Mersey sound, though <a href=\"http://www.benjamingait.com/\" title=\"\">Benjamin Gait</a>'s work is so far removed from beat music that he doesn't use bar lines. His short piece, Till night is overgone, was hushed, fragile and chant-like, if a little hesitant overall.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bengaunt.com\" title=\"\">Ben Gaunt</a>'s The Old Cataclysm Blues had rhythm – Gershwin's, in fact, as the piece was a jazzy displacement exercise created while stalled on a more substantial work. The contributions of the two most senior composers both reflected on world conflict. <a href=\"http://www.anthonygilbert.net\" title=\"\">Anthony Gilbert</a> kept the Palestinian question in mind throughout a troubled journey from dissonance to unstable harmony; it was easy to imagine <a href=\"http://www.ump.co.uk/composer%20pages/roxburgh.htm\" title=\"\">Edwin Roxburgh</a>'s plangent Lament for oboe and strings replacing Samuel Barber's Adagio as the go-to track for underscoring montages of the world's disaster zones.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.hope.ac.uk/staff/pratts.html\" title=\"\">Stephen Pratt</a>'s homage to Stravinsky, Chants du Printemps, was a fearless attempt to harness the brute energy of The Rite of Spring, like a rodeo rider clinging to a particularly implacable bull. <a href=\"http://www.ianstephens.net\" title=\"\">Ian Stephens</a>'s tribute to the clarinettist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/02/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Dame Thea King</a> combined sublime echoes of her playing, set to the rhythm of a scurrilous limerick she wrote about a cow's dissatisfaction with artificial insemination.</p><p>Yet the most arrestingly individual piece, deftly handled by conductor Clark Rundell, was a work by the Liverpool-born composer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/08/steve-martland\" title=\"\">Steve Martland</a>, who died unexpectedly of a heart attack earlier this year, and to whom the concert was dedicated. Reveille evoked the hammer-blow intensity of Martland's mentor, <a href=\"http://www.boosey.com/composer/louis+andriessen\" title=\"\">Louis Andriessen</a>, while the remorseless repetition of a rising three-note motif on the vibraphone sounded as if it might preface a demonic public address announcement giving details of the next egg-and-spoon race in hell.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

        "headline":"Want to get Daft Punk's Get Lucky? Give the vinyl a few more spins on the turntable",
        "body":"<p>Earlier this year, I wrote about trying to make sense of the <a href=\"http://hiddentracks.org/its-not-actually-a-disco-album-per-se-daft-punk-notes-from-a-small-backlash-2013\">early reaction to Daft Punk's Random Access Memories</a> when it became available to stream on iTunes a week ahead of release. After three weeks of living with Get Lucky, the consensus among about two-thirds of the first people who heard it was that, well, it could have done with a few more Get Luckys. What seemed striking was that they didn't seem to consider that some songs might require a bit of application from the listener. And yet, I would say that at least half of my 100 favourite albums revealed their charms gradually, over repeated listens. I bought <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pentangle\">Pentangle</a>'s Sweet Child when I was 17. It sat in my collection for about eight years, receiving only the occasional play, before I suddenly realised that this might be one of my favourite records of all time. It seemed to me that streaming Random Access Memories free and ahead of its official release might have backfired. By making it just another option on an endless try-before-you-buy taster menu, Columbia Records might have done the album a disservice.</p><p>How could this anticlimax have been circumvented? One suggestion I made was releasing the vinyl version one or two weeks ahead of a digital. It prompted a shitstorm of responses, mainly from people who assumed that I think vinyl is superior, and that the people who buy their music on vinyl are superior human beings.  They're not, but on the whole they are different. If you're wedded to a format that sets you back approximately £20 an album, it stands to reason that you'll work harder to justify the purchase. Two weeks of online chatter from people gradually realising that there was actually room in their lives for Wall-E's post-Studio 54 comedown opus would have created far more anticipation than the few hundred people who impulsively tweeted their first impressions on hearing what came out of their laptop speakers.</p><p>As it turned out, enough people heard something in Get Lucky to persuade them that Random Access Memories might be enjoyed most on vinyl. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/uk-vinyl-sales-daft-punk-david-bowie\">Figures released by the music industry organisation BPI</a> revealed a 100% increase in vinyl sales across 2013 so far, with the Daft Punk album topping the list. In the general scheme of things, vinyl is still very much a minority format. A 100% spike in sales only barely nudges total sales past the 500,000 mark. But if you're an artist who happens to do well in vinyl sales – albums by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Boards of Canada were among the 10 best-selling vinyl releases in 2013 – your relatively few sales will almost certainly eclipse several years of Spotify spoils. The upswing in vinyl sales is sometimes put down to the idea that music sounds warmer on vinyl or to the notion that holding a record sleeve and placing its contents on a turntable offers a more well-rounded aesthetic experience than a CD. To be honest, I'm not sure about \"warmth\". But sometimes – if playing, say, an original seven-inch of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8782KIj_rKw\">Let's Hang on by the Four Seasons</a> on a 60s Sanyo portable record player, and hearing how a 45 year-old speaker can barely contain the music's volume – it seems to make it all the more exciting. On the other hand, listening to a CD of John Renbourn singing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9fiaeKGrts\" title=\"\">I Know My Babe</a> by hooking up a set of Harman Kardon speakers to my computer provides a hushed, foetal intimacy that's no less lovely.</p><p>Perhaps arguing for the warmth of vinyl is simply a matter of trying to justify a pleasure that's sometimes hard to articulate. Everything but the Girl musician and sometime Buzzin' Fly label boss <a href=\"http://www.buzzinfly.com/comments/miles-showell-july-2012.html\" title=\"\">Ben Watt interviewed Abbey Road mastering engineer Miles Showell</a> to get an empirical measure of the merits of vinyl and digital formats. Showell contended that vinyl's superior fidelity was only discernible \"if the record was (i) cut well at the mastering stage, (ii) processed and pressed well at the factory, which is the really hard part, (iii) then kept clean and stored in ideal conditions and (iv), finally, played on a decent turntable with a very well-engineered tone arm fitted with a good and correctly aligned cartridge that, in turn, has a clean and undamaged stylus, all of which needs to feed a high quality RIAA vinyl disc pre-amplifier\".</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCBJ8BVy49w&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Reading on mobile?

Neither, I would venture, have most people who prefer to listen to music on vinyl. So what do I prefer? I enjoy going to a record shop when I am not altogether sure what I'm after. I prefer hearing and falling hard for something blasting out of the shop speakers that, on closer listening, turns out to be by an artist I didn't think I liked that much. Last month, in the west London outpost of Rough Trade, that happened to me with the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/15/arctic-monkeys-live-roundhouse\" title=\"\">Arctic Monkeys</a> album. I prefer the anticipation of  judging how it sounds in my kitchen. If it's a record I haven't listened to before I bought it – as happened with music by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/may/02/new-music-lloyd-cole-period-piece\" title=\"\">Lloyd Cole </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/10/parquet-courts-light-up-review\" title=\"\">Parquet Courts</a> on the same visit to Rough Trade – I like that we'll have to make an effort to get along. I can't just dismiss it and go on to the next thing. More than anything, I think that's what these new BPI figures tell us. The resurgence of vinyl is the closest music consumption has come to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/04/slow-food-carlo-petrini\" title=\"\">slow food movement</a>. My misgivings about Spotify aren't entirely predicated on the pittance of money that trickles down to music makers. If it was, I would stop buying second-hand records because their creators wouldn't make a penny from my purchase. Spotify merely formalises on a global scale the decline in how much people are prepared to pay for music.</p><p>We don't like it when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world\" title=\"\">artists such as David Byrne</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/spotify-thom-yorke-dying-corpse\" title=\"\">Thom Yorke</a> talk about the royalties generated by Spotify. It's somehow unbecoming of our favourite artists to discuss money. But, obvious as that may seem, payment is intrinsic to our concept of worth. And that has ramifications for the listener as well as the artist. It stands to reason that you'll work harder to get value out of something for which you paid an appreciable amount of money. That Marc Jacobs coat you paid £300 for? You might try and shed half a stone to fit back into it. But that raincoat from TK Maxx, well, the incentive isn't as great. The growth of vinyl and the rise of streaming are driven by the same forces. Both provide something that the other, by its very nature, simply can't. The pleasure you get from an experience is often proportionate to how much time and effort you expend. The carrier bag on the bus home. The expectation. The way it looks and feels. Even the way it smells. And that's before you even place it on the turntable. As New Radicals put it: \"<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/22717276\" title=\"\">Can't forget/ You only get what you give</a>.\" It's a shame that song never came out on vinyl.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420241396|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|edff244bc2350c8a59171802987fe0d984052a3e -->",

        "body":"<p>Stravinsky's contention that music is \"by its very nature, essentially powerless to express anything at all\" – that it's simply, but extraordinarily, a speculation in sound and time – seems to bypass <a href=\"http://www.empiricalmusic.com/\" title=\"\">Empirical</a>. In six packed years the British group have evolved from a contemporary jazz outfit to their present incarnation as a jazz/classical chamber ensemble. The band's 2008 debut album had such sassy titles as Fat Cat and Dark Lady, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/22/empirical-tabula-rasa-review\" title=\"\">their latest</a> looms with weighty tracks – The Simple Light Shines Brightest, Cosmos, or The Prophet. But if Empirical, augmented here by the classical <a href=\"http://www.benyounesquartet.com/\" title=\"\">Benyounes Quartet</a>, sound at odds with Stravinsky's pragmatism, they nonetheless did plenty of fascinating speculating in sound and time in this gig, even if (as on the new album) they could have clipped a spare moment here and there.</p><p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/empiricalmusic/cosmos\">Reading on mobile? Listen to the track here</a></p><p>The core quartet – saxophonist Nathaniel Facey, vibraphonist Lewis Wright, bassist Tom Farmer and drummer Shane Forbes – opened with Facey's soulfully plaintive long-note weave over a bass vamp (Yin and Yang) and Wright's punchily percussive stop-start theme, Bellsonian Scales. The Benyounes joined for Facey's The Simple Light Shines Brightest, in which a jazzily twisting, drums-shadowed strings melody gave way to a seductive daydream, a fast bebop vibes solo, and a typically composer-like alto sax break from the composer, always attentive to the ways in and out of even the shortest phrase. This thoughtful and sophisticated performer even sounded more like a french hornist than a saxophonist amid the mists of the Benyounes' floating opening to Tom Farmer's Ascent and Descent.</p><p>Wright's The Prophet brought a rootsier, folk-melodic feel to the music, and the jazz group's free-flow reached a new heat, invoking the classic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/aug/09/john-coltrane-giant-step\" title=\"\">Coltrane quartet's tumultuous collective roar</a> early in the second half. In contrast, they came closer to <a href=\"http://www.porticoquartet.com/\" title=\"\">Portico Quartet</a> on Farmer's chiming The Healer, powered up their jazz engine again for the whippy Empiricism – and steered Lewis Wright at his most delicate into the swirling, deep-toned strings lines on Forbes' Repentance, the most memorably transporting genre-blend of an uneven but engaging night.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

        "body":"<p>\"Sumptuous, extravagant and empty\" was one reviewer's take on a <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/37d33f68-04cd-11e3-9e71-00144feab7de.html#axzz2hPdNliVq\" title=\"\">Salzburg festival opera production this summer</a>.</p><p>Money can corrupt anyone and anything. But is opera especially prone to such corruption because of the perceived need to present a grand spectacle? Some people would say that the reviewer's dictum above charactises all opera.</p><p>Opera draws on many means to move our hearts, engage our minds and stimulate our senses. Such an experience doesn't come cheap. The main cost is people: a conventional production requires a cast of soloists boosted by a large orchestra, chorus and often dancers. Another small army – from the creative and music teams to the backstage staff – builds and looks after the show.</p><p>Whether it's endowing ancient myths with the latest technical wizardry (as in the Metropolitan Opera's recent Ring cycle) or reproducing historically informed splendours, opera productions can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds. And even with princely patrons it needs grand theatres to stand a chance of recouping costs through ticket sales. The pressure to present a spectacle is understandable.</p><p>But money cannot guarantee a great performance or production. And although access to opera has often been the preserve of those with wealth and education, it has also been – and still is – loved passionately by many without either. Even stripped down, opera can be incredibly powerful, especially in spaces smaller than your average opera house.</p><p>Small-scale opera comes in all shapes, sizes and standards: in <a href=\"http://kingsheadtheatre.com/operaupclose.html\" title=\"\">pubs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.silentopera.co.uk/\" title=\"\">factories</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gardenopera.co.uk/\" title=\"\">gardens</a>. For a glimpse, check out what the <a href=\"http://www.theoperagroup.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Opera Group</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sizezeroopera.com/\" title=\"\">Size Zero Opera</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tete-a-tete.org.uk/\">Tête à Tête</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hgo.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Hampstead Garden Opera</a> or <a href=\"http://fulhamopera.com/site/\" title=\"\">Fulham Opera</a> are up to.</p><p>Of course, limiting or doing without an orchestra and a chorus – two of opera's greatest glories – is the worst privation faced by small companies. But reducing costs by performing in small or unusual venues, hiring up-and-coming singers and building simple sets can definitely make opera more accessible and less intimidating for those who have never ventured inside the Royal Opera House or Coliseum. And it can make it more fun for those who have. A certain amount of \"poor opera\" may even be a healthy corrective to purify and revive the form.</p><p>Opera speaks very effectively for itself when you focus on what is essential: the singers who share the music, poetry, characters, and story with us. Peter Brook did this brilliantly with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhINJ5RTG5k\" title=\"\">his famous adaptation of Carmen</a>, an 82-minute show featuring four singers, three actors, a 15-piece orchestra and very little set. It ran for 150 performances in its first season in Paris and then toured the world.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420240944'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381935845488/Opera-Naked-ST-James-stud-008.jpg' alt='Opera Naked, ST James studio theatre, oct 2013' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'Operatic cabaret' … Opera Naked includes including arias from Madama Butterfly, Tosca and Tannhäuser. Photograph: Robert Workman</figcaption></figure><p>Five years ago I set up <a href=\"http://www.unexpectedopera.com/\">Unexpected Opera</a> to challenge expectations of what opera is and to share it with new audiences in productions such as Barber of Savile Row, Orpheus Down Under and a staged Messiah (which brought operatic performances to community choral singers). This week, we're taking our new show, <a href=\"http://www.stjamestheatre.co.uk/events/opera-naked/\">Opera Naked</a>, to London's intimate St James Studio.</p><p>Opera Naked came about partly as a reaction to programmes like Pop Star to Opera Star and to the \"opera stars\" who use microphones and have never performed a full role onstage. But it is, first of all, my love letter to singers and to the form itself.</p><p>The show features a series of dramatic vignettes about what singing opera involves, based on interviews with dozens of singers. We also include a selection of excerpts, chosen because they are special to us, or because they bring to life central aspects of what opera even without sets or scenery. Favourites come from Carmen, Madam Butterfly, I Pagliacci, Tosca and Onegin. </p><p>Then there's the \"Awful Auditions\" section, which, ok, might be a little bit exaggerated for fun, but faithfully represents reality. The cast tell us why they wanted to sing opera, and how they came to it. Opera singers aren't necessarily posh – Nadine Mortimer Smith, from Brixton, discovered opera after a career on the trading floor. Philip Spendley started out as a zookeeper and was a bank manager before he got the opera bug.</p><p>In our pilot performances last year you could feel the audience responding to the intense emotions and sensual impact, unhindered by pretence, snobbery or meaningless extravagance. With singers and little else, even \"bleeding chunks\" of opera can be overwhelming and gripping when they are performed by artists possessed of hard-won skills.</p><p>In a recent interview on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b037pcv8/HARDtalk_Thomas_Hampson_Opera_Singer/\" title=\"\">HARDtalk with the baritone Thomas Hampson</a>, Sarah Montague voiced the usual complaints about opera's supposed elitism and inaccessibility, <a href=\"http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2013/07/bbc-today-presenter-opera-is-one-of-the-least-watched-art-forms-in-the-world.html\" title=\"\">to the outrage of opera fans</a>. I wish <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/157406285/Letter-to-the-BBC?fb_action_ids=10151572401031947&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;action_object_map=%7B%2210151572401031947%22%3A458930794204883%7D&amp;action_type_map=%7B%2210151572401031947%22%3A%22og.likes%22%7D&amp;action_ref_map=%5B%5D\" title=\"\">the responses from some of these opera lovers</a> could be more widely exposed. I challenge those who agree with the position she presented to come to shows like those of Opera Naked and see if it changes their minds.</p><p>Opera is an expensive art form, but it is so rich in content that it can be incredibly powerful in its essential, \"naked\" form, without huge expenditure. The glamour and spectacle that opera often trades in can be hugely enjoyable and even help illuminate the work, but it isn't what opera is about. The theatre is in the voices. You can do without scenery and costumes, and even without the orchestra, but without singers it isn't opera.</p><p><em>Opera Naked is at </em><a href=\"http://www.stjamestheatre.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>St James theatre </em></a><em>until 20 October 2013.

        "headline":"A to Z of Wagner: R is for the Ring Cycle",
        "body":"<p><strong>R</strong> is of course for <strong>Ring, Der Ring des Nibelungen</strong>, to give Wagner's grandest conception its proper title. He announced the notion in A Communication to My Friends in 1851. \"I shall write no more operas. As I have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works, I will call them dramas. I propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas, preceded by a lengthy prelude. At a specially appointed festival, I propose, at some future time, to produce those three dramas with their prelude, in the course of three days and a fore-evening.\" </p><p>All this came to pass. Wagner was always a great carrier out of his intentions, however monumental and improbable they looked on paper. He wrote the tetralogy backwards starting with Siegfried's death,  delving ever deeper into the Norse legends and medieval German poems on which the work was based.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJZDoaVHkhw\">Das Rheingold</a> forms the prelude to the work, weighing in at a breezy two and a half hours, followed by the three epic dramas – <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80EeGywK52M\">Die Walküre</a> (The Valkyrie), <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65poInFK6Fs\">Siegfried</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWoaFvKNNuI\">Götterdämmerung</a>, each at four hours plus. If you ever see people arriving at an opera house at 5 in the afternoon, you can bet it's for a performance of Wagner's Ring. The composer wanted them played on successive evenings, but they rarely are. The demands on the singers are too great. Indeed, they are often given as standalone operas, or a house will (for financial and logistical reasons) premiere them one per season and then eventually put on the whole cycle, though almost certainly not on successive nights.</p><p>In his excellent book on Wagner, Michael Tanner has a chapter with the endlessly debated question: \"What is the Ring About?\" There are so many ways of interpreting the Ring – pro-ecology, anti-capitalist, anti-Jewish, anti-marriage – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/aug/02/frank-castorf-bayreuth-ring-cycle\">that it has allowed directors a more or less free hand to do what they want</a>. Tanner says most authorities agree it hinges on a battle between love and power, though he warns against too glib an acceptance of that proposition. </p><p>In essence, it is a creation myth. In Rheingold we are confronted with a structured world of gods, giants and dwarfs (the Nibelungs) who battle for control of a ring forged by the evil Alberich from gold stolen from the Rhinemaidens. That ring gives its owner control of the world. Alberich renounces love when he steals the gold, and the gold (and the quest for power which it represents) destroys each of those who take possession of it. Only Brünnhilde, daughter of chief god Wotan and the earth goddess Erda, stands outside the power madness, renounces her demi-god status and eventually returns the ring to the Rhinemaidens. </p><p>Brünnhilde is, in effect, the first woman, killing herself because she has lost the man she loved (Siegfried) but at the same time ushering in humanity in all its glorious imperfection as the old world of the gods burns. If the immolation scene doesn't make you cheer and cry at the same time (and not just with relief at the end of 15 hours of music), the Ring has failed to work its magic. </p><p><strong>R</strong> is also for <strong>Anna Russell</strong>, the Anglo-Canadian comedian who made a career out of boiling the Ring Cycle down into <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m69aPAo1rXE\">a brilliant 30-minute sketch</a>. It is an affectionate parody of Wagner's excesses, and still guaranteed to raise a laugh, 50-plus years later. Le Figaro called The Ring \"the dream of a lunatic\", and the late Ms Russell captures that madness superbly. </p><p>Oh, almost forgot. <strong>R</strong> is also for <strong>Rienzi</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuksVNEqAA\">an early and little performed opera</a> (premiered in 1842) but with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIwWtwn6qA\">tremendous overture</a> that is frequently heard in concert. Wagner disowned the work later in life, but Hitler was keen on it and is even said to have owned the autograph score.</p><h2>Previous articles in the series</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/jan/16/a-z-wagner-alberich-antisemitism\">A is for Alberich</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/jan/30/a-z-wagner-bayreuth-brunnhilde\">B is for Bayreuth</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/feb/13/a-z-wagner-c-cosimo\">C is for Cosima</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/mar/12/a-z-wagner-d-death\">D is for Death</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/mar/26/a-z-wagner-e-heroines\">E is for winsome heroines</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/apr/04/a-z-wagner-f-die-feen\">F is for Die Feen</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/apr/18/a-z-wagner-gesamtkunstwerk\">G is for Gesamtkunstwerk</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/may/08/a-z-wagner-h-hitler\">H is for Hitler</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/may/22/a-z-wagner-i-isolde\">I is for Isolde</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/jun/13/a-to-z-of-wagner-j-is-for-jews\">J is for Jews</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/jul/12/a-to-z-of-wagner-k-for-kundry\">K is for Kundry</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/jul/30/a-to-z-of-wagner-l-is-for-lohengrin\">L is for Lohengrin</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/aug/08/a-to-z-wagner-meistersinger-nurnberg\">M is for Meistersinger</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/13/stephen-moss-a-to-z-of-wagner-n-is-for-nietzsche-nibelungs-and-norns\">N is for Nietzsche</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/sep/03/a-to-z-of-wagner-o-is-for-ortrud\">O is for Ortrud</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/27/a-to-z-of-wagner-p-is-for-parsifal\">P is for Parsifal</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/oct/09/a-to-z-of-wagner-q-is-for-queen-victoria\">Q is for Queen Victoria</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420125504|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|76cb3f921236cd9f84c09cb4bebd2c6f4f84e709 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Oban, Scotland.   <br />      <br /><strong>The lineup</strong>: Joseph Black, Martin Anfield, Rory MacDonald, Kieran Heather and Chris McGarry.  </p><p><strong>The background</strong>: Yesterday, the Quietus posted <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/13597-simon-price-critic-will-self\">an excellent article by Simon Price</a> (and the to-and-fro between the site's editor and a reader in the comments section was even more riveting), arguing for the \"parasitic but necessary\" role of the critic in the internet age. Price argued for the continued benefits of analysis and contextualisation, although he didn't talk about the other unexpected task that is often regarded as the remit of the critic: that of prophesier of the future. One of the unwritten roles of the music critic especially is that of A&amp;R person, the tacit acknowledgement being that we should be able to predict the fortunes or otherwise of a new act at will. </p><p>We mention this because in April 2008 we wrote about Mumford &amp; Sons <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/14/popandrock3\">in this column</a>, and although we said something that we still stand by – they \"sound like Coldplay reincarnated as hillbillies\" – we are ashamed to say that at no point did we foresee that they would become one of the biggest bands on the planet. Today's new band are a bit Mumfords – albeit a more aggressive Mumfords, a Clashy Mumfords rather than a Coldplay one, which maybe means they're more <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zVmx709Nrg\">the Men They Couldn't Hang</a> than M&amp;S – but again, we have no idea whether their rambunctious form of folk will catch on beyond the indie-gig milieu in which they currently operate in their native Scotland and beyond. </p><p> <a href=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F12235944\">Reading on mobile? Click here to listen</a></p><p>Much is being made of that rambunctiousness. \"They're carrying the folk torch and using it as an arsonist might,\" their tourmates Frightened Rabbit have teased, while their press release declares their intention to \"revolutionise folk music in their own unique way\" and early reviews have hailed \"a band hell-bent of injecting a dose of rock'n'roll into the folk scene\",  detecting in their \"visceral\" attack \"whiffs of Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK\". Wrote one website: \"They are more akin to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds than they are their folk-leaning contemporaries.\" Equal fuss is made of their apparently pioneering divination of the darkness within folk, as they draw on the \"twisted tales of love, death and madness in traditional folk\" and give such contorted trad arr fol-de-rol some sonic welly. </p><p>Well, we can't hear such radical invention any more than we can estimate their commercial potential, and we could have sworn indie bands had been exploring folk's dark side for years. What Washington Irving do doesn't sound remotely new to our ears, attuned as they are to years of exposure to the Pogues and the aforementioned TMTCH. But certainly if you liked those groups you will probably be favourably disposed towards this lot. On Palomides, a track from their debut double-album – and we applaud their ambition in that regard – they sing in unison to denote comradeship and community spirit. The music is designed to rouse rabbles, or at least, crowds of students. You've Seen the Last of Me has the plangency, chime and melody of a Smiths song, almost, and proves how close Smiths songs were to folk, at times. You can just imagine Moz in a woolly sweater, yodelling along with this one. She Moved Through the Fair takes the original ballad and gives it extra contemporary wallop. Old St Luan is typical of their output: loud, strummy, with plenty of bash and crash. We really do want to conclude that they are a tougher Mumfords, but we haven't listened to the latter in five years, not even once, although if Washington Irving do make it big, fully expect us to take all the credit. </p><p><strong>The buzz</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.supajam.com/news/story/Washington-Irving-are-releasing-a-double-album\">\"Washington Irving are an indie folk act, but don't panic because they're still interesting.\" </a> <br />  <br /><strong>The truth</strong>: They're a Clashy Mumfords.      <br /> <br /><strong>Most likely to</strong>: Cover <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPA_XuxUx3M\">Rainy Night in Soho</a>.</p><p><strong>Least likely to</strong>: Cover <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DmIFIkcU7U\">Rainy Night in Georgia</a>.  </p><p><strong>What to buy</strong>: Palomides: Volumes I &amp; II is released by Instinctive Raccoon on November 4. </p><p><strong>File next to</strong>: Admiral Fallow, Skinny Lister, Dry the River, Men They Couldn't Hang.    </p><p><strong>Links</strong>: <a href=\"http://washingtonirving.bandcamp.com\">washingtonirving.bandcamp.com</a>.  </p><p><strong>Friday's new band</strong>: Wilkinson.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420141381|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|28a508c295324305a445f1cec46239a70baf1087 -->",

        "headline":"Morrissey: 10 things we learned from Autobiography",
        "body":"<h2>Morrissey was a teenage athlete</h2><p>Although his schooldays were deeply unhappy, the teenage Morrissey found himself an unlikely sportsman. \"By accident I am enlisted to represent the school in track events for the 100 metres and the 400 metres for which, unthinkably, I receive schoolboy medals.\" And so begins a period in which \"I am obliged to feel honoured and to dream of the 14-second dash, or the one-minute 400.\"</p><h2>Morrissey made his first TV appearance in a period drama</h2><p>Stumbling accidentally on to the Coronation Street set as a teenager, Morrissey found himself accosted by a woman bearing a bundle of scripts. On learning that he can, indeed, handle a bicycle well she issues an instruction: \"We need a boy for Saturday. It's a 7am start, no dialogue.\" And so Morrissey makes a brief appearance – \"even if you don't blink at all you will miss me\" – in The Stars Look Down, set in \"the frozen north of 1913\". He is but a spot on the horizon – \"a punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate\".</p><h2><br />Morrissey's first female crush was … a man</h2><p>\"Jerry Nolan on <a href=\"http://superradnow.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/new_york_dolls_-_1973_new_york_dolls.jpg\">the cover of the [New York] Dolls' debut album</a> is the first woman I ever fell in love with; the hussy-slut positioning of the legs is playmate call-girl, and the pink drum kit might be a rock'n'roll first.\"</p><h2>Morrissey and the soaps were made for each other</h2><p>Young and hardly gainfully employed, Morrissey wrote to Granada TV, suggesting he be employed as a writer on Corrie. \"I am invited to submit a script, and I whip off a word-slinger's delight wherein young take on old as a jukebox is tested in the Rovers' Return.\" Sadly, he is told his talents lie elsewhere. Many years later, however, the soaps come for him, when he is offered roles on Emmerdale and EastEnders, as Dot Cotton's \"so far unmentioned\" son. \"I would arrive unexpectedly in Albert Square and cause births, deaths and factory fires every time I opened my mouth\". As Morrissey observes: \"The most fascinating aspect of both offers is that somebody somewhere thought it a good idea.\" And that's without even considering the startling fact he was offered a cameo on Friends during a visit to filming of the sitcom.</p><h2>For all his anger at Mike Joyce, Morrissey praises the Smiths' rhythm section</h2><p>Though the lawsuit brought by Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke forever soured Morrissey's relationship with his former bandmates, he is effusive about their talents as the Smiths honed their craft. \"The Smiths' sound rockets with meteroic progression: bomb-burst drumming, explosive chords, combative basslines, and over it all I am as free as a hawk to paint the canvas as I wish. It is a gift from Jesus.\"</p><h2>Sandie Shaw may have been one Morrissey's idols, but that changed</h2><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bbZLll3Vdo\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p><p>Morrissey was delighted when Sandie Shaw agreed to sing Hand in Glove, less delighted with subsequent events. \"Ugh,\" was his reaction when she told him: \"Twenty-seven in the charts might be great for you, but it's not good enough for me.\" And her failure to treat the band \"to dinner, or even a bottle of stale ale\" is regarded as poor recompense for taking 40% of the cut from her recording of the Smiths' debut single.</p><h2>Nick Kent asked to join the Smiths</h2><p>After Johnny Marr left the band, the remaining three considered recruiting another guitarist. And one who asked to be considered was the veteran rock writer. \"I am not a good self-salesman,\" he wrote to Morrissey, \"but I can confidently boast an encyclopaedic knowledge of the chord structures, dynamics etc of Johnny's contributions to date … Being musically associated with your very good self would signify the very apex of my crusade for immortality.\"</p><h2>After the release of Margaret on the Guillotine, Morrissey was questioned by the police</h2><p>Special Branch summoned Morrissey in the wake of his 1988 album Viva Hate, featuring <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsq3H_6XuFA\">Margaret on the Guillotine</a>, \"so that they might gauge whether or not I pose a security threat to Margaret Thatcher\". The meeting is civil, the singer's autograph is given, and after an hour he is sent away and the matter is ended.</p><h2>The Krays were persecuted</h2><p>Morrissey believes the East End gangster bosses were targeted by the authorities for being \"working class and far too formidable\". Their sin was not running a gangland empire, but that \"their empire promised no financial gain for the government\". They were, he states, \"unfairly locked away for the rest of their lives\".</p><h2>He was the victim of a kidnap attempt</h2><p>Morrissey believes Mexican kidnappers targeted him after a show in Tijuana in September 2007, when his driver veers from the highway down a dark road – 20 minutes after having promised they were four minutes from the US border. He and his security guard, fortunately, are able to leave the car, which leaves them in the middle of nowhere.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420211234|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|862b3ec39421e747545617bbfe3cacd2e6807622 -->",

When he met Jake Owen Walters, he writes, \"for the first time in my life the eternal 'I' becomes 'we', as, finally, I can get on with someone\".</p><p>Morrissey writes movingly about the two-year relationship. \"Jake and I neither sought not needed company other than our own for the whirlwind stretch to come,\" he writes. \"Indulgently Jake and I test how far each of us can go before 'being dwelt in' causes cries of intolerable struggle, but our closeness transcends such visitations.\"</p><p>Morrissey never specifies whether they were lovers, but talks of sharing hotel suites, of being photographed with his head \"resting on Jake's exposed belly\", and of Jake bringing him tea in the bath. </p><p>He also recounts an exchange at an airport. \"'Well,' says the woman in the British Airways lounge, 'you're either very close brothers or lovers.' 'Can't brothers be lovers?' I imprudently reply – always ready with the pointlessly pert, whether sensible or not.\"</p><p>The ending of the relationship is described in a way that could hardly be more Morrissey – with a visit to his home by Alan Bennett, who observes the pair and says: \"Now, now. What's going on? Something's happened, hasn't it? … You haven't spoken a word to each other since I arrived.\"</p><p>Although Autobiography never specifically addresses Morrissey's sexuality, he talks about his lack of interest in girls as a teenager. \"Girls remained mysteriously attracted to me,\" he writes, \"and I had no idea why, since although each fumbling foray hit the target, nothing electrifying took place, and I turned a thousand corners without caring … Far more exciting were the array of stylish racing bikes that my father would bring home.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420208795|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|ef74b5cb86503229b81f19cc738d52648e330f4d -->",

        "headline":"Want to get Daft Punk's Get Lucky? Give the vinyl a few more spins on the turntable",
        "body":"<p>Earlier this year, I wrote about trying to make sense of the <a href=\"http://hiddentracks.org/its-not-actually-a-disco-album-per-se-daft-punk-notes-from-a-small-backlash-2013\">early reaction to Daft Punk's Random Access Memories</a> when it became available to stream on iTunes a week ahead of release. After three weeks of living with Get Lucky, the consensus among about two-thirds of the first people who heard it was that, well, it could have done with a few more Get Luckys. What seemed striking was that they didn't seem to consider that some songs might require a bit of application from the listener. And yet, I would say that at least half of my 100 favourite albums revealed their charms gradually, over repeated listens. I bought <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pentangle\">Pentangle</a>'s Sweet Child when I was 17. It sat in my collection for about eight years, receiving only the occasional play, before I suddenly realised that this might be one of my favourite records of all time. It seemed to me that streaming Random Access Memories free and ahead of its official release might have backfired. By making it just another option on an endless try-before-you-buy taster menu, Columbia Records might have done the album a disservice.</p><p>How could this anticlimax have been circumvented? One suggestion I made was releasing the vinyl version one or two weeks ahead of a digital. It prompted a shitstorm of responses, mainly from people who assumed that I think vinyl is superior, and that the people who buy their music on vinyl are superior human beings.  They're not, but on the whole they are different. If you're wedded to a format that sets you back approximately £20 an album, it stands to reason that you'll work harder to justify the purchase. Two weeks of online chatter from people gradually realising that there was actually room in their lives for Wall-E's post-Studio 54 comedown opus would have created far more anticipation than the few hundred people who impulsively tweeted their first impressions on hearing what came out of their laptop speakers.</p><p>As it turned out, enough people heard something in Get Lucky to persuade them that Random Access Memories might be enjoyed most on vinyl. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/uk-vinyl-sales-daft-punk-david-bowie\">Figures released by the music industry organisation BPI</a> revealed a 100% increase in vinyl sales across 2013 so far, with the Daft Punk album topping the list. In the general scheme of things, vinyl is still very much a minority format. A 100% spike in sales only barely nudges total sales past the 500,000 mark. But if you're an artist who happens to do well in vinyl sales – albums by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Boards of Canada were among the 10 best-selling vinyl releases in 2013 – your relatively few sales will almost certainly eclipse several years of Spotify spoils. The upswing in vinyl sales is sometimes put down to the idea that music sounds warmer on vinyl or to the notion that holding a record sleeve and placing its contents on a turntable offers a more well-rounded aesthetic experience than a CD. To be honest, I'm not sure about \"warmth\". But sometimes – if playing, say, an original seven-inch of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8782KIj_rKw\">Let's Hang on by the Four Seasons</a> on a 60s Sanyo portable record player, and hearing how a 45 year-old speaker can barely contain the music's volume – it seems to make it all the more exciting. On the other hand, listening to a CD of John Renbourn singing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9fiaeKGrts\" title=\"\">I Know My Babe</a> by hooking up a set of Harman Kardon speakers to my computer provides a hushed, foetal intimacy that's no less lovely.</p><p>Perhaps arguing for the warmth of vinyl is simply a matter of trying to justify a pleasure that's sometimes hard to articulate. Everything but the Girl musician and sometime Buzzin' Fly label boss <a href=\"http://www.buzzinfly.com/comments/miles-showell-july-2012.html\" title=\"\">Ben Watt interviewed Abbey Road mastering engineer Miles Showell</a> to get an empirical measure of the merits of vinyl and digital formats. Showell contended that vinyl's superior fidelity was only discernible \"if the record was (i) cut well at the mastering stage, (ii) processed and pressed well at the factory, which is the really hard part, (iii) then kept clean and stored in ideal conditions and (iv), finally, played on a decent turntable with a very well-engineered tone arm fitted with a good and correctly aligned cartridge that, in turn, has a clean and undamaged stylus, all of which needs to feed a high quality RIAA vinyl disc pre-amplifier\".</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCBJ8BVy49w&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Reading on mobile?

Neither, I would venture, have most people who prefer to listen to music on vinyl. So what do I prefer? I enjoy going to a record shop when I am not altogether sure what I'm after. I prefer hearing and falling hard for something blasting out of the shop speakers that, on closer listening, turns out to be by an artist I didn't think I liked that much. Last month, in the west London outpost of Rough Trade, that happened to me with the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/15/arctic-monkeys-live-roundhouse\" title=\"\">Arctic Monkeys</a> album. I prefer the anticipation of  judging how it sounds in my kitchen. If it's a record I haven't listened to before I bought it – as happened with music by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/may/02/new-music-lloyd-cole-period-piece\" title=\"\">Lloyd Cole </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/10/parquet-courts-light-up-review\" title=\"\">Parquet Courts</a> on the same visit to Rough Trade – I like that we'll have to make an effort to get along. I can't just dismiss it and go on to the next thing. More than anything, I think that's what these new BPI figures tell us. The resurgence of vinyl is the closest music consumption has come to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/04/slow-food-carlo-petrini\" title=\"\">slow food movement</a>. My misgivings about Spotify aren't entirely predicated on the pittance of money that trickles down to music makers. If it was, I would stop buying second-hand records because their creators wouldn't make a penny from my purchase. Spotify merely formalises on a global scale the decline in how much people are prepared to pay for music.</p><p>We don't like it when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world\" title=\"\">artists such as David Byrne</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/spotify-thom-yorke-dying-corpse\" title=\"\">Thom Yorke</a> talk about the royalties generated by Spotify. It's somehow unbecoming of our favourite artists to discuss money. But, obvious as that may seem, payment is intrinsic to our concept of worth. And that has ramifications for the listener as well as the artist. It stands to reason that you'll work harder to get value out of something for which you paid an appreciable amount of money. That Marc Jacobs coat you paid £300 for? You might try and shed half a stone to fit back into it. But that raincoat from TK Maxx, well, the incentive isn't as great. The growth of vinyl and the rise of streaming are driven by the same forces. Both provide something that the other, by its very nature, simply can't. The pleasure you get from an experience is often proportionate to how much time and effort you expend. The carrier bag on the bus home. The expectation. The way it looks and feels. Even the way it smells. And that's before you even place it on the turntable. As New Radicals put it: \"<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/22717276\" title=\"\">Can't forget/ You only get what you give</a>.\" It's a shame that song never came out on vinyl.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420241396|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|edff244bc2350c8a59171802987fe0d984052a3e -->",

        "headline":"Morrissey: 10 things we learned from Autobiography",
        "body":"<h2>Morrissey was a teenage athlete</h2><p>Although his schooldays were deeply unhappy, the teenage Morrissey found himself an unlikely sportsman. \"By accident I am enlisted to represent the school in track events for the 100 metres and the 400 metres for which, unthinkably, I receive schoolboy medals.\" And so begins a period in which \"I am obliged to feel honoured and to dream of the 14-second dash, or the one-minute 400.\"</p><h2>Morrissey made his first TV appearance in a period drama</h2><p>Stumbling accidentally on to the Coronation Street set as a teenager, Morrissey found himself accosted by a woman bearing a bundle of scripts. On learning that he can, indeed, handle a bicycle well she issues an instruction: \"We need a boy for Saturday. It's a 7am start, no dialogue.\" And so Morrissey makes a brief appearance – \"even if you don't blink at all you will miss me\" – in The Stars Look Down, set in \"the frozen north of 1913\". He is but a spot on the horizon – \"a punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate\".</p><h2><br />Morrissey's first female crush was … a man</h2><p>\"Jerry Nolan on <a href=\"http://superradnow.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/new_york_dolls_-_1973_new_york_dolls.jpg\">the cover of the [New York] Dolls' debut album</a> is the first woman I ever fell in love with; the hussy-slut positioning of the legs is playmate call-girl, and the pink drum kit might be a rock'n'roll first.\"</p><h2>Morrissey and the soaps were made for each other</h2><p>Young and hardly gainfully employed, Morrissey wrote to Granada TV, suggesting he be employed as a writer on Corrie. \"I am invited to submit a script, and I whip off a word-slinger's delight wherein young take on old as a jukebox is tested in the Rovers' Return.\" Sadly, he is told his talents lie elsewhere. Many years later, however, the soaps come for him, when he is offered roles on Emmerdale and EastEnders, as Dot Cotton's \"so far unmentioned\" son. \"I would arrive unexpectedly in Albert Square and cause births, deaths and factory fires every time I opened my mouth\". As Morrissey observes: \"The most fascinating aspect of both offers is that somebody somewhere thought it a good idea.\" And that's without even considering the startling fact he was offered a cameo on Friends during a visit to filming of the sitcom.</p><h2>For all his anger at Mike Joyce, Morrissey praises the Smiths' rhythm section</h2><p>Though the lawsuit brought by Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke forever soured Morrissey's relationship with his former bandmates, he is effusive about their talents as the Smiths honed their craft. \"The Smiths' sound rockets with meteroic progression: bomb-burst drumming, explosive chords, combative basslines, and over it all I am as free as a hawk to paint the canvas as I wish. It is a gift from Jesus.\"</p><h2>Sandie Shaw may have been one Morrissey's idols, but that changed</h2><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bbZLll3Vdo\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p><p>Morrissey was delighted when Sandie Shaw agreed to sing Hand in Glove, less delighted with subsequent events. \"Ugh,\" was his reaction when she told him: \"Twenty-seven in the charts might be great for you, but it's not good enough for me.\" And her failure to treat the band \"to dinner, or even a bottle of stale ale\" is regarded as poor recompense for taking 40% of the cut from her recording of the Smiths' debut single.</p><h2>Nick Kent asked to join the Smiths</h2><p>After Johnny Marr left the band, the remaining three considered recruiting another guitarist. And one who asked to be considered was the veteran rock writer. \"I am not a good self-salesman,\" he wrote to Morrissey, \"but I can confidently boast an encyclopaedic knowledge of the chord structures, dynamics etc of Johnny's contributions to date … Being musically associated with your very good self would signify the very apex of my crusade for immortality.\"</p><h2>After the release of Margaret on the Guillotine, Morrissey was questioned by the police</h2><p>Special Branch summoned Morrissey in the wake of his 1988 album Viva Hate, featuring <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsq3H_6XuFA\">Margaret on the Guillotine</a>, \"so that they might gauge whether or not I pose a security threat to Margaret Thatcher\". The meeting is civil, the singer's autograph is given, and after an hour he is sent away and the matter is ended.</p><h2>The Krays were persecuted</h2><p>Morrissey believes the East End gangster bosses were targeted by the authorities for being \"working class and far too formidable\". Their sin was not running a gangland empire, but that \"their empire promised no financial gain for the government\". They were, he states, \"unfairly locked away for the rest of their lives\".</p><h2>He was the victim of a kidnap attempt</h2><p>Morrissey believes Mexican kidnappers targeted him after a show in Tijuana in September 2007, when his driver veers from the highway down a dark road – 20 minutes after having promised they were four minutes from the US border. He and his security guard, fortunately, are able to leave the car, which leaves them in the middle of nowhere.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420211234|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|862b3ec39421e747545617bbfe3cacd2e6807622 -->",

'Can't brothers be lovers?' I imprudently reply – always ready with the pointlessly pert, whether sensible or not.\"</p><p>The ending of the relationship is described in a way that could hardly be more Morrissey – with a visit to his home by Alan Bennett, who observes the pair and says: \"Now, now. What's going on? Something's happened, hasn't it? … You haven't spoken a word to each other since I arrived.\"</p><p>Although Autobiography never specifically addresses Morrissey's sexuality, he talks about his lack of interest in girls as a teenager. \"Girls remained mysteriously attracted to me,\" he writes, \"and I had no idea why, since although each fumbling foray hit the target, nothing electrifying took place, and I turned a thousand corners without caring … Far more exciting were the array of stylish racing bikes that my father would bring home.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420208795|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|ef74b5cb86503229b81f19cc738d52648e330f4d -->",

        "body":"<p>The British legal system and NME face the brunt of Morrissey's ire in his Autobiography, with side orders of disdain for record labels (especially Rough Trade), the 1970s education system and even a word of mild criticism for John Peel.</p><p>Judge John Weeks, who described the singer as \"devious, truculent and unreliable\", is in turn called \"the pride of the pipsqueakery\". </p><p>Weeks had used the words in his summing-up at the end of <a href=\"http://smiths.wikia.com/wiki/Joyce_v_Morrissey_%26_Ors\">the 1996 court case</a> in which he ruled former Smiths drummer Mike Joyce was entitled to 25% of the group's earnings.</p><p>\"Weeks tore into me with a thunder reserved for rapists and murderers,\" Morrissey writes. \"How do we rap these outspoken pop stars on the knuckles? How do we put them out of action? Here's how. Or, at most, we can try.\" The judge is described as \"ringing his creased little hangman's hands whilst resembling a pile of untouched sandwiches\".</p><p>The judges who dismissed Morrissey's appeal fare little better. \"Lord Waller fell asleep unashamedly throughout the entire hearing – his chin resting on his chest,\" Morrissey says. \"He awakes briefly and his right index finger lodges in his right nostril, as he fiddles about with the unseen. It would be comical if not so grotesque, and we can only despair at how lives and reputations rely so urgently on the thoughts of such puppetry.\"</p><p>Morrissey even suggests his own barrister, Murray Rosen, did not use all the available evidence, because he \"was in line for judicial promotion, and in the halls of justice, solidarity among the adjudicators must never be jumbled by mere scruples\".</p><p>Morrissey's description of the case and appeal lasts nearly 50 pages, the longest passage in a single subject in the book, but the matter of his relationship with NME crops up several times.</p><p>He asserts that the then editor of NME – not named, though Danny Kelly was editor at the time – in 1992 \"allegedly called a staff meeting at which he has passed the command that his staff writers must now 'get Morrissey' … the plan was underway to dislodge me as an NME staple.\"</p><p>After Morrissey supported Madness at Finsbury Park in London that summer, a show disrupted by skinheads and during which he draped himself in the Union Jack, he says the NME ran a cover bearing the words: \"Is Morrissey flirting with fascism?\", with – Morrissey observes – \"no thought whatsoever of me in the burning wreckage of it all … They milk and foster their racist allegations – full of high moral code and judicial thuggery\". In fact, <a href=\"http://motorcycleaupairboy.com/interviews/1992/caucasian.htm\">NME's front cover read: \"Flying the flag or flirting with disaster?</a>\"</p><p>Fifteen years later,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/30/timjonze\"> a Morrissey interview with the magazine prompted further accusations of racism</a>, which the singer describes as \"the most offensively malodorous attack … the editor [then Conor McNicholas] gives the story teeth by switching the wording of my replies, and by inventing questions that were never asked. It is catastrophically controversial.\" Nevertheless, the interviewer – Tim Jonze, now of the Guardian, though not identified by name – is described as \"very sensitive and courteous\".</p><p>Although Morrissey denies the allegations of racism, Autobiography does not address the content of his remarks to NME. Nor does he mention<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/03/morrissey-simon-armitage-interview\"> the interview he gave to the Guardian in 2010</a> in which he called Chinese people a \"subspecies\" for their treatment of animals.</p><h2>Morrissey's other targets</h2><p>• <strong>Rough Trade and its boss, Geoff Travis</strong> \"He must surely be aware that, wihtout the Smiths, he would have found himself wandering from kaftan to kaftan; the Westway above slamming out the Who or the Clash, but not the recalcitrant Smiths – who saved his life and made it count in the long run.\"</p><p>• <strong>Teachers</strong> Morrissey's feelings about his schooldays were documented on the Smiths' song The Headmaster Ritual, and Autobiography brings to vivid life the \"belligerent ghouls\" who ran Manchester schools. \"This freakish use of the leather strap is the answer for all teachers who find themselves in a situation that they simply cannot deal with, or answer.\"</p><p>• <strong>John Peel</strong> Although the Smiths' sessions for John Peel's Radio 1 show were seen as crucial to the growth in their popularity, Morrissey says it was the show's producer, John Walters, who was the real driving force behind their presence on the programme. \"John Peel, though, did not ever come to see the Smiths play live, and did not attend any of the radio sessions. He is cited as instrumental in the Smiths' success, but if not for the continual exuberance of John Walters, John Peel could never have encountered the Smiths.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420207643|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|0e528d664c73a3eddcba41bc311f64430ae52f66 -->",

        "headline":"Elliott Smith – 'I don't feel any sadder than anybody else I know': a classic interview from the vaults",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.sweetadeline.net/\">Elliott Smith</a> recovers nicely. Just one hour ago he was sitting in a tiny backstage room, enjoying a post-show libation and breathing in a blue cloud of smoke courtesy of a gang of well-wishers. </p><p>Soon, the crowd diminishes, enough for one dogged follower to claim Smith's attention. \"You must be a Cat Stevens fan, the kind of music you play,\" this young man with opossum eyes says.</p><p>Having commandeered the singer's attention, he bangs on about how fame drove sensitive strummer Cat Stevens nuts, drove him into the hands of Islam, drove him to call for the head of Salman Rushdie. Other fans back away; band members stick their head in the room and quickly withdraw. All but Smith, who politely listens with nary a squirm.</p><p>Until finally he can't take it any longer. He graciously excuses himself and waits until he's across the room before muttering, \"The last thing I need right now is somebody telling me how fame can make you crazy.\"</p><p>But morning has broken here in London, and nothing can bring Smith down. He heads back to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/dec/01/popandrock\">the Columbia</a>, the rock-star haunt that's the British version of the Chelsea Hotel, where friends and road crew and fellow traveling Northwesterners Sleater-Kinney are lining up at the bar, ordering drinks, and when the bartender of this private club room explains that they have to be staying at the hotel to order a drink, every one of them says the same thing: Their friend Elliott is the man, Elliott is coming soon, Elliott really, really is staying at the hotel.</p><p>Finally, Smith arrives, in his T-shirt from Value Village, his bargain-bin green suede shoes, his knit cap, and frayed, flared green pants. \"Trying to look good just gets on my nerves,\" he says. Smith flashes his room key, and confirms that all these people actually are his friends. Massaging a glass of beer, he seems happy, truly happy, which is not something a singer/songwriter so often linked with words such as \"gloom\" and \"Garfunkel\" is supposed to be. Happier than someone who sings about the need to \"bottle up and explode\", and happier than someone who last year tried to kill himself. </p><p>A pair of Dutch dowagers try chatting him up from their bar stools, and they have a conversation neither party understands before Smith repairs to his table. \"It's all OK,\" he says with a fraction of a smile. \"I'm doing fine now.\"<br />\t\t\t\t\t<br />\"I'm not interested in making 'Elliott Smith records' over and over again. I'd be really happy if I could write a song as universal and accessible as I Second That Emotion,\" he says. \"It's a big game to play, trying to make something that's mainstream enough and still human.\"</p><p>Elliott Smith just may prove up to the task. For everything it can mean this year, he is the songwriter to beat, a waltz-loving, George Harrison-quoting, profane craftsman who gets fan letters from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/25/courtney-love-interview\">Courtney Love</a> and still beats up on himself. He likes songs so much that, on his nights off, Smith rounds up friends and rocks the karaoke machine with versions of Scorpions and Don McLean hits. </p><p>Maybe he likes songs too much: his keep gagging on pieces of the past. \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13BLo-OhJo\">I'm so glad that my memory's remote/'Cause I'm doing just fine hour-to-hour, note-to-note</a>,\" he sings on his fourth album, XO. But no matter how much his songs reveal an urge to burn all the photo books, there's a bone-tired weariness in his singing that can't let go of old business. However calm his songs sound, they still roar like a car crash echoing in a seashell.</p><p>\"Some beautiful songs try to make you think that, for a moment, there's no crap in the world, that it's just a beautiful place,\" says Slim Moon, founder of <a href=\"http://www.killrockstars.com/\">Kill Rock Stars</a>, the Olympia, Washington, label that released Smith's second and third albums (1995's Elliott Smith and 1997's Either/Or). \"But Elliott's songs admit that the world's fucked up, and this is just a beautiful moment we get to have.\"</p><p>Some of the dark imagery came when Smith returned to Portland, Oregon, after graduating from Massachusetts's Hampshire College in 1991. \"I was reading all this heavy-duty feminist theory, and Catherine MacKinnon in particular,\" he says. \"If you're a straight white man, she made it seem impossible to live your life without constantly doing something shitty. It kind of drained all my energy away. I didn't want to do anything.\"</p><p>Casting about for a career, he settled on being a fireman, because a fireman is an indisputably essential guy, right? \"Someone has to put out fires, while it's not particularly essential for me to play songs to people. It's important that somebody play songs, but …\"</p><p>He signals for another round of double espressos in a London cafe overlooking a canal. You couldn't get much more bohemian than the music playing in this room of tiny round tables, first French crooner Serge Gainsbourg and then cabaret freak Scott Walker wailing of their obelisk-size pain. It's almost as if a tractor beam has been turned on, and brought the moody, beautifully broken Smith home.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH8-lQ9CeyI\">Reading on mobile? Listen here<br /></a><br />Everywhere he goes, it is the same beautiful brokenness, the same rawness that reaches out and brings you forward. He played Miss Misery, his Oscar-nominated song from the Good Will Hunting soundtrack, at the awards show – in a white suit! – and for a few minutes made the Hollywood pageant seem bizarrely intimate. When he performs, Smith comes across both worried and unintimidated, like he knows he's going to have to fight his way out of this one, and like it's nothing he hasn't done before.</p><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHpbovYq-Vk\">Bottle Up and Explode!</a>\" is more than a song title, it's a way of dealing, or not dealing, with the world. Some of the people who most care about Smith have noticed. Two friends in Portland – where Smith lived until he moved to Brooklyn two years ago – are Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss. Coomes was in Heatmiser, a grungy Portland band Smith formed after he was a fireman; Weiss plays drums in Sleater-Kinney. Both are also in the band <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/08/sam-coomes-quasi-internet-has-demystified-idea-being-band\">Quasi</a>, who back Smith live and whose recent album, Featuring \"Birds\", included <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXDllorZ3IY\">The Poisoned Well</a>, an angry song aimed at Smith: \"You won't live long/ But you may write the perfect song.\"</p><p>\"I don't feel any sadder than anybody else I know,\" Smith says. \"I'm happy some of the time, and some of the time I'm not.\" One of the times when he was not came in 1997, when the singer tried to kill himself. He won't say why this happened, though a piece in the Los Angeles Times suggests it had to do with a breakup from his girlfriend.</p><p>\"I don't like when people talk about all the bad things that have happened to them as if that makes them unique. Because I don't think I've had a harder time than other people.</p><p>\"But, um, yeah – I, uh, jumped off a cliff. But it didn't work. It was in North Carolina or somewhere. It wasn't like I made up my mind to throw myself off a cliff. I got freaked out and started running, it was totally dark, and I ran off the edge of a cliff. I saw it coming up, and it wasn't like, 'I'm gonna throw myself off this cliff and die.' It was just, 'Ground's coming up. Who cares, whatever.' I landed on a little tree, punctured my, you know, body. It just made a really ugly wound.\"</p><p>Around this time some of Smith's friends were so worried about Smith's drinking and talk of obliteration they arranged a substance-abuse intervention. They surprised him with a counsellor in a room in Chicago, and pressured him to check into an Arizona detox facility. A few days later Smith walked out, afraid he was about to be trapped. Kill Rock Stars' Slim Moon, who helped plan the intervention and who also recorded Nirvana early on, sees similarities between Kurt Cobain and Smith: \"Kurt was the most talented songwriter I'd ever met. But he was the same way [as Elliott]: He appeared really fragile, in a lot of ways was really stubborn, and he internalized everything. He would go on and on in his songs about how nothing was going to relieve his pain. But at the same time he was searching hard for something to relieve it.\"</p><p>Since he walked out of the clinic, Smith hasn't spoken to Moon. And he says part of XO's anger came out of the intervention. \"A lot of songs on the record had to do with being amazed at how quickly people will invade your space just because you don't deal with things like they do. They think that you drink too much, or they think that you're too – I just don't think being scared is a good enough reason to take over somebody's life.\"<br />\t\t\t\t\t<br /> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ADiSSNWU90\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p><p>It's easy to get the wrong idea about that face. At first, the skin's waxy softness, the three-days' growth, the brawler's nose, is all you notice. He looks uncared for and unconcerned.</p><p>But look closely, and what slowly reveals itself is something gentle and exhausted. This might be why, after Good Will Hunting's Minnie Driver and Matt Damon broke up, rumours circulated that Driver and Smith were an item. (He denies that they were anything but friends.)</p><p>In a dressing room backstage of a big club in Portland, the Smith profile takes a sip from a microbrew. It becomes apparent how Gary Smith, Elliott's father, lent a lot of his features to his son, along with a precise way of speaking that holds each word out an even beat. Gary Smith is a psychiatrist; he speaks this way for a living. He and Elliott's mother divorced when Elliott was one year old. Elliott stayed with his mom in Dallas until he was 14, and then moved with his father and stepmom to Portland. \"He was always into music,\" says the father, strumming one of Elliott's guitars.</p><p>Right then in walks Elliott, who's just rehearsed a George Harrison cover he'll perform with Quasi that night. \"When he was three,\" says Gary, smiling at Elliott, \"I brought him over to my apartment. I put The White Album on a lot. He loved Rocky Raccoon. I just tried to get it off before Why Don't We Do It in the Road came on.\" With that, the son sings a line from the song.</p><p>\"Do you remember when you were involved with Junior Achievement?\" asks Gary.</p><p>When Elliott was 14, he entered a talent contest held by the farm team of capitalism. For weeks, the sound of Elliott practicing Beatles songs on his guitar wafted from his bedroom.</p><p>\"The talent show was in a big church filled with people,\" says Gary, \"and there were all these different acts, and one of them was a tap dancer, tap-dancing to Yankee Doodle Dandy, all dressed in red, white, and blue. And Elliott played Blackbird and I was stunned, and I thought maybe it was just me, but after he finished playing there was a hush, and then this warm applause filled the hall. It was the first time I knew, whoa, this is where he's going.\" He puts down a bottle of beer. \"The end of the story\" – and by now Elliott starts giggling – \"is, they chose somebody to go on a national talent show, and the person they chose was the tap dancer, tap-dancing to Yankee Doodle Dandy. It was the beginning of that sort of …\"</p><p>He doesn't finish the sentence, because the father and son are both laughing out loud, giddy as goats, at what is so obvious it doesn't need to be said: It was the beginning of not quite getting the prize, of not quite knowing if you want all the yankee-doodle-doo up the road. \"Elliott may take turns here and there, and run into dead ends,\" says Dad, strumming again on his son's guitar. \"But he has a way of maintaining himself and his integrity. He's quiet, but potent.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420027916|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|2358f5cdd551f49e3bf5201dd03d76d5b675fa6e -->",
