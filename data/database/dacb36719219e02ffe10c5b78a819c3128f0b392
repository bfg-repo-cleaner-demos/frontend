        "body":"<p>The chances of keeping the global temperature increase below 2C will &ldquo;swiftly diminish&rdquo; unless the world takes immediate action to escalate cuts in carbon emissions, the United Nations has warned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unep.org\">The UN Environment Program</a> said that even if nations meet their current emissions reduction pledges, carbon emissions in 2020 will be eight to 12 gigatonnes above the level required to avoid a costly nosedive in greenhouse gas output.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unep.org/publications/ebooks/emissionsgapreport2013/EmissionsGapReport2013/tabid/130755/ctl/Login/language/en-US/Default.aspx?returnurl=%2fpublications%2febooks%2femissionsgapreport2013%2fDefault.aspx\">The Emissions Gap Report 2013</a>, which was compiled by 44 scientific groups in 17 countries, warns that if the greenhouse &ldquo;gap&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;closed or significantly narrowed&rdquo; by 2020, the pathway to limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C will be closed.</p> <p>At UN talks in 2010, the international community agreed to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 2C by 2100, based on pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>Scientists at the recent IPCC gathering warned that the world could emit enough carbon to surpass <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/27/ipcc-world-dangerous-climate-change\">the 2C limit within 30 years</a>, and this latest UN analysis heightens concerns that the world could be heading for a temperature rise of 4C or even 6C, triggering damaging sea level rises, extreme weather events and food insecurity.</p> <p>The Emissions Gap Report, released ahead of climate talks in Warsaw next week, found that although the 2C target could be achieved with higher emissions by 2020, failure to significantly reduce CO2 levels will &ldquo;exacerbate mitigation challenges&rdquo; after this time.</p> <p>&ldquo;This will mean much higher rates of global emission reductions in the medium term; greater lock-in of carbon-intensive infrastructure; greater dependence on often unproven technologies in the medium term; greater costs of mitigation in the medium and long term; and greater risks of failing to meet the 2C target,&rdquo; the UN Environment Program stated.</p> <p>In order to avoid this scenario, the report recommends that emissions should reach a maximum of 44 gigatonnes of CO2 by 2020, falling to 40 gigatonnes by 2025 and further to 22 gigatonnes by 2050.</p> <p>However, given that the 2C target was set based on the assumption that action would start in 2010, the report warns it will become &ldquo;increasingly difficult&rdquo; to meet this goal. Global greenhouse gas emissions for 2010, the latest year for which data is available, stood at 50.1 gigatonnes.</p> <p>Although the report states the window for action is &ldquo;narrowing&rdquo;, the 2C target could still be achieved by implementing ambitious emissions reduction promises, tightening the rules of existing pledges and international co-operation on areas such as energy efficiency, renewables and fossil fuel subsidies.</p> <p>Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/30/climate-change-abbott-emissions-target\">Climate Change Authority said</a> that Australia&rsquo;s 5% emissions reduction goal is &ldquo;not a credible option&rdquo; and should be increased, possibly to 15% or 25%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/28/australia-should-reduce-carbon-emissions-by-at-least-25-by-2020\">A separate analysis</a> by WWF found that Australia has already burned through two-thirds of its share of a &ldquo;carbon budget&rdquo; that would keep the temperature rise under 2C.</p> <p>Achim Steiner, UN Environment Program executive director, said that delayed action to reduce emissions would increase the rate of climate change-fueled impacts.</p> <p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;lock-in&rsquo; would slow down the introduction of climate-friendly technologies and narrow the developmental choices that would place the global community on the path to a sustainable, green future,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, the stepping stone of the 2020 target can still be achieved by strengthening current pledges and by further action, including scaling up international co-operation initiatives in areas such as energy efficiency, fossil fuel subsidy reform and renewable energy.</p> <p>&ldquo;Even agriculture can contribute, as direct emissions from this sector are currently responsible for 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions &ndash; more if its indirect emissions are taken into account.&rdquo;</p> <p>Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who was recently accused of &ldquo;talking through her hat&rdquo; by Tony Abbott for linking bushfires to climate change, added: &ldquo;As we head towards Warsaw for the latest round of climate negotiations, there is a real need for increased ambition by all countries: ambition which can take countries further and faster towards bridging the emissions gap and a sustainable future for all.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, increased national ambition will not be enough to meet the scientific realities of climate change, which is one reason why a universal new agreement &ndash; able to catalyse international co-operation &ndash; is urgently needed by 2015.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421674669|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|eaa487e16a985da3b816af54f0ffa8ff1fe2b4de -->",

        "body":"<p>The Indonesian foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, has escalated the diplomatic row between Australia and Indonesia after revelations about Australia's intelligence gathering activities by suggesting co-operation on people smuggling operations may be reviewed.</p> <p>Natalegawa made the comments in a press conference on Monday. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/nsa-australia-bali-conference-spy-indonesia\">Guardian Australia reported at the weekend that Australia was spying</a> on Indonesia at the UN climate change conference in 2007, according documents obtained by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p> <p>Last week Fairfax Media used documents leaked to German news magazine Der Spiegel by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden to show that Australia was gathering intelligence from<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/spy-agency-taps-undersea-cables-20130828-2squf.html\"> listening posts across the Asia-Pacific region</a>.</p> <p>When he was questioned about what action Indonesia would take against Australia, the foreign minister said: &ldquo;One of them obviously is the agreement to exchange information, exchange even intelligence information, in fact, to address the issue of people smuggling.\"</p> <p>\"If Australia feels that there are ways of obtaining information other than the official one then one wonders where we are in terms of co-operation.\"</p> <p>\"Enough is enough,\" Dr Natalegawa said. \"The recent revelations will have a potentially damaging impact in terms of the trust and confidence between countries concerned.\"</p> <p>Indonesia<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/indonesia-summons-australian-ambassador-embassy-spying-claims\"> summoned the Australian ambassador, Greg Moriarty,</a> and US officials to the foreign ministry last week to explain the revelations. Natalegawa had also sought explanation from Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop during a meeting in Perth on Friday.</p> <p>But Natalegawa said on Monday he was not satisfied with either of the explanations offered by Bishop or Moriarty. \"The kind of response that we've been obtaining or receiving is the more generic response that neither the government of Australia nor the United States is able to confirm or deny the practices reported in the various media,\" he said.</p> <p>Natalegawa&rsquo;s comments come just days after the immigration minister, Scott Morrison, arrived back in Australia from a trip to Indonesia where he met Dr Amir Syamsuddin, Indonesia's minister for law and human rights, to discuss people smuggling operations.</p> <p>At his weekly press conference last Friday Morrison told reporters: \"Australia and Indonesia have a shared interest in resolving this problem that is not of Indonesia's making yet whose co-operation along with our other regional partners is critical to resolving it.</p> <p>\"We have opened a new phase in our co-operation with Indonesia and I am extremely optimistic about what will be achieved in the weeks, months and years ahead.\"</p> <p>Natalegawa said last Friday that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/indonesia-says-australia-spying-unacceptable\">spying revelations were &ldquo;not cricket&rdquo;</a> and he had sought clarification about Australia&rsquo;s involvement with the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421603563|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|3f5909aa81d3b9475a383c44d034ae288b30939f -->",

        "body":"<p>A new opinion poll underscores the substantial political difficulties associated with some of the more ambitious reform proposals that could emerge from the Abbott government&rsquo;s new commission of audit process.</p> <p>An Essential poll <a href=\"http://essentialvision.com.au/category/essentialreport\">published</a> on Tuesday shows public disquiet with a number of the potential directions floated in the lead-up to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/australia-cut-spending-shrink-bureaucracy\">creation</a> of the new commission of audit &ndash; the first inquiry of its type at the federal level since 1996.</p> <p>The Coalition has allowed the commission, chaired by business chief Tony Shepherd, to embark on its work with very broad-ranging terms of reference.</p> <p>The government has been careful not to pre-emptively rule options out in advance &ndash; although during the election campaign, the then shadow communications spokesman Malcolm Turnbull told the communications union the Coalition had no plans to sell off the postal service.</p> <p>Treasurer Joe Hockey has made it plain the commission needs a broad canvas on which to work. The context for setting up the inquiry was the Coalition&rsquo;s oft repeated declarations of a &ldquo;budget emergency&rdquo; &ndash; which created a requirement to find substantial efficiencies to bring the federal budget back to a sustainable footing.</p> <p>The prime minister has said the commission is very unlikely to propose tax increases, setting up the proposition that the budget sustainability sought by the new government will be driven by reducing the size of government, eliminating duplication and cutting expenditure.</p> <p>The new Essential poll shows 63% of the sample would oppose the sell-off of Australia Post; 59% would oppose the privatisation of the Hecs debt (an option <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/christopher-pyne-student-debt-private-sector\">left open</a> by the education minister, Christopher Pyne); 60% would oppose cutting welfare benefits; and 59% would oppose handing control of DisabilityCare to a privatised Medibank Private.</p> <p>The poll also suggests mixed public views about the Abbott government&rsquo;s plans to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/abbott-confirms-plan-privatise-medibank\">privatise</a> Medibank Private. Of those questioned, 43% opposed the privatisation, 22% supported it, and 35% didn&rsquo;t have a view.</p> <p>There was, however, strong public support for potential recommendations reducing duplication between the states in areas like education and health (73% were in favour); and the means testing of all welfare benefits (63% support).</p> <p>How the Abbott government responds to suggestions flowing from its commission audit will be a significant test of its early political resolve. The prime minister used a recent radio interview to begin laying the groundwork for what might emerge when the commission hands down its findings in 2014.</p> <p>&ldquo;If we are going to get debt under control, if we are going to get the budget under control &ndash; back into the black &ndash; yes, inevitably, things will have to change,&rdquo; Abbott said last month.</p> <p>&ldquo;There will be some things the public don't like but I think the public understands the government has been living beyond its means. We can't continue. And that&rsquo;s why, amongst other things, we are having this commission of audit.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421676866|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|fbace10be3130a7ecee052a50e8a653645ecc499 -->",

        "body":"<p>Rebekah Brooks was involved in a deliberate effort to hide material from police during the \"panic-stricken\" days around the closure of the News of the World, the jury in the phone-hacking trial has been told.</p><p>Brooks, then chief executive of News of the World publisher News International, and her personal assistant Cheryl Carter have been accused of trying to conceal seven boxes of her notebooks the day after the announcement that the paper was to close down and two days before its final edition. They deny the charges.</p><p>Andrew Edis QC, for the prosecution, told the jury on Monday the attempt to hide evidence happened during the \"fevered\" and \"anxious\" days before the paper was closed in early July 2011.</p><p>Edis said Brooks was aware Scotland Yard had reopened its investigation into phone hacking in January 2011 and had declared the company's determination to co-operate with the police.</p><p>\"There was always a course of justice in existence which could be perverted by hiding evidence. Hiding evidence was not acceptable at any time that year, but the atmosphere, we would suggest, became even more fevered as time went on,\" said Edis.</p><p>On 7 July 2011 it was announced that the News of the World was to close. On 8 July Carter arranged to have the boxes containing Brooks's notebooks removed from the News International archive in Enfield, the jury was told.</p><p>This day, said Edis, was a \"significant day\" as it was the day that the former editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, was arrested.</p><p>\"A media firestorm which was about to engulf the News of the World, so you can imagine the extremely anxious if not panic-stricken approach that must have been going on,\" Edis told the jury.</p><p>\"When we come to look at what Mrs Brooks was doing in July 2011, we always need to bear in mind the context. This was a big business for News International and for her. At all times she was aware there was a police inquiry, Operation Weeting,\" he added.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421627350'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383569251094/Cheryl-Carter-008.jpg' alt='Cheryl Carter' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Phone-hacking trial: Cheryl Carter arrives at the Old Bailey. Photograph: Barcroft Media</figcaption></figure><p>The jury heard how Carter, along with her son Nick and Gary Keegan, the husband of Brooks's other personal assistant Deborah Keegan, went to Enfield to collect seven boxes of notebooks and took them to Carter's home.</p><p>They were told they were selected for this exercise two days before the News of the World was to close because they could be trusted.</p><p>Later, in an interview with police under caution, Carter said the boxes had in fact been mislabelled and contained her own notebooks, the prosecution said.</p><p>The boxes of notebooks have never been found, Edis added.</p><p>Carter was also alleged to have given a false alibi to the police about the whereabouts of Brooks on the same day claiming she was not in the office, when mobile phone records show that the two of them had been at News International's Wapping headquarters.</p><p>\"The false alibi was quite dishonest to cover what happened. Because she'd remember where the boss was on the Friday before the News of the World closed, wouldn't she?\" said Edis.</p><p>He claimed that Carter not only lied about the contents of the boxes but also about the reasons for removing them.</p><p>Carter said when she was being questioned by police the reason why the boxes were removed was because Ian Mayes, the News International archivist, had asked her to move them because the archive was downsizing. Edis told the jury that was simply not true.</p><p>\"So there were a number of falsehoods about this exercise all of which were completely unnecessary if they related to material related to Mrs Carter, not Mrs Brooks,\" said Edis.</p><h2>Brooks ordered deletion of emails, court told</h2><p>Edis also alleged that Brooks ordered the deletion of emails that covered the entire period of her editorship of the News of the World and the Sun.</p><p>It  was \"normal policy\" for companies to have email deletion policies to improve efficiency. \"There's nothing wrong with that in principle,\" he said, and News International's original plan was to delete everything \"before December 2008\".</p><p>But by looking at \"Mrs Brooks's personal involvement\" in the email deletion, \"we may learn what she hoped it might achieve for her\", he said.</p><p>In January 2010 Brooks sent an email to News International's legal affairs department asking: \"What happens to my emails with deletion?\"</p><p>In June she inquired why the deletion programme was not already under way. \"That's her chasing the implementation of the email deletion,\" said Edis.</p><p>Then in August 2010 she sent another email reiterating that everyone needed to know that \"anything before January 2010 will not be kept\". When that date of January 2010 was queried, she replied: \"Yes. January 2010. Clean sweep, Thanks.\"</p><p>Edis said: \"So there's a change in the date. Now it is anything before January 2010. Which happens to catch her entire time as a working editor at News International.\"</p><p>On the changing of  the email deletion date, Edis said: \"We suggest that shows Mrs Brooks may have had a personal interest in this email deletion policy – both to the date of the cut-off and for her own personal emails – also that it should be got on with.</p><p>\"This is all going on in the context of the Guardian having published its article in the summer of 2009.</p><p>\"We suggest that there is some evidence that Mrs Brooks was keen to get rid of the material that related to her activities when she was editor, first of the News of the World and then of the Sun.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421627351'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2012/5/30/1338380806713/Vince-Cable-008.jpg' alt='Vince Cable' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Vince Cable: Brooks voiced concerns his stance on News Corp's BSkyB takeover.

We have spent months moving from rogue reporter to zero tolerance with some success,\" he wrote.</p><p>Five days later, on 21 December 2011, Cable was stripped of responsibility for ruling on News Corp's Sky takeover after telling undercover Daily Telegraph reporters he was \"at war\" with Rupert Murdoch.</p><p>The trial continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421619021|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|031558434fa656983f95e44a5c1e8a2a58164781 -->",

        "body":"<p>A court in Bangladesh has sentenced 152 people to death for their actions in a 2009 border guard mutiny in which 74 people, including 57 military commanders, were killed.</p><p>Dhaka's metropolitan sessions court judge Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman also sentenced 157 others, mostly border guards, to life in prison while 271 people were acquitted. The extensive case involves 846 accused, and the verdicts are still being announced.</p><p>The mutiny on 25-26 February 2009 took place two months after the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, took office. The  military was unhappy over the response of the government, which did not allow troops to attack the border guards' headquarters in Dhaka where military commanders were killed.</p><p>Hasina offered an amnesty to quell the revolt but rescinded the offer when dozens of bodies were found in sewers and in mass graves.</p><p>Bangladesh's military has staged 21  coup attempts. The amnesty offer and the government's handling of the case strained the military's relationship with Hasina, and she pledged to try those responsible.</p><p>The country's criminal investigation department investigated and pressed charges against 850 people with serious crimes including murder and arson. Four of the accused died and 20 were tried in absentia.</p><p>Human rights groups have criticised Bangladesh for the mass trial, saying it will not aid justice. New York-based Human Rights Watch last week said at least 47 suspects have died in custody while the suspects have had limited access to lawyers, and to knowledge of the charges and evidence against them. Bangladeshi authorities have denied the allegations.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421683522|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|c05f7922a8eeaf369acc5f915cfccb195c705722 -->",

        "body":"<p>Congolese rebels have surrendered  after a 20-month uprising, offering the best hope of peace for years in the country's war-ravaged east.</p><p>The M23 rebel group declared a ceasefire and said it was ready to disarm and demobilise troops and pursue a political solution to end the crisis.</p><p>\"The chief of general staff and the commanders of all major units are requested to prepare troops for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration on terms to be agreed with the government of Congo,\" the M23 leader, Bertrand Bisimwa, said.</p><p>The announcement came hours after Democratic Republic of the Congo government forces drove the rebel fighters out of their  two remaining strongholds. \"Tshanzu and Runyoni were taken by the army around 3am,\" government spokesman Lambert Mende told Reuters. \"Many M23 fighters are surrendering. Militarily this is finished.\"</p><p>The Kinshasa government expects peace talks mediated by neighbouring Uganda to resume soon, Mende added.</p><p>Al-Jazeera showed pictures of  M23 military leader General Sultani Makenga's abandoned home in the village of Chanzu and quoted witnesses saying  he had fled to neighbouring Rwanda.</p><p>The M23 is made up of fighters who deserted the Congolese army in April 2012 following a mutiny. Its name <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20438531\" title=\"\">is a reference to a 23 March 2009 peace deal</a>  the CNDP militia accused the Congolese government of betraying. Eight hundred thousand people have fled their homes since the insurgency began.</p><p>The rebels' capitulation marks a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/world/africa/a-reason-for-hope-in-congos-perpetual-war.html\" title=\"\">dramatic turnaround</a>. Less than a year ago they marched into and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/20/congo-rebel-m23-take-goma\" title=\"\">captured the major eastern city of Goma</a> and bragged  they were ready to march on the capital. UN peacekeepers were passive spectators and the Congolese army descended into a drunken, defeated shambles.</p><p>But the lightning reversal appears to be a vindication of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/05/un-force-democratic-republic-congo\" title=\"\">UN decision to create its first fighting force with a mandate to go on the offensive</a>. Tanks and helicopters from the 3,000-strong UN intervention brigade have supported a reorganised, better paid and more disciplined Congolese army in the recent advances.</p><p>Perhaps most crucially of all, the backing that the M23 received from neighbouring Rwanda has virtually dried up in recent months, <a href=\"http://congosiasa.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/as-m23-nears-defeat-more-questions-than.html\" title=\"\">regional analyst Jason Stearns blogged last week</a>. \"According to several reports from the frontlines, despite indications of some cross-border support in the Kibumba area, the M23 was largely left to its own devices,\" Stearns wrote. \"'The Rwandans just wouldn't pick up their phone calls,' one source close to the M23 leadership told me.\"</p><p>Rwanda has always denied the charge made by the UN's group of experts that it was providing military and logistical support to the M23.</p><p>African leaders meeting in Pretoria, South Africa, congratulated Congolese government forces and the UN peace enforcement mission in eastern Congo for \"recapturing M23 strongholds and restoring government control\". Kabila was present at the meeting but the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, sent his foreign minister.</p><p>Conflict in eastern Congo goes back two decades to the Rwandan genocide and has claimed millions of lives,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/16/congo\" title=\"\"> earning the label \"Africa's first world war\"</a>.  The collapse of the M23 marks a hopeful breakthrough but numerous other armed groups continue to operate in the vast area.</p><p>Russell Feingold, US special envoy to the Congo and the Great Lakes region, told a briefing in Pretoria: \"In a region that has suffered so much, this is obviously a significant positive step in the right direction.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421684474|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|e83da5bfeff1715188d74b59e59f61cc7f31bb3f -->",

        "body":"<p>Political parties and their representatives are positioning themselves in anticipation of a fresh Senate election in Western Australia after the Australian Electoral Commission said the disputed result was now bound for the high court.</p><p>The Coalition on Monday attempted to frame any fresh Senate race in WA as a new political referendum on Labor's clean energy package in the wake of the shadow cabinet's decision last week to stick with the election policy on climate change.</p><p>\"It will be another opportunity to have a referendum on the carbon tax, which is hurting families and hurting the economy,\" the federal finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told reporters in Canberra.</p><p>But Labor has brushed that off as political rhetoric from a government intending to implement a policy that will not actually address climate change.</p><p>The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said the opposition did not intend to wave through a policy that removed the legal cap on pollution. The Coalition's \"direct action\" plan was a \"dog\" of a policy, he said. \"You can't just throw the baby out with the bathwater,\" Butler said on Monday. </p><p>Candidates in Western Australia are also positioning themselves ahead of a process which could throw open nominations for a fresh Senate contest.</p><p>Labor's Louise Pratt, who lost out in the contested recount in part because the WA left-winger was Labor's number two Senate candidate in the September election, hinted her party may want to adjust the order of the senate ticket in a new pre-selection.</p><p>\"It will be a question for the Labor party to resolve, but it is clearly a different race with a lot more focus,\" Pratt said on Monday. Former union official Joe Bullock was elected in WA in the number one spot for the ALP.</p><p>Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is also likely to be a contender in any new contest, according to the party's former lead candidate in WA, Gerry Georgatos.</p><p>The jostling on Monday occurred even though it was not yet clear whether the high court, sitting as the court of disputed returns, would actually order a fresh election.</p><p>The special minister of state, Michael Ronaldson, issued a stern rebuke against \"hypotheticals\", including, presumably, to colleagues on his own side of politics who are out framing the parameters of the next contest.</p><p>\"It is purely hypothetical for people to assume there will be a fresh election. There are clearly a range of options, of which a fresh election could be one,\" Ronaldson told the ABC on Monday afternoon. Ronaldson said it was \"premature\" for anyone to be speculating about future courses of action.</p><p>The fracas has been prompted by the loss of 1,375 ballot papers during a recent recount in the WA Senate race. The Australian Electoral Commissioner, Ed Killesteyn, said on Monday that the loss of the ballots created \"a nagging and almost irreconcilable doubt about the outcome of the West Australian senate election\".</p><p>Killesteyn did a round of media interviews on Monday in which he issued another unreserved apology for an incident that has inflicted substantial reputational damage on the AEC.</p><p>The commission is leaving open the option of petitioning the court of disputed returns itself in a gesture that would be intended to restore confidence to the electoral system. The AEC has also called on the services of the former federal police commissioner, Mick Keelty, to investigate the incident.</p><p>The WA Senate result was declared on Monday afternoon despite the lost ballots, triggering the 40-day process for petitions to the High Court. The recount awarded the final two places to the Greens and to the Sports party. The original result gave the Senate spots to a Palmer United party candidate and to the ALP.</p><p>The PUP has already flagged its intention to challenge the result.</p><p>Greens senator Scott Ludlam spoke at the declaration on Monday, remarking that it was appropriate the WA result be challenged in the court of disputed returns.</p><p>Louise Pratt also spoke, saying it was important to secure \"a proper democratic outcome for the voters of WA\". She said the onus was on the AEC to petition the court.</p><p>A number of players, including the Greens and the South Australian independent Nick Xenophon, have used the uncertainty about the WA ballots process to argue the case for broader reforms to the Senate voting system to stop micro-parties gaming the system.</p><p>Xenophon is proposing to bring forward a private members bill when the new federal parliament resumes next week to implement optional preferential voting. The Greens support that change as well.</p><p>Ronaldson said on Monday he would be giving the parliamentary committee on electoral matters a reference to examine the 2013 poll, but he would not be rushing to any other conclusion.</p><p>\"I've had an enormous amount of advice over the last six weeks – some of it constructive, some of it less so,\" the special minister of state said.</p><p>Liberal campaign director Brian Loughnane has publicly called for an inquiry into the senate voting process after the strong result for micro-parties in the 2013 poll – a call which has in-principle support from the ALP.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421597869|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|459254d1d005801dc4fa4a20b4b5f3601d0fdc2d -->",

        "body":"<p>Multiple shots were fired inside a northern New Jersey mall shortly before closing time and the search was on early Tuesday for the suspected shooter, a Bergen county official said. There was no report of injuries.</p> <p>Jeanne Baratta said authorities believed the shooter may still be in the Garden State Plaza Mall. Swat teams were concentrating their search in the north-east corner of the 200,000 square metre mall in Paramus.</p> <p>Baratta said a call was received saying shots were fired at the facility shortly before the mall's 9.30pm closing time on Monday night.</p> <p>Paramus police chief Kenneth Ehrenberg said early on Tuesday that the suspect had been dressed in black and wore what was believed to be a motorcycle helmet. A weapon had not been recovered.</p> <p>Witnesses said the sound of gunfire sent customers and employees rushing for the exits and hiding places.<br />Baratta said authorities found one bullet casing.</p> <p>Hundreds of law enforcement officers converged on the mall, which was put on lockdown. New Jersey state police landed a helicopter in the parking lot of one of the state's largest and most popular shopping malls.</p> <p>Baratta said Swat teams and police with canine units were going through the mall and working to evacuate anyone still inside. As of early Tuesday authorities believed there were still people in the mall, she said.</p> <p>Nick Woods was working in a Lego store when a woman ran by shouting that there was a shooting.<br />Woods said his supervisor locked them in a back room, along with a woman, a man and a child.</p> <p>When they peeked out two hours later, they saw police officers standing outside and he called the police emergency dispatcher to ask that the officers be told they were coming out. He said the emergency operator told him she could not contact individual police officers and that he should walk out with his hands in the air.</p> <p>\"I had to go out of the store shouting at the officers with my hands up and they turned and pointed their guns at me,\" Woods said. \"It was one of the scariest experiences of my life.\"</p> <p>Jessica Stigliano, 21, of Richfield, New Jersey, said she was sitting in the mall's food court when she saw people running and yelling \"shots were fired\".</p> <p>Carlos Sinde, 36, of Astoria, Queens, said he was ushered out of a cinema screening of the movie Gravity. \"Once the security guards started telling us what was going on, that's when there was hysteria,\" he said.</p> <p>The mall is located in Bergen county, about 15 miles (24km) north-west of Manhattan.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421670781|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|49ae9b026ae0311de6d236edc7d2828adf34500d -->",

        "body":"<p>Two unaccompanied teenage asylum seekers being held in a small secure compound on Manus Island regional processing centre were transferred offshore as a result of administrative errors, Guardian Australia understands.</p> <p>The two boys, both unaccompanied minors, understood to be a 16-year-old Rohingyan and a 17-year-old Iranian, claim to have been on Manus for three months and two months respectively, a source close to the case said. This means it is likely they were transferred under Kevin Rudd&rsquo;s so-called PNG solution.</p> <p>It is understood that one did not give his age when he was interviewed on Christmas Island, and was subsequently transferred to Manus, another may have given a false age during interview.</p> <p>Both boys were housed with the adult male population on Manus for a number of days before staff offered them separate accommodation, which they both took.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/boys-kept-in-isolation-at-manus-island-detention-centre\">Guardian Australia revealed</a> this accommodation meant the boys had their meals brought to them in takeaway food containers and had a video player and a cut down ping pong table but no access to other camp facilities. It is understood that the room they are held in has no air conditioning and is about 20 sq metres.</p> <p>Another source on Manus said the compound had previously served as a kitchen.</p> <p>Both the boys are understood to have stated a desire to attend school but since all family groups were removed from the Manus camp there are no children&rsquo;s educational facilities in the camp. Both have asked to be transferred off Manus.</p> <p>One of the boys has said that he did not want to stay with adults due to a previous trauma involving an adult, one source said.</p> <p>In the past three months the boys have only been allowed out on excursion twice, Guardian Australia understands.</p> <p>One of the boys has attempted self-harm on Manus and was being watched 24 hours a day.</p> <p>Guardian Australia also understands a third transferee on Manus Island, an Iraqi asylum seeker, is claiming to be a minor and authorities are evaluating the claim. This asylum seeker is being held with adults.</p> <p>Guardian Australia has contacted the minister for immigration and border protection for comment but has not received a reply.</p> <p>On Monday, the former immigration minister Tony Burke said that he had intended to transfer unaccompanied minors to Manus &ldquo;but not until appropriate accommodation and services were in place and not until it was clear what arrangements would be made for their resettlement if their claims were upheld.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;Even though as minister my guardianship responsibility did not continue once they were in PNG, it would have been present at the time I decided to send them there and I did not think I could discharge that responsibility unless I knew what principles and arrangements had been made for their resettlement,&rdquo; he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421599152|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|a624cae491ec746c7e51f6dbdbff06c43a943382 -->",

Amid the melee, Morsi and his colleagues rejected the authority of the court before the bedlam forced the presiding judge to adjourn proceedings until 8 January.</p><p>\"What is happening now is a military coup,\" boomed Morsi after arriving in the defendants' cage – his first words in public since 2 July, when he gave a rambling televised speech the night before he was deposed by the army, following days of mass protests in which millions had called for the military to intervene.</p><p>\"I am furious that the Egyptian judiciary should serve as cover for this criminal military coup,\" he continued.</p><p>Following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/egypt-high-alert-mohamed-morsi-trial\" title=\"\">days of uncertainty</a> about whether Morsi would even be allowed to attend, he entered the courtroom shortly after 10am, his 14 colleagues greeting him with a polite round of applause. But proceedings quickly descended into farce, with the defendants' legal team chanting \"the people demand the return of the president\" and flashing a four-fingered \"Rabaa\" salute that has become a calling-card for Morsi supporters. Local journalists responded by shouting \"execution\", a reference to the death penalty some Egyptians hope await Morsi and his allies from the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>Then followed a scrum of journalists, who clambered over the court stalls and pushed past policemen to catch their first glimpse since July of Egypt's first democratically elected president. He appeared well, wearing a tieless dark suit – unlike his fellow defendants, who were clad in white prison tracksuits – and did not appear to have lost weight during his period of incommunicado incarceration. Other defendants had earlier spoken of a more difficult time in prison, with one claiming to journalists from inside the defendants' cage that they had almost all been tortured. The hair of former MP Mohamed Beltagy had turned from black to grey.</p><p>After the room quietened enough to let the presiding judge, Ahmed Sabry Youssef, formally begin proceedings, each defendant rejected the legitimacy of the court – arguing they had been imprisoned on political grounds. \"I am Dr Mohamed Morsi and I am the president of the republic,\" shouted Morsi, when asked to identify himself. \"This coup is a crime and treasonous, and the court is held responsible for it.\"</p><p>Another melee followed, with some journalists and policemen in the courtroom calling Morsi a traitor. One lawyer tried to throw a shoe, while others held up pictures of a reporter who was shot during street clashes last December – violence that Morsi is now accused of inciting.</p><p>Morsi is alleged to have encouraged the murder of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/05/egypt-clashes-protesters-muslim-supporters\" title=\"\">protesters demonstrating outside Cairo's presidential palace last December</a>, charges also faced by the 14 other senior officials from the Muslim Brotherhood. The 15 defendants are accused of ordering hundreds of Brotherhood cadres on 5 December 2012 to attack secular protesters camped outside his presidential palace demanding the abandonment of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/23/morsi-power-grab-angers-opposition\" title=\"\">constitution drafted by Morsi's allies</a>. The confrontation sparked night-long clashes that left at least 11 dead, some of them Brotherhood supporters, and began a spiral of political upheaval that led to the army overthrowing Morsi in July, following days of mass protests.</p><p>Though Morsi and his co-defendants say they were arrested for political reasons resulting from July's regime change, human rights lawyers acting for those who died last December reminded journalists during a break in proceedings that their charges predate Morsi's overthrow.</p><p>\"This is not a case that has been orchestrated,\" said Ragia Omran, a lawyer for the victims' families. \"It's important to note that we filed the charges on 5 December itself.\"</p><p>Pandemonium inside the court on Monday twice forced the trial's adjournment. Each time it reconvened, Morsi made a further speech – speaking aloud four times in total. \"This is not a court,\" he said in his final outburst. \"This court, with all due respect to the people in it, is not specialised to deal with the trial of the president of the republic. This is a coup. I am held against my will. The coup is treasonous and a crime, and I am president of the republic.\"</p><p>The defendants' outburst led to unlikely exchanges between them and Youssef. \"Mohamed, you are not the one running the court,\" the judge told Beltagy, a Muslim Brother who had earlier said he had been held in solitary confinement. \"I am the one running the court.\"</p><p>During Morsi's final outburst, Youssef told the former president \"<em>malesh</em>\" – \"never mind\" – before giving up and leaving the courtroom for good. An official later announced the next session would be on 8 January, and said Morsi would be sent to prison instead of being held incommunicado in a military facility.</p><p>Throughout the session, Morsi refused to recognise the validity of the trial and rejected the right of his lawyer – Selim al-Awa, a prominent figure who also ran for president last year – to represent him. One of the Brotherhood's legal team later grudgingly admitted they would have to engage with the trial.</p><p>\"The defendants don't want to recognise it, but this is the de facto court, and we are going to have to deal with it,\" said Bahaa Abdelrahman, a lawyer acting for Essam el-Arian, the senior Brotherhood official arrested only last week.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421626434|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|da3d2d66016a9f45c3476268715ade05858ae857 -->",

        "body":"<p>A Kenyan court has charged four Somali men   with terrorist offences for helping al-Qaida-linked militants carry out an attack on a shopping mall in Nairobi that killed 67 people.</p><p>All of the men who appeared in court on Monday were formally charged with \"commission of a terrorist act\" under Kenya's anti-terrorism laws. Other accusations ranged from providing support and shelter to the gunmen to using false documents.</p><p>The suspects all pleaded not guilty at the hearing.</p><p>Few details have emerged  about  how the September attack was masterminded or how gunmen held off Kenyan security forces for four days in the Westgate mall. Responsibility for the assault was claimed by the Somali Islamist group al-Shabaab.</p><p>American, British, Israeli and other experts joined Kenyan investigators at the site of the attack, which struck at the heart of east Africa's biggest economy. The west regards Kenya as vital in tsuppressing Islamism in the region.</p><p>The men in court were named as Mohamed Ahmed Abdi, Liban Abdullah Omar and Hussein Hassan, while a fourth was identified as Adan Mohamed Ibrahim, although he was listed as using other aliases.</p><p>Last month, Kenya named four gunmen who took part in the assault. Al-Shabaab said it acted because of Kenya's refusal to withdraw its troops from Somalia, where they are part of a African peacekeeping force battling the militants.</p><p>The court is expected to set a formal date for the start of the trial on 11 November. The men were remanded in custody until then.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421618296|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|f974f5f50ff93bf2a4f6a1cb2e8bd9dd158da998 -->",

        "body":"<p>A landmark bill that would ban workplace discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender people passed a key vote in the US Senate on Monday, relying on support from a few initially reluctant Republicans.</p><p>The procedural vote to move to a Senate debate on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (Enda), viewed as a key test of support for the bill, passed the Senate by 61 votes to 30, one more than required.</p><p>But the prospects of the bill eventually becoming law were dealt a blow when the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, said he did not support it. \"The Speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small business jobs,\" Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said.</p><p>Boehner had previously avoided committing to a position on the legislation, and his opposition was a setback for supporters of the bill.</p><p>Barack Obama strongly supports Enda, and, in an op-ed piece published by the Huffington Post yesterday, said millions of LGBT Americans currently went to work fearful of losing their jobs.</p><p>\"It's offensive. It's wrong. And it needs to stop because, in the United States of America, who you are and who you love should never be a fire-able offence,\" the president wrote.</p><p>Obama compared the battle over Enda to efforts to end discrimination against women and religious and racial minorities. \"Passing Enda would build on the progress we've made in recent years,\" he added. \"When Congress passes it, I will sign it into law, and our nation will be fairer and stronger for generations to come.\"</p><p>The procedural move in the Senate required 60 votes to ensure that conservative Republicans could not block it. In total, seven Republicans joined all the members of the Democratic majority, including three who appeared to hesitate.</p><p>The vote was delayed as Republican senators Kelly Ayotte, Pat Toomey and Rob Portman met in the Republican cloak room, just off the Senate floor, where they were lobbied by the legislation's backers.</p><p>Those involved in the a last-minute attempt to persuade the Republican trio included Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, and his deputy, Chuck Schumer.</p><p>All three Republicans eventually voted for the measure, ensuring it scraped through, after apparently negotiating future amendments in exchange for their support.</p><p>The fact the vote received the backing of moderate Republicans, as well as Democrats from conservative states who in previous years might have felt obliged to vote no, revealed that social attitudes in the US are changing, though slowly.</p><p>Another wavering Republican Senator, Dean Heller, had announced earlier in the day that he would back the bill, which would make it illegal for a firm in any US state to sack an individual because of their gender identity or sexual orientation.</p><p>Heller, a senator from Nevada – which is one of 22 states to have banned workplace discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation – described his decision to support the bill as \"the right thing to do\". He added: \"This legislation raises the federal standards to match what we have come to expect in Nevada, which is that discrimination must not be tolerated under any circumstance.\" The Senate last voted on Enda in 1996, when it failed by one vote.</p><p>The proposed legislation has become a touchstone issue, revealing the fissure between the moderate and more conservative wings of the GOP.</p><p>Gay and transgender advocacy groups consider the bill a critical step towards equal rights in the US. They have had the support of Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who has tried to lobby colleagues to back the bill.</p><p>However, conservative Republicans have expressed discomfort with a bill that would afford new federal rights to gay and transgender people, claiming that, if enacted, the law would enable unwarranted lawsuits. A recent study by the Government Accountability Office – the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of Congress – found the existing state-level anti-discrimination laws had led to \"relatively few\" legal actions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421667733|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|c7cef8845b04924e60f427f026e6d0482d4be278 -->",

        "body":"<p>Former NSW MP Carl Scully has described Eddie Obeid's behaviour in hiding his retail interests as \"quasi-criminal\", but insists he does not hate the man who thwarted his attempt to become premier.</p> <p>Scully appeared before the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) as investigations continued on Tuesday into whether Obeid lobbied state ministers to have retail leases at Circular Quay renewed without going to tender.</p> <p>Scully told the commission that Obeid was furious with him when he turned down his request for a five-year extension to a lease held by Tony Imad.</p> <p>It has since emerged that Imad's businesses were bought by an Obeid front company in 2002, with relative John Aboud acting as the public face.</p> <p>Scully denied a claim by Obeid's lawyer, Stuart Littlemore, that much of his evidence was untrue and was borne of hate for the disgraced former minister.</p> <p>Scully and Obeid both belonged to Labor's Terrigal faction, but their friendly relationship soured when the powerful cabal backed Morris Iemma's bid for the premiership.</p> <p>\"No. He was one of a number of people that secured the election of Morris Iemma but I think `hate' is the wrong word,\" Scully said.</p> <p>Like all previous ministers appearing before the Icac, Scully said Obeid never revealed his family's hidden interests in two restaurants and cafe at the quay, which earned the family about $2.5m annually.</p> <p>\"I regard that as quasi-criminal,\" Scully said.</p> <p>Scully was ultimately in charge of the leases as ports minister from April 1995 to December 1997 and again from April 1999 to April 2003.</p> <p>Five-year leases were signed in 2000, with the understanding expressions of interest would be sought when they ran out in August 2005.</p> <p>But the inquiry heard Obeid asked Scully for a five-year extension on a lease held by Imad after documents were signed and a lengthy process, including Icac approval, had been undertaken.</p> <p>\"He said ... `he's spent a lot of money in doing the shop up and a five-year lease is not long enough',\" Scully said.</p> <p>\"[I said] `It's not going to happen' and then I said, `and besides Tony Imad's a crook'.\"</p> <p>Obeid then became \"very angry\" and upset and screamed \"Tony Imad's not a crook ... he's a hard-working small business family man,\" Scully said.</p> <p>The inquiry, which continues before Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy, is expected to last another two weeks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421668573|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|4ea6646f6028cd0435e72ee65a9b177b75bdf0e1 -->",

        "headline":"CIA made doctors torture suspected terrorists after 9/11, taskforce finds",
        "body":"<p>Doctors and psychologists working for the US military violated the ethical codes of their profession under instruction from the defence department and the CIA to become involved in the torture and degrading treatment of suspected terrorists, an investigation has concluded.</p><p>The report of the Taskforce on Preserving Medical Professionalism in National Security Detention Centres concludes that after 9/11, health professionals working with the military and intelligence services \"designed and participated in cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment and torture of detainees\".</p><p>Medical professionals were in effect told that their ethical mantra \"first do no harm\" did not apply, because they were not treating people who were ill.</p><p>The report lays blame primarily on the defence department (DoD) and the CIA, which required their healthcare staff to put aside any scruples in the interests of intelligence gathering and security practices that caused severe harm to detainees, from waterboarding to sleep deprivation and force-feeding.</p><p>The two-year review by the 19-member taskforce, Ethics Abandoned: Medical Professionalism and Detainee Abuse in the War on Terror, supported by the <a href=\"http://www.imapny.org/medicine_as_a_profession/interrogationtorture-and-dual-loyalty\">Institute on Medicine as a Profession (IMAP)</a> and the Open Society Foundations, says that the DoD termed those involved in interrogation \"safety officers\" rather than doctors. Doctors and nurses were required to participate in the force-feeding of prisoners on hunger strike, against the rules of the World Medical Association and the American Medical Association. Doctors and psychologists working for the DoD were required to breach patient confidentiality and share what they knew of the prisoner's physical and psychological condition with interrogators and were used as interrogators themselves. They also failed to comply with recommendations from the army surgeon general on reporting abuse of detainees.</p><p>The CIA's office of medical services played a critical role in advising the justice department that \"enhanced interrogation\" methods, such as extended sleep deprivation and waterboarding, which are recognised as forms of torture, were medically acceptable. CIA medical personnel were present when waterboarding was taking place, the taskforce says.</p><p>Although the DoD has taken steps to address concerns over practices at Guantánamo Bay in recent years, and the CIA has said it no longer has suspects in detention, the taskforce says that these \"changed roles for health professionals and anaemic ethical standards\" remain.</p><p>\"The American public has a right to know that the covenant with its physicians to follow professional ethical expectations is firm regardless of where they serve,\" said Dr Gerald Thomson, professor of medicine emeritus at Columbia University and member of the taskforce.</p><p>He added: \"It's clear that in the name of national security the military trumped that covenant, and physicians were transformed into agents of the military and performed acts that were contrary to medical ethics and practice. We have a responsibility to make sure this never happens again.\"The taskforce says that unethical practices by medical personnel, required by the military, continue today. The DoD \"continues to follow policies that undermine standards of professional conduct\" for interrogation, hunger strikes, and reporting abuse. Protocols have been issued requiring doctors and nurses to participate in the force-feeding of detainees, including forced extensive bodily restraints for up to two hours twice a day.</p><p>Doctors are still required to give interrogators access to medical and psychological information about detainees which they can use to exert pressure on them. Detainees are not permitted to receive treatment for the distress caused by their torture.</p><p>\"Putting on a uniform does not and should not abrogate the fundamental principles of medical professionalism,\" said IMAP president David Rothman. \"'Do no harm' and 'put patient interest first' must apply to all physicians regardless of where they practise.\"The taskforce wants a full investigation into the involvement of the medical profession in detention centres. It is also calling for publication of the Senate intelligence committee's inquiry into CIA practices and wants rules to ensure doctors and psychiatrists working for the military are allowed to abide by the ethical obligations of their profession; they should be prohibited from taking part in interrogation, sharing information from detainees' medical records with interrogators, or participating in force-feeding, and they should be required to report abuse of detainees.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421563159|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|a9e1558268b2b5a0db9836f9cd8ca75b6c6b4684 -->",

        "body":"<p>Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, has attacked the US government for apparently breaking into the connections that link the company's data centres around the world as \"outrageous\" and described other surveillance practices as \"possibly illegal\".</p><p>Speaking at an event in Hong Kong, Schmidt stepped up the company's response to revelations in the Washington Post that the National Security Agency, working with its British counterpart, GCHQ, had broken into fibre optic cables that carry the transfer of data around the world for Google and Yahoo.</p><p>\"It's really outrageous that the National Security Agency was looking between the Google data centers, if that's true,\" Schmidt <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/11/04/googles-schmidt-on-nsa-china-and-north-korea/\">told the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>\"The steps that the organization was willing to do without good judgment to pursue its mission and potentially violate people's privacy, it's not OK.\"</p><p>The comments reflected Silicon Valley's hardening criticism of government snooping amid continued revelations based on documents leaked by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</p><p>Just two months ago,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/eric-schmidt-google-nsa-surveillance\"> Schmidt declined</a> to \"pass judgment\" on the surveillance programmes.</p><p>But last week it was reported that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-reports-nsa-secretly-intercepts-data-links\">NSA intercepted communications</a> links used by Google and Yahoo to move vast amounts of data between overseas data centres.</p><p>On Monday, the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/04/how-we-know-the-nsa-had-access-to-internal-google-and-yahoo-cloud-data/\">published further Snowden documents</a> and additional context for its story. Among the details published in the latest report is the claim the interception took place on \"British territory\".</p><p>It also claimed that none of the statements issued by the NSA since the story was published contained substantive denials. It said the source documents showed the NSA, rather than break directly into Google or Yahoo data centres, intercepted communication between them that ran on private fibre optic cable circuits. The former is known as \"data at rest\", the latter as \"data on the fly\".</p><p>It was clear spies broke into both companies' private \"clouds\", or internal networks, said the report, because some of the extracted data existed nowhere else.</p><p>It remained unclear how the NSA did this, and whether it had help from inside the technology giants.</p><p>Asked if it had launched an internal security review, Google on Monday reissued a statement given last week from chief legal officer David Drummond, saying the company did not give access to its systems to any government and that it was expanding encryption across more Google services and links.</p><p>In his interview, Schmidt said Google had lodged complaints with the NSA, the White House and members of Congress. He also attacked the separate NSA program that sweeps up the telephone metadata relating millions of Americans. \"The NSA allegedly collected the phone records of 320 million people in order to identify roughly 300 people who might be a risk. It's just bad public policy … and perhaps illegal,\" he said.</p><p>Google itself has faced repeated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/19/google-privacy-laws-uk-lawsuit\">accusations of privacy violations</a>, including illicitly tracking web browsing. </p><p>Schmidt has made no secret that the company tests boundaries of what is acceptable. \"Google policy is to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it,\" he said in 2010.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/germany-edward-snowden-asylum\">Outcries in Europe </a>and growing momentum in Washington to rein in surveillance has put the NSA on the defensive.</p><p>Asked to respond to Schmidt's criticism, an NSA spokesperson said the agency was \"focused on valid foreign intelligence targets\" and referred to a previous statement that press articles had misstated facts and mischaracterised NSA activities.</p><p>\"NSA conducts all of its activities in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies – and assertions to the contrary do a grave disservice to the nation, its allies and partners, and the men and women who make up the National Security Agency.\"</p><p>Last week the agency's director, General Keith Alexander, said the agency had not used a presidential order to circumvent domestic legal restrictions: \"I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers. We go through a court order.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421648807|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|d03fea628a7b3113b06d9840f44f9143292f44c5 -->",

        "body":"<p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, who is meeting Israeli and Palestinian leaders separately in the Middle East this week, is preparing to table a plan to push forward stagnating peace talks between the two sides, according to reports.</p><p>Although negotiations resumed more than three months ago, with 15 meetings clocked up so far, American officials are concerned there is no sign of real movement or a breakthrough, with both sides restating established positions. A US proposal, likely to be presented in the new year, would be aimed at injecting impetus.</p><p>The reports come as Palestinian dismay over Israeli settlement expansion is mounting, and as the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is insisting that any peace agreement must include a continued Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley, a strip of the West Bank along the border with Jordan.</p><p>Israel is also pressing ahead with plans to build a steel security barrier along the border with Jordan, the last remaining section of Israel's perimeter that is not fenced. It is not clear whether the fence would continue inside the West Bank to create an Israeli-controlled buffer zone between Palestinian and Jordanian territory.</p><p>Netanyahu told cabinet colleagues on Sunday that an Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley was paramount. \"First and foremost, the security border of the state of Israel will remain along the Jordan River,\" he said.</p><p>According to an Israeli member of parliament, the US is preparing to table a blueprint for peace. Zahava Gal-On, leader of the leftwing Meretz party, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.556168\" title=\"\">told Haaretz</a> the plan would \"include all the core issues and will be based on the 1967 lines, with agreed-on land swaps. The plan will include a gradual timetable for implementation and will also address the dimension of regional peace based on the Arab peace initiative as a basis for renewed talks. It will also include an economic plan to invest billions in the Palestinian economy.\"  The 2002 Arab peace initiative  was a plan for Arab countries to make peace with Israel in return for a Palestinian state.</p><p>The US had moved from \"third party trying to bring the two sides together, to a role of direct involvement in the process\", Gal-On added in a statement.</p><p>Israel's army radio said Kerry was working on a plan similar to the Clinton parameters, guidelines set out by the former US president in 2000 as a basis for negotiations. The secretary of state reportedly informed Netanyahu of his intentions during a seven-hour meeting in Rome two weeks ago.</p><p>The Clinton parameters called for a demilitarised Palestinian state on about 95% of the West Bank with compensatory land swaps, the incorporation of the main settlement blocks into Israel, a temporary international presence in the Jordan Valley, and Palestinian refugees being compensated and permitted to return to their new state. Jerusalem would be shared as the capital of both states.</p><p>US officials have taken a more proactive role in recent negotiating sessions, scheduled to last until the spring. Despite little sign of compromise, both sides are anxious to avoid blame for the failure of negotiations. To that end, the parties have thus far stuck to their pre-talks commitments: Israel by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/30/tension-israelis-26-palestinian-prisoners-release\" title=\"\">releasing a second batch</a> of long-term Palestinian prisoners last week, and the Palestinians by refraining from signing up to international bodies and treaties.</p><p>But Israel's announcement last week of more than 1,700 new homes in East Jerusalem and West Bank settlements  prompted the Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, to offer his resignation, a move rejected by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. The Palestinians have also threatened to demand that international bodies declare settlement construction a <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinians-threaten-international-legal-action-over-Israeli-settlement-construction-330274\" title=\"\">war crime</a>.</p><p>Netanyahu dismissed the complaints, saying: \"The Palestinians knew that we would build in the course of the negotiations. This was a clear part of the start of the negotiations, and they were told clearly that Israel would not put any restriction on construction during this period. All the Palestinian allegations that this is a violation are an attempt to create an artificial crisis. Israel has met all the commitments that it has undertaken.\"</p><p>Speaking in Cairo, Kerry said the Israeli announcement had \"disturbed people's perceptions of whether or not people are serious and are moving in the right direction\".</p><p>Israel's outgoing national security adviser, <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4449105,00.html\" title=\"\">Ya'akov Amidror</a>, said the failure of the talks would increase Israel's international isolation. \"It is clear to everyone that handling international pressure depends on the progress of the negotiations, and if the talks fail, it will give everyone interested in boycotting us every reason to do so,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421629672|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|357fc95a2f2bf7fc3b0d06d9a559e362f095e76f -->",

        "body":"<p>The high court will hear the Commonwealth&rsquo;s challenge to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government&rsquo;s same sex marriage laws in a two-day hearing set for the first week of December.</p> <p>The dates were set at a directions hearing in Canberra on Monday afternoon, where Chief Justice Robert French ruled that the full bench would hear the landmark case on 3 and 4 December &ndash; just a few days before the new same sex marriage law takes effect in Canberra.</p> <p>The Abbott government sought and was granted an expedited hearing in a case which will determine whether or not same sex marriages can take place in the ACT under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/22/same-sex-marriage-gay-rights-canberra-politics-australia\">new laws</a> passed by the legislative assembly last month.</p> <p>In October, the ACT became the first jurisdiction in Australia to legalise same sex marriage.</p> <p>The ACT ultimately agreed to the expedited hearing dates set by the chief justice on Monday, but first put forward an argument in the directions hearing that there was no constitutional issue to be considered. The territory said it was a matter of statutory interpretation whether the new ACT law could work concurrently with the Commonwealth Marriage Act and the Family Law Act.</p> <p>Chief Justice French suggested it was of interest to state governments whether or not the Commonwealth had sole powers to regulate marriage. NSW is currently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/31/same-sex-marriage-debate-in-nsw-parliament-live\">considering</a> a same sex marriage bill, with debate on that proposal expected to resume on 14 November.</p> <p>The ACT government confirmed on Monday afternoon that the high court hearings would be concluded before the first marriages could legally occur in Canberra.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the ACT attorney-general, Simon Corbell, told Guardian Australia: &ldquo;The matter has been set down for hearing on 3 and 4 December.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;The Marriage Equality (Same Sex) Act 2013 has been notified on the ACT legislation register today, and the minister has signed the instrument which allows the act to commence on 7 November,&rdquo; the spokeswoman said.</p> <p>&ldquo;This means that the earliest date that marriages under this act could occur is 8 December.&rdquo;</p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/25/high-court-could-rule-on-act-same-sex-marriage-in-early-december\">first directions hearing</a> last month, the Commonwealth said it was working on a timetable that the new territory law would take effect from 7 December.</p> <p>Final confirmation of the expedited process is a blow for same sex marriage advocates in Canberra, although it is not yet clear when the court intends to hand down its judgment in the case, and the ACT government insists the bill has at least a prospect of surviving the current Commonwealth challenge.</p> <p>Regardless of what happens with the high court process, the issue of same sex marriage will come back before the new federal parliament in the form of a private member&rsquo;s bill.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Liberal party frontbencher Malcolm Turnbull repeated his preference that the Coalition be granted a conscience vote on this question. Turnbull told the Ten Network: &ldquo;My view, as you know, is that we should have a free vote, and if we do agree to have a free vote, I will vote in favour of same-sex marriage.&rdquo;</p> <p>The prime minister has a conservative view of marriage, but has said repeatedly if the issue returns to the new federal parliament then the Coalition party room will determine how to proceed.</p> <p>While many MPs on all sides of the political divide favour ending discrimination against same sex couples, it is unclear, even with a conscience vote, whether a majority in the new federal parliament would support a change in the law.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421592189|2013-11-05T11:25:05Z|72685c6e0bee972b1283d9ea8109f0575712df46 -->",
