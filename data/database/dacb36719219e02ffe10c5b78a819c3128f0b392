        "body":"<p>Former attorney general Nicola Roxon has unleashed on Kevin Rudd &ndash; contending he was a &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; who deserved the political bastardry inflicted on him by his Labor colleagues in 2010.</p> <p>Roxon used the John Button lecture in Melbourne on Wednesday night to deliver an extraordinary public evisceration of Rudd, covering both his period as prime minister and the period he spent out of the leadership campaigning with caucus supporters to get it back.</p> <p>The Kevin Rudd described by Roxon ran chaotic policy development processes, stifled cabinet collaboration and abused staff and senior officials &ndash; calling the then New South Wales premier Kristina Keneally &ldquo;Bambi&rdquo; behind her back.</p> <p>She said Rudd had a &ldquo;fatal attraction to everyone else&rsquo;s problems&rdquo; but displayed little inclination or aptitude for implementation. The former prime minister, Roxon said, was &ldquo;great at the cut through and then struggled at the follow through&rdquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;Removing Kevin was an act of political bastardry, for sure, but this act of political bastardry was made possible only because Kevin had been such a bastard himself to too many people,&rdquo; Roxon said in the lecture.</p> <p>She said Rudd had always treated her &ldquo;appropriately and respectfully. Although I was frustrated beyond belief by his disorganisation and lack of strategy, I was never personally a victim of his vicious tongue or temper.</p> <p>&ldquo;I did, however, see how terribly he treated some brilliant staff and public servants. Good people were burnt through like wildfire.&rdquo;</p> <p>Roxon&rsquo;s remarks were part of a more wide-ranging intervention about the lessons Labor should learn from its period in government.</p> <p>She said the party needed to be able to tolerate dissent and discussion, to give up the close reads of opinion polls, to run orderly processes, to understand the purpose of power &ndash; which relied on having the skills to implement a progressive policy agenda. &ldquo;We can want power but we have to want it for a purpose,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have to know how to use that power well and to full effect.&rdquo;</p> <p>Roxon was a strong supporter of Julia Gillard. She fell out with Rudd during the period when she was health minister and tried to implement national reforms to public hospitals.</p> <p>She has publicly criticised Rudd before, and made it clear during the course of Labor&rsquo;s rolling leadership debate that she would never contemplate serving in his cabinet again.</p> <p>But in the Button lecture on Wednesday, she was not only critical of Rudd, she was self-critical, and critical of colleagues for not applying more pressure to achieve more effective internal governance.</p> <p>Roxon argued Labor should have been more candid with the voters about the dysfunction within the government that preceded the leadership coup in 2010. This failure of candour meant Labor paid a high price when voters could not comprehend what had happened. It also inflicted damage on Rudd, and on Gillard, she said.</p> <p>&ldquo;Although at the time it seemed unimaginable to contemplate being so rude to your own PM, with the benefit of hindsight some of us should have spoken out, if not before, at least immediately afterwards,&rdquo; Roxon said.</p> <p>&ldquo;We made a brutal decision and then shied away from the brutal explanation that was needed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We left everyone looking for answers and, by doing this, I think we did a great disservice to Kevin and Julia.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;On its own it would have cast a long shadow over the next three years in government and with active fanning by Kevin and his supporters it proved impossible to recover from.&rdquo;</p> <p>She said Rudd should leave the parliament to ensure the next generation of Labor leaders and MPs had a fair go. &ldquo;I believe we also must confront the bitter truth that as long as Kevin remains in parliament, irrespective of how he behaves, pollsters will run comparisons with him and any other leader.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;In my opinion, and it is only my opinion, for the good of the federal parliamentary Labor party and the movement as a whole, Kevin Rudd should leave the parliament &ndash; otherwise the action of any Labor leader will always be tested through the prism of popularity compared to him.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420116935|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|a4599b9c2ea17c2e90b45906376cae826c287516 -->",

        "headline":"US warned of credit downgrade as Republicans inch closer to the brink",
        "body":"<p>A leading ratings agency put the US on notice of a downgrade on Tuesday amid political turmoil in Washington over how to resolve the budget crisis less than a day before the country's borrowing requirement expires.</p><p>Fitch warned that the political battle \"risks undermining confidence in the role of the US dollar as the pre-eminent global reserve currency, by casting doubt over the full faith and credit of the US.\"</p><p>The White House seized on the announcement, saying that it demonstrated the urgency of reaching a deal.</p><p>But senior Republicans in the House of Representatives inched further to the brink on Tuesday night when they abandoned a planned vote on a so-called continuing resolution, which would have extended the debt ceiling and reopened the federal government, when it became clear the they could not muster enough votes.</p><p>A day that ended in turmoil began with recriminations when the House initially rejected a fragile bipartisan deal that emerged from the Senate on Monday night. That deal would have extended the debt limit and authorised government spending with only one token concession over healthcare.</p><p>The House speaker, John Boehner, then floated an alternative compromise that would have, in addition, delayed a new tax on medical devices designed to help pay for the Affordable Care Act and deprive lawmakers of any personal health insurance subsidies. That succeeded only in inflaming conservatives in his own party, who regarded the House and Senate compromises as surrender, and Democrats who accused Boehner of introducing unacceptable new \"ransom demands\".</p><p>Boehner acceded to rightwing demands to drop the medical device tax provision, which was seen as benefiting only health equipment manufacturers, and retained the proposal to cut healthcare from congressional and White House staff, which amounted to an $18,000-a-year pay cut for most employees. The resolution got as far as being published on the House rules committee website. </p><p>But the plan collapsed in the face of sustained conservative opposition. Heritage Action, a conservative group that holds Republican candidates accountable to Tea Party-backed causes, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fheritageaction.com%2Fkey-votes%2Fkey-vote-no-on-house-spending-and-debt-deal%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIOhATopLhkBoQEBKbT8PeqdObXw\">announced that it would mark down Republicans</a> who voted in favour of the resolution. Support from House Republicans melted away and Boehner postponed the vote. </p><p>Shortly before 6:30pm, with House Republicans in disarray, a succession of senior party figures arrived for crisis talks in Boehner's office. It looked set to be a long meeting; congressional staffers were spotted delivering boxes of pizza.</p><p>Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader in the House, earlier held the speaker personally to blame for bowing to pressure from his conservative wing. \"I am very disappointed with John Boehner, who is trying to preserve his role at the expense of the country,\" he said.</p><p>House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said the Republican plan \"sabotages a good-faith, bipartisan effort by the Senate and is a luxury our country cannot afford\". Her chief whip Steny Hoyer claimed Republicans wanted to \"snatch confrontation from the jaws of reasonable agreement\".</p><p>The White House also emphatically rejected the new Republican approach.</p><p>\"The president has said repeatedly that members of Congress don't get to demand ransom for fulfilling their basic responsibilities to pass a budget and pay the nation's bills. Unfortunately, the latest proposal from House Republicans does just that, in a partisan attempt to appease a small group of Tea Party Republicans who forced the government shutdown in the first place,\" spokeswoman Amy Brundage said in a statement.</p><p>\"Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have been working in a bipartisan, good-faith effort to end the manufactured crises that have already harmed American families and business owners,\" she continued. \"With only a couple days remaining until the United States exhausts its borrowing authority, it's time for the House to do the same.\"</p><p>As the wrangling continued in Washington, Fitch said it had reached its conclusion because of the increased possibility that the US will not reach a deal on its debt ceiling before 17 October, when Treasury secretary Jack Lew has said the US will run out of cash. \"Although Fitch continues to believe that the debt ceiling will be raised soon, the political brinkmanship and reduced financing flexibility could increase the risk of a US default,\" said Fitch.</p><p>The agency's move came as US investors appear to be increasingly nervous that the impasse in Washington could lead the US to default on its obligations for the first time in history. The Dow fell 133.25 points or 0.87% to end the day down after a brief rally when it appeared a breakthrough had been made.</p><p>In 2011, Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded US debt as Democrats and Republicans argued once more about the debt ceiling. The move came amid sharp selloffs on stock markets around the world. </p><p>\"The repeated brinkmanship over raising the debt ceiling also dents confidence in the effectiveness of the US government and political institutions, and in the coherence and credibility of economic policy. It will also have some detrimental effect on the US economy,\" said Fitch.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420074721|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|014a3ca15230e7ae3298c02992cfecbd3d41b380 -->",

        "body":"<p>An Australian intelligence agency has been collecting thousands of private email and chat contact lists in its attempts to assist the NSA, new leaks about the US spy agency&rsquo;s snooping capabilities have revealed.</p> <p>The latest information leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden to the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html\">Washington Post</a> has revealed extensive collecting of private contact lists and address books from email and instant messaging accounts, a program that was previously undisclosed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/the-nsas-overcollection-problem/517/\">leaked document</a> &ndash; a PowerPoint presentation on &ldquo;content acquisition optimisation&rdquo; &ndash; explains how the NSA can address the challenge of having too much data from its interceptions and those from the &ldquo;five-eyes&rdquo; partner agencies in Australia, Britain, Canada, and New Zealand.</p> <p>One slide states that &ldquo;the NSA collects, on a representative day, ~ 500,000 buddy lists and inboxes&rdquo;.</p> <p>More than 250m address books are gathered every year, collected &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; as they are transmitted.</p> <p>On a single day used as an example, the address book haul included 444,743 from Yahoo, 105,068 from Hotmail, 82,857 from Facebook, 33,697 from Gmail and 22,881 from other providers. A third of them came from an Australian Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) search.</p> <p>A case study of the email account of an Iranian target was mined by the DSD on behalf of the NSA.</p> <p>The Washington Post reported that these lists could provide greater personal detail than phone records, and often included some message content. But because of the vast network created by address book contacts it could also create false representations of associations between people.</p> <p>As with previous revelations about the NSA&rsquo;s surveillance programs, authorities gave some justification that their searches concentrated on overseas targets. An anonymous official told the newspaper that when information passes through the data collection program, &ldquo;the assumption is you&rsquo;re not a US person&rdquo;.</p> <p>A spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.dni.gov/index.php\">Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a>, which oversees the NSA, told the Washington Post that the NSA &ldquo;is focused on discovering and developing intelligence about valid foreign intelligence targets like terrorists, human traffickers and drug smugglers. We are not interested in personal information about ordinary Americans.&rdquo;</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the attorney general told Fairfax media that all Australian agency interceptions were in accordance with Australian law. ''Our intelligence agencies operate under a strong legal and oversight framework,&rdquo; she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420108181|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|d4f8220f4fae8c9b241fac3c892fb341027f5bc9 -->",

        "body":"<p>It would be a normal state of affairs for an incoming government to meet one of the most influential players in the international and local media, particularly one who took a close personal interest in the outcome of Australia&rsquo;s recent political contest.</p> <p>But neither Tony Abbott nor his communications spokesman, Malcolm Turnbull, will say whether they plan to meet the News Corp chairman, Rupert Murdoch, while the media mogul is in Australia over the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>The prime minister&rsquo;s office declined to comment on Wednesday when asked by Guardian Australia if a post-election catch-up was on the agenda. A spokesman for Turnbull also declined to comment about whether a meeting had been scheduled.</p> <p>Murdoch generally makes a point of meeting prime ministers and opposition leaders, politicians he regards as up and comers, and relevant portfolio ministers from Australia&rsquo;s major political parties during his frequent visits to Australia, and when politicians travel to New York.</p> <p>The News Corp chairman publicly backed Tony Abbott&rsquo;s bid for the prime ministership in 2013 &ndash; and there was considerable political controversy during the campaign about coverage by the News Corp tabloids.</p> <p>During the campaign Kevin Rudd declared that Murdoch was intent on achieving a change of government in Australia. Abbott advised Rudd to stop complaining about media coverage.</p> <p>Abbott&rsquo;s deputy, Julie Bishop, contended that Rudd had &ldquo;lost the plot&rdquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually worried about Kevin Rudd's state of mind. He seems to be descending into some dark world of conspiracies where everybody&rsquo;s against him and it&rsquo;s led by Rupert Murdoch,&rdquo; she told the ABC.</p> <p>In a piece for the online publication <a href=\"http://inside.org.au/rupert-murdochs-sixtieth-anniversary/\">Inside Story</a> on Wednesday, the University of Sydney media academic Rodney Tiffen remarked of the election campaign and transition to government, that Murdoch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Australian newspapers are celebrating the election of Tony Abbott, which some of them, notably Sydney&rsquo;s Daily Telegraph, campaigned for with as much bias as Murdoch&rsquo;s papers showed when they opposed Gough Whitlam&rsquo;s government in 1975.</p> <p>&ldquo;But what they displayed more than anything during that campaign was how little sense they have of either a business or professional strategy to meet the challenges of shrinking circulations.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420103065|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|f174000fe6401ebc841e6189f7874bd1bb21d69b -->",

A week later an addition to his pecuniary interests ledger showed that Randall and his wife had taken ownership of a Cairns investment property.</p> <p>When questioned by Fairfax, and given a day to respond, the MP&rsquo;s office declined to comment.</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon Randall told Guardian Australia in a statement: &ldquo;The claims relating to travel were appropriately acquitted with the Department of Finance.&rdquo;</p> <p>Further expense claims include an October 2012 study tour to Sri Lanka for Randall and his wife, at a cost of $28,408 including a $2,135 phone bill, a trip to Melbourne and back to Perth, and thousands of dollars spent on books.</p> <p>The books, some of which were bought in multiple copies, included children&rsquo;s cookbooks, travel books, the Guinness World Records, a guide to Broadway musicals and six copies of former prime minister John Howard&rsquo;s Lazarus Rising.</p> <p>&ldquo;In relation to the purchase of books, these were under entitlement and were purchased as gifts for community groups and schools in my electorate,&rdquo; Randall said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420092135|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|32d8c54d18c4ee95ad98f5749c606b135c4b1cb3 -->",

        "body":"<p>The federal government&rsquo;s contentious plan to devolve power for environmental assessments has won enthusiastic backing from the Liberal-run states.</p> <p>Greg Hunt, the environment minister, wants to create &ldquo;one stop shops&rdquo; to assess the ecological impact of major projects such as coal mines and ports.</p> <p>Hunt said: &ldquo;I have spoken to ministers from all six states and have been heartened by their response but will leave each minister to speak for themselves.</p> <p>&ldquo;The government will work with each state across the country progressively to strike agreements to reach a national one-stop shop scheme.&rdquo;</p> <p>This system, which the government claims will &ldquo;slash red tape and increase jobs and investment&rdquo;, will be run by the states. Currently, major projects have to be approved by the states and the federal government, under its <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/%20\">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act </a>obligations.</p> <p>The Coalition said there should be one process for environmental assessments, with a single lodgment and documentation portal. Local government will also be encouraged to be involved in the process.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the government said it had approved the framework for the new regime, which will require agreement with the states. Federal staff will be sent to help states with the implementation of the new set-up.</p> <p>Memorandums of understanding will be signed with &ldquo;willing&rdquo; states. The government aims to then strike agreements on assessments within 12 months.</p> <p>Queensland has already signed a draft memorandum of understanding, while New South Wales is set to be the next to commit.</p> <p>Robyn Parker, the NSW environment minister, said: &ldquo;The NSW premier recently met with the prime minister to advance the development of the MOU to establish a one-stop-shop for environmental approvals.</p> <p>&ldquo;NSW is committed to addressing the issues of duplication and welcomes minister Hunt&rsquo;s release of the framework to streamline this process.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Victorian government said it was &ldquo;looking forward&rdquo; to discussing the new system with Hunt, while Western Australia is also enthusiastic. Albert Jacob, the state&rsquo;s environment minister, told Guardian Australia that he &ldquo;welcomed&rdquo; a plan that would &ldquo;streamline the current system which unnecessarily duplicates the rigorous approvals processes undertaken by the state.&rdquo;</p> <p>He added: &ldquo;We are committed to working with the commonwealth on cooperative efforts to strengthen intergovernmental cooperation on the environment and to minimise costs to business while maintaining high environmental standards.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Labor-run Tasmanian government said it supports streamlining &ldquo;cumbersome environment regulation&rdquo;, although South Australia, where Labor is also in power, is less enamored by the idea. A spokesman for the South Australian government told Guardian Australia that the state was &ldquo;seeking more information&rdquo; on the plan before committing to it.</p> <p>The Greens and conservation groups are highly critical of the plan to devolve powers, claiming that the states can&rsquo;t be trusted to safeguard the environment.</p> <p>&ldquo;Prime minister Abbott is pushing ahead with his destruction of federal environment protection to leave national icons like the Great Barrier Reef in the hands of his environmentally negligent state cronies,&rdquo; said Senator Larissa Waters, the Greens&rsquo; environment spokeswoman.</p> <p>&ldquo;Prime minister Abbott is set to go down in history as not only a climate criminal but an environmental vandal.</p> <p>&ldquo;The duplication argument that Mr Abbott and his big business buddies are pushing as justification for his environmental vandalism is a complete furphy.</p> <p>&ldquo;In all states and territories, governments have already established streamlined environmental assessment processes where one set of environmental assessment documents counts for both the state and federal levels.&rdquo;</p> <p>Business groups are more favourable towards the plan. Maria Tarrant, deputy chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, said the one-stop shops will provide certainty for projects.</p> <p>&ldquo;The government is to be commended for progressing this reform in a timely manner within a robust framework,&rdquo; she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420094283|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|a7dcad3100f51a6d5dae9d5130d71f75adab9e7d -->",

        "body":"<p>More than 65,000 vulnerable Australians are being turned away by food relief charities every month because there is not enough to go around, with the majority being low-income families rather than unemployed or homeless people.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.foodbank.org.au/hunger-in-australia/the-endhunger-report/\">End Hunger Report 2013</a>, conducted by Deloitte Access Economics, surveyed about 900 welfare agencies which receive food from <a href=\"http://www.foodbank.org.au/\">Foodbank</a> &ndash; a not-for-profit organisation which gathers and distributes safe but unsellable food products donated by retailers, restaurants and other companies.</p> <p>Their findings show that every month more than 65,000 Australians &ndash; half of them children &ndash; seek food relief at one of the country&rsquo;s numerous charities but get nothing. Of those who do receive aid, two thirds do not get as much as they need.</p> <p>The organisation&rsquo;s first End Hunger report in 2012 found that Australia does not satisfy the United Nations World Food Summit&rsquo;s basic definition of &ldquo;food security&rdquo;, and the situation has worsened this year, with a 9% increase in people seeking help.</p> <p>The CEO of Foodbank NSW, Gerry Anderson, who describes his organisation as &ldquo;the pantry of the welfare sector&rdquo;, said those going empty-handed included people who physically turned up to aid agencies seeking help, but had to be turned away. Others were unable to join already overstretched registration-based assistance programmes.</p> <p>The majority of those needing help are low-income families, where the parent or parents are employed but do not make enough money to cover housing costs, bills, food and other expenses.</p> <p>&ldquo;Those type of families, they live from payday to payday and any little event or misadventure, like the car breaking down or the child having to go to hospital &hellip; that tips them over the edge and that&rsquo;s when they come to us for help,&rdquo; Anderson told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Over the last ten years the net worth of low-income households has fallen by 3.6%, further widening the gap with the average Australian household, which saw an increase of 22.2% over the same period.</p> <p>The report found 80% of agencies were unable to meet demand, blaming insufficient funding or a lack of food, almost 60% of which is provided by Foodbank.</p> <p>&ldquo;Foodbank services the welfare agencies who are then frontline,&rdquo; said Anderson.</p> <p>Reverend Cain Pennell runs one of these frontline services, Food Shed, from the Enmore church of the Nazarene in Sydney&rsquo;s inner west. Pennell told Guardian Australia that while they are not having to turn people away yet, the organisation could only sustain a dozen or so extra people per week before they would begin running out of food &ndash; all of which they currently received from Foodbank.</p> <p>&ldquo;We began a food shed out the back of our church to be able to provide access for people to cheap food and to be an agency for helping people,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>&ldquo;I do suspect that if trends continue, and we continue to get a high demand for our services then we simply won&rsquo;t be able to provide enough food for all the people who want to come.&rdquo;</p> <p>Most of Food Shed&rsquo;s visitors are low income families. Pennell said they get few if any homeless.</p> <p>&ldquo;One lady in particular, drove past us and saw our sign, stopped in and was extremely grateful and almost brought to tears by the fact that she could now have the ability to be able to pay some of those bills,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>&ldquo;She has a permanent part-time job, makes only about $500 a week but her rent is about $250 a week. She was struggling to pay for all the things she needed just to survive.&rdquo;</p> <p>Pennell echoed the calls made by Foodbank for greater government assistance of welfare agencies.</p> <p>In the report&rsquo;s opening message, Enzo Allara, Foodbank chairman, wrote: &ldquo;We need a national policy agenda to address this insidious and destructive problem. Foodbank and our partners in the welfare sector stand ready to work with the government to address the issue of food insecurity in Australia in a meaningful and comprehensive way.&ldquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420092062|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|95999bdee3ded97051603069cd042d8f1cf79547 -->",

Claims that he had been poisoned by Israel swiftly took hold among Palestinians, who revered Arafat as a resistance leader.</p><p>No postmortem was conducted on his body, but after al-Jazeera aired the polonium-210 suspicions last year, the Palestinian Authority agreed to a request by Arafat's widow, Suha, and French judicial investigators to exhume his body for further tests.</p><p>The Swiss scientists said: \"An autopsy would have been useful in this case because although potential polonium poisoning might not have been identified during that procedure, body samples could have been kept and tested afterwards.\"</p><p>Polonium-210 was used to kill Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian KGB agent, who died in London in 2006.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419984495|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|be6bb4857c3ef44e8187aefe1ecd2581dfc6e61d -->",

        "body":"<p>The Queensland attorney general will give himself the power to say which sex offenders should be locked up until they die.</p> <p>Jarrod Bleijie has announced tough new laws to keep the worst sex offenders in jail until they die.</p> <p>\"This legislation will be reserved for the worst of the worst,\" Bleijie told reporters on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"Some of these people just can't be rehabilitated. They should never be released from prison.\"</p> <p>Under the changes, the attorney general can recommend to cabinet which offenders should die in jail.</p> <p>Cabinet then refers the matter on to the governor in council to approve, taking the decision away from the courts.</p> <p>\"It does take it out of the court and put it in my jurisdiction in terms of making a public interest declaration,\" Bleijie said.</p> <p>He intends to declare the proposed laws urgent so they pass parliament this week, before a court hearing for serial sex offender Robert John Fardon.</p> <p>The government is appealing against an order to release Fardon. His case will return to court in November.</p> <p>The 64-year-old has been serving an indefinite jail term for sex offences against women and girls dating back to 1967.</p> <p>\"I'm not going to beat around the bush, this is plan B,\" Bleijie said of the new laws, targeting Fardon and others like him.</p> <p>The laws would not apply to all sex offenders, but would be reserved for the very worst predators, Bleijie said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Bleijie found himself embroiled in a public spat with civil libertarians over new laws designed to deal with bikie gangs.</p> <p>The state parliament passed laws on Wednesday that ban gang members and associates from gathering, and carry additional jail terms of 15 to 25 years for bikies who commit serious crimes.</p> <p>The laws will come into force by the end of the week.</p> <p>This meant the crime and misconduct commission would have more power to \"attack criminal motorcycle gangs\" by this weekend, Bleijie said.</p> <p>The commission is getting expanded powers to gather information from bikie gang members, including being able to haul them before hearings without having to go through a bureaucratic process.</p> <p>Fear of retribution is no longer considered a reasonable excuse for refusing to give evidence to the commission.</p> <p>And information given to the crime watchdog about unexplained wealth can now be used to prosecute alleged offenders.</p> <p>Police will also be allowed to conduct probity checks into tattoo parlour owners.</p> <p>The laws ban bikie gang members from owning, operating or working in tattoo parlours.</p> <p>Bleijie has said the ban could be expanded to cover the security, gym and used-car industries.</p> <p>\"If there are criminal motorcycle gang members profiteering, promoting, working, associating, being the proprietor of these other businesses, then we will crush them too,\" he told parliament.</p> <p>The president of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, Terry O'Gorman, accused the attorney general of rushing through laws that threatened freedom of association, without consultation or scrutiny.</p> <p>He called Bleijie \"a disgrace\" and said he \"doesn't give a rat's\" about the high office he holds.</p> <p>The attorney general has hit back, accusing O'Gorman of \"bleating\" about the new laws because he did not get his way.</p> <p>He suggested O'Gorman may have contributed to Queensland&rsquo;s problems.</p> <p>\"I took the view parliament should deal with the matter as soon as possible,\" Bleijie said on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"People are sick and tired of the likes of Mr O'Gorman bleating every time he [O'Gorman] doesn't like something the government is doing because he didn't get his way.</p> <p>\"Well, he had his way for the last 20 years and that's in essence some of the issues we have now and we are trying to fix.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420088484|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|efcabeebdb9ffa60f2f4f358d0d8f14394a0b4b8 -->",

        "body":"<p>Negotiations in Geneva are due to go into a second day on Wednesday after the first \"very detailed\" technical discussions between Iran and major powers over Tehran's nuclear programme for years.</p><p>Iranian and US diplomats were holding face-to-face meetings last night after a day of multilateral talks in which Iran unveiled a PowerPoint presentation of proposals to end the decade-old deadlock. Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, met the US undersecretary of state, Wendy Sherman, at an impromptu session while the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, met the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton.</p><p>Wednesday's session comes amid the first signs of real progress for at least four years.</p><p>No details of the Iranian presentation, titled \"Closing an unnecessary crisis: Opening new horizons\", were disclosed but it is thought to propose curbs on the Iranian programme in return for sanctions relief and international recognition of Iran's right to enrich uranium.</p><p>\"For the first time, very detailed technical discussions continued this afternoon,\" said Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann.</p><p>Speaking to reporters after the Iran presentation, Araqchi said: \"We believe our proposal has the capacity to make a breakthrough.\" He said the Iranian plan set out a timeline of six months to get to a deal. He said Iran hoped the next step – a new round of talks on the details of a deal – would take place within a month.</p><p>Senior diplomats from the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China – who make up a negotiating group chaired by Ashton – were consulting with their capitals on a common response to the Iranian presentation.</p><p>Unlike previous negotiations, the two days of talks in Geneva are being carried out in English, which Zarif and Araqchi speak fluently. Without the need for interpreters, the negotiations were moving at least twice as quickly as previous talks.</p><p>After giving the PowerPoint presentation in the morning, Zarif retired to his hotel complaining of severe backache and telling reporters he was in to much pain to talk. He has said the condition was brought on by attacks by the conservative press in Tehran which he said had misquoted him as saying the recent thaw with the US was a mistake.</p><p>The twinges forced Zarif to lie down for much of the flight from Tehran to Geneva, on which he brought a doctor to help keep the pain under control. The backache was apparently not the only reminder of the pressures at home: according to one Iranian report, Zarif's delegation received a phone call from Tehran on Tuesday morning with last-minute changes to the Iranian proposal.</p><p>Asked about the foreign minister's condition, Araqchi said: \"He's not alright at all. He is suffering a lot.\" He said Zarif had gone back to the hotel but would not leave Geneva.</p><p>Before the talks began, a senior US official said the aim was to make progress towards an interim confidence-building deal that would defuse tensions and buy time for a more comprehensive solution to the Iranian nuclear standoff.</p><p>The official said Araqchi's announcement days before Geneva that Iran would not contemplate shipping out enriched uranium as part of a deal was not a critical problem. \"There's a variety of ways of dealing with that,\" she said.</p><p>\"To get to a comprehensive agreement is very, very difficult with highly technical issues that have to be resolved. We are looking for a confidence-building step that will put some time on the clock,\" the official said. \"The aim is to rebuild trust … to constrain the programme and even take it back a notch.\"</p><p>She pointed to the fact that the US delegation included financial experts as evidence that Washington was ready to talk about scaling down sanctions in response to Iranian concessions. \"If they are ready to go, we are ready to go,\" she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420055173|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|eff249b884d7e697962e839ee9515b3eafbc11f6 -->",

We need good programmes for parents from before their children are born.\"</p> <p>A lot could be learnt from the US, which had decreased childhood obesity.</p> <p>A minority of Australian schools adhered to dietary guidelines, she said, and workplaces should revise their catering and what was allowed in their vending machines.</p> <p>Obesity was a condition of an inactive, affluent society that consumed in excess, said Peeters, who is head of obesity and population health at Baker IDI.</p> <p>However, people of lower education and income living in rural areas were most at risk because energy-dense, nutrient-poor food was relatively cheap.</p> <p>\"People don't need to be thinking too much about weight loss when they are a little overweight, but they do need to be thinking about preventing weight gain,\" she said.</p> <p>\"If you are a little overweight at 30, you are likely to be quite overweight by 50.\"</p> <p>One way to avoid children growing up to be obese was to limit sugar intake, said associate professor Tim Gill, of the University of Sydney, who will chair a session at the conference.</p> <p>\"We are burning so few calories that every calorie we eat needs to come from nutritious food,\" he said.</p> <p>Active children should be allowed two small treats a day at most, he said.</p> <p>The biggest problem was sugary drinks, which should be limited to one glass a week.</p> <p>\"People are not aware how much sugar they are eating. A can of soft drink has eight to ten spoons of sugar, but children and teenagers typically drink double that in a serve. Foods that contain a lot of added sugar contribute little nutrition, but a lot of calories,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420085268|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|7333678148fc106bc3ed063b6f9538889a5db761 -->",

        "body":"<p>Independent Victorian MP Geoff Shaw has allegedly assaulted a protester outside parliament.</p> <p>Witnesses allege the Frankston MP assaulted an elderly man who was protesting against proposed changes to taxi registrations. Witnesses <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/geoff-shaw-reportedly-punches-taxi-protester-20131015-2vk43.html\">told Fairfax Media</a> that Shaw seemed to swing at an elderly man and throw him down the stairs.</p> <p>Mr Shaw did not deny the incident, but said: \"Have you seen the footage? You can see I was attacked. I was clearly attacked,\" he told <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/geoff-shaw-reportedly-punches-taxi-protester-20131015-2vk43.html\">Fairfax Media</a>.</p> <p>The incident was captured on a phone camera. Footage shows the protester confronting Shaw who then appears to shove the man out of the way, swinging his arm and kicking his leg out as the man lay on the steps. Two other men then appear to run at Shaw, who pushes them away, swinging his briefcase.</p> <p>Shaw reportedly tried to make journalists at the scene delete photographs from their cameras.</p> <p>Local Melbourne news stations released <a href=\"http://ow.ly/i/3qtY3\">some</a> <a href=\"http://ow.ly/i/3qtYg\">stills</a> from their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/9newsmelb/status/389973204195749888\">footage</a> of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/9newsmelb/status/389970857205841920\">incident</a>.</p> <p>\"I took video footage of Shaw physically pushing a man down and swinging his arms around him, causing physical damage towards their faces,\" witness Louie Karkatzoulis told reporters.</p> <p>\"He got a bit physical and out of control.\"</p> <p>Victoria Police confirmed to Guardian Australia that it was investigating &ldquo;an alleged assault that occurred at parliament house around 2pm&rdquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;At this stage the investigation is ongoing. There have been no arrests and no charges laid,&rdquo; said senior constable Adam West.</p> <p>Shaw went into parliament for question time and was not immediately available for comment. Fairfax reported that an opposition member raised the incident as a point of order and Shaw stormed from the chambers.</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/18/victorian-mp-charged-misconduct2\">Shaw was charged</a> with 23 counts of obtaining financial advantage by deception and one count of misconduct in public office.</p> <p>In 2011, Shaw was involved in an altercation with another driver. This incident was shortly after Shaw revealed he had been charged with assault in 1992 when he was employed as a bouncer for a nightclub.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419974016|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|83e7d92eeec95fcf5170a1c8af7c8403806383e0 -->",

        "body":"<p>An inquiry into the bushfires that ravaged much of eastern Tasmania in January has highlighted numerous failures in the emergency services&rsquo; handling of the blazes.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/divisions/osem/2013_tasmanian_bushfires_inquiry_report%20\">independent inquiry</a>, which was led by former South Australian police commissioner Mal Hyde, has made 103 recommendations on how to improve fire, police, traffic management and evacuation procedures.</p> <p>The report is critical of the fire service for failing to respond to computer simulations that indicated the town of Dunalley would be ravaged by fire. It also highlights confusion over the chain of command for the emergency, an inadequate strategy for road closures and the lack of any sort of plan for evacuations.</p> <p>The fires destroyed more than 400 properties, including nearly 200 homes, causing more than $100m in damage. No lives were lost, although more than 10,000 cattle died.</p> <p>According to the report, 3,000 firefighters fought 34 fires in catastrophic conditions on 4 January. It details how the fire storm jumped a canal to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family\">engulf Dunalley</a>, causing hundreds of people to evacuate and seek shelter.</p> <p>&ldquo;The fact that no person was killed should not simply be taken as an indication that the emergency management arrangements worked well,&rdquo; the report states. &ldquo;It is highly likely the preparedness of many people in the community and emergency warnings contributed to this outcome. In a number of respects the emergency management arrangements worked well. However, in a number of ways they did not.&rdquo;</p> <p>The report said there should be a state plan for relocating people during an emergency and said advice to flee at the last moment was contrary to standard firefighting practice, which recommends people leave their houses early, if at all.</p> <p>A more integrated approach between the various emergency response agencies, with a clear chain of command and responsibility, was needed ahead of future bushfire seasons, the report stated.</p> <p>It added that the sheer number of bushfire warnings in January &ndash; 179 in total &ndash; overwhelmed local media, making it difficult for people to become aware of fire threats.</p> <p>Lara Giddings, the Tasmanian premier, said the state government had accepted all the recommendations in principle and would be fast-tracking 31 of them. She told parliament it was &ldquo;critical we respond quickly now that weaknesses have been identified&rdquo;.</p> <p>Giddings said a new website called AlertTas would be created to provide information on fire threats. Tasmanian police will develop a plan on evacuations while computer modelling will be improved ahead of the 2014 bushfire season, she added.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419972316|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|ab5aa6ec0e015777c3e86c47c7429172b481cd21 -->",

        "body":"<p>The funeral in Italy of Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke has been called off  amid clashes outside the church between sympathisers and anti-fascist protesters.</p><p>Priebke's lawyer, Paolo Giachini, said he had cancelled the service because police outside the church in Albano Laziale near Rome had stopped friends and relatives of Priebke entering the church. The Italian news agency Ansa reported that members of a far-right Italian political movement had been barred from entering by  authorities.</p><p>Priebke, a former SS captain who died in Rome last Friday aged 100 while serving a life sentence for his role in the massacre of 335 Italians in 1944, had been denied a church funeral in the Italian capital by the Catholic church despite protests from his lawyer and family. But on Tuesday, the Society of Saint Pius X, which has split from the Vatican over its opposition to the modernisation of Catholic doctrine and its outreach to Jews, offered Priebke a funeral at its church in Albano Laziale.</p><p>The group gained notoriety in 2009 when a British member, Richard Williamson, denied the Holocaust had taken place, saying: \"I believe there were no gas chambers.\"</p><p>As the hearse containing Priebke's remains tried to enter the church on Tuesday afternoon accompanied by a police escort, protesters kicked it, yelled \"assassin\" and tried to attack a priest. Riot police separated the crowd from a small group of rightwing extremists, some hooded, who gave the fascist salute. As the evening wore on, the opposing groups briefly clashed before police intervened.</p><p>Nicola Marini, the mayor of Albano Laziale, had tried to ban the coffin from entering the town for the funeral, which was taking place on the 70th anniversary of the Nazi roundup of Jews in Rome, but he was overruled by the local government prefect.</p><p>After living in Argentina for 50 years after the war, Priebke was given a life sentence in Italy in 1998 for his role in the 1944 massacre at the Ardeatine caves in Rome, a reprisal for the killing of 33 German soldiers by resistance fighters.</p><p>Given house arrest with permission to attend church, he outraged Jews in Rome, who would bump into him as he walked in a city park. Priebke admitted no guilt, insisting  he had been following orders and, just before his death, claimed that the Holocaust was an invention.</p><p>After the Vatican denied him a funeral in Rome, the capital's mayor also ruled out a burial  in the capital. Argentina's foreign minister said Priebke could not be buried in Argentina, and a spokesman for the council of Priebke's home town, Hennigsdorf in Germany, said: \"We don't have to bury Priebke in Hennigsdorf and we will not do it.\"</p><p>Mayor Marini said a burial there was also out of the question.</p><p>Cremation was the best solution, said Riccardo Pacifici, the president of Rome's Jewish community. \"Spreading his ashes, like they did to Adolf Eichmann, would stop his grave becoming a pilgrimage destination.\"</p><p>After the cancelled funeral, Priebke's coffin remained in Albano Laziale overnight.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420097932|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|6ec1fb363e2fa36edf23172e4e571c995ca58245 -->",

        "body":"<p>Huge numbers of goats, cows and even camels will be slaughtered in Pakistani on Wednesday homes to mark the Islamic holy day of Eid al-Adha.</p><p>The sacrificial offering of around 6m animals will allow families to fulfil a religious duty, guarantee some much appreciated meat handouts to the poor and provide nearly half of the annual requirement of the country's leather industry.</p><p>It will also generate an extraordinary cash windfall for some of Pakistan's most dangerous militant groups.</p><p>Thinly disguised front organisations have been gearing up to compete against each other and legitimate charities to collect as many animal skins as possible, which can then be sold on for cash.</p><p>\"For us it is second only to Ramadan for our income,\" says an official from the Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF).</p><p>FIF is the charitable wing of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), itself the reincarnation of one of south Asia's most dangerous militant groups, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a banned organisation dedicated to fighting jihad against India.</p><p>JuD has successfully fought off legal bans although many believe it remains deeply involved in militancy.</p><p>The US government has offered $10m (£6m) for information leading to the arrest of Hafiz Saeed, the group's leader accused by some US officials of masterminding and overseeing the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks.</p><p>Saeed moves around the country freely. On Monday, he held a press conference outside a mosque in an affluent district of Islamabad.</p><p>Surrounded by piles of food, toys and other goods that he said would be given to victims of last month's earthquake in Baluchistan, he appealed for people to give their animal hides to JuD.</p><p>\"Whatever funds we get from hides of animals we will use in Baluchistan to rebuild houses and help the people,\" he said to a bank of almost 20 television cameras.</p><p>The organisation hopes to collect 100,000 hides from around the country this year. A cow hide can fetch up to $50.</p><p>Also available to buy are JuD livestock which the organisation provides and slaughters on behalf of individuals or groups who want to pool resources to share the cost.</p><p>Such initiatives have helped the organisation take market share from other charities, including the Edhi Foundation, a much-respected social welfare group.</p><p>\"It's hard to complete because they have more manpower from all their religious seminaries,\" said Mohammad Rashid from the Edhi Foundation in Islamabad. \"They send all their students out to the streets, to volunteer.\"</p><p>Because JuD is not officially a banned organisation nothing will or can be done to stop it collecting hides.</p><p>There are fears that very little will be done to stop illegal groups from collecting hides either, particularly as many of them operate under false names.</p><p>Officials say around half of the 24 groups that applied for the right to set up street stalls to collect hides in Islamabad were rejected after they were investigated and found to be front organisations.</p><p>In recent weeks newspapers have carried government advert warning people not to give hides to illegal groups. However, a thorough crackdown is unlikely.</p><p>Muhammad Rizwan, the senior superintendent of police in Islamabad, said the issue was not as critical to public safety as preventing suicide bombers from getting into mosques or other large gatherings that will occur across the country in the coming days.</p><p>\"Our focus has to be on security because we have 685 mosques in the city alone and many huge gatherings. All our resources will be focused onto that.\"</p><p>While most people will give their hides to local mosques or respectable charities, some deliberately give to militants.</p><p>\"Definitely why shouldn't I give to jihadi organisations,\" said Syed Sabir Hussain, a small business owner from Rawalpindi. \"What is wrong if they are fighting for Allah and Muslims?\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420008035|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|9b8298e7ce92ce1d5d768c7995c0b9197a85db95 -->",

        "body":"<p>The outgoing House of Representatives speaker, Anna Burke, has given newly elected parliamentarians a candid window onto their new professional world &ndash; and urged them to take time for themselves and prioritise their personal wellbeing.</p> <p>However, Burke warned the new arrivals not to claim expenses for attending weddings, saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not work &ndash; regardless of what anybody says.&rdquo;</p> <p>New MPs are currently in Canberra for their orientation ahead of the resumption of federal parliament last month, and Burke addressed them in the chamber on Tuesday.</p> <p>Burke, who made waves by airing her disappointment at her omission from the new Labor frontbench in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/anna-burke-women-labor-party\">a comment piece for Guardian Australia</a> on Monday, told the MPs she had once given a speech on banking regulations at 2am, &ldquo;half asleep, with drool running down my face&rdquo;, in the certainty that no one would be listening. A voter, however, got in touch to declare the contribution interesting. She said she wanted to reply, advising the person to &ldquo;get a life&rdquo; &ndash; but didn&rsquo;t.</p> <p>The anecdote was a homily about parliamentarians never being off the clock, and never out of the spotlight. &ldquo;You think there&rsquo;s no one listening but they are, they&rsquo;re out there, on ABC24, on the radio,&rdquo; Burke said.</p> <p>Voters had approached her on the beach in Merimbula &ndash; far from her Melbourne suburban home &ndash; when she was in her swimmers. &ldquo;I was at the beach, at Merimbula, in New South Wales. I&rsquo;m from Victoria. At the beach. In the bathers. You never want to be spotted in the bathers as a girl. &lsquo;Oh it&rsquo;s Anna Burke, our local member.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh God.&rsquo; You are always a parliamentarian. Never forget it,&rdquo; she advised.</p> <p>Burke informed the group the public could be preoccupied with unexpected things. She reported there was also a rolling controversy about her hair during the 43rd parliament. &ldquo;A lot of comments that I got as speaker were about my hair. It used to drive me nuts &ndash; this big argument,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>&ldquo;I was channelling Justin Bieber &ndash; why I&rsquo;d be channelling the Bieb is beyond me, even my kids don&rsquo;t like the Bieb &ndash; but I hadn&rsquo;t had time to get a haircut. Sue me. No joke, [the outrage] went on for weeks.</p> <p>&ldquo;The moral of the story is just remember yourself in this process. You need to keep on top of what you need to do to keep yourself in a really good place.</p> <p>&ldquo;Remember to look after yourself, because a lot of people don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s the one thing you do sacrifice a lot of in this place: yourself. You don&rsquo;t make the time for yourself. You might make the time for your partner, your kids, your extended family, the community. You need to remember yourself. It&rsquo;s a big lesson that a lot of people forget.&rdquo;</p> <p>In addition to the demands of being a public figure, Burke&rsquo;s speech on Tuesday traversed &ldquo;torturous&rdquo; parliamentary sitting hours and the strange customs of the parliament, including the art of &ldquo;giving speeches to no one&rdquo;.</p> <p>Burke urged the newcomers to think of themselves as community representatives first and foremost, and to use some of the innovations of the last parliament to pursue private members business, to make speeches and collaborative contributions.</p> <p>She also defended the last minority parliament against arguments it had been ineffective. She said as House of Representatives speaker, she&rsquo;d been &ldquo;deeply depressed&rdquo; by the notion that the 43rd parliament had been a failure.</p> <p>&ldquo;There was this notion the parliament had failed. Leave aside politics, leave aside parties, leave aside government, opposition &ndash; the parliament did not fail. This is a magnificent institution. It is above, in lots of respects, the politics of the day,&rdquo; Burke said.</p> <p>&ldquo;It will continue to work, and it did as a hung parliament. Legislation was still passed, committees still met, people came together and did things, and in some respects because of the hung parliament &ndash; it forced people to come together and do things. The parliament worked.&rdquo;</p> <p>Burke also urged the new arrivals to be careful with their expenses and taxpayer-funded entitlements, referencing the recent public controversy about MPs&rsquo; claims. She said the common sense test with expenses was community standards and expectations, not what the system allowed people to justify.</p> <p>Burke said going to weddings and claiming expenses would be very controversial. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to pass the ultimate test &ndash; the community &ndash; regardless of whether you can justify it,&rdquo; she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419972577|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|2f13c76c78a5e16891fed8b72fb90630dba110a4 -->",

The 26-year-old was in a Porsche 996 as a passenger when it hit the barriers at the circuit on Tuesday. He had been leading the drivers' championship of the Porsche Supercup series, all of the races for which take place at Formula One events.</p><p>Edwards is understood to have been killed instantly when the car left the track and impacted with a tyre wall on the outside of turn six at the track in Ipswich, 25 miles west of Brisbane. The driver was extracted from the wreckage, which had caught fire, by emergency services and was taken to intensive care with life-threatening injuries.</p><p>It is understood it took three hours to remove the driver from the car. Inspector Dave Preston of Queensland police said it had been a difficult operation to get the man out of the mangled wreckage: \"The fire and rescue had to do extensive work in relation to extracting and opening the vehicle up sufficiently to remove him. He was trapped for some time.\"</p><p>The driver, who has yet to be named, was a 20-year-old Brisbane man. His family were understood to be trackside at the time. He was pinned from the waist down in the wreckage for three hours after the crash took place at 11.30am, after which he was airlifted to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.</p><p>Edwards was the son of Guy Edwards who competed in Formula One and the 24 Hours of Le Mans during the 1970s and 1980s and was one of the drivers who helped remove <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/14/james-hunt-niki-lauda-summer-of-speed\" title=\"\">Niki Lauda from his burning car at the 1976 German Grand Prix</a> at the Nürburgring.</p><p>Sean Edwards won the European GT3 Championship in 2006 and gone on to race in the FIA GT Championship, the American Le Mans Series, the Le Mans 24 hours and the Porsche Supercup and Porsche Supercup Germany series. He finished third  in a Porsche in the GT2 class at his very first 24 hour race, at Spa in 2007.</p><p>Having won the Dubai 24 Hours last year he did so again in 2013 and was also a winner for the Black Falcon team at the Nürburgring 24 this year and took the Long Beach round of the American Le Mans series in the GTC class.</p><p>Racing for the Allyouneed by Project 1 team in this year's Porsche Supercup, he had victories in Spain, Monaco and Hungary and was leading the championship by 18 points with two races at Yas Marina due to have taken place on 2-3 November.</p><p>He had also recently taken part in the making of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/15/rush-review-kermode\" title=\"\">film Rush</a>, recounting the 1976 F1 battle between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, advising on the racing scenes and in some parts portraying his father.</p><p>The crash comes just five months after another death at Queensland Raceway. In June a 23-year-old motorbike rider was killed when he hit the back wheel of another rider.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419989015|2013-10-16T15:58:17Z|9f66209cfc0cf8bacd0330c75a3eb3b56de67e8d -->",
