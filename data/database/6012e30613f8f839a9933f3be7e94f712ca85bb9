        "body":"<p>Until recently – the watershed came somewhere around the millennium – British perceptions of modern German politics focused not on Germany's government or its main political parties, which were boringly democratic and law-abiding, but on the increasingly distant Nazi past and on extreme parties of the right, which appeared to some eyes to threaten the return to street violence, domestic authoritarianism and&nbsp;foreign aggression.</p><p>This perception said much more about the British than the Germans. In the end, given a helpful push by the seriousness of the financial crisis and by the pragmatic leadership of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a>, the pfennig has finally dropped. Today, better late than never, British perceptions of Germany now focus where they should have been all along – on the resilience of Germany's postwar institutions and on the general good balance of its society and economy in dealing with the problems it faces. It is part of what gives me cautious hope about the outcome of any UK referendum on Europe.</p><p>But the conclusion to that is this: one down, 27 to go. That is because, reading some of what is being written and said about the current state of Europe, it feels as if we have been here before. What used to be said about Germany's imminent lurch to the right is now often being said about Europe more generally. Well, it was wrong then and, with certain provisos, it is also wrong now.</p><p>The current focus for fashionable doom-mongering about the politics of Europe is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014_(United_Kingdom)\" title=\"\">European parliament elections of May 2014</a>. These elections, it is said, are likely to&nbsp;see a far-right backlash across many EU countries. Faced with such a possibility, some observers predict the collapse of the EU itself, and even a new dark age of renewed competing European nationalisms.</p><p>It would be foolish to dismiss all these possibilities in every respect, not least because a lot can happen between now and the elections. And foolish, too, to deny that across Europe these elections will be a major opportunity for single-issue and extremist parties – not always the same thing –to make a play for the support of insecure, disillusioned and plain angry voters in the 28 member states. Foolish, finally, because Europe has manifestly not dealt with its banking and fiscal crises in either an even-handed or a sure-handed way.</p><p>Nevertheless, these warnings about an impending or a continuing lurch to the right simply do not match the facts. For one thing, they assume that Euroscepticism elides into far-right extremism, when sometimes it does and sometimes it does not. For another, far-right politics is far from homogeneous. Some parties passionately defend the welfare state, while others see it as unworthy of a strong, manly nation. All in all, though, the warnings about the far right amount to little more than scaremongering.</p><p>Take the claim that the far right is prospering because of the economic crisis and the relative failure to resolve it. The electoral evidence for this does not exist. Yes, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2012/may/07/france-election-results-map-round-two\" title=\"\">National Front took 18% in the 2012 presidential election in France</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18482415\" title=\"\">Golden Dawn twice polled 7% in Greece's two legislative elections last year too</a>. Both results were undoubtedly disturbing and newsworthy, and parties of government in those two countries need to take them extremely seriously. Yet they can hardly be portrayed either as triumphs or, in the case of the National Front, as a high-water mark. They represent a challenge to the system, not a threat to it. Thus far, moreover, they have been contained.</p><p>And look at the main elections in Europe this year, not last. In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21565606\" title=\"\">Cyprus</a> the nationalist anti-immigrant presidential candidate got 1%. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/germany-election-results-merkel-live-updates\" title=\"\">Germany</a>, the Eurosceptic AFD (by no means a party of the far right) got 4.7%, while the far-right NPD scored 1% (its vote went down, not up). In Lombardy, the Northern League's vote declined by 13%. True, the Freedom party took 21% in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24329375\" title=\"\">September's Austrian general election</a> and put its vote up, while the newly created Action for Dissatisfied Citizens polled 19% in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24686257\" title=\"\">Czech general election</a> two weeks ago. But the Freedom party has been higher in the past and Austria has survived, and the Czech ADC is a party of the centre-right that was formed to protest against indigenous Czech political corruption, rather than the crisis in the eurozone (of which the Czech Republic is not part).</p><p>None of this is to say that the European elections will not provide an opportunity for the right to do better. Something of the sort is almost certain in an election which few voters take seriously, which favours protest votes and which tends to have low turnouts. Even so, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/04/a-european-shutdown-the-2014-european-elections-and-the-great-recession/\" title=\"\">according to Cas Mudde</a>, an academic specialist on the subject, the far right is on course to gain 34 to 50 seats in the European parliament, which is roughly 4% to 7% of the total. That's hardly a landslide, even if you elide Euroscepticism and the far right together, which I do not.</p><p>Focusing on the real far right has an honourable history. But it is deeply rooted in the terrible experience of interwar Germany. That is not a good historical model for today. The reality is that no country in modern Europe is like the Weimar Republic – and it is time we recognised that the political responses to today's financial crisis are unfolding very differently to those of the Great Depression.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to what is said by those who focus on the far right, the most striking aspect of the modern crisis is the adaptability and resilience of existing institutions, including the EU, in the face of huge pressures. That's not to say the crisis has not had an effect. In some ways it has given an extra push to trends that were already in evidence when the economy was booming. Nevertheless in most countries, including Britain, most voters continue to vote for traditional political parties, not new ones. And in most countries, also including Britain, most people seem to prefer to give the existing system the benefit of the doubt, albeit often with understandably bad grace. They are wise to do so.</p><p>The real choice facing politics is not a grand global showdown between good and evil, the old left and the old right. That's an escapist fantasy. The issue is whether the existing centre left or the existing centre right is better and more creative at building a coalition of interest around a confidence-inspiring and practicable programme – and then keeping enough support get re-elected. Right now in Europe, the centre right is proving a bit better at this than the centre left. The hard graft for centre-left parties across Europe is to turn this&nbsp;around – not to be a 21st-century Don Quixote forever tilting at 19th- or&nbsp;20th-century windmills.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421846492|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|ce769585460016bcca9a50805213cff5a56112eb -->",

The reality is that no country in modern Europe is like the Weimar Republic – and it is time we recognised that the political responses to today's financial crisis are unfolding very differently to those of the Great Depression.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to what is said by those who focus on the far right, the most striking aspect of the modern crisis is the adaptability and resilience of existing institutions, including the EU, in the face of huge pressures. That's not to say the crisis has not had an effect. In some ways it has given an extra push to trends that were already in evidence when the economy was booming. Nevertheless in most countries, including Britain, most voters continue to vote for traditional political parties, not new ones. And in most countries, also including Britain, most people seem to prefer to give the existing system the benefit of the doubt, albeit often with understandably bad grace. They are wise to do so.</p><p>The real choice facing politics is not a grand global showdown between good and evil, the old left and the old right. That's an escapist fantasy. The issue is whether the existing centre left or the existing centre right is better and more creative at building a coalition of interest around a confidence-inspiring and practicable programme – and then keeping enough support get re-elected. Right now in Europe, the centre right is proving a bit better at this than the centre left. The hard graft for centre-left parties across Europe is to turn this&nbsp;around – not to be a 21st-century Don Quixote forever tilting at 19th- or&nbsp;20th-century windmills.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421846492|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|ce769585460016bcca9a50805213cff5a56112eb -->",

        "headline":"It's David Cameron who's rolling over for big corporations in the EU-US trade deal",
        "body":"<p>Before negotiations have even started, the proposed <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\" title=\"\">trade deal between the EU and United States</a> has been heralded as a game-changer: an unprecedented stimulus package for the European economy, a shot across the bow for British Eurosceptics and a chance for Europe and the US to set the standard for global trade before China beats us to it. It is a significant opportunity for transatlantic trade, no doubt. Critics, meanwhile, are blaming the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership for the failures of rightwing European governments and the powers they are willing to cede to multinational corporations. The anger is right but the target is wrong: we need to look far more closely at the UK coalition government's priorities before laying the blame at the door of \"Brussels\".</p><p>It is expected (as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/us-trade-deal-full-frontal-assault-on-democracy\" title=\"\">George Monbiot has pointed out</a>) that the European commission will seek to include in the deal a mechanism known as the investor-state dispute settlement. This clause is intended to protect foreign investors from discrimination by governments. In practice it means that companies will have the right to sue foreign governments if they don't like the local legislation. The cases are heard in private. Governments often lose. Millions of pounds, dollars and euros have been paid to private companies when a secret panel of arbitrators decides the government has overstepped the mark by legislating, say, to make generic drugs more widely available or to stop tobacco companies aggressively marketing to children.</p><p>The mechanism is a scandal. The European commission has a lot to answer for, and those of us shouting the loudest in Brussels against it will keep shouting. But the buck does not stop with the commission, and it is not an invention of the US trade deal.</p><p>Investor-state mechanisms have existed in investment agreements for years. We already have them in UK agreements with non-EU countries. They have been pencilled into EU trade agreements with Canada and Singapore.</p><p>The EU now has legal powers in the area of investment policy, and member governments are in the process of establishing one clear set of rules to replace the existing spaghetti bowl of criss-crossing agreements. It is the perfect opportunity to abandon the investor-state mechanism.</p><p>Alas, governments, including the UK, issued the European commission with a negotiating mandate that includes the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism. The commission is pursuing their request with vigour.</p><p>And now, don't the missing pieces of the UK coalition's debacle <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/20/cameron-lynton-crosby-contract-philip-morris\" title=\"\">over plain cigarette packaging</a> fall into place? The Australian government was sued by Philip Morris when it attempted to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes and has since decided to scrap the investor-state dispute mechanism because of its effect on the government's ability to legislate on health and environment. Meanwhile, in the UK David Cameron's enthusiasm for plain packaging stopped dead in its tracks and the legislation was put on hold because of \"considerable legal uncertainty\".</p><p>The fact that the government was willing to sacrifice a key health proposal because of fears that big tobacco would sue is bad enough. The fact that Cameron failed to scrap the investor-state provision in UK investment agreements is worse, and the fact that his government demanded the European commission actually include it in new EU agreements with Canada, Singapore and the US is shameful. But no doubt the Tories would be happy to sit back and let \"Brussels\" take the blame for this one.</p><p>Labour MEPs and our sister parties in the Socialist and Democrat group in the European parliament continue to vote to scrap this mechanism, but we face an uphill battle in a parliament dominated by conservatives and a minority of MEPs who do not even turn up to vote.</p><p>Alongside the investment agreements themselves the parliament and council are currently negotiating legislation for the practical implementation of the investor-state dispute settlement. As the lead MEP for the Socialists and Democrats on this legislation I am drafting clauses to ensure that, if investor-state cannot be stopped, there will at least be legal requirements for transparency. As a minimum it should be made public if foreign companies are suing the EU. We should know what the companies are suing for and how much taxpayers' money is at stake. We must also be able to ringfence legislation for public health, the environment and workers' rights to ensure companies cannot challenge them.</p><p>Meanwhile, no EU investment agreements have been concluded, but time is rapidly running out. The answer is not to derail the US trade agreement but look to the almost-concluded agreements with Singapore and Canada and urge the UK government and MEPs to pressure the commission to change tactics. The Tories give us a lot of hot air about \"standing up to Brussels\", but on standing up to corporate power? Radio silence.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421830564|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|089bd8a4eb977ef94e3511d15382ce5666f7940c -->",

        "body":"<p>EU competition regulators are preparing to fine six global banks including Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and HSBC for suspected rigging of benchmark eurozone interest rates.</p><p>The penalties, which will also target Royal Bank of Scotland, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale, represent the first punishment meted out by Brussels in a global probe and represent another costly payout for an industry struggling to put past misdeeds behind it.</p><p>Some of the banks had agreed to settle with the European commission in exchange for a 10% reduction in their fines, while several of the banks will not be fined immediately as they are contesting the size of the proposed penalties. HSBC, Europe's largest bank, is one of those. In these cases, the banks are likely to face formal charges next month, followed by fines next year.</p><p>The move comes two years after the commission, the EU's antitrust authority, raided a number of banks for suspected fixing of Euribor, a benchmark used as the basis for pricing €250 tn (£210tn) worth of financial contracts, from Spanish mortgages to complex derivatives.</p><p>Barclays, which alerted the commission to the suspected wrongdoing, will not be fined, the source said.</p><p></p><p>Commission spokesman for competition policy, Antoine Colombani, declined to comment.</p><p>The EU can impose fines of up to 10% of a company's global revenue for breaches of antitrust rules. In this case, the fines are likely to be towards the low end of the scale, the source said. However, since all the banks have revenues of at least €16 bn a year, even a 1% fine would result in hundreds of millions of euros in penalties.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421731930|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|e243dacccb01e833ae8935bb876419da1bbaf23b -->",

        "body":"<p>Only hours before, the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, had resolutely declared that Greece was not at war with the international bodies keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. But on Tuesday, inspectors representing those organisations may have been forgiven for thinking otherwise.</p><p>In scenes not witnessed since the beginning of Greece's economic crisis, auditors from the European Union and International Monetary Fund came face-to-face with the full force of anti-austerity anger as protesters in Athens jeered, heckled and stopped them from leaving the finance ministry.</p><p>Held back by riot police brought in to guard the department, furious demonstrators screamed \"take your bailout and get out of here\" as the officials left a first round of talks with the finance minister, Yannis Stournaras.</p><p>The IMF's mission chief to Greece, Poul Thomsen, was forced to duck as a man threw a barrage of coins at him. As the Dane was pushed into a waiting car, the protester was dispatched to Greece's central police headquarters.</p><p>Later in the day, the inspectors had to be whisked out of the building through an emergency exit when irate Greeks blocked the main entrance.</p><p>The protests come on the eve of a general strike and amid spiralling tensions between Athens and its triumvirate of foreign lenders, \"the troika\", which have propped up the Greek economy to the tune of €240bn (£200bn) since May 2010.</p><p>Mired in a sixth straight year of recession, with unemployment nudging 30%, Greece has been hit by record levels of poverty – the price of making the biggest fiscal adjustment of any OECD state since the second world war.</p><p>Many of the demonstrators who took to the streets told reporters they had been directly affected by public sector dismissals demanded by the EU, IMF and European Central Bank. The prospect of yet more austerity measures being meted out to plug a looming fiscal gap has sent passions rising further.</p><p>Relentless spending cuts and tax rises have resulted in Greeks losing 40% of their disposable income since the crisis began, according to Samaras, who took to the airwaves ahead of the troika's latest inspection tour.</p><p>\"Both Greek society and the economy cannot afford any more measures,\" the leader said in his first televised interview since assuming office 15 months ago. \"Everyone has to understand that.\"</p><p>Tuesday's meetings follow weeks of angry exchanges between Greek officials and creditors over the extent of the funding gap. While Athens contends it is around €500m, and can be easily filled with the application of \"targeted measures\" and structural reforms, lenders say it is at least four times bigger and will require extra budget cuts to be resolved. The meetings kept well clear of the issue, insiders said.</p><p>There was much speculation before the visit that the troika might not come at all because of the standoff. On Monday, Samaras felt fit to intervene, reminding Greeks that the country was in negotiation with its lenders, not at war with them.</p><p>After Tuesday's protests, however, officials were refusing to divulge what the inspectors' next moves would be.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421732657|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|77860354ab9802c925e0442eedb3d49b3825d2f6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's business lobby group will set out its \"unequivocal\" support for Britain staying in the European Union on Monday, claiming that membership brings each household some £3,000 a year.</p><p>The CBI said a poll of members around the country showed the vast majority wanted to remain part of the EU, subject to important reforms. At its annual conference in London, the group will stress that benefits such as easier access to export markets, both in Europe and further afield, easily outweigh the costs.</p><p>Presenting his \"business vision for a reformed EU\", CBI director general John Cridland countered those calling for a so-called \"Brexit\" by stressing that being outside the world's largest trading bloc would leave the UK isolated and without influence.</p><p>David Cameron has promised to put Britain's EU membership to a vote in 2017. The referendum has caused huge controversy inside the Tory party, which is split between those MPs who are pushing the prime minister for a vote before the 2015 election and a faction led by the former chancellor Ken Clarke, who has described the vote as silly and reckless.</p><p>The CBI's research could strengthen Cameron's hand inside the Tory party, especially as it found that more than three-quarters of small and medium-sized businesses back staying inside the single market. Traditionally, polls have shown large majorities among large businesses for EU membership against a large no vote from smaller enterprises.</p><p>Cridland said: \"We have looked beyond the political rhetoric to examine the pros and cons of EU membership and British business is unequivocal: the single market is fundamental to our future.\"</p><p>The group's conclusions credit membership of the bloc with giving Britain access to European markets of 500 million people, helping cement the UK as the world's leading financial centre and attracting investment from around the world. It says that by aggregating research already available it has come up with a \"conservative\" estimate that the benefits amount to 4-5% of GDP, or as much as £78bn a year, making each household £3,000 better off.</p><p>But the group also outlines a number of frustrations. \"The EU isn't perfect and there is a growing unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. Europe has to become more open, competitive and outward looking if we are to grow and create opportunities and jobs for all our citizens,\" Cridland said.</p><p>\"I am clear that the ever closer union of the eurozone is not for Britain. The big reform issue is to ensure that Britain's membership of the single market and the EU of the 28 does not become damaged or diluted by the eurozone's drive for greater integration.\"</p><p>The group is calling on the EU to fully implement a market for services and to create a digital one, and also to secure trade deals with the US and Japan as part of talks already under way. It also wants a moratorium on legislation where there is a case for decisions to be made at national level, such as employment law.</p><p>Separately, the <a href=\"http://niesr.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">National Institute of Economic and Social Research</a> (NIESR) is calling for more research into the benefits of both staying in and leaving the EU.</p><p>\"So far, while there has been plenty of partisan rhetoric, there has been little serious and comprehensive analysis of the implications for the British economy of an exit from the EU,\" says NIESR's director Jonathan Portes, writing in the group's Economic Review.</p><p>\"It is vital that the UK political debate on EU membership over the next few years is informed by high-quality, objective economic analysis. There will be few decisions that will be so important for our long-term economic future.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421570232|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|1a0a7103422babca70a77e88b97395517cb97ae0 -->",
