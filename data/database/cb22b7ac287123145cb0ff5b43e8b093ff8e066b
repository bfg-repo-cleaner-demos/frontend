Photo: Tristram Kenton</figcaption></figure><p>The General Manager of Scottish Opera <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYpkmzkiOlA\">Alex Reedijk</a> still won't talk to the press about the recent departure of the company's Music Director, Emmanuel Joel-Hornak, who resigned before he'd even got close to lifting a baton (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/sep/30/scottish-opera-joel-hornak-reedijk-resigns\">as I reported last month</a>); the maestro himself has so far made no comment, and the orchestra and chorus - the part-time players and singers who make up Scottish Opera's ensemble - aren't allowed to talk to the press (that's stipulated in their contracts.)</p><p>There is a lot of secrecy swirling around Scotland's biggest and most expensive musical and theatrical institution. And quite right too, not to talk to those nasty people from the media. After all, it's only the future of Scotland's largest scale arts organisation that's at stake, the country's biggest symbol of classical music culture, on the eve of a debate about Scotland's potential future as an independent nation, and a crucial argument about the place of the arts therein, whatever happens in the vote - quite right, what is there really to talk about...?</p><p>Well - Mr Reedijk, Scottish Opera's board, and managers: how about what you're doing with £8.37m  (the figure the company received in 2011-12) of Scottish taxpayers' money? And why the company, however you spin it, has become a part-time travesty of what it once was. (Even though there is one more full-scale production this year than I mentioned in my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/sep/30/scottish-opera-joel-hornak-reedijk-resigns\">previous post on this story</a>, that still means the company is managing to put on only three full-scale shows - Don Giovanni, Don Pasquale, and Madame Butterfly - in a  12 months. But that's the kind of thing <a href=\"http://www.operanorth.co.uk/productions?page=3\">Opera North</a> or <a href=\"http://www.wno.org.uk\">Welsh National Opera</a> manage in half, a third, of that time.)</p><p>What with all that keeping schtum going on in Glasgow, there's nothing, naturally, that can be said directly about what the musicians who work for the company are feeling. It is possible, however, to imagine what the atmosphere might be. So put yourself in the position of the orchestral players, for example, many of whom played with  Scottish Opera during the glory days of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/aug/21/classicalmusicandopera.edinburghfestival20033\">Ring Cycles</a>, groundbreaking <a href=\"http://www.scottishopera.org.uk/about-us/our-history\">Janacek and Berlioz productions, Strauss, Mozart, Verdi, James MacMillan, David Horne, Judith Weir, Sally Beamish, and dozens of others</a>. These are people who were told they were overpaid and on luxurious conditions - at least that's one inference you could take from Reedijk's demoting the whole lot of them to part-time contracts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2010/sep/17/scottish-opera-orchestra\">in 2010</a>. But if there wasn't enough work for them, whose fault was that? Not the players themselves, obviously, but the managers for failing to use the Scottish government's funds to do what they should be doing: that's to say, running a full-time, full-scale opera company - just like Opera North does, on roughly equivalent funding - as opposed to planning part-time seasons for part-time musicians. There's less work for them to do, ergo you don't need to employ them properly. What simpler way could there be to save money? It's the same story with the chorus, who were made part-time <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jun/09/classicalmusicandopera.scotland\">back in 2004</a>.</p><p>One of Reedijk's central achievements, he says, is to keep <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/back-to-basics-for-scottish-opera-1-2940269\">Scottish Opera in the black</a>. Well: that's certainly one consequence of doing so little full-scale work. But no-one remembers managers of opera companies for their husbandry of accounts. They're remembered for what they did, for what happened on stage, for how audiences were introduced to the most complex, most risky, and most rewarding art-form in the world. Anyone could keep Scottish Opera in the black if you just spent as little as possible, and paid lip service to pushing the boundaries with small-scale shows, the occasional starry director, and bought-in educational brands such as <a href=\"https://www.scottishopera.org.uk/13-14/sensoryo\">SensoryO</a>. </p><p>Reedijk can at least rightly point to some achievements during his seven years in charge, like the bold and sometimes brilliant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/16/five-15-opera-review\">Five:15</a> shows which produced 15 new short operas, or the fact that he has toured the company to more parts of Scotland than ever before. But his reign marks a downsizing of the company in terms of its artistic reach and ambition, as well as its musical (although not its administrative) staff. For that, you see, is what Scottish Opera actually is. Not a touring wing of a music-theatrical practice, not a glorified education department, not a multi-media arts consultancy or artistic management hub, but a company whose sole reason for existing is to stage operas for the people of Scotland and beyond. </p><p>Before his arrival in Glasgow, Joel-Hornak circulated a \"vision\" document to staff and players (as <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/scottish-operas-music-director-had-vision-at-odds-with-company.22338656\">reported in The Herald</a>), which included his goal of reinstating a full-time orchestra and chorus. Was that the clincher that made the relationship between the conductor, Reedijk and his management staff finally break down? Pure speculation, of course. But that's the parodic situation Scottish Opera finds itself in, in which its managers and leaders are the ones arguing for the itinerant, the part-time, the small-scale. Compared to the current creative confidence of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Scottish Opera is in danger of being run into creative and cultural irrelevance - and at just the time when this proud, historically ambitious, over-achieving company could and should be making the case for itself as the single cultural jewel of which the country should be proudest. It can and it must be that company again - and soon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420642929|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|a8fa2d9bf2df94a2c6bc4f21c9cfe78bf719675f -->",

        "body":"<p>YouTube is expected to launch a new subscription music service by the end of this year, competing with Spotify and other streaming music firms, including YouTube's own parent company Google.</p><p>YouTube's new service will be \"designed with mobile listening in mind\" <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/5763268/youtube-close-to-launching-subscription-music-service\">according to music industry site Billboard</a>, which also claims that there will be two tiers, with users able to choose between free and ad-supported, or a $10-a-month premium version with no ads and the ability to store songs for offline listening.</p><p>Its report suggests that Google signed most of the necessary licensing deals with music labels and publishers while negotiating agreements for its separate Google Play Music All Access streaming service, which launched earlier in 2013.</p><p>For its part, YouTube isn't commenting publicly on the speculation. \"We're always working on new and better ways for people to enjoy YouTube content across all screens, and on giving partners more opportunities to reach their fans,\" explained a statement. \"However, we have nothing to announce at this time.\"</p><p>An announcement may be imminent, though. The company is holding its first <a href=\"http://youtube.com/musicawards\">YouTube Music Awards</a> on 3 November in New York: an MTV or Billboard-style awards ceremony with performances from Lady Gaga, Eminem and Arcade Fire among other artists. It would be an ideal time to unveil a new digital music service for a captive audience of fans.</p><p>Speculation about YouTube's plans for a Spotify-style subscription service have been swirling for some time. In March, Fortune claimed that <a href=\"http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/03/05/youtube-streaming/\">YouTube was planning to launch it by the end of 2013</a>, tipping a similar blend of free and premium access.</p><p>It's also true that YouTube is probably already the world's biggest streaming music service, generating hundreds of millions of streams of music videos every month. YouTube currently attracts more than 1bn unique users a month, who collectively watch more than 6bn hours of video.</p><p>In 2012, research firm Accustream iMedia Research claimed that <a href=\"http://musically.com/2012/05/02/youtubes-music-video-plays-estimated-at-384bn-for-2011/\">38.4% of YouTube's views were music videos</a>, and although that percentage may have fallen since due to the growth of other kinds of content on YouTube, music is still a huge factor.</p><p>In October, Pew Research Center claimed that <a href=\"http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Online-Video.aspx\">50% of US adult internet users watch music videos online</a>, with that figure rising to 81% for 18-29 year-olds – a trend driven largely by YouTube.</p><p>In September 2013, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/miley-cyrus-pewdiepie-youtube-videos\">Miley Cyrus' YouTube channel alone notched up 270.1m views</a>, with strong showings from other artists like Katy Perry (162.1m) and Avicii (105m) indicating music's popularity on YouTube.</p><p>At the indier end of the scale, label Cooking Vinyl has said it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/04/record-labels-making-money-youtube\">makes an average of $5,000 per million views on YouTube</a>, with its distribution manager predicting that YouTube will become \"our most important revenue stream in the future\".</p><p>YouTube has been building up its music activities for some time, too. Examples include <a href=\"http://musically.com/2013/05/10/streams-and-video-views-now-count-towards-riaa-gold-and-platinum-awards/\">working with Billboard and industry body the RIAA</a> in the US to make YouTube views count towards, respectively, the Hot 100 singles chart and gold and platinum awards; <a href=\"http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.youtube.com/en//yt/playbook/media/pdfs/playbook-music-guide.pdf\">launching a \"Playbook\" guide</a> to help musicians get more out of YouTube; and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/dg-playlister.html\">becoming one of the BBC's launch partners</a> for its Playlister digital music service.</p><p>YouTube launching a full subscription service has some intriguing implications for existing streaming music services, though. It's unclear how much it would complement rather than compete with Google Play Music All Access, for example, with that service part of Google's Android business.</p><p>Another rival would be Vevo, the music videos service that not only uses YouTube as its main distribution channel, but which counts Google as one of its shareholders <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/2/4488400/youtube-renews-vevo-deal-buys-stake-in-company-music-videos\">following an investment earlier this year</a>.</p><p>Vevo's latest metrics show it generating 4bn monthly streams in June 2013, with mobile and connected TV apps accounting for 30% of those views. A mobile-focused YouTube music service would be a strong competitor for those eyeballs. YouTube recently said that mobile devices now account for 40% of its total views, up from 25% this time last year.</p><p>A dedicated YouTube music service will also pose stiff competition for Spotify, Deezer, Rdio and other on-demand streaming firms, and could even hasten Apple's transformation of iTunes from a downloads store into a streaming service – something that has so far focused on personal radio service iTunes Radio.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420828535|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|b234d21cdcb18bb26bf8d2026b67bbbf9b3e8d72 -->",

        "headline":"Labels launching Transmitter YouTube channel to promote British music",
        "body":"<p>British music labels are launching their own YouTube channel, Transmitter, to promote UK artists with a mixture of live performances, interviews and album playbacks.</p><p>The channel will launch on 11 November as a joint venture between industry body BPI and online video firm <a href=\"http://www.lovelive.tv/\">LoveLive</a>, which has previously worked with a range of artists, labels and brands on video projects.</p><p>Original shows on Transmitter will include collaboration-focused The Hook-Up; First Play for album playbacks; and weekly magazine show Live At 5. Fans will be encouraged to chat to artists during the live streams, while another show called Matchmaker will see artists and YouTube stars teaming up.</p><p>\"There's been a lack of platforms that promote multiple artists. It used to happen on television, but since Top of the Pops finished there's no weekly show any more in primetime that introduces consumers to what's going on in music,\" BPI chief executive Geoff Taylor told The Guardian.</p><p>\"And on YouTube, there's nothing for mainstream chart music that does that. The audience has moved from television to mobile, so we want to both help labels promote their artists and help fans find really high-quality content.\"</p><p>British stars Tinie Tempah, Drenge, The Saturdays, James Arthur, Wretch 32 and The Wanted will be among the first artists to appear on Transmitter, with overseas musicians including The Strypes, Sean Paul and Janelle Monae also set to take part.</p><p>\"I think Transmitter is a great and exciting new way for artists to talk about music in detail, from their early influences to new and exciting discoveries, all within one of the biggest platforms for music in the world,\" said Tempah in a statement.</p><p>The BPI points to a YouGov survey in May 2013 that found 77% of 16-24 year-olds in the UK listening to music on YouTube, compared to 33% listening to streaming music services like Spotify.</p><p>Some music-related brands are already taking advantage. Youth lifestyle broadcaster <a href=\"http://sbtv.co.uk/\">SB.TV</a> has notched up more than 189m views on YouTube, and recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/21/youtube-video-channel-sbtv\">won private equity backing in a deal valuing the company at £8m</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, bass-music brand <a href=\"http://www.ukfmusic.com/\">UKF</a>, which launched its UKF Dubstep and UKF Drum &amp; Bass channels in 2009, now has more than 6.1m subscribers and just under 1.5bn views across the two channels, and has used YouTube as a platform to expand into compilations, merchandise and live events.</p><p>It's no co-incidence that both SB.TV and UKF were started by teenage entrepreneurs. Transmitter is an attempt to show that established music industry companies can find similar success on YouTube, with another example being the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/23/all-def-music-youtube-label\">All Def Music channel being launched by Universal Music</a> and Def Jam founder Russell Simmons.</p><p>The BPI will take comfort from the example of Turkish industry body MÜ-YAP, whose <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/muyap\">channel aggregating videos from artists in Turkey</a> has become one of YouTube's most popular channels.</p><p>In September, MÜ-YAP generated 179m video views, making it the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/miley-cyrus-pewdiepie-youtube-videos\">third largest channel behind only Miley Cyrus and PewDiePie</a>. However, Taylor said the BPI is keen for Transmitter to not be seen as another MÜ-YAP, in terms of being driven by a trade body.</p><p>\"We're not doing this because we're a trade body or because we think it needs to be done by a trade body. We're doing it because all labels think it's something that can add to what's out there, and the BPI is a convenient place for labels to do something together,\" said Taylor.</p><p>\"The BPI does a lot of things to protect the market, but we want to promote the market as well as protecting it. We've embedded click-to-buy in the videos in quite an interesting way, so it's very much about helping the legal music market to grow.\"</p><p>It's also a positive turn in the fractious relationship between the BPI and YouTube's parent company Google. The BPI has been harrying Google in 2013 over what it sees as broken promises over its anti-piracy strategy.</p><p>In August 2012, Google announced that it would begin using \"valid copyright removal notices\" from rightsholders as one of the signals for its search rankings, with the result that sites receiving a large number of successful takedown requests <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/10/google-algorithm-hollywood-lobbyists-copyright\">might appear lower in Google's search results</a>.</p><p>Industry bodies like the BPI and its US counterpart the RIAA ramped up the number of takedown notices accordingly – <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/\">Google's own stats show it received 5.4m notices from the BPI alone</a> in the last month – but both bodies have complained vociferously that piracy sites aren't being demoted as a result.</p><p>\"Google is a very important business partner for the music industry: not just YouTube, but Google Play too. We want to work with Google growing the audience around music and monetising that music with them,\" said Taylor.</p><p>\"On search results, we still believe there's a lot more for them to do to be supporting real music and legal services ahead of sites that they know to be illegal. They need to think hard about their position on that. We want to encourage them to improve their search results so consumers are directed to legal sites, not sites full of malware and porn.\"</p><p>On YouTube's music potential, at least, the BPI and Google can find agreement. And with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/24/youtube-spotify-subscription-music-service\">YouTube rumoured to be launching a subscription-based music service</a> later this year, that role as a business partner for the British music industry may soon be strengthened even more.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420869333|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|5b016f2aab46ed4196ce20a32f8b88fca92ae46f -->",

        "headline":"Chris Hadfield: in space 'you recognise the unanimity of our existence'",
        "body":"<p>It is a disorienting business, being in space, and most astronauts in the first days of orbit scan the Earth for reminders of home. The Russians look for their great lakes; the Americans for mountain ranges. For Chris Hadfield, the former commander of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/international-space-station\" title=\"\">International Space Station</a>, it was Plank Road, a 19th-century thoroughfare running through southern Ontario, Canada. \"These guys put it there 150 years ago, and it was a neat thing for me to see from orbit. Hey, look! That's where I'm from!\" After a few days, the perceptive lens widens. \"And you just start seeing the whole world.\"</p><p>Hadfield, 54, is sipping coffee from a Nasa mug&nbsp;in the sun room of his home on Stag Island, a&nbsp;picturesque retreat 300km west of Toronto. Since returning from space last year, he has faced an old-school astronaut problem, one that general boredom with the space programme had all but erased: not just celebrity, but a sort of stunned adoration. At a recent event, he was asked in front of 5,000 people, \"What is the meaning of life?\" The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo\" title=\"\">music video</a> he shot from orbit, a version of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D67kmFzSh_o\" title=\"\">David Bowie's Space Oddity</a>, has been viewed 200m times. Hadfield's skills are extraordinary: he is a fighter pilot, a test pilot and an aeronautical engineer capable of docking a&nbsp;rocket ship (\"It's not like parking a car\"). But that's not why the world loves him. Of the hundreds of astronauts who have gone into space, none has humanised it quite the way Hadfield has. It's weird that goofy guitar playing and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pran4wUg5y4\" title=\"\">exchanging tweets with William Shatner</a> should seem remarkable, but in the context of the space station, it was. For the first time, it seemed like an extension of Earth. The night before our interview, he says, he took a stroll along the waterfront and, glancing up, remarked on the passage overhead of the International Space Station, a pinpoint of light in the darkness. \"I&nbsp;used to live there,\" he mused, with a&nbsp;casualness to make the mind boggle.</p><p>It is also the deftness with which Hadfield is able to describe his experiences, not something those with advanced engineering degrees are necessarily well primed to do. As he says diplomatically of a&nbsp;super-bright former colleague, \"He wasn't maybe gifted at interpersonal relationships.\" Hadfield, on the other hand, gives a good impression of being a regular guy. \"I look like a cop,\" he says drily, in response to being told by lots of people how cool he is, something that Helene, his wife, finds hilarious. Actually, he looks like a biology teacher; it's the moustache and the boyish enthusiasm. \"You get the question all the time: when are normal people going to be able to go to space? Well, I'm kind of a&nbsp;normal person.\"</p><p>Hadfield isn't worshipped at home. At one point he asks the photographer to avoid his shoes, because Helene hates them and will kill him if she sees them in the shoot. \"What a wonderful wife you are,\" he says when she brings him more coffee and Helene replies with a withering look.</p><p>These qualities have served to head off a&nbsp;syndrome long recognised by Nasa as problematic for returning astronauts: the crashing anticlimax and existential difficulties of life after space travel. Hadfield was a veteran by the time he took off from Kazakhstan last year – it was his third space flight – but he was still braced for the possibility that if the mechanics of the mission didn't kill him, the mind-warp just might. He wouldn't merely be travelling in space this time; he would be living there for half a year, on a space station the size of a five-bedroom house, with up to five other people. \"We are our own town,\" he says. \"Every single skill that exists in a town, we have to have on board. There are six of us, then three leave and&nbsp;are replaced by another three. But if they have a problem on the way up, then there's three of you. So every trio that goes up has to have all the resident skills necessary for the entire time.\" And if something goes wrong? If the one doctor on board dies? He smiles. \"Nobody can come get us.\"</p><p>In 1992, when Hadfield was selected for Canada's space programme, he had no real expectation of ever going to space. Most astronauts don't. Two decades of training in everything from emergency medicine (he can perform minor surgery) to Russian (he is fluent) might land them only a desk job, albeit a highly charged desk at Mission Control.</p><p>For Hadfield, it was miraculous enough merely to find himself in training. Before 1983, Canada didn't even have a space programme, so in 1969, when nine-year-old Hadfield watched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/neil-armstrong\" title=\"\">Neil Armstrong</a> walk on the moon and decided he was going to become an astronaut, it was a thoroughly absurd resolution. Or, as he puts it, \"absurd, but not impossible. Just look at some of the things we accept as professions: watch America's Next Top Model! Or the Olympics. These things are absurd. But we're human and that's what we do. And so I&nbsp;figured, what the heck, it interests me.\"</p><p>He has since gone on two spacewalks, something a total of 200 people in history have done. He has piloted a Soyuz rocket, which has&nbsp;a&nbsp;four-second response window between system failure and death. His coolness of temperament, of course, is part of what recommended him in the first place.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421116730'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/23/1382528923296/Hadfield-on-the-space-shu-007.jpg' alt='Hadfield on the space shuttle Atlantis in November 1995' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hadfield on the space shuttle Atlantis in November 1995, photographed by astronauts on Russia’s Mir space station. Photograph: Nasa/Reuters/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>Hadfield trained in the Canadian air force (his father was a commercial pilot for Air Canada), got selected for test pilot school and eventually won a place on the space programme, one of four recruits from more than 5,000 applicants. Then, and later on at Nasa, he passed tests that would freak most of us out at a theoretical level. Would-be astronauts are put through potentially stressful experiences to flush out fears that might compromise a mission, such as claustrophobia. \"They zip you inside a beach ball, make it mostly dark and don't tell you when you'll be let out. If you're the type of person that would bother, you won't get selected.\" How did he react? \"I thought it was great. I was in a small, dark place with good air and nothing to do for a while. Beautiful.\"</p><p>Given the probability that he would never get to use these skills in space, Hadfield developed a&nbsp;singular philosophy: \"Every single thing that you learn really just gives you more comfort. It's something I counsel kids all the time: if someone is willing to teach you something for free, take them up on it. Do it. Every single time. All it does is make you more likely to be able to succeed. And it's kind of a nice way to go through life.\"</p><p>It is one of the homilies of An Astronaut's Guide To Life On Earth, Hadfield's new memoir, in which he extrapolates general lessons from the space station and his years of training. The advice is, for the most part, counterintuitive or at least countercultural: when you're piloting what amounts to a large bomb into orbit, it's a very good idea, he writes, to \"sweat the small stuff\". The main question an astronaut asks himself during the insanely dangerous 10 minutes after takeoff is: \"OK, what's the next thing that will kill me?\" To give an idea of the danger: \"No aeroplane you've ever gotten into had less than thousands of flights before they took their first passenger. Thousands. Because vehicles are unsafe at first. We only flew the shuttle 135 times total. Every single flight was a radical test flight. With really high stakes.\"</p><p>Avoiding paralysis in those first moments is a&nbsp;question of moving through the minutiae of checklists and protocols. Before each of Hadfield's three space flights, he went through thousands of drills and simulations at Nasa, in a bid to anticipate every possible emergency, including the death of a loved one on Earth, and his own death (referred to unofficially as \"death sims\", to which spouses are invited). On the last mission, this exercise was, sadly, put to the test. \"<a href=\"http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/marshburn-th.html\" title=\"\">Tom [Marshburn</a>]'s mum died while we were up there. We had talked about it in advance: six guys in our 30s, 40s and 50s, someone is probably going to lose a family member over six months up there. So we simulated; how are we going to support each other, what are we going to do? Then, when it happened, and we got a call from Houston saying we want a private medical conference with Tom, we knew.\" (By comparison, Hadfield says, preparing for one's own death is relatively easy. \"If I die, that's not my concern. I was alive and now I'm dead, so be it.\")</p><p>You can imagine Hadfield driving his family mad with these disaster simulations, but it's a habit of mind he can't lose. \"I treat everything that way.\"</p><p>Such as? \"In an elevator: I get in, and I recognise the fragility of the environment. And the skills set of the people in there. I&nbsp;naturally go, OK, elevators stop all the time, it's just cables pulling us up and down; what am I&nbsp;going to do if there's a&nbsp;problem with it? How will I react? I won't scream and drop to the floor, or grab the wall; that has no purpose.\" Everything is about the preparation and, in space at least, about the manual override of earthly instincts: fight or flight, for instance, isn't helpful when your spaceship goes wrong. Hadfield blinks in astonishment at the way non-astronauts behave in an emergency.</p><p>Details about life in zero gravity are always compelling: \"If you're talking to the Royal Bank of&nbsp;Canada, or a kindergarten, or the UN, that's really all they want to know.\" Sleeping on the space station is a question merely of floating, \"no&nbsp;need for a mattress or pillow\", Hadfield writes. Space food can be bland; to season it, they use pepper suspended in olive oil, so it doesn't fly&nbsp;up and scatter, and make everyone sneeze. And there is no washing of clothes in space; water doesn't function as a cleaning agent the way it does on Earth, so they wear their socks and underpants until they fall apart, then burn them. (Before the mission, Hadfield had wondered if the&nbsp;space station would smell bad, but it doesn't, he says. He thinks it might be because in zero gravity, clothes float away from the skin.)</p><p>The spacewalk is the pinnacle of any mission, and something that only a minority of astronauts get to do. Each spacesuit costs upwards of $1m, and is effectively a one-man space station. If&nbsp;it's possible to experience claustrophobia and agoraphobia at once, the effect of being trapped in one of these things while floating in the universe would do it. Hadfield, of course, doesn't have phobias. But he is human. \"Spacewalking trumps everything. Viscerally, it is a phenomenal place to be; to be able to glance right and see the world, glance left and see the universe, and realise for a moment that you're holding on to your known existence with one hand. That's the thing.\"</p><p>Spacewalking isn't how it looks in the new blockbuster <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/28/gravity-review-venice-film-festival\" title=\"\">Gravity</a>; it's so dangerous, Hadfield says (a leak in the suit would result in ruptured lungs, burst eardrums and rapid loss of consciousness), that you don't muck around out there, as Sandra Bullock and George Clooney do before everything goes pear-shaped. (Hadfield did enjoy the film, though. \"How did they make all that look so good? Of course, when you come out of your spacesuit, you're not wearing a tank top and shorts. Sandra Bullock looked really good in those! We wear a diaper and a liquid cooling garment. We don't look nearly so good.\")</p><p>On his first spacewalk in 2001, Hadfield was asked to float to the end of the space station and dismantle an antenna. Before he could finish, it exploded. \"I was trying to grab stuff and part of the pieces got away. So Houston said, OK, hold on while we sort out what to do.\" For 15 minutes, he floated above the Earth with nothing to do. \"This was an early part of the station, so it didn't have big solid metal handrails. It had little fabric rails. I'm holding on, thinking, it's like a cheap suitcase handle and that is my link to everybody and everything.\" Once he had stabilised, he actually let go. \"I just sat there floating, trying to soak up the experience. Alone in the universe, with that view.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421116731'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/23/1382529291501/Chris-Hadfield-010.jpg' alt='Chris Hadfield' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>‘#7;You get the question all the time: when are normal people going to go to space? Well, I’m kind of normal,’ says Hadfield. Photograph: Derek Shapton for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Did he feel lonely? \"No. You feel hugely honoured and privileged; this is a glimpse into an understanding of ourselves that no one has seen. I found it overpoweringly visual. You don't have random thoughts. The onslaught of what was pouring in through my eyeballs was filling up&nbsp;everything. The textures and colours of the world are constantly changing, and a&nbsp;whole continent is rolling by next to you, while this huge gold and silver and white spaceship is there in your hand, and if you just look behind it, there's the whole universe. Infinity.\"</p><p>When Chris Hadfield was a child, his teacher took the class to a deserted parking lot, gave them each a piece of string and told them to mark off a&nbsp;square foot of ground and spend the hour studying it. \"It was just wild weeds and stuff. I don't remember a&nbsp;lot of grade six, but I remember that clearly; that if you take the time to notice, there's a&nbsp;fascinating amount of things happening in one square foot of earth. It taught us appreciation and a little bit of ecology; but it was a real perspective-building thing for me. To recognise the world of wonder that exists in this little square of normal nature. And that same idea carries through to everything.&nbsp;If you notice the minutiae around you, I don't know how you could ever be bored.\"</p><p>Hadfield is talking about the adjustments he had to make after returning to Earth from the space station. Earlier generations of astronauts, lacking anyone to ask or help from Nasa, had a lot of psychological problems. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/24/biography.features\" title=\"\">The Apollo guys</a>, some of them hadn't had time to think about what this was going to be like. And they didn't have anyone to talk to about it. So a couple of them came back fundamentally changed, religiously. Or alcoholic. Because they couldn't handle the change in perspective: to be able to cover up the world with their thumb; to see themselves that way.\"</p><p>It was easier for Hadfield and his crew. Since the 1960s, the space agency has developed a&nbsp;rigorous therapeutic framework for returning astronauts.\"We had people to talk to and examples to follow. I don't know of any recent astronauts who've had an epiphany based on space travel.\"</p><p>Still, pragmatism has its limitations, and the question of what happens existentially when one is able to look down on the Earth is one Hadfield has thought a lot about. \"I've had a&nbsp;chance to see something that is way outside everybody else's frame of reference and gives a&nbsp;perspective that is very different from everyone else's. So how do you then rationalise that with the rest of your life?\"</p><p>He is quiet for a few moments. \"I just have to make it part of who I am and be happy with it and accept it and not let it get in the way. And for me it becomes very enriching. You've probably eaten something really delicious at some point in your life. The best thing you've ever had. Does that mean all food from then on is terrible? Because you had ambrosia 14 years ago? Probably not. You'll say, this food is really good, and I had ambrosia 14 years ago. I'm a lucky guy. That's how I deal with the madness, I think.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-408764336\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/5/13/130513Hadfield-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/5/13/130513Hadfield_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/5/13/130513Hadfield/130513Hadfield.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/5/13/130513Hadfield-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/5/13/130513Hadfield_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>And retaining a sense of wonder about things on Earth? \"It's a deliberate choice. Cynicism is the easiest of all reactions, right? But it's also so disappointing and self-defeating.\"</p><p>Hadfield was determined to make the most of his five months on the space station; for there to be fun as well as medical and ecological research; art as well as science. One of his favourite experiments on board came at the suggestion of the Japanese space agency: trying out the Japanese art form of expressing the reflection of the moon in water; only, in this case, it was the reflection of the Earth. \"I had to build a&nbsp;big cylinder and squirt water into it, with the Earth out the window, and set up a camera to get pictures of the Earth coming through these water droplets floating around. That's not my normal job, right? But I really found it delightful. It was one of my favourite things to do up there. They called it Blue Earth Gazing. I&nbsp;really liked Blue Earth Gazing.\"</p><p>The recording of Space Oddity came about by chance, at the suggestion of Hadfield's son, Evan (he has three grown-up children), who had to pester his dad into doing it. \"I was like, I've got stuff going on up here. I don't really care about Space Oddity. But he was right. The reaction was phenomenal. When I landed, the first human being I met was a search and rescue guy I've known for years who reached into the Soyuz and said, 'Chris, I saw your video, it was <em>great</em>.'\" Hadfield laughs. \"I just rode a spaceship home from space, and that's what you want to comment on?\"</p><p>Being married to an astronaut is a tough gig. You hardly see them and there's a good chance they will die on the job. You are also competing for their interest with the universe. I ask Hadfield if, in his professional lifetime, it had been possible to undertake the two-year mission to Mars, he would have hesitated to say yes.</p><p>\"Not for a second,\" he says. \"Not for a second.\" He looks at me in amazement. \"Would you?\" Er. \"Think about it. What were you doing between 1992 and 1994?\" Um. \"Right. You can't remember. So why wouldn't you do something extraordinary?\"</p><p>Commercial space travel may at some point lessen the mystique of space, but it's a mistake to think of it as uniquely commercial, Hadfield says. \"The shuttle was built by Rockwell for a profit. The space station is run by Boeing. Space flight has always been commercial.\" But to operate in a&nbsp;private capacity, outside of government, would be new. Yes, he says, Richard Branson has called for advice on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/07/justin-bieber-space-virgin-galactic\" title=\"\">Virgin Galactic</a> project, and some former Nasa colleagues have been signed up as pilots. What of Branson's plan to launch Paris Hilton into space? \"I'm all for the idea. I&nbsp;commend him for it. But it's not much of a space flight. I'm not sure that she knows what she's paying for. She may think she's going to be Sandra Bullock, see the universe and stars whipping by. None of that's happening. They're just going to go up and fall back down again. They'll get a few minutes of weightlessness, and they'll see the black of the universe. And they'll see the curve of the Earth and the horizon, because they'll be above the air. But whether that'll be enough for the quarter-million-dollar price tag? I don't know.\"</p><p>There's something else, too. \"Eventually they'll crash one. Because it's hard. They're discovering how hard. They wanted to fly years ago and faced a lot of obstacles, but he's a&nbsp;brave entrepreneur and I hope he succeeds. The more people who can&nbsp;see the world this way, the better off we are.\"</p><p>Being in space, Hadfield says, \"you recognise the unanimity of our existence. The commonality.\" The reason his Space Oddity video was such a phenomenon, he says, is not that it told us&nbsp;something about space, but that it told us something about ourselves. \"It helped show people something I understand very well: that this is an extension of human consciousness. Human understanding. Human perspective on ourselves.
