Yet these new figures show that while large firms have little difficulty tapping debt markets, SMEs – and particular young, fast-growing firms – continue to struggle to access growth capital.</p> <p>Both policy-makers and financial institutions need to do more to help fast-growing SMEs access finance. The British Business Bank has a huge role to play here, and should be enhanced with additional capital to help plug the gap.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T13:42:49.868Z\">at 1.42pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-526f8169e4b0ffc73763b618\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T09:47:50.222Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets are up</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The major European markets are all slightly higher this morning:</p> <p><strong>FTSE 100</strong>: +0.36% at 6,749.05</p> <p><strong>CAC 40</strong>: +0.17% at 4,258.99</p> <p><strong>DAX 30</strong>: +0.07% at 8,985.04</p> <p><strong>IBEX</strong>: +0.55% at 9,789.2</p> <p><strong>FTSE MIB</strong>: +1.3% at 19,073.95</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> is the biggest riser on the <strong>FTSE 100</strong>, with shares up 5% at 475p.</p> <p>The company is flying high after a better than expected set of third-quarter results which included a dividend hike and a plegde to return proceeds of asset sales to shareholders.

        "headline":"Taking on the big six energy giants is not a leftwing delusion – ask Hungary",
        "body":"<p>For daring to deviate from the neoliberal script on the subject of energy company profiteering, Labour leader Ed Miliband was portrayed as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/ed-miliband-energy-price-freeze-tories\" title=\"\">a sinister hardcore Marxist</a> whose dastardly plan was to fulfil his late father's dream and transform Britain into the old Soviet Union. According to this dominant narrative, if you want to take any meaningful action against the \"big six\" energy giants, and interfere with market forces, you must be some kind of unreconstructed Bolshevik – or at the very least a misguided leftie who wants to take the country back to the nightmare 1970s, the decade when the gap between rich and poor in Britain reached its lowest level in history.</p><p>However, in another European country, a political leader has been getting far tougher with profiteering energy companies than Miliband has suggested. In this country, the government has imposed a cut of over 20% in energy bills – a 10% reduction came into force in January, a further 11.1% cut will be implemented in November. It is also drafting a bill that would ban utility companies from paying dividends to shareholders. The aim of the government is to return natural monopolies to the public sector, to operate on a non-profit basis. \"We must once and for all bring an end to the era where energy providers can ride roughshod over people,\" the country's leader declared.</p><p>So where is this bastion of socialism in Europe, and who is the wild-eyed leftist who is leading it? Step forward <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/hungary-political-regression-repression-racism\" title=\"\">Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary</a>. The man who has declared war on profiteering energy companies is none other than the fiercely anti-communist leader of the centre-right Fidesz party.</p><p>In a recent interview with the Daily Telegraph, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/hungary/10373959/Viktor-Orban-interview-Patriotism-is-a-good-thing.html\" title=\"\">Orbán talked of his admiration for Margaret Thatcher</a>. \"Her role was very important: she was always in favour of freedom, always anti-communist,\" he declared. Yet ironically, it's this member of the Iron Lady fan club who is carrying out policies in Hungary that would be denounced as \"communist\" if anyone on the left in Britain was brave enough to suggest them.</p><p>With elections due next spring, we can, of course, question Orbán's motives in moving against the energy companies. However, the very fact that his government is prepared to act highlights sharply the contrast with the inertia of the UK's Conservative-led coalition.</p><p>Fidesz contends that there were 15 price increases in gas bills during the period 2002-10, when they were in opposition, and that urgent action was essential to ensure cheaper energy bills for households and businesses. Hungarian politicians have sneered at Orbán's populist stance on energy, but the government's policies have brought relief to ordinary people and made everyday life more bearable in a country where around 20% of the household budget was going on gas bills. It's the government's interventionist approach on energy prices that helps explain its commanding lead in the opinion polls – a recent poll showed that the governing coalition was 15% ahead of its nearest rivals and it's likely that Orbán will be returned to power in next year's general election.</p><p>Conservatives in Britain could, if they were smart, learn a lesson from Fidesz's brand of economic Gaullism, yet their commitment to market forces and the financial backing the Conservative party received from the City, means that they're likely to stay wedded to the current unpopular and discredited model. That's even when Thatcherite figures from the 80s and 90s such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/22/john-major-profits-tax-energy-companies-price-rises\" title=\"\">Sir John Major</a> and Peter Lilley are calling for changes.</p><p>The hysterical reaction to Miliband's extremely modest plans for a price freeze demonstrates just how out on a limb the UK is. In the genuinely democratic postwar era it would have been unthinkable that our utilities would one day be privately owned (and for a large part owned by foreign companies), and would then hit households and businesses with above-inflation rises year after year, and that the UK government would simply sit back and do nothing. But that's where we've got to.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421136633|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|053813f7a033694ab5c80b69d2bec0d8e6d95799 -->",

        "headline":"Green taxes will ultimately cut our bills as well as saving energy",
        "body":"<p>The collateral damage in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/ed-davey-green-levy-energy\" title=\"\">great energy debate</a> is mounting by the day. As the party leaders scrabble to come up with something to say in response to public concern about bills, the costs so far include their reputations for sound economics, the investment plans of many businesses and, potentially, the transition to a low-carbon future. Never mind the grandchildren's planet: burn, baby, burn.</p><p>As bills go up between 8.2% (SSE) and 10.4% (npower), there is no doubt about the pain. The average bill is £1,267. This hits household budgets hard and has been a significant factor undermining consumers' confidence about spending.</p><p>The blame game has begun. Labour blames the energy companies, and wants a freeze. John Major implicitly agrees by proposing a windfall tax on their profits. The Tory right blames onshore wind, ironically the cheapest of renewables. The energy companies blame green taxes, and want them cut.</p><p>The prime minister, once long ago pictured <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/27/david-cameron-eco-image-retoxification\" title=\"\">hugging a husky in the Arctic</a>, duly panics despite the risk to his integrity and image. He promises to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/23/energy-industry-competition-test-cameron\" title=\"\">cut green taxes</a> even though his own Tory manifesto pledged: \"We will increase the proportion of tax revenues accounted for by environmental taxes.\"</p><p>Is anyone right in the blame game? Let's start with the companies. Like most businesses, they are not above some jiggery-pokery with estimated bills, some fancy tax-dodging, and the selective presentation of the facts. They have repeatedly run scare stories about the cost of the regulatory requirements imposed on them.</p><p>Energy UK, their lobbying body, claimed last year that the eco subsidy (which helps the fuel-poor and those living in leaky old houses) would cost £1.7bn to £2.35bn. In fact there is a trade in the insulating projects that the companies have to undertake. Those who do too many can sell to those who have fallen short, and that market shows that the true cost is exactly what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/11/osborne-plan-cut-energy-company-obligation\" title=\"\">the government planned, at £1.3bn a year</a>.</p><p>There is a difference, though, between playing grandmother's footsteps with the regulator, self-serving lobbying, and the more significant charge that they rig the market. The market has been inspected repeatedly, most recently by Ofgem in its retail market review. The charge does not stick. Gas prices are the lowest in western Europe, and electricity prices the third lowest. Nor do prices go up more quickly than down.</p><p>Far from being bullying behemoths, the energy giants are looking like threatened dinosaurs. The profits of all six are rising with recovery, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4b39ace2-0048-11e3-ba6b-00144feab7de.html#axzz2ivIgwFzX\" title=\"\">but last year they totalled £3.74bn</a>, which is a little more than half the profits of just one bank, Barclays. Their way of making money – selling more energy from big power stations – is under global attack.</p><p>Those low-energy light bulbs are working, so electricity demand is still below its peaks in Europe. The trend for householders to produce their own electricity is hitting the giants hard, as are renewables. When the wind blows and the sun shines, electricity can flood on to national grids. In Germany the wholesale electricity price has on occasion gone negative, which is a power company's nightmare if you are trying to make a return on big coal, gas or nuclear to pay to your pension-fund shareholders.</p><p>Nor are green taxes to blame. They are too small. About 9% of energy bills are government charges. Some 5% go on the eco subsidy. Without these policies, bills would be more painful for the most vulnerable, and higher for many others.</p><p>About 4% goes to support low-carbon electricity from renewables. These policies decarbonise the electricity sector, tackling climate change. They also give us energy security, and protect the consumer against volatile fossil fuel prices.</p><p>Overall, the government's policies – backed until recently by three-party consensus – are forecast by Whitehall economists to cut energy bills, not increase them. They <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/27/rising-energy-bills-reduced-climate-policies\" title=\"\">will save consumers about £166 a year</a> (or 11%) by 2020 thanks to energy saving and diversification from fossil fuels.</p><p>The only easy green tax to ditch is the carbon price floor, an unnecessary charge on electricity generated from oil, coal and gas. It is not needed to decarbonise electricity but it collects £600m this year, adding £5 to bills. It will steadily rise to add more than £20. The Liberal Democrats did not want it, but George Osborne insisted on the revenue.</p><p>It is possible, of course, that some programmes now funded from energy bills could be paid from taxation, but ministers will find that they cannot ditch these policies. First, it would be foolish to raise future energy bills by slowing energy-saving and the shift to renewables.</p><p>Second, there is a legislated fuel poverty target, and ministers would find themselves fighting a judicial review. The same applies to renewables, as we agreed an EU legal target of 15% of our energy from renewables by 2020.</p><p>The real blame for high bills is our excessive reliance on gas and coal, and the world market price. Not even the British&nbsp;prime minister has much power over that.</p><p>Sadly, few people these days read Cervantes. David Cameron should. He looks increasingly like Don Quixote, tilting at windmills. <em>  </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421061363|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|e460ea6628486f7390e9f4e95806ac3f3523f17f -->",

        "headline":"Five questions that the big six energy firms must answer",
        "body":"<p>The bosses of the big six energy companies will appear before the energy and climate change select committee on 29 October. The powerful group of MPs, chaired by Tim Yeo, will grill them on green levies, profit levels – and why consumers face such big increases in their bills. These are the questions they should ask:</p><p></p><h2><strong>Why have you increased household energy prices by up to 10% when inflation is almost a quarter of this?</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>The companies will argue that their costs have risen hugely because of wholesale power price increases and \"green\" levies. Don't take this at face value: companies buy a portfolio of future contracts lasting many years to ensure that their wholesale supplies will meet future retail demand. If they have underestimated their needs, that is their responsibility – and they could choose to absorb that cost. No one knows how much the power companies have bought in advance – and at what price – so independent experts have to take their arguments on trust. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/oct/10/green-taxes-energy-bill-fuel-sse-price-rising\" title=\"\">Green levies make up only 9% of the overall bill currently, a figure that will rise to 14% by 2020</a>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>How can you say the retail energy market is competitive when more than 95% of households use of one of the big six firms?</strong></h2><p>The companies always argue that they are constrained from profiteering because consumers are free to switch to one of their competitors if they don't like price rises. But the dominance of the big six makes it very hard for small independents to enter the market. A consumer who consults one of the switching services will invariably be offered a change to another of the big six. Why is it that 30 years since the market began to be liberalised, a group of enormous firms still have a stranglehold over the sector? And why do they all put their prices up pretty much at exactly the same time, if they are not acting in concert in some way?</p><p></p><h2><strong>Why shouldn't the big six have their control of the wholesale power market broken up and separated, as Ed Miliband is arguing?</strong></h2><p>Companies such as Scottish Power will argue that currently they are making losses in both retail supply and wholesale power generation. But that is unusual. When companies are making massive profits in power generation they always say it is illegal for them to cross-subsidise their retail side, but the fact is they can choose where to take losses. It is also worth remembering that Centrica, the owner of British Gas, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/27/centrica-british-gas-increase-profit\" title=\"\">spent £500m buying back its own shares earlier this year</a> to boost shareholder returns.</p><p>The big six claim the 5% margin they earn in retail is very low. However, this figure is in line with the big supermarkets. In Northern Ireland, where prices are capped, suppliers make just 2% profit.</p><p>Small retailers say it is hard to build market share – partly, they say, because the big six have the wholesale power market sewn up. Miliband is right to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/26/energy-bill-freeze-consumer-groups-welcome\" title=\"\">pledge an end to \"vertical integration\"</a>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>How much money do your trading arms  make each year, and why do you not openly report those numbers to Ofgem and the public?</strong></h2><p>The big six will tell you that all their accounts are open to Ofgem scrutiny already, so they have nothing to lose from an open competitive review of the kind demanded by David Cameron. But they do not reveal their trading profits. In fact, the companies are reluctant to reveal even how many staff they employ in these operations – whose job is basically to speculate on market movements. Anecdotal evidence suggests this is a huge money-spinner. The MPs should push them to reveal everything about such departments, including whether they have given details to ongoing probes into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/06/gas-price-fixing-investigation-citigroup\" title=\"\">gas trading irregularities</a>.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Why have many of the big six been involved in mis-selling, overcharging or other abuses, and do you think – like the banks – that you are too big to fail?</strong></h2><p>There's probably no answer to the first of these, except \"sorry\". Days ago, the last of the big six, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/22/scottish-power-pay-misleading-customers-ofgem\" title=\"\">Scottish Power, paid an £8.5m fine</a> after Ofgem found inadequate training and monitoring of staff had led to inaccurate information on annual charges, consumption calculations and tariffs being given out. E.ON, which was fined £1.7m in 2012 for overcharging, had to pay an additional £2.5m this summer to help its poorest customers meet their fuel bills this winter after it was found to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jul/09/eon-fined-energy-saving-lightbulbs\" title=\"\">selling low-energy light bulbs it should have given away</a>. SSE was fined £10.5m for \"prolonged and extensive\" mis-selling, while British Gas was fined £1m two years ago for misreporting how much energy it had supplied.</p><p>Too big to fail? Energy companies seem to be claiming, like the banks, that we need them more than they need us. They repeatedly warn that if they are not allowed to make profits they won't invest. Yet they've clearly not invested enough in the past, while their dominance in the market may have deterred other potential investors.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420958981|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|1a629c4ed9a928fa035deae895e72a882c5daef8 -->",

        "headline":"Do Britain's energy firms serve the public interest?",
        "body":"<h2>Yes. The market is dysfunctional. We need to shape dynamic capitalism for the good of society, argues Will Hutton<br /></h2><p>Capitalism is the best and worst of systems. Left to itself, it will embrace the new and relentlessly follow the logic of prices and profit, a revolutionary catalyst for necessary change. But it can only ever react to today's prices, which cannot capture what will happen tomorrow. So, left to itself, capitalism will neglect both the future and the cohesion of the society in which it trades.</p><p>What we know, especially after the financial crisis of 2008, is that we can't leave capitalism to itself. If we want it to work at its best, combining its dynamism with public and social objectives, there is no alternative but to <em>design</em> the markets in which it operates. We also need to try to embed into its calculus wider obligations than the simple pursuit of economic logic. Otherwise, there lies disaster.</p><p>If this is now obvious in banking, it has just become so in energy. Since 2004, consumers' energy bills have nearly trebled, far more than the rise in energy prices. The energy companies demand returns nearly double those in mass retailing for a good that is essential to life.</p><p>This would be problematic at any time, but when wages in real terms have fallen by some 10% in five years it constitutes a crisis. John Major, pointing to the mass of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/22/john-major-windfall-tax-energy\" title=\"\">citizens who now face a choice between eating or being warm</a> – as he made the case for a windfall profits tax on energy companies – drove home the social reality. The energy market, as it currently operates, is dysfunctional and illegitimate. There has to be change.</p><p>The problem is simple. The dynamics of today's electricity and gas markets do not create companies or business strategies in which public interest objectives and social obligations are sufficiently prioritised. Instead, every dysfunction is passed on to consumers in their bills, which have become the most regressive element in disposable household incomes. Energy costs are now as toxic as Mrs Thatcher's poll tax, perhaps even more so. BBC Radio 4's <em>Question Time</em> audience cheer the idea of nationalising the energy companies.</p><p>The design of this market is now universally recognised as wrong, universally, that is, while excepting the regulator and the government. The energy companies are able to disguise their cost structures because there is no general pool into which they are required to sell their energy – instead opaquely striking complex internal deals between their generating and supply arms. Yet this is an industry where production and consumption is 24/7 and whose production logic requires such energy pooling. The sector has informally agreed, without regulatory challenge, that it should seek a supply margin of 5% – twice that of retailing. Hence, without overt collusion all the recent proposed tariff increases are around 10% to achieve this target benchmark.</p><p>On top the industry also requires long-term price guarantees for investment in renewables and nuclear without any comparable quid pro quo in lowering its target cost of capital. The national grid, similarly privately owned, balances its profit maximising aims with a need to ensure security of supply. And every ambitious commitment to decarbonise British energy supply by 2030 is passed on to the consumer, rich and poor alike, whatever their capacity to pay. This is a market designed by its hapless regulator, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ofgem\" title=\"\">Ofgem</a>, to produce an energy poll tax. It will also lead to negligible new investment unless backed by government guarantees and subsidies. It could scarcely be worse – and with so much energy capacity closing in the next two years constitutes a first-order national crisis.</p><p>Importantly, David Cameron's first reaction is not to order a competition commission inquiry, so far resisted by the regulator and, with the honourable exception of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/edf\" title=\"\">EDF</a>, by most of the industry. This would have been the strategic response to what is clearly a strategic problem, and would expose the series of wrong decisions taken by Ofgem and indeed the government. Instead, the response is to dodge the strategic question and join the climate change deniers by blaming the problem on the alleged millstone of Britain's green commitments. It is Cameron at his slick and short-term worst.</p><p>For a start, only &pound;112 of the average &pound;1,415 energy bill is represented by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy\" title=\"\">green</a> commitments. Some of these are the subsidies to support investment in renewables, notably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower\" title=\"\">wind</a>; some to promote more energy-efficient homes, typically older houses occupied by Britain's poorest; and some to install <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/18/smart-meters-uk-hacking-electricity\" title=\"\">smart meters</a> that will empower consumers to better control their energy usage as well as automatically buying for them energy from the cheapest supplier. Which of these does Cameron wish to abandon? And if he scrapped the lot the reality of a badly designed market would remain, bringing scant relief on bills while forgoing huge benefits.</p><p>The real enemy of the piece is that the current energy industry structure is pitched in a no man's land. It is not the deregulated market of the imagination of an ideological pamphlet from the <a href=\"http://www.iea.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Institute of Economic Affairs</a>, which would deliver neither investment, nor low prices, nor decarbonisation nor security of supply. But neither is it a structure in which there is an intelligent amalgam of public guarantees and private company dynamism. It is a bodge.</p><p>The general direction of reform is clear. Energy companies should be required to sell their electricity into a pool whose price would become the base price for retail. This would remove at a stroke the ability to mask the relationship between costs and prices: retail prices would fall as well as rise clearly and unambiguously as pool prices changed.</p><p>The grid, which delivers electricity and gas into our homes and is the guarantor that the lights won't go out, must be in public ownership, as is Network Rail in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/rail-transport\" title=\"\">rail industry</a>. It should also be connected to a pan-European grid for additional security. Green commitments should be paid out of general taxation to strip the poll tax element out of energy bills, with the rich paying more than the poor for the public good. Because returns on investment take decades in the energy industry, despite what free market fundamentalists argue, the state has to overtly underwrite energy investment as it is doing with nuclear and renewables.</p><p>But the quid pro quo, as argued by energy expert <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/helm-dieter\" title=\"\">Professor Dieter Helm</a>, should be that energy companies have to accept that their cost of capital is thus lower because the risk element has been withdrawn – a new compact between the energy sector and government. They are, after all, utilities – a crucial part of our social as well as economic landscape.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/24/ed-miliband-labour-freeze-prices-2017\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband's proposed price freeze</a> has caught the headlines. It is in effect a windfall tax on energy companies as they pay to hedge prices in the forward markets but which will be felt by the consumer as a price freeze. Less discussed are the other elements in his policy – notably pooling supply – which cautiously head in the right direction. Effective capitalism requires careful design and organisation, along with firms that combine a business and social purpose. Banking learnt this lesson: energy companies are next in line. What we should embrace is the revival of the mixed economy – a precondition for a return to the prosperity and productivity that was sacrificed on the altar of market fundamentalism.</p><h2>No. Far from a return to nationalisation, more liberalisation is what is required, argues Philip Booth<br /></h2><p>The British energy industry has gone from nationalisation to privatisation and back to government control in the space of 25 years. Although the energy industry is nominally in private hands, we have exactly the same approach of government picking winners and dictating investment plans that was followed with disastrous consequences from the second world war to the mid 1980s.</p><p>In the 1970s and early 1980s, the consumer got a raw deal because long-term investment plans and contracts promoted by the government required electricity companies to use expensive indigenous coal. Government planning also dictated the development of a nuclear programme that is probably one of the most expensive government project disasters in history, losing &pound;32bn.</p><p>The energy industry is, once again, controlled by the state. The same underlying drivers dictate policy in the new world of state control. It is not rational economic thinking and public-interested civil servants that determine policy, but interest groups. Going back 30 years, it was the coal industry – both management and unions – and the nuclear industry that dictated policy. Tony Benn said he had &quot;never known such a well-organised scientific, industrial and technical lobby&quot;. Today, it is green pressure groups, EU parliamentarians and commissioners and, often, the energy industry itself that are loading burdens on to consumers. When the state controls the energy industry, whether through the back or the front door, it is vested interests that get their way and the consumer who pays.</p><p>So how did we get to where we are today? In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the industry was entirely privatised. It was recognised that there were natural monopoly elements and so prices in these areas were regulated. At the same time, the regulator was given a duty to promote competition. From 1998, all domestic energy consumers could switch supplier for the first time and then wholesale markets were liberalised, allowing energy companies to source the cheapest forms of energy. Arguably, this was the high water mark of the liberalisation of the industry.</p><p>Privatisation was a great success. Instead of investment policy being dictated by the whims of government and interest groups, it became dictated by long-term commercial considerations. From 1986 to 1997, domestic gas bills fell by an average of 2.6% a year in real terms – a very large cumulative reduction. From 1990 to 1999, electricity charges for domestic consumers fell by 26%, with a larger fall for industrial users. There is no point arguing that this was due to falling world energy prices – until privatisation, electricity companies had to use expensive domestic fuels. The political special interests under nationalisation required the use of expensive and dirty fuels.</p><p>Sadly, the era of liberalised markets, rising efficiency and lower bills did not last long. Both the recent Labour governments and the coalition have pursued similar policies of intervention after intervention to send the energy industry almost back to where it started.</p><p>In the first place, there are carbon reduction targets. Even if carbon reduction is deemed desirable, it could have been achieved through the emissions trading scheme: after all, the purpose of that scheme is to cap carbon emissions at a particular level. If the cap is appropriate, the scheme should work. Alternatively, a simple carbon tax could be charged. A carbon tax would allow energy businesses and consumers to reduce carbon emissions in the most efficient way for them – turning the heating down, installing insulation or, perhaps, buying energy from a company that uses non-carbon generation. But the government thinks it knows best, so it has added to the emissions trading scheme a carbon price floor, a requirement to allow households to produce their own electricity and sell it back, and an obligation to produce energy using incredibly expensive renewables.</p><p>As part of its renewable strategy, in a strange echo of the 1970s, the government has signed a long-term contract for nuclear power to be supplied at twice the current price of electricity. If we can find a bad deal, let's lock it in for 35 years! That is exactly what governments did with centralised coal contracts in the postwar period. Some of the renewables promoted by government are nearly three-and-a-half times more expensive than the cheapest methods of generating electricity. All these costs raise the price of energy to consumers. In addition, we also have state-dictated investment plans. Consumers deserve better.</p><p>One issue that unites left and many on the paternalist right, such as the US neo-cons, is that of energy security. Do we not need government intervention to keep the lights on and ensure that we are not over-reliant on energy from unstable countries? Perhaps the possibilities of fracking will consign this debate to the dustbin. However, it should be noted that there is nothing more insecure than energy arising from a policy determined by vested interests without any concern for commercial considerations. Was coal secure in the 1970s? Certainly not. Is onshore wind secure? No: the coldest winters are the stillest.</p><p>Energy security will not be achieved by requiring energy companies to invest in expensive sources of supply and by rendering past investments redundant through regulation. It will also not be achieved by making the investment environment even more uncertain. Several companies all seeking the cheapest supplies from diverse sources will best serve the interests of energy security.</p><p>The UK once had an inefficient and expensive energy industry. After privatisation, costs plummeted as the industry served the consumer rather than the mining unions and pro-nuclear interests. Today, after a decade or more of increasing state control, we have an industry that serves vested interests rather than the consumer interest once again. Electricity prices before taxes are now 15% higher than the average of major developed nations. Electricity could be around 50% cheaper without government interventions. We must liberalise again and not complete the circle by returning to nationalisation.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421018877|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|db692e749ed2e454eb3d4eaf80fff7ac336a4132 -->",

        "headline":"Only full-scale reform of our energy market will prevent endless price rises",
        "body":"<p>Britain's energy market is broken. The most recent hike in prices is just the latest sign. There are more to come, and the unedifying thinking aloud from the political establishment is not going to fix it. We need full-scale energy market reform.</p><p>There is nothing we can do with today's UK energy market to stop consumers from being hit by even more unfair price increases. Just as worryingly, it is impossible to guarantee that the UK's current market and our energy policies will make it possible to meet the demand for affordable energy, which is mushrooming as our economy grows, our population rises. It does not work like that.</p><p>The market is complicated. Prices for gas and electricity are affected by myriad subsidies and levies. Because the market for energy is global, our government is not responsible for them all; they are also levied by other countries involved in supplying our energy. Wholesale prices are also pushed up when anything happens to squeeze global supply. There is very little to stop oil- and gas-supplying countries \"turning the tap off\" if they are tempted to use energy resources as a weapon of diplomacy, for example. But the latest price hikes have not been driven by any of these factors. Wholesale gas prices have hardly risen in the last few years, while consumer prices have kept going up.</p><p>Ed Miliband is right to highlight that our energy market is not working in the interests of consumers. Rightly, people are increasingly angry about it. The political responses we have seen simply don't cut it. Miliband's price-fixing policy scam would simply induce a price rise before the next general election and discourage much-needed investment in our ageing, carbon-dependent energy infrastructure. A windfall tax would simply be passed on to consumers, thereby guaranteeing further price hikes. We must – as the prime minister has proposed – look at green levies, but they account for less than 10% of our energy bills, so this alone is not going to address the challenge.</p><p>In fact, it is not clear that a true market in energy exists. Fears about an energy oligopoly – a market dominated by a few huge companies – are being replaced by ones of a monopoly as price rises are announced almost simultaneously by the \"Big 6\" companies. The annual audit of competition the prime minister has proposed is a start, but nowhere near enough. Our hard-pressed consumers, both at home and in business, need a proper, authoritative and independent investigation by the Competition Commission to restore confidence in the energy market.</p><p>Looking further ahead, the government's response needs proper thought. We need to act not react. An effective strategy needs to be delivered over years, not months, and nothing must be off the table. Three areas need attention.</p><p>Britain needs to take a much longer-term view of how it uses energy. Over the last four decades California's economy has grown eight times without its energy usage increasing. We can do the same here. Our focus needs to be on energy efficiency, not on subsidising intermittent, renewable energy generation. In our increasingly populated and energy-demanding world, wholesale energy prices will not go down any time soon. We must be honest about that and introduce policies which will mitigate the impact of that reality on our lifestyles and our children's future.</p><p>In this context, we need to revisit the decarbonisation targets set under the previous government. Not because I believe we should abrogate our climate change responsibilities, but because they are destroying important parts of our economy. If this continues unchecked, there will be one less powerful, democratic nation around to effect beneficial change to the environment. A low-carbon Britain with no jobs and no money will not help save the planet. Real progress on decarbonisation must not undermine our global economic position.</p><p>Finally, we need to tackle the current structure of the energy market. The inefficient monolith that was the Central Electricity Generating Board was rightly broken up and privatised in the 1980s, but what replaced it is far from perfect. Six large, foreign (often) state-owned companies took its place, each of which has an uncannily similar structure: a generation company, a trading company (not located in the UK) and a retail company which are all \"vertically integrated\". This means that they control the whole supply chain and has made it impossible to have real competition. The majority of profits are made out of energy generation and trading (another reason a windfall tax on profits will not work).</p><p>We need to consider alternatives. In New York state, for example, a not-for-profit co-operative successfully delivers clean energy to consumers. Energy is a necessity for life, and gas and electricity can only be delivered along existing pipes and wires. Creating competition in a market for just two commodities in a fixed delivery network won't bring prices down much further, even if it succeeds in making the energy generation sector work better. Quite simply, a new, co-operative approach to energy delivery makes common sense.</p><p></p><p><em>Dr Phillip Lee is Conservative MP for Bracknell and a member of the energy and climate change select committee.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421010763|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|9510a09a1a57a4d106b754c9793fb542274f07e2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ed Miliband switched his energy supplier to one of the \"minnows\" challenging the big six providers after being stung by a bill for &pound;1,000.</p> <p>The Labour leader said he switched from E.On to First Utility, but did not yet know how much money he had saved.</p> <p>Miliband said the decision to switch last winter was taken with his wife, Justine. Asked how much they had saved, he said: \"We don't know yet. We had a huge big bill for last winter &ndash; as much as a thousand pounds.\"</p> <p>Miliband has put energy prices at the heart of his assault on the coalition government, pledging a 20-month freeze if he comes to power.</p> <p>And First Utility followed his lead by announcing its own freeze until the end of the winter just days later, while Centrica-owned British Gas, SSE and ScottishPower raised prices by between 8.2% and 11.2%.</p> <p>Prime minister David Cameron branded Miliband's freeze \"the politics of the conman\" in the House of Commons last week.</p> <p>But the Labour leader told the Mail on Sunday: \"It's a sure sign that someone is losing the argument when they lose their cool.</p> <p>\"He has gone from saying it wasn't a problem to telling people to wear jumpers. For goodness' sake, it's an insult. It's Edwina Currie-esque.</p> <p>\"He used to say he was a prime minister for the centre ground, now he's a prime minister for Centrica. He's not willing to stand up to the big energy firms.\"</p> <p>Downing Street insists Cameron has not advised people to wear jumpers to cut their heating bills, though a No 10 spokesman did tell reporters that people \"may wish to consider\" wrapping up warm.</p> <p>Miliband was buoyed by last week's intervention from former&nbsp;Conservative prime minister Sir John Major, who called for a windfall tax on the power firms.</p> <p>\"The Tories want to rerun the 1992 election, but now they can't,\" the Labour leader said. \"What John Major was saying is that Cameron has lost touch with millions of the people who voted Tory in 1992, whom I call 'Major's millions'.\"</p> <p>A poll in the same paper found a large majority of consumers oppose green levies on energy bills.</p> <p>It found 60% opposed the levies, with just 18% supporting them. Some 61% said they would support the repeal of some of the levies, compared with11% who would not.</p> <p>The Survation poll found almost three-quarters (72%) believed energy prices would affect the way they voted in the general election, with more (40%) backing Cameron's approach than Miliband's price freeze (33%).</p> <p>But more people blamed the energy companies (59%) than either the current government (15%) or the previous Labour administration (15%) for the spiralling cost of gas and electricity.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421046437|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|4c57c4c3657742d29bcd14ab09cd2aa73f924b0f -->",

        "headline":"Lib Dems to resist Tory plans to cut green taxes",
        "body":"<p>Liberal Democrat ministers will resist Conservative plans to cut green taxes that add to the public's energy bills, Danny Alexander has said .</p><p>The chief secretary to the Treasury told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show that the taxes, which amount to about 4% of the average bill, are vital to Britain's long-term commitments to funding renewable energy and are a fixed Lib Dem policy.</p><p>His stance has signalled a hardening of the positions between the two coalition parties over how to cut Britain's energy bills. It follows a poll that showed public support for David Cameron's plan to \"roll back\" green levies on customer bills.</p><p>It comes as other senior Lib Dem figures have called for George Osborne to make further interventions to help needy households with energy payments. Simon Hughes called for low-income households to be offered an immediate rebate on energy bills in the chancellor's autumn statement.</p><p>Alexander said: \"We are looking at every aspect of what contributes to people's energy bills to make sure that in all of these cases people are not paying a penny more than they need to.</p><p>\"Our commitments to green energy and our commitments to renewable energy are vitally important and they are not something that Liberal Democrats will compromise on.\"</p><p>Asked if the 4% of energy bills that are estimated to come from green energy bills will remain, while the other 4-5% for social purposes may be moved to general taxation, he said: \"We are looking at all options, we haven't made any decisions on either of those things at the moment.\"</p><p>Alexander added that he has been angered by accusations that energy companies may have exploited tax loopholes following a report in the Independent on Sunday that claims that Scotia Gas, half of which is owned by SSE, had avoided up to £72.5m through the loophole.</p><p>\"I'm livid about that. It is not something that is acceptable at any time, but particularly when people are going through tough spending choices.\"  There would be new commitments to addressing aggressive tax avoidance in the autumn statement, he added. There were further negative headlines for the big six energy companies after a whistleblower told the Observer British Gas has made £20m in just one year recently from credit owed to customer accounts.</p><p>A Survation report for the Mail on Sunday showed 60% opposed the taxes, with 18% in favour; and 44% backed the prime minister's approach to the energy market, compared with 33% supporting Ed Miliband.</p><p>It also found that more people blamed the energy companies (59%) than either the government (15%) or the previous Labour administration (15%) for the spiralling cost of gas and electricity.</p><p>Cameron last week came under fire on Tuesday over Sir John Major's call for a windfall tax on the excess profits of Britain's big six energy companies. He stunned the Lib Dems the following day by announcing he was going to roll back the environmental levies, giving Nick Clegg 30 minutes notice before prime minister's questions.</p><p>The review, which will be carried out by the Office of Fair Trading and the new Competition and Markets Authority, is to be announced this week in the annual energy statement. The chancellor is to unveil any changes to levies in his autumn statement.</p><p>Clegg's aides responded by noting that schemes to help the fuel-poor, such as the Warm Home Discount scheme, worth £135m to 2 million poorer customers, would be more progressive if funded by general taxation rather than a flat levy on consumers.</p><p>Miliband was the first party leader to put the issue of gas prices firmly on the political agenda in September by announcing that Labour would implement a price freeze if elected. Labour has said it would be willing to consider some green levies being switched to general taxation, but said the priority was the behaviour of the energy companies.</p><p>Hughes said that, after using previous autumn statements to announce freezes on fuel duty for motorists,  Osborne should now take action for energy consumers.</p><p>\"I would like people to have a rebate on energy bills that would help the poorest most and would mean that there would be immediate relief this year, not waiting for the post-election period,\" he told the BBC's Sunday Politics.</p><p>The big six energy companies are due to appear before the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee on Tuesday to answer questions about prices. But they have come under fire after it emerged that only one of them – E.On – is expected to send its chief executive to face MPs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421056414|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|cb1f237cd4f6cf6303987dda7d796478610bf7ed -->",

        "headline":"British Gas rakes in £20m profit from overestimated bills, says whistleblower",
        "body":"<p>Energy giant British Gas is siphoning off millions of pounds of extra profits annually by keeping hold of money owed to former customers who have built up credit on their accounts.</p><p>A whistleblower has told the <em>Observer</em> that £20m-worth of \"credit balances\" was put into the annual accounts of British Gas in one recent financial year. The shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said she was \"shocked\" by revelations about the credit windfall, which she said was \"unacceptable\".</p><p>The revelations, at a time of growing public dismay over soaring bills and high profits enjoyed by the big six suppliers, will raise the political temperature further before power bosses are questioned by a parliamentary select committee on Tuesday about recent price rises.</p><p>On Friday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/23/scottish-power-losses-raise-bills\" title=\"\">Scottish Power became the fourth energy supplier to announce big price rises.</a> The energy giant said it would increase gas prices by 8.5% and electricity prices by 9% from 6&nbsp;December. Scottish Power acted after npower said it would raise prices by 10.4%, SSE said it would put them up by 8.2% and British Gas announced a rise of 9.2%.</p><p>Under the current system, energy companies estimate customers' future usage and charge accordingly. If less energy is used, credit is built up which can be reclaimed or used to offset higher-than-expected subsequent bills.</p><p>The profits from \"credit\" were taken by British Gas in cases where private or business customers had been overcharged on the basis of estimated bills, and then changed to another supplier, or ceased using British Gas for other reasons, with the outstanding sum owed to them still on their accounts.</p><p>British Gas – which argues that it is unable to track down all customers who have left them, changed addresses, or gone bankrupt – used to wait six years before taking the cash. But the whistleblower claims a special team was set up – partly based at a Leicester call centre – to fast forward this process so that investigations to locate people would be launched, and the money then taken into company accounts over a much shorter timescale.</p><p>Under this new arrangement, British Gas then took years of accumulated credit owed on accounts to augment its income. While there is nothing illegal about this, the source said British Gas was apparently nervous about how the move would be viewed if it became public. \"We were briefed about how sensitive this was and there was endless talk about how this would look if it ended up on the front page of a newspaper,\" said the whistleblower. He believes that all the other power companies also take this kind of money back into their accounts as profit but only after six years.</p><p>British Gas confirmed that it had set up a team to improve its credit balances but declined to say exactly what contribution it made to the business. A spokeswoman said customers in credit could always ask for the money to be refunded. She added: \"We did improve our revenue and billing processes and this was fully audited and highlighted in our annual report in 2011.\"</p><p>Flint said: \"I am really shocked by these allegations. These companies say they want to rebuild customers' trust, but with practices like this it's no surprise people are mistrusting of the energy industry. It is simply not acceptable for suppliers to overcharge people on top of the extortionate bills they are already paying. When customers are in credit, this should be repaid. If companies can't find customers to repay them, they should use this money to keep bills down or help other vulnerable customers, not boost their profits.\"</p><p>The Department of Energy and Climate Change said confusion over energy sector accounting practices would be reviewed under plans to increase transparency which will be set out this week. A spokesman said: \"Energy companies don't seem to have got the message that their customers just won't accept opaque book-keeping and unexplained profits.\"</p><p>Writing on theguardian.com, Dr Phillip Lee, a Tory member of the energy select committee, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/26/energy-price-rises-market-reform\" title=\"\">says the energy market is \"broken\" </a>and calls for an investigation by the Competition Commission. He also says ministers need to look again at current decarbonisation targets and consider a completely new \"co-operative\" model for the industry.</p><p>Separately Tim Yeo, the chair of the committee, who has stood aside pending the outcome of an investigation into claims by the <em>Sunday Times</em> that he&nbsp;\"coached\" a witness, which he strongly denies, is writing to the prime minister with a plan to lower prices and help those on the lowest incomes.</p><p>Yeo suggests abolishing the floor price for carbon, introducing a new tariff system under which people would be guaranteed a certain amount of energy at a lower price, and then have to pay more when they pass the limit, and opening up the National Grid to competition.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421031395|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|c925730d84856bac6d3e7fc0b33227adfac2b504 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's energy policy is chaotic, lost in a morass of subsidies, regulations, lobbies and taboos. No one can understand it, which is why most retreat to slogans and prejudice. The revelation that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/26/british-gas-caroline-flint-credit-windfall\" title=\"\">British Gas treats my \"direct debit\" credit balance as a free loan</a> merely adds fury to my own contribution.</p><p>The government is proposing to give the statutory regulators \"more power to enforce competition\". The big six energy companies – who have ousted bankers as the top capitalist ogres thanks to their apparent profiteering – exploit the ebbs and flows of state intervention to push up prices at what seems an unjustified rate. Last week came the most extravagant intervention of all, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-hinckley-deal-energy\" title=\"\">the Hinkley Point nuclear contract going to France</a>, and no scope for competition from small-scale nuclear generation.</p><p>Meanwhile the regulators are themselves at odds. The discredited energy policeman, Ofgem, is now to be overseen by the Office of Fair Trading, who are overseen in turn by ministers, who are themselves at odds with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/ed-davey-green-levy-energy\" title=\"\">Liberal Democrats fighting for green taxes and Tories against them</a>. Both are cursed by the impossible pursuit of an arbitrary target to cut carbon emissions by a fixed date. This has degenerated into a shambles of carbon price manipulation and subsidies to renewables.</p><p>While it is near impossible to disentangle the social or environmental impact of this, my own reading suggests that precious little of it has materially aided either the poor or the planet. Like so many attempts to distort markets for benign reasons, rewards have gone to landowners, contractors, consultants and power companies, impeding growth by driving up prices to consumers.</p><p>The government is right at least to start with competition. Breaking the big six oligopoly must be right. But a deep audit of energy policy, its subsidies and market corruption is desperately needed. Otherwise none of us will know where to begin.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421104994|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|4d2e6631fe1f9f197c03fb0e5abab32fb18545d3 -->",

        "body":"<p>The \"big six\" energy firms are coming under increasing pressure over their recent price rises as official figures cast doubt on their claims that rising wholesale costs were to blame. Consumers are being hit by price increases of up to 11.1%. But data from the energy regulator Ofgem suggested that wholesale prices rose by only 1.7% over the last year.</p><p>According to analysts, the price rises will hit more than 17 million customers. Real wages, in contrast, have fallen to their lowest level on record.</p><p>British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power and npower have all sought to blame increases in wholesale costs for their price rises, saying that government green schemes and rising network charges were also to blame.</p><p>\"The prices that individual suppliers pay depend on their own hedging strategies, and the Ofgem methodology is, at best, an approximation of what those hedging profiles are,\" a British Gas spokesman told the FT. \"We buy a certain amount of gas more than two years in advance, and if you look at the 24 month figure to October 2013, there has been an 18% increase in the wholesale cost.\"</p><p>SSE said the suggestion that wholesale costs had not risen over the last year was \"simply false\". \"This is very much a global market and we are seeing increased international competition for supplies, which is putting up prices,\" a spokesman told the FT.</p><p>Representatives of all of the major energy firms are due to face MPs on Tuesday afternoon as the energy select committee investigates the latest prices rises. They will also go head-to-head with Ofgem's interim chief executive Andrew Wright.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421089812|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d5e17c495fe1ff58819bb67ecda07726c3541974 -->",

        "headline":"Heat is on politicians to tackle domestic energy burden",
        "body":"<p>When Labour leader Ed Miliband announced at the party's conference last month that, if elected to government, he would freeze consumer energy prices for two years, it sent shock waves through the UK's energy industry.</p><p>Miliband received rapturous applause from the party faithful in the hall, but the response was sharply divided outside of the conference. Some consumer and fuel-poverty campaigners welcomed the proposals as a way to relieve hard-pressed households that have seen bills soar, but many in the industry warned it could stifle investment and blackouts could result.</p><p>Miliband's announcement and the response to it illustrate two key things about energy policy today: that it has taken centre stage in politics as rising bills have hurt consumers and that government interference in energy markets is controversial. </p><p>Businesses complain that tinkering with policy, never mind radical departures from it, creates uncertainty and makes it hard to make investment decisions – witness the debacle over the feed-in tariffs for solar power. But politicians are under pressure from all quarters; not just from the industry, but also from consumers, energy-intensive businesses, and environmental and poverty campaigners.</p><p>After the bill-freezing announcement, Labour turned to the government's flagship policies: the green deal and the energy company obligation (Eco), by which money is siphoned off from the \"big six\" suppliers and targeted at home-energy improvements for people on low incomes. </p><p>The latest data, published on 19 September, showed only 384 people had signed up to the green deal, making it unlikely the target of 10,000 by year-end would be met. Luciana Berger, Labour's shadow energy minister, said the figures showed the scheme was \"struggling to get off the ground\". </p><p>Eco was also failing, she claimed, because – under the rules – about 60% of the money may end up with households that can already afford to adequately heat their homes.</p><p>Five days after its conference, Labour announced its alternatives: if the party takes power in 2015, it will <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/25/labour-scrap-green-deal-ed-miliband\">scrap the green deal and Eco</a>. A new Energy Save scheme would replace the green deal, offering lower interest rates than the loans currently on offer for home improvements. However, Berger has not yet said how low this rate will be or how the financing will be managed.</p><p>Instead of Eco, the £1.3bn from energy companies would be poured into a new scheme in which local authorities play the key role, on the basis that they have a better understanding of the improvements needed for low-income and hard-to-reach households in their areas.</p><p>But like Miliband's policy to freeze bills, these proposed changes have worried some in the industry, who fear uncertainty over the green deal and Eco will make investment difficult. For consumers, there is little incentive to take on disruptive, long-term home improvements now if there might be a better deal coming along in 18 months. It is also not clear whether people taking out loans now will be able to move to a lower interest rate if Labour takes power.</p><p>Alex Tsimboykas, director of energy consultants EUM, which carries out home surveys, sums up the dilemma for the insulation industry: \"Eco and the green deal need an overhaul. The current Eco scheme is not supporting the most vulnerable people. But starting from scratch could delay the delivery of measures even more.\"</p><p>Paul King, chief executive of the UK Green Building Council, added: \"Talk about replacing [the green deal] causes further confusion and lack of confidence in the construction sector.\" He also said low-interest loans would not be enough on their own to increase the take-up of insulation to the levels needed.</p><p>Berger moved to calm fears by insisting that she would work closely with industry: \"Ensuring a smooth transition will be our number one priority.\"</p><p>However, Greg Barker, the Conservative minister for climate change, said changes to the green deal were not needed: he was still confident it would be a success and that there were \"encouraging\" signs.</p><p>He argued that the most recent figures are probably skewed because fewer people want to buy insulation in the summer. The green deal also suffered a few setbacks early on because the launch was delayed and companies faced difficulties getting the IT, legal contracts for consumers and financing watertight before taking their packages to market. </p><p>However, the next six months will be key. \"With UK households wasting £1.8bn a year due to the lack of insulation, it's scandalous that only 12 households have had energy-saving measures carried out under the green deal,\" said Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth. \"A massive drive to stop our homes leaking energy is the only way to ensure we end fuel poverty.\"</p><p>While Labour can craft eye-catching energy policy in opposition, Liberal Democrats face a trickier choice. Even if they would like to, they cannot disown the coalition policy, but their stance on energy could become yet another concern to their environmentally conscious base. The party's strategists have been notably quiet.</p><p>Many in the industry are nervous, but few are prepared to openly criticise politicians before the results of the scheme have become clearer. However, the fear is that – if the green deal fails – they will be back to square one, having wasted a lot of money.</p><p>If the green deal does not show substantial improvements in take-up by next summer, the Conservatives will be under pressure to find ways to fix the scheme or replace it. At that point, we will be just a year from the next general election. The energy industry – and consumers worried about how to heat their homes – will have to wait for the voters to choose before they have any real certainty on the future of insulation.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421128794|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|7c13c6fdf7c576af2a82c307a8387503edb6d10a -->",

        "body":"<p>Reports that <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/16/families-too-poor-to-heat-up-food-given-by-charity-4147655/\" title=\"\">recipients of food bank parcels are returning products that need to be heated up</a> came as no surprise to me. Neither did the news that various <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/29/energy-firms-raised-prices-as-wholesale-costs-fall\" title=\"\">energy companies were putting their prices up</a>, again by an average of over 9%. Gas prices and train fares seem to be the two commodities for modern British life that base their prices on a whim, or numbers plucked out of thin air, without a thought to the real cost to those for whom those price hikes mean unimaginable sacrifices in their day to day lives.</p><p>I don't imagine the chief executives of any of the big six called before MPs on Tuesday has ever had to unplug their fridge because they simply can't afford to run it, or wrap their toddler in a fleece all-in-one and a jumper and a dressing gown of an evening.</p><p>It wasn't too long ago myself that I was sitting with my back to my front door, hissing at my toddler to be quiet because there was a man on the other side of it hammering with his fist. I owed Eon £390 in unpaid electricity bills, and they were shouting that they knew I was in there. Every new morning brought red-topped letters, final demands and pairs of men peering through the windows – but as I told them time and again, I couldn't give them what I didn't have.</p><p>I couldn't take advantage of the \"cheaper bills if you pay by direct debit\", because my finances were so chaotic that the direct debits often bounced, leaving me with a £25 charge from my bank and a £12 late fee from the energy company for my troubles. If you haven't got a tenner to get them off your back for a week, you certainly don't have an additional £37 for charges.</p><p>I was unemployed, applying for every job that I came across, and mistake after mistake with housing benefit payments meant that I was struggling to get by. The £10 a week food shop has been well documented by now, but I don't really talk about the Christmas day that I sent my son to his father's house to spare him the misery of yet another day in a freezing cold flat, with no television to entertain us, no tree, no presents and nothing that even slightly resembled a Christmas dinner. The furniture was parked in front of the radiators because I didn't use them anyway, and I slept in the kitchen-cum-living room, because it was the warmest place in the house. Some days I barely moved from the day-bed, sitting applying for jobs curled up in my duvet, with Small Boy playing with his toy cars beside me.</p><p>Eventually, I was told by one of the men hammering on the door that I would be put on a key meter, another bitter irony, as those with the least money pay the highest rates and tariffs for their gas and electricity.</p><p>Sitting at my desk now, in a pair of jumpers rather than turn the heating on, old habits die hard. I work these days and have an income, but I still only turn the lights on if I absolutely have to, keep the water lukewarm and haven't yet turned the heating on.</p><p>I spent 18 months with the furniture parked in front of the radiators, cooking as quickly as I possibly could to use the least amount of gas and electricity. I unscrewed the lightbulbs in the hallway, unplugged everything at the wall so not even the LCD display was blinking away on the oven. I eventually turned the fridge and freezer off – they were empty anyway – and the boiler, desperate to save money, shocking myself awake in the morning with the shortest, coldest showers, and boiling a kettle of water twice a week to bath my young son.</p><p>But still, there are some corners that can't be cut. The clothes still need washing, especially when potty training a toddler. You debate every cup of tea, wonder how much it will really cost, and put another jumper on to try to keep warm. You go to bed when it gets dark in the evenings, because it's warm in bed and you can't see anything anyway.</p><p></p><p>You go to a coffee shop where the staff are friendly, early in the morning when they're unlikely to be busy, and plug your mobile phone and the small notebook computer you borrowed from a friend into the wall to charge it. Anything to save a little money, anywhere you can.</p><p></p><p>I'm not the only one. I visited a single parents' support group in Bristol a few weeks back as part of an Oxfam project, and the mothers I met there all told the same story. How gas and electricity bills were one of their biggest outgoings. How they don't quite understand how it can cost so much, when they don't put the heating on, or luxuriate in hot baths every evening. An £18 standing charge to be connected to the mains might not sound a lot to some people, but to others, spending almost a fiver a week without so much as turning a tap on is the difference between eating and missing meals.</p><p>We hear time and again what a prosperous, affluent country Britain is, the sixth richest in the world. But aren't we ashamed that people who need emergency food handouts are eating cold beans and stewed steak from the tin, or handing it back, because they can't even heat it up?

        "body":"<p>The big energy companies came to account for themselves and their ever rising prices in parliament on Tuesday. It was a heartwarming session. They are so determined to do the right thing, so desperate to be loved by the public, so anxious that, thanks to them, nobody – not the poorest disabled pensioner – will ever have to choose between eating and heating.</p><p>Listening to them, you'd imagine that if anyone phoned in to say they couldn't meet their bill, a top executive would offer to pay it himself – out of his bonus, if necessary. These guys aren't running businesses – they are directing charities.</p><p>You might be sad but not surprised to learn that many MPs on the energy committee did not buy this at face value. Neither did Stephen Fitzpatrick, the MD of the tiny Ovo Energy (0.5% of the market), who sat at the end of the line of witnesses and growled that none of the figures his three colleagues were quoting made any sense to him.</p><p>Gas prices had fallen from 74p a therm in 2011, and his company were buying it for winter at 69p. \"I cannot see any explanation for their prices,\" he said, adding that if they could afford to knock 15% off the bills of customers who had quit (it is called a \"winback deduction\") they could afford to do it for everyone. People would ask, if they could pay all that back now, how long had they been overcharging?</p><p>The other three, from much bigger companies, looked askance. (I am not certain what \"askance\" means, but I know that's what they were looking.) I haven't seen such a look, combining contempt with, as we say here, a complete ignoral – at least not since Jeffrey Archer had to share an Old Bailey dock with the man who had shopped him to the police.</p><p>They must also have been deeply resentful of the way Mr Fitzpatrick was getting stacks of free publicity for his company. A colleague tells me that, in fact, Ovo would cost him £172 more per year than npower, but he's on npower's lowest tariff. If everyone on npower's eye-watering top tariff were to switch, the lowest charges would shoot up. It's very, very complicated.</p><p>William Morris, of SSE (8.2% price rise), said movingly that nobody should be in a position where they had to choose between eating and heating. There would be help. \"We don't want to fuel their fears,\" he said. Of course not. They can't afford to fuel anything at those prices!</p><p>It was all a problem of publicity. The public, and I paraphrase, had no idea what wonderful people the energy companies were. \"We have to get that message across!\" he said. Why, they had 20,000 employees who needed to be paid. \"They are equally members of society,\" he said gravely, and we had a vision of power workers shivering in the dark, purely to keep down the bills of selfish, rapacious customers.</p><p>The gist of their argument was that the government should pay. At the moment energy prices are like the poll tax, the same for everyone. Fund it out of taxation, and you could cut bills. So – again I paraphrase – we could all pay less to the energy companies if we paid more to the energy companies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421240722|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|44845f06d4210df153be4355c566644558cd2202 -->",

        "headline":"Energy firms raised prices despite drop in wholesale costs",
        "body":"<p>Some of Britain's big six energy companies have seen their wholesale electricity costs fall over the last three years while still putting up prices for millions of households.</p><p>The figures will put yet more pressure on the firms to explain why bills and UK profits have been going up, as they appear before a influential House of Commons committee of MPs.</p><p>According to Ofgem, Npower paid an average of £59.61 per megawatt-hour for electricity in 2010. The average wholesale price fell by 4% to £57.32 in 2011 and rose by less than 2% to £58.39 in 2012. The company increased retail prices by 5.1%, 7.2% and 9.1% respectively in those years.</p><p>Similarly, EDF paid wholesale prices for electricity supplied to households of £58.16MWh in 2010, falling by 0.6% to £57.82 in 2011 and rising less than 5% to £60.68 in 2012. In those years EDF's electricity prices to customers went up by 7.5%, 4.5% and 10.8% respectively.</p><p>Meanwhile E.ON paid £57.64MWh  for its electricity in 2010, rising by 7% to £61.82 in 2011 and falling by 4% to £59.44 in 2012. It raised its power prices twice by a cumulative 20% in 2011, before cutting them by 6% in 2012.</p><p>Asked why wholesale prices appeared to be out of kilter with increases in bills, companies said network and environmental costs had been the biggest factor in higher electricity bills, which are now around £600 a year on average. However, figures from Ofgem indicate electricity network costs have only risen by £10 in each of the last four years, while green costs are rising by a similar amount. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/oct/11/energy-prices-bills-rise-sse\" title=\"\">Green and social levies make up £112, or less than 9%, of the average household energy bill</a>.</p><p>With four of the big six – British Gas, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE – announcing big price rises in the last few weeks, the companies are under increasing pressure to justify the increases, after figures from the energy regulator suggested the profit margin made by the companies per household has more than doubled from £45 to £95 over the last year. Ofgem said wholesale energy costs have gone up by just £10 in a year, while VAT, operating and other costs are up £40. The energy companies dispute this analysis and point to higher wholesale costs this winter.</p><p>Downing Street yesterday said energy companies should account for the latest round of price rises, which have averaged 9% this autumn. Energy bill increases are continuing to cause a headache for the coalition, as a new YouGov poll shows 68% of the public believes Labour's energy price feeze is workable.</p><p>Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, called on the companies to \"come clean about why they are imposing yet another round of inflation-busting price rises this winter, when they are already making huge profits\".</p><p>\"Revelations about rising profits and the growing gap between wholesale costs and household energy bills highlight why answers are needed,\" she said. Which?, the consumer group, yesterday called on the chancellor to tackle rising bills.  The group said it wants the companies broken up and an end to the \"blank cheque\" of allowing energy companies to charge customers whatever they like for a government scheme to cut energy usage for poorer households.</p><p>Will Straw, associate director at of the IPPR thinktank, also questioned why the big six think \"profits of 5% to 6% are acceptable in a competitive market\".</p><p>\"In 1998, as the market was liberalised, the regulator believed 1.5% was an adequate margin for energy suppliers. Profits in other sectors like supermarkets are as low as 2%.\"</p><p>Asked about the wholesale power prices, a spokesman for nPower pointed to comments by Paul Massara, its chief executive, who said earlier this year: \"The main factor behind rising costs is government policy and regulation to fund this country's transition to a more efficient economy, with modern infrastructure and warm, insulated homes for all.\"</p><p>An EDF spokesman said wholesale energy costs have \"not been the main driver of increases in prices\". He added: \"When we last raised our prices in December 2012 we made it clear that a major driver was the increases we were seeing in the charges for transmission and distribution of energy to our customers.\"</p><p>He also said EDF made no profit from supplying residential homes in the last three years and said it was impossible to do a \"perfect match-back between the tariff increases and the year-on-year increase in costs\".</p><p>A spokesman for E.ON acknowledged wholesale prices influenced its power prices but said \"energy bills are about much more than just wholesale costs\", with just over 2% accounting for profit.</p><p>In the House of Lords last night, Lord Jenkin condemned the energy \"oligopoly\" and tabled an amendment calling for greater competition.</p><p>Another amendment in favour of decarbonising all of Britain's electricity by 2030, tabled by Lord Oxburgh, a former chairman of Shell, narrowly failed to pass.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421156554|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|3a93c049ec9c1d5b9e0e28a0126269b0b764216c -->",

        "body":"<p>Labour leader Ed Miliband has dismissed the \"list of excuses\" offered to MPs by energy firms, blaming rising bills on them overcharging hard-pressed customers.</p><p>He rejected the idea of a Competition Commission investigation into the market, saying \"nothing less than a price freeze\" would do.</p><p>Miliband, whose promise to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour wins the 2015 election has sent the issue to the top of the political agenda, said what was needed was action rather than a review.</p><p>He told reporters: \"What we've heard today was a list of excuses from the energy companies.\"</p><p>Responding to E.ON chief executive Tony Cocker's call for a Competition Commission investigation, Miliband said: \"We don't need more excuses, more reviews, what we need is action. Action against companies that are overcharging people and taking advantage of a broken market.</p><p>\"That's why it's so important that we implement Labour's price freeze, which is what we'll do, and reform a broken market so there's proper competition, proper transparency and a regulator who can cut prices for consumers.\"</p><p>He said green levies were not the reason for rising bills, but the charges should offer \"value for money\".</p><p>Miliband said: \"We should always have value for money in whatever costs there are on bills. But when the companies and the government say that the problems of the cost of living crisis to do with energy aren't to do with overcharging, they are wrong.</p><p>\"That's why I'll accept nothing less than a price freeze.\"</p><p>Miliband added: \"I think everybody knows by now that the market's not working. There are still some people who are trying to defend that broken market – the energy companies, this government – but I am determined we act.</p><p>\"Frankly, hard-pressed families need someone who'll stand up for them. That's what I'm doing and that's what I'll do as prime minister.\"</p><p>Energy companies appearing before the energy and climate change select committee on Tuesday insisted the rises in bills were partly down to green taxes, but stood accused of charging customers \"the maximum price they feel they can get away with\".</p><p>Rising wholesale costs and environmental \"stealth taxes\" were behind the average 9.1% rise announced by some major firms, the committee was told.</p><p>But the businesses practices of the big six was called into question by small scale competitor Ovo Energy.</p><p>Managing director Stephen Fitzpatrick told MPs he \"can't explain\" the price rises being imposed because his company was buying gas at a cheaper price – 5p a therm less – than it had in 2009.</p><p>Loyal bill-payers are charged are a far higher rate, in some cases £200 more, than those who switch but the companies responsible go \"unchallenged\" by Ofgem, he said.</p><p>\"It looks to me like a lot of energy companies, a significant number of the big six, are charging the maximum price they feel they can get away with to the customers that they feel will not switch under any circumstances and then maintaining the illusion of competitive pricing with tariffs targeted towards a very small number of relatively well-engaged customers,\" he told MPs.</p><p>\"In the case of NPower, which is the worst offender, historically and today the price differential is about 16%, which is about £200.\"</p><p>He accused British Gas of being the most active in terms of running a dedicated \"win back team\" whose sole job was to call up customers that were leaving to say \"now we can cut your bill\".</p><p>\"When this kind of behaviour is allowed to go unchallenged, and an ex-monopoly advantage that the big six have, is allowed to go unchallenged by Ofgem, then you will never get effective competition.</p><p>\"If you don't have effective competition in a retail market then you are always going to be trying to find out where the money has gone and time and time again you will hear very clever, very complex, very confusing answers and you will never get to the bottom of it.</p><p>\"Effective competition is the only solution to lower bills.\"</p><p>Fitzpatrick has previously suggested that the larger energy companies pay over the odds for energy when their retail arms buy from their own wholesale divisions – a claim the other energy bosses denied on Tuesday.</p><p>Pressed on the allegation, Tony Cocker, chief executive officer of E.ON, said: \"We buy our electricity and our gas for the retail business from the market via our trading business.</p><p>\"We operate our businesses on a standalone basis.</p><p>\"There is absolutely no cross-subsidy between the businesses.\"</p><p>Cocker, who described green schemes as a \"stealth tax\" or \"poll tax\", said E.ON had not yet made a decision on whether to follow the other firms and increase prices.</p><p>\"We will hold our prices as long as we can,\" he told the MPs, adding that his company faced the same pressures as the other firms, with rises in wholesale and network costs, as well as the social and environmental obligations.</p><p>He has written to David Cameron calling for a Competition Commission investigation into the industry to be set up to help reassure customers.</p><p>\"I fundamentally believe that this market is competitive but I acknowledge we are not trusted and therefore I believe we need to have a very thorough Competition Commission investigation,\" he said.</p><p>William Morris, managing director of SSE, which has announced an 8.2% price rise, said he regretted having to increase bills for customers, who were \"struggling to maintain their budgets\".</p><p>Transport costs had increased by 10%, while the government's environmental schemes had risen by 13%, he said.</p><p>\"We would like to see those costs taken off the customers' bills and onto taxation. We welcome the government's decision to review that.\"</p><p>Morris said that companies would reduce bills as quickly as possible if the government decided to scrap the green taxes.</p><p>Companies have estimated that bills could be cut by around £60 if the green taxes were axed.</p><p>Guy Johnson, external affairs director of Npower, which has announced average rises of 10.4%, said the largest driver of price rises had been the cost of the so-called climate obligation on power firms.</p><p>The green taxes cover the period to March 2015, so the energy firms will have to fulfil a large part of their obligation next year, he said.</p><p>\"That was a concern when we were considering prices for next year.\"</p><p>An analysis by industry regulator Ofgem showed that, while the increases announced so far this autumn by some of the companies have averaged 9.1%, wholesale prices have risen by 1.7% – adding just £10 to the average household bill of £600.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421228177|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|b5b45f8cfabbd855c0b013b60f21f52213dc0837 -->",

Level one is that prices seem to go up a lot, don’t seem to go down when world prices go down, and that the bosses of a lot of companies seem to get paid an awful lot, which doesn’t seem to go down if their companies do badly. But level two is that nationalising the energy industry would not make gas and electricity bills magically cheaper.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T18:45:39.236Z\">at 6.45pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-526ffa97e4b08c7e086ff154\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T18:26:54.237Z\">6.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Still waiting for MPs to return to the Thatcher room to wrap up this session on the 'big six' with Ofgem's chief executive.</p> <p>So time for a quick backgrounder: earlier this year the committee accused Ofgem of failing to improve transparency in the energy market. Ofgem hired BDO accountancy firm to advise on financial reporting of energy companies, but then failed to take up its recommendations, arguing they would put unnecessary burdens on the big six.</p> <p>MPs rejected this argument in their <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmenergy/108/10802.htm\">report on energy prices, profits and poverty</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We believe that taken as a whole, the benefits of BDOs recommendations - in terms of improvements to transparency and comparability of the statements and associated improvements in consumer trust - significantly outweigh any burdens on the six largest vertically integrated energy companies.&nbsp;</p> <p>We recommend that Ofgem should require the six largest vertically integrated companies to implement BDO' recommendations 1 (publishing statements to the same year-end), 2 (independent auditor opinion on statements), and 4(reporting of trading function results). We also encourage Ofgem to consider requiring implementation of BDO's recommendations in full and to publish, in its response to this report, its analysis of the cost to energy companies of full implementation.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>With MPs calling Ofgem &quot;a paper tiger&quot;, it is not only the big six energy bosses that are attempting to defend their reputations today.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526ff809e4b0ded76c0a9112\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T18:02:00.671Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The division bell is ringing again.

However, mortgage approvals are still below pre-crisis levels, with monthly approvals averaging above 100,000 in 2006 and 2007.</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong>, chief UK economist at<strong> IHS Global Insight</strong>, had this to say on the Bank's data:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The marked increase in mortgage approvals in September provides compelling evidence that housing market activity was already gaining appreciable momentum even before the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme came into being in early October.</p> <p>While the strength of house price rises in London is becoming an increasing concern and pushing up the overall national increase in house prices, we are currently a long way off from an overall housing market bubble emerging.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there is a mounting danger that house prices could really take off over the coming months, especially ifalready significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is lifted appreciably further by the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme</p> <p>It is therefore of vital importance that policymakers closely monitor the situation and are prepared to act quickly and decisively if signs of the housing market overheating become increasingly widespread and pronounced.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <strong>Bank of England</strong> also revealed that lending to non-financial companies&nbsp;rose by &pound;720m in September., following a &pound;3.7m fall in August.</p> <p>However, while lending to large companies increased by &pound;1.1bn, loans to small and medium-sized enterprises fell by &pound;383m. </p> <p><strong>Adam Marshall,</strong> director of policy and external affairs at the<strong> British Chambers of Commerce</strong>, said more help was needed for SMEs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It’s good to see overall business lending rise, as this has an impact on business confidence. Yet these new figures show that while large firms have little difficulty tapping debt markets, SMEs – and particular young, fast-growing firms – continue to struggle to access growth capital.</p> <p>Both policy-makers and financial institutions need to do more to help fast-growing SMEs access finance. The British Business Bank has a huge role to play here, and should be enhanced with additional capital to help plug the gap.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T13:42:49.868Z\">at 1.42pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-526f8169e4b0ffc73763b618\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T09:47:50.222Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets are up</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The major European markets are all slightly higher this morning:</p> <p><strong>FTSE 100</strong>: +0.36% at 6,749.05</p> <p><strong>CAC 40</strong>: +0.17% at 4,258.99</p> <p><strong>DAX 30</strong>: +0.07% at 8,985.04</p> <p><strong>IBEX</strong>: +0.55% at 9,789.2</p> <p><strong>FTSE MIB</strong>: +1.3% at 19,073.95</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> is the biggest riser on the <strong>FTSE 100</strong>, with shares up 5% at 475p.</p> <p>The company is flying high after a better than expected set of third-quarter results which included a dividend hike and a plegde to return proceeds of asset sales to shareholders.

        "headline":"Energy firms raised prices despite drop in wholesale costs",
        "body":"<p>Some of Britain's big six energy companies have seen their wholesale electricity costs fall over the last three years while still putting up prices for millions of households.</p><p>The figures will put yet more pressure on the firms to explain why bills and UK profits have been going up, as they appear before a influential House of Commons committee of MPs.</p><p>According to Ofgem, Npower paid an average of £59.61 per megawatt-hour for electricity in 2010. The average wholesale price fell by 4% to £57.32 in 2011 and rose by less than 2% to £58.39 in 2012. The company increased retail prices by 5.1%, 7.2% and 9.1% respectively in those years.</p><p>Similarly, EDF paid wholesale prices for electricity supplied to households of £58.16MWh in 2010, falling by 0.6% to £57.82 in 2011 and rising less than 5% to £60.68 in 2012. In those years EDF's electricity prices to customers went up by 7.5%, 4.5% and 10.8% respectively.</p><p>Meanwhile E.ON paid £57.64MWh  for its electricity in 2010, rising by 7% to £61.82 in 2011 and falling by 4% to £59.44 in 2012. It raised its power prices twice by a cumulative 20% in 2011, before cutting them by 6% in 2012.</p><p>Asked why wholesale prices appeared to be out of kilter with increases in bills, companies said network and environmental costs had been the biggest factor in higher electricity bills, which are now around £600 a year on average. However, figures from Ofgem indicate electricity network costs have only risen by £10 in each of the last four years, while green costs are rising by a similar amount. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/oct/11/energy-prices-bills-rise-sse\" title=\"\">Green and social levies make up £112, or less than 9%, of the average household energy bill</a>.</p><p>With four of the big six – British Gas, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE – announcing big price rises in the last few weeks, the companies are under increasing pressure to justify the increases, after figures from the energy regulator suggested the profit margin made by the companies per household has more than doubled from £45 to £95 over the last year. Ofgem said wholesale energy costs have gone up by just £10 in a year, while VAT, operating and other costs are up £40. The energy companies dispute this analysis and point to higher wholesale costs this winter.</p><p>Downing Street yesterday said energy companies should account for the latest round of price rises, which have averaged 9% this autumn. Energy bill increases are continuing to cause a headache for the coalition, as a new YouGov poll shows 68% of the public believes Labour's energy price feeze is workable.</p><p>Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, called on the companies to \"come clean about why they are imposing yet another round of inflation-busting price rises this winter, when they are already making huge profits\".</p><p>\"Revelations about rising profits and the growing gap between wholesale costs and household energy bills highlight why answers are needed,\" she said. Which?, the consumer group, yesterday called on the chancellor to tackle rising bills.  The group said it wants the companies broken up and an end to the \"blank cheque\" of allowing energy companies to charge customers whatever they like for a government scheme to cut energy usage for poorer households.</p><p>Will Straw, associate director at of the IPPR thinktank, also questioned why the big six think \"profits of 5% to 6% are acceptable in a competitive market\".</p><p>\"In 1998, as the market was liberalised, the regulator believed 1.5% was an adequate margin for energy suppliers. Profits in other sectors like supermarkets are as low as 2%.\"</p><p>Asked about the wholesale power prices, a spokesman for nPower pointed to comments by Paul Massara, its chief executive, who said earlier this year: \"The main factor behind rising costs is government policy and regulation to fund this country's transition to a more efficient economy, with modern infrastructure and warm, insulated homes for all.\"</p><p>An EDF spokesman said wholesale energy costs have \"not been the main driver of increases in prices\". He added: \"When we last raised our prices in December 2012 we made it clear that a major driver was the increases we were seeing in the charges for transmission and distribution of energy to our customers.\"</p><p>He also said EDF made no profit from supplying residential homes in the last three years and said it was impossible to do a \"perfect match-back between the tariff increases and the year-on-year increase in costs\".</p><p>A spokesman for E.ON acknowledged wholesale prices influenced its power prices but said \"energy bills are about much more than just wholesale costs\", with just over 2% accounting for profit.</p><p>In the House of Lords last night, Lord Jenkin condemned the energy \"oligopoly\" and tabled an amendment calling for greater competition.</p><p>Another amendment in favour of decarbonising all of Britain's electricity by 2030, tabled by Lord Oxburgh, a former chairman of Shell, narrowly failed to pass.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421156554|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|3a93c049ec9c1d5b9e0e28a0126269b0b764216c -->",
