Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>• The leaders of America's intelligence services said the l<strong>oss of surveillance capabilities could lead to a &quot;catastrophic&quot; 9/11-like attack on the United States</strong>. DNI James Clapper and NSA director Keith Alexander testified as new legislation was introduced in Congress with substantial bipartisan support to limit NSA surveillance capabilities.</p> <p><strong>• The intelligence officials agreed in principle to the declassification of some Fisa court opinions,</strong> as a gesture of transparency. The length of time the NSA stores American's phone metadata might be reduced to three years from five. And the creation of a permanent advocate role on the court was deemed possible although the justice department witness opposed it.</p> <p>• <strong>Clapper did not deny that the US conducts surveillance on foreign leaders</strong>. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/nsa-files-us-intelligence-officials-testify-in-congress-live-coverage#block-52701100e4b08c7e086ff162\">debate</a> broke out on the committee over whether committee members had been informed of the practice.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• Alexander said reports that NSA collects tens of millions of phone calls in France are &quot;completely false.&quot; </strong>He didn't talk about metadata collection performed by NSA.&nbsp;He said the reports have mistaken data &quot;provided to NSA by foreign partners&quot; for data NSA collects.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• The conversation was restricted to two intelligence programs that so far have garnered a lion's share of media coverage:</strong> phone metadata collection and the surveillance of foreign Internet users. Both programs are subject to Fisa court approval. Critics warn that both programs sweep up substantial intelligence about Americans in a way that relies on tendentious interpretations of the law.</p> <p><strong>• White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president had already made some changes</strong> to US spy practices even as a review of those practices continues. Multiple anonymous White House officials said the president had ended spying on friendly leaders. Carney would not comment on those reports.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/statuses/395297007369084928\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Actually more useful than most House--esp most HPSCI--hearings.

Clapper, without confirming that the spying took place, seemed to concede that, saying only “we have by and large complied with the spirit and intent of the law.”</p> <p>Schiff drew a heated and unexpected rebuke from Rogers, who called his suggestion “disingenuous.” The committee has access to “mounds of product” from the NSA, Rogers said. Schiff shot back a direct question about whether Rogers in fact knew about the foreign leader spying, which Rogers said he could not answer without confirming – but invited the committee member to view reams of intelligence in private.</p> <p>Later, Schiff returned to the colloquy. The California Democrat said that yes, NSA reports the &quot;selectors&quot; it spies on, but &quot;not all selectors are equal.&quot; The implication seemed to be that the NSA doesn't specify explicitly to the committee when a &quot;leader of an allied nation&quot; – &quot;not an average selector,&quot; Schiff said – has been spied upon.&nbsp;</p> <p>Schiff said &quot;we need a discussion here&quot; about the standards by which the NSA contextualizes to the oversight committee when a major foreign figure has been spied upon. He suggested that the current standard was lower than the one the CIA must employ when reporting a covert action.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T20:04:24.317Z\">at 8.04pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52701070e4b0ded76c0a9120\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T19:47:51.673Z\">7.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The NSA programs under discussion today are administered by the Fisa court under rules amended in 2008. <strong>The court has been criticized as a rubber stamp t</strong>hat automatically accedes to intelligence community requests.&nbsp;</p> <p>James Cole, the deputy attorney general on the panel next to Clapper and Alexander, points out that it's really more efficient that way:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stuartmillar159/statuses/395274114128044032\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Deputy AG Cole says making FISA court adversarial would &quot;slow down&quot; the work of the court and the intel community</p>— Stuart Millar (@stuartmillar159) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuartmillar159/statuses/395274114128044032\">October 29, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52700a9de4b08c7e086ff15b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T19:38:51.432Z\">7.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>An interesting exchange between Rep.

That led to Abu Ghraib, torture at the secret C.I.A. prisons, warrantless wiretapping of American citizens, grave harm to international relations, and the dragnet approach to surveillance revealed by the Snowden leaks.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526fb4dee4b0ded76c0a90ee\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T13:15:30.062Z\">1.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Germany</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>“Spies will be spies” has been the response of some commentators to the NSA surveillance revelations. Yesterday Reuters’ Jack Shafer wrote that protests from world leaders “are largely contrived. As Max Boot and David Gewirtz wrote in Commentary's blog and ZDNet, respectively, nations have traditionally spied on allies both putative and stalwart. One excellent reason to spy on an ally, Gewirtz notes, is to confirm that the ally is really an ally. Allies sometimes become adversaries, so shifting signs must be monitored. Likewise, allies may be allies, but they always have their disagreements. What better way to prevent unpleasant surprises from an ally than by monitoring him?”</p> <p>This response can also be heard in some quarters in Germany, as my colleague <strong>Philip Oltermann</strong> reports. &quot;Everybody does it&quot; has been one common reaction: the Germans shouldn't make such a fuss, as they were probably bugging other leaders' phones too.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So do German intelligence services spy on other national leaders? Even critics of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND - Germany’s foreign intelligence agency) aren't convinced. Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, an intelligence expert who was previously been himself the target of BND surveillance, told the Guardian it was &quot;absurd&quot; to assume that the German intelligence service spied on allied nations.</p> <p>The BND is by no means staffed by saints, he argues. For one, it has been happy to share information gathered by US and UK agencies. But in its own activities it has traditionally concentrated on its core competence area of gathering information in countries where the German military is engaged, fighting international terrorism and tackling organised crime.</p> <p>One simple reason for this focus was staffing issues. While the number of NSA employees is estimated at over 40,000, and the number of GCHQ employees at around 5,800, Germany is thought to employ only about 1,300 agents working in &quot;technical surveillance&quot;. </p> <p>If David Cameron was on the target list of the BND, said Schmidt-Eenboom, we would probably know about it: all the search terms for electronic surveillance by the German intelligence service had to be signed off by the German parliament.</p> <p>According to an article in the S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung, the US and EU member states were not systematically spied on by either Germany's secret service or intelligence agencies. This was a decision that has been backed by a succession of German governments. Andrea Nahles, general secretary of the Social Democrats, has in the last few days come on the record to say that her party had no plans to change this strategy.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T13:35:50.207Z\">at 1.35pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-526faf4ce4b0ffc73763b629\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T12:53:38.266Z\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Journalist Marcy Wheeler, aka Empty Wheel, notes Dianne Feinstein's comment that she wants “a total review of all intelligence programs … so that members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are fully informed as to what is actually being carried out by the intelligence community&quot; <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/2013/10/29/one-day-after-rolling-out-comprehensive-review-feinstein-proceeds-with-mark-up-anyway/#sthash.QmWpQloE.dpuf\">and points out</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, her committee will nevertheless <a href=\"http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings.cfm?hearingId=5fa8a4fcfd512d43b3816f1ee7015d20\">conduct a mark-up</a> of her bill to not fix the spying targeted at Americans.</p> <p>Umm, given that she just admitted she doesn’t know everything the NSA has been doing — and that she hasn’t been fully informed — don’t you think the comprehensive review should precede the new legislation?</p> </blockquote> <p>A mark-up of a bill is the process by which a congressional committee debates and rewrites proposed legislation. </p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/statuses/395168957541273600\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>One Day after Rolling Out “Comprehensive Review,” Feinstein Proceeds with Mark-Up Anyway <a href=\"http://t.co/7Imh3vJjI1\">http://t.co/7Imh3vJjI1</a></p>— emptywheel (@emptywheel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/statuses/395168957541273600\">October 29, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526fad86e4b0ded76c0a90eb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T12:44:57.592Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Reuters has also spoken to a &quot;senior Obama administration official&quot; who has suggested Obama may ban spying on friendly leaders.

Separately, the NSA's inspector general reported 12 cases in which officers and analysts with access to the spying systems intentionally abused them, usually to monitor their lovers' phone calls.</p> </blockquote> <p>AP also points out that NSA director General Keith Alexander, who will testify today, has said the phone surveillance programme has stopped &quot;only one or two cases of terror activity out of about a dozen threats directed at the US&quot;.</p> <p>This the news agency describes as &quot;limited evidence showing why the telephone surveillance is important&quot;. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526fa220e4b0ffc73763b624\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T12:00:44.250Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Ahead of today's House hearing, James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence declassified dozens of pages of top-secret documents in an apparent bid to show the NSA was acting legally when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">gathered millions of Americans' phone records</a>.</p> <p>Clapper said he was following Obama's direction to make public as much information as possible about how US intelligence agencies spy under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. </p> <p>The release of the documents yesterday focused on section 215 of the Patriot Act, which is used to allow the bulk collection of US phone records. </p> <p>The Associated Press reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The documents support administration testimony that the NSA worked to operate within the law and fix errors when they or their systems overreached. One of the documents shows the NSA admitting to the House Intelligence Committee that one of its automated systems picked up too much telephone metadata. The February 2009 document indicates the problem was fixed.</p> <p> Another set of documents shows the judges of the FISA court seemed satisfied with the NSA's cooperation. It says that in September 2009, the NSA advised the Senate Intelligence Committee about its continuing collection of Americans' phone records and described a series of demonstrations and briefings it conducted for three judges on the secretive U.S. spy court. The memorandum said the judges were &quot;engaged throughout and asked questions, which were answered by the briefers and other subject matter experts,&quot; and said the judges appreciated the amount and quality of information the NSA provided.</p> <p> It said that two days later, one of the judges, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton, renewed the court's permission to resume collecting phone records.</p> <p> The documents also included previously classified testimony from 2009 for the House Intelligence Committee by Michael Leiter, then head of the National Counterterrorism Center. He and other officials said collecting Americans' phone records helped indict Najibullah Zazi, who was accused in a previously disclosed 2009 terror plot to bomb the New York City subways.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526fa1cfe4b0ffc73763b623\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T11:54:19.200Z\">11.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a> will receive a classified dossier in the next two weeks that will lay out the consequences for US foreign relations of the National Security Agency's powerful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\">surveillance</a> apparatus and provide the White House with a raft of possible reforms, reports <strong>Paul Lewis</strong> in Washington.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The document is being drafted by a top-level group of experts appointed by the president to conduct an external review of US surveillance capabilities and the damage to public trust resulting from the Edward Snowden disclosures.</p> <p>The review, parts of which will be declassified and released to the public, will be completed by mid-December.

But the disclosure that it is moving to prohibit it signals a landmark shift for the NSA, which has had nearly unfettered powers to collect data on tens of millions of people around the world, from ordinary citizens to heads of state, including the leaders of Brazil and Mexico.</p> <p>It is also likely to prompt a fierce debate on what constitutes an American ally. Prohibiting eavesdropping on Ms. Merkel’s phone is an easier judgment than, for example, collecting intelligence on the military-backed leaders in Egypt.</p> </blockquote> <p>The NYT adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The administration will reserve the right to continue collecting intelligence in friendly countries that pertains to criminal activity, potential terrorist threats and the proliferation of unconventional weapons, according to several officials. It also appeared to be leaving itself room in the case of a foreign leader of an ally who turned hostile or whose actions posed a threat to the United States.</p> </blockquote> <p>The paper also quotes Dennis C Blair, Obama’s first director of national intelligence, who had little sympathy for foreign leaders’ complaints:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If any foreign leader is talking on a cellphone or communicating on unclassified email, what the US might learn is the least of their problems.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526f848ee4b0ffc73763b619\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T09:54:02.622Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><em>Welcome to our hub for all Edward Snowden, NSA and GCHQ-related developments around the world, as controversy over revelations leaked by the whistleblower continue to make headlines. As arguments rage over how much of our day to day life should be monitored in the name of security, we'll be tracking the growing global debate about privacy in the digital age. We'd like to know what you think about the whole NSA story, what you're worried about – and any new areas you'd like to read more about.</em></p> <p>Good morning. The focus turns to Washington today, where the two most senior intelligence officials in the US are to testify before the House of Representatives intelligence committee.</p> <p>Both James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, and General Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, are expected to be questioned on why they appears not to have informed either the White House or congressional oversight committees about the spying activities directed at foreign leaders revealed over the past weeks.</p> <p>Clapper is also under fire for misleading Congress on bulk domestic collection. Alexander caused controversy last week when he mused that “we ought to come up with a way of stopping” reporters’ stories about the NSA.</p> <p>Also today James Sensenbrenner, the Republican author of the 2001 Patriot Act, the act which authorised the bulk collection of phone records, will introduce a bill called the United and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet Collection, and Online Monitoring Act or USA Freedom Act, which would ban warrantless bulk phone metadata collection and prevent the NSA from querying its foreign communications databases to identify information on Americans. Patrick Leahy, the Democratic chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, will simultaneously introduce a counterpart to the bill in the upper house.</p> <p>The moves come as:</p> <p><strong>•&nbsp;The chair of the Senate intelligence committee, who has been a loyal defender of the National Security Agency, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/nsa-surveillance-dianne-feinstein-opposed-allies\">dramatically broke ranks</a>, saying she was &quot;totally opposed&quot; to the US spying on allies and demanding a total review of all<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\"> surveillance</a> programmes.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>California Democratic senator<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/dianne-feinstein\"> Dianne Feinstein</a> strongly criticised the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\"> NSA</a>'s monitoring of the calls of friendly world leaders such as German chancellor Angela Merkel.</p> <p>Feinstein, who has steadfastly defended the NSA's mass surveillance programs, added that both Barack Obama and members of her committee, which is supposed to received classified briefings, had been kept in the dark about operations to target foreign leaders.</p> <p>&quot;It is abundantly clear that a total review of all intelligence programs is necessary so that members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are fully informed as to what is actually being carried out by the intelligence community,&quot; Feinstein said in a statement to reporters.</p> <p>&quot;Unlike NSA's collection of phone records under a court order, it is clear to me that certain surveillance activities have been in effect for more than a decade and that the Senate Intelligence Committee was not satisfactorily informed.</p> <p>&quot;With respect to NSA collection of intelligence on leaders of US allies – including France, Spain, Mexico and Germany – let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed,&quot; she said.</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong>Obama told ABC News that he would not discuss classified information but accepted that security operations were being reassessed to ensure proper oversight of the NSA's technical abilities.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/29/obama-nsa-spying-questions-video\">He said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The national security operations, generally, have one purpose and that is to make sure the American people are safe and that I'm making good decisions. I'm the final user of all the intelligence that they gather. But they're involved in a whole wide range of issues. We give them policy direction. But what we've seen over the last several years is their capacities continue to develop and expand, and that's why I'm initiating now a review to make sure that what they're able to do doesn't necessarily mean what they should be doing.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/29/obama-nsa-spying-questions-video\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"1988262\" data-video-name=\"Obama sidesteps questions on NSA spying and what he knew – video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\" data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/29/1383036511250/Barack-Obama--014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-421182850\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/29/1383036506898/Barack-Obama--010.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/29/131029ObamaNSA-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/29/131029ObamaNSA_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/29/131029ObamaNSA/131029ObamaNSA.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/29/131029ObamaNSA_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>The White House's chief spokesman, Jay Carney, said the administration &quot;acknowledged the tensions&quot; caused by Snowden's disclosures, saying:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The president clearly feels strongly about making sure we are not just collecting information because we can, but because we should.

Tensions were high over the possibility of military strikes on Syria, as well as over Russia's decision in August to grant asylum to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>The revelations from his dossier of leaked material continue to shake Washington DC and inflame parts of Europe.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lastampa.it/2013/10/29/esteri/il-regalo-avvelenato-di-putin-chiavette-usb-con-microspie-tgcan1MZYJaIopzSKRr5gI/pagina.html\" title=\"\">According to La Stampa</a>  and <a href=\"http://www.corriere.it/cronache/13_ottobre_29/gadget-truccati-regalo-leader-cosi-putin-voleva-spiare-l-europa-10353c34-406b-11e3-a16f-76083166bd35.shtml\" title=\"\">Corriere della Sera</a> , the first person to raise the alarm over the Russian devices was Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European council, who allegedly went to intelligence services in Brussels and Germany for advice on whether they were what they seemed.</p><p>Initial tests carried out by the German secret services reportedly revealed the devices to be equipped with \"Trojan horse\" programmes \"capable of illicitly picking up computer and mobile phone data\", according to a warning allegedly sent subsequently to guest countries represented at the G20 summit.</p><p>Delegates were urged \"to take every possible precaution in the event of these objects having been used and, if they have not been, to hand them over to the security services for further tests\", according to Corriere. It said further tests were ongoing.</p><p>It was unclear how many delegates and leaders had received the gifts and even less clear whether any of them had actually used the flash drives and chargers, the newspapers wrote.</p><p>Dmitri Peskov, spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, denied the allegations, saying they were \"a clear attempt to divert attention from a problem that really exists: the US's spying, which is now a subject of discussion among European capitals and Washington\". He told the Ansa news agency that Russia does not know the sources of the reports, adding that in any case they were baseless.</p><p>But the eyebrow-raising claims of what La Stampa termed \"Putin's poisoned gift\" appeared to have prompted the Italian government to take action on the growing number of allegations regarding covert spying operations. In a statement on Tuesday, it said the country's prime minister, Enrico Letta, had called for the inter-ministerial security committee to meet on Thursday to discuss \"questions pertaining to the security of telecommunications in the light of the Datagate [NSA] affair and the revelations on the last G20\".</p><p>The Italian reports are not the first to have accused a G20 host nation of spying on its guests. In June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/16/gchq-intercepted-communications-g20-summits\" title=\"\">the Guardian disclosed</a> that foreign politicians and officials who took part in two such meetings in London in 2009 had their computers monitored and phone calls intercepted on the instructions of their British government hosts.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421224362|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|a7326ac70ff129473f2e71dac6768ed8ce6a103e -->",

        "body":"<p>Barack Obama will receive a classified dossier in the next two weeks that will lay out the consequences for US foreign relations of the National Security Agency's powerful surveillance apparatus and provide the White House with a raft of possible reforms.</p><p>The document is being drafted by a top-level group of experts appointed by the president to conduct an external review of US surveillance capabilities and the damage to public trust resulting from the Edward Snowden disclosures. </p><p>The review, parts of which will be declassified and released to the public, will be completed by mid-December. However, a senior administration official familiar with the process said a secret \"interim report\" will be shared with the president shortly.</p><p>The group's work has been delayed slightly because of the recent US government shutdown, but it is expected to submit the report to the president via the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, in the week beginning 11 November.</p><p>The review is being carried out by a panel that includes Richard Clarke, a former White House counter-terrorism chief, and Michael Morell, the previous deputy director of the CIA. </p><p>Its importance has been amplified over the last week, after a series of revelations about the nature and scope of monitoring activities abroad, particularly against US allies.</p><p>On Monday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/spain-summons-us-ambassador-nsa-calls\">the US ambassador to Spain, James Costos, was summoned by the prime minister</a> after reports in the El Mundo newspaper that the NSA had spied on 60 million phone calls in the country during one recent 30-day period.</p><p>The Spanish government called on the US to hand over all necessary information concerning \"supposed eavesdropping carried out in Spain\". Spain joins Brazil, Mexico, Germany and France on a list of countries demanding answers from the administration. On Monday, a delegation from the European parliament arrived in Washington to discuss the spy allegations with US lawmakers. </p><p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls\">the Guardian revealed</a> that the NSA monitored the phone conversations of at least 35 world leaders. Separately, Angela Merkel called Obama to protest that her phone had been monitored, with Der Spiegel reporting on Sunday that the surveillance on the German chancellor began as early as 2002.</p><p>Asked about the reports on Monday, the White House's chief spokesman, Jay Carney, said the administration \"acknowledged the tensions\" caused by Snowden's disclosures. \"We understand this has caused concern in countries that represent some of our closest relationships internationally,\" he said, \"and we are working to allay those concerns and to discuss these issues.\"</p><p>\"The president clearly feels strongly about making sure we are not just collecting information because we can, but because we should,\" Carney said. \"We recognize there needs to be additional constraints on how we gather and use intelligence.\" </p><p>Jen Psaki, spokeswoman for the the State Department, which is managing the diplomatic fallout, added that the US was \"not naive\" about the impact of the disclosures on foreign relations.</p><p>The White House has declined to say whether Merkel's phone was monitored in the past. But according to the Wall Street Journal, the Obama administration ordered the NSA to cease the surveillance of her and other leaders after the program emerged over the summer in a separate, internal review of the agency's activities.</p><p>Carney said that internal review, led by the White House with input from agencies across government, will also also be completed before the end of the year. It contains what Carney described as a \"separate\" component dedicated to dealing with issues relating to \"some of the very specific things with regard to intelligence gathered, including matters that deal with heads of states and other governments\". </p><p>The external review, which will feed into the White House's internal assessment of surveillance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/nsa-surveillance-review-panel-insiders\">has itself been criticised</a> for being too close to the Obama administration. </p><p>In addition to Clarke and Morell, the panel, which first met on 27 August, includes a law school professor, Geoffrey Stone, the former White House official Cass Sunstein and Peter Swire, who advised Obama and former president Bill Clinton on privacy. </p><p>The group has been tasked with reconsidering surveillance capabilities \"in light of advancements in technology\", seeking to find the right balance between national security interests and maintaining standards of privacy and civil liberties.</p><p>When he announced the review in early August, Obama specifically said it should consider \"how surveillance impacts our foreign policy – particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public\".</p><p>The foreign policy component of its work has now provided a renewed focus. The extent of anger among foreign countries, particularly in Europe, has taken some administration officials by surprise. The most furious reaction has come from Germany, which is planning to send a delegation to Washington in the coming days.</p><p>The delegation is expected to include the directors of Germany's foreign and domestic intelligence services, who will expect to meet their counterparts, including the director of the NSA, General Keith Alexander, according to a source with knowledge of the trip. </p><p>The delegation, which will arrive late this week or early next, will also include high-ranking officials from Chancellor Merkel's office who will meet with counterparts on the White House's national security council.</p><p>Separately, a group of European Union parliamentarians arrived in Washington on Monday to meet with US lawmakers and senior national security officials and discuss what the White House called \"privacy issues\".</p><p>US representative Mike Rogers, a Republican, said afterward they discussed the need to rebuild trust and share intelligence. </p><p>Rogers, a staunch defender of US intelligence agencies, acknowledged the parliamentarians have brought legitimate concerns, according to Reuters.</p><p>\"It's important to understand that we're going to have to have a policy discussion that is bigger than any individual intelligence agency of either Europe or the United States,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421150470|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|7052f5d11dac48f75040e96b0047d07da9c7bb52 -->",

They include a report in the Guardian, based on documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, that at least 35 world leaders have been monitored by the agency.</p><p>\"Unless the United States is engaged in hostilities against a country or there is an emergency need for this type of surveillance, I do not believe the United States should be collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers. The president should be required to approve any collection of this sort,\" Feinstein added.</p><p>\"The White House has informed me that collection on our allies will not continue, which I support. But as far as I'm concerned, Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing. To that end, the committee will initiate a major review into all intelligence collection programs.\"</p><p>Feinstein's statement comes at a crucial time for the NSA. Legislation will be introduced in Congress on Tuesday that would curtail the agency's powers, and there are the first signs that the White House may be starting to distance itself from security chiefs. On Monday, the White House's chief spokesman, Jay Carney, said the administration \"acknowledged the tensions\" caused by Snowden's disclosures. </p><p>\"The president clearly feels strongly about making sure we are not just collecting information because we can, but because we should,\" Carney said. \"We recognize there needs to be additional constraints on how we gather and use intelligence.\" </p><p>Obama told ABC News on Monday evening that he would not discuss classified information but accepted that security operations were being reassessed to ensure proper oversight of the NSA's technical abilities.</p><p>He said: \"The national security operations, generally, have one purpose and that is to make sure the American people are safe and that I'm making good decisions. I'm the final user of all the intelligence that they gather. But they're involved in a whole wide range of issues.</p><p>\"We give them policy direction. But what we've seen over the last several years is their capacities continue to develop and expand, and that's why I'm initiating now a review to make sure that what they're able to do doesn't necessarily mean what they should be doing.\"</p><p>On Tuesday morning, James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican and author of the 2001 Patriot Act, will introduce a bill called the USA Freedom Act that will ban warrantless bulk phone metadata collection and prevent the NSA from querying its foreign communications databases for identifying information on Americans. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chairs the Senate judiciary committee, will introduce the bill's Senate counterpart that same day. </p><p>Also on Tuesday, the two most senior intelligence leaders are due to testify before the House intelligence committee. Both are now expected to be grilled on why they appear not to have informed either the White House or congressional oversight committees about the spying activities directed at foreign leaders.</p><p>James Clapper, the director of national intelligence who is under fire for misleading Congress on bulk domestic collection, will testify about surveillance reform Tuesday afternoon. He will be accompanied by General Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, who last week mused to a Pentagon blog that \"we ought to come up with a way of stopping\" reporters' stories about the NSA's bulk collection programs. </p><p>Their performance is likely to be influential towards members of Congress on the fence about bulk domestic collection ahead of a vote on Sensenbrenner's bill. A July predecessor came within seven votes of passage. </p><p>Feinstein's shifting position was not the only emerging challenge confronting the NSA late Monday. A new disclosure from the Electronic Frontier Foundation added to the agency's woes by suggesting that it began testing means to gather location data on cellphones inside the US before informing the secret surveillance court that oversees it.</p><p>A short document apparently written in 2011 by an NSA lawyer discussed a 2010 \"mobility testing effort\" involving \"cell site locations.\" The lawyer, whose name was redacted in a document obtained by the group under the Freedom of Information Act, said that the Justice Department was believed to have \"orally advised\" the so-called Fisa Court that \"we had obtained a limited set of test data sampling of cellular mobility data (cell site location information) pursuant to the Court-authorized program\" under section 215 of the Patriot Act, which the NSA uses to justify collecting Americans' phone records in bulk.</p><p>Alexander recently conceded that the so-called \"pilot program\" for cellular geolocation collection existed and said it was potentially a \"future requirement for the country.\" It was previously unknown that the pilot program proceeded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/nsa-us-cell-phone-data-location-programs\">before the Fisa Court knew of it.</a> </p><p>Just a month ago, in her own committee, Feinstein, delivered a full-throated and unequivocal defence of every surveillance activity conducted by the NSA.</p><p>\"It is my opinion that the surveillance activities conducted under FISA, and other programs operated by the National Security Agency, are lawful, they are effective, and they are conducted under careful oversight within the NSA, by the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and by the FISA Court and the Congress,\" Feinstein said on September 26.</p><p>In August, following disclosures that the NSA had improperly collected data on thousands of Americans, Feinstein accused the Washington Post of misquoting her, saying her committee \"has never identified an instance in which the NSA has intentionally abused its authority to conduct surveillance for inappropriate purposes\".</p><p>Feinstein is bringing her own legislation to enable superficial reforms of the NSA and the secret court system, but stops short of curbing the intelligence community's powers, is being marked up at her committee on Tuesday.</p><p>Feinstein's about-face presents the major challenge for the White House, which perceives the California Democrat as a key Senate surrogate on surveillance issues. </p><p>Obama has yet to take a position on the Leahy and Sensenbrenner bills. Congressional aides expect a major push by the NSA to defeat the bills, but are unsure how vigorously the White House will oppose them. </p><p>Carney's remarks on Monday, prompted by a growing sense of diplomatic backlash against the US over the NSA, provide additional uncertainty. US officials have distanced Obama from the foreign-leader spying in anonymous comments to the Wall Street Journal.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421160303|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|19101ad41f396d2f40985b1bbf2e74630e05e031 -->",

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>• The leaders of America's intelligence services said the l<strong>oss of surveillance capabilities could lead to a &quot;catastrophic&quot; 9/11-like attack on the United States</strong>. DNI James Clapper and NSA director Keith Alexander testified as new legislation was introduced in Congress with substantial bipartisan support to limit NSA surveillance capabilities.</p> <p><strong>• The intelligence officials agreed in principle to the declassification of some Fisa court opinions,</strong> as a gesture of transparency. The length of time the NSA stores American's phone metadata might be reduced to three years from five. And the creation of a permanent advocate role on the court was deemed possible although the justice department witness opposed it.</p> <p>• <strong>Clapper did not deny that the US conducts surveillance on foreign leaders</strong>. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/nsa-files-us-intelligence-officials-testify-in-congress-live-coverage#block-52701100e4b08c7e086ff162\">debate</a> broke out on the committee over whether committee members had been informed of the practice.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• Alexander said reports that NSA collects tens of millions of phone calls in France are &quot;completely false.&quot; </strong>He didn't talk about metadata collection performed by NSA.&nbsp;He said the reports have mistaken data &quot;provided to NSA by foreign partners&quot; for data NSA collects.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• The conversation was restricted to two intelligence programs that so far have garnered a lion's share of media coverage:</strong> phone metadata collection and the surveillance of foreign Internet users. Both programs are subject to Fisa court approval. Critics warn that both programs sweep up substantial intelligence about Americans in a way that relies on tendentious interpretations of the law.</p> <p><strong>• White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president had already made some changes</strong> to US spy practices even as a review of those practices continues. Multiple anonymous White House officials said the president had ended spying on friendly leaders. Carney would not comment on those reports.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/statuses/395297007369084928\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Actually more useful than most House--esp most HPSCI--hearings.

Clapper, without confirming that the spying took place, seemed to concede that, saying only “we have by and large complied with the spirit and intent of the law.”</p> <p>Schiff drew a heated and unexpected rebuke from Rogers, who called his suggestion “disingenuous.” The committee has access to “mounds of product” from the NSA, Rogers said. Schiff shot back a direct question about whether Rogers in fact knew about the foreign leader spying, which Rogers said he could not answer without confirming – but invited the committee member to view reams of intelligence in private.</p> <p>Later, Schiff returned to the colloquy. The California Democrat said that yes, NSA reports the &quot;selectors&quot; it spies on, but &quot;not all selectors are equal.&quot; The implication seemed to be that the NSA doesn't specify explicitly to the committee when a &quot;leader of an allied nation&quot; – &quot;not an average selector,&quot; Schiff said – has been spied upon.&nbsp;</p> <p>Schiff said &quot;we need a discussion here&quot; about the standards by which the NSA contextualizes to the oversight committee when a major foreign figure has been spied upon. He suggested that the current standard was lower than the one the CIA must employ when reporting a covert action.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T20:04:24.317Z\">at 8.04pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52701070e4b0ded76c0a9120\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T19:47:51.673Z\">7.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The NSA programs under discussion today are administered by the Fisa court under rules amended in 2008. <strong>The court has been criticized as a rubber stamp t</strong>hat automatically accedes to intelligence community requests.&nbsp;</p> <p>James Cole, the deputy attorney general on the panel next to Clapper and Alexander, points out that it's really more efficient that way:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stuartmillar159/statuses/395274114128044032\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Deputy AG Cole says making FISA court adversarial would &quot;slow down&quot; the work of the court and the intel community</p>— Stuart Millar (@stuartmillar159) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuartmillar159/statuses/395274114128044032\">October 29, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52700a9de4b08c7e086ff15b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T19:38:51.432Z\">7.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>An interesting exchange between Rep.

Yesterday Reuters’ Jack Shafer wrote that protests from world leaders “are largely contrived. As Max Boot and David Gewirtz wrote in Commentary's blog and ZDNet, respectively, nations have traditionally spied on allies both putative and stalwart. One excellent reason to spy on an ally, Gewirtz notes, is to confirm that the ally is really an ally. Allies sometimes become adversaries, so shifting signs must be monitored. Likewise, allies may be allies, but they always have their disagreements. What better way to prevent unpleasant surprises from an ally than by monitoring him?”</p> <p>This response can also be heard in some quarters in Germany, as my colleague <strong>Philip Oltermann</strong> reports. &quot;Everybody does it&quot; has been one common reaction: the Germans shouldn't make such a fuss, as they were probably bugging other leaders' phones too.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So do German intelligence services spy on other national leaders? Even critics of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND - Germany’s foreign intelligence agency) aren't convinced. Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, an intelligence expert who was previously been himself the target of BND surveillance, told the Guardian it was &quot;absurd&quot; to assume that the German intelligence service spied on allied nations.</p> <p>The BND is by no means staffed by saints, he argues. For one, it has been happy to share information gathered by US and UK agencies. But in its own activities it has traditionally concentrated on its core competence area of gathering information in countries where the German military is engaged, fighting international terrorism and tackling organised crime.</p> <p>One simple reason for this focus was staffing issues. While the number of NSA employees is estimated at over 40,000, and the number of GCHQ employees at around 5,800, Germany is thought to employ only about 1,300 agents working in &quot;technical surveillance&quot;. </p> <p>If David Cameron was on the target list of the BND, said Schmidt-Eenboom, we would probably know about it: all the search terms for electronic surveillance by the German intelligence service had to be signed off by the German parliament.</p> <p>According to an article in the S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung, the US and EU member states were not systematically spied on by either Germany's secret service or intelligence agencies. This was a decision that has been backed by a succession of German governments. Andrea Nahles, general secretary of the Social Democrats, has in the last few days come on the record to say that her party had no plans to change this strategy.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T13:35:50.207Z\">at 1.35pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-526faf4ce4b0ffc73763b629\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T12:53:38.266Z\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Journalist Marcy Wheeler, aka Empty Wheel, notes Dianne Feinstein's comment that she wants “a total review of all intelligence programs … so that members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are fully informed as to what is actually being carried out by the intelligence community&quot; <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/2013/10/29/one-day-after-rolling-out-comprehensive-review-feinstein-proceeds-with-mark-up-anyway/#sthash.QmWpQloE.dpuf\">and points out</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, her committee will nevertheless <a href=\"http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings.cfm?hearingId=5fa8a4fcfd512d43b3816f1ee7015d20\">conduct a mark-up</a> of her bill to not fix the spying targeted at Americans.</p> <p>Umm, given that she just admitted she doesn’t know everything the NSA has been doing — and that she hasn’t been fully informed — don’t you think the comprehensive review should precede the new legislation?</p> </blockquote> <p>A mark-up of a bill is the process by which a congressional committee debates and rewrites proposed legislation. </p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/statuses/395168957541273600\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>One Day after Rolling Out “Comprehensive Review,” Feinstein Proceeds with Mark-Up Anyway <a href=\"http://t.co/7Imh3vJjI1\">http://t.co/7Imh3vJjI1</a></p>— emptywheel (@emptywheel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/statuses/395168957541273600\">October 29, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526fad86e4b0ded76c0a90eb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T12:44:57.592Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Reuters has also spoken to a &quot;senior Obama administration official&quot; who has suggested Obama may ban spying on friendly leaders.

He and other officials said collecting Americans' phone records helped indict Najibullah Zazi, who was accused in a previously disclosed 2009 terror plot to bomb the New York City subways.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526fa1cfe4b0ffc73763b623\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T11:54:19.200Z\">11.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a> will receive a classified dossier in the next two weeks that will lay out the consequences for US foreign relations of the National Security Agency's powerful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\">surveillance</a> apparatus and provide the White House with a raft of possible reforms, reports <strong>Paul Lewis</strong> in Washington.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The document is being drafted by a top-level group of experts appointed by the president to conduct an external review of US surveillance capabilities and the damage to public trust resulting from the Edward Snowden disclosures.</p> <p>The review, parts of which will be declassified and released to the public, will be completed by mid-December.

But the disclosure that it is moving to prohibit it signals a landmark shift for the NSA, which has had nearly unfettered powers to collect data on tens of millions of people around the world, from ordinary citizens to heads of state, including the leaders of Brazil and Mexico.</p> <p>It is also likely to prompt a fierce debate on what constitutes an American ally. Prohibiting eavesdropping on Ms. Merkel’s phone is an easier judgment than, for example, collecting intelligence on the military-backed leaders in Egypt.</p> </blockquote> <p>The NYT adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The administration will reserve the right to continue collecting intelligence in friendly countries that pertains to criminal activity, potential terrorist threats and the proliferation of unconventional weapons, according to several officials. It also appeared to be leaving itself room in the case of a foreign leader of an ally who turned hostile or whose actions posed a threat to the United States.</p> </blockquote> <p>The paper also quotes Dennis C Blair, Obama’s first director of national intelligence, who had little sympathy for foreign leaders’ complaints:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If any foreign leader is talking on a cellphone or communicating on unclassified email, what the US might learn is the least of their problems.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526f848ee4b0ffc73763b619\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-29T09:54:02.622Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><em>Welcome to our hub for all Edward Snowden, NSA and GCHQ-related developments around the world, as controversy over revelations leaked by the whistleblower continue to make headlines. As arguments rage over how much of our day to day life should be monitored in the name of security, we'll be tracking the growing global debate about privacy in the digital age. We'd like to know what you think about the whole NSA story, what you're worried about – and any new areas you'd like to read more about.</em></p> <p>Good morning. The focus turns to Washington today, where the two most senior intelligence officials in the US are to testify before the House of Representatives intelligence committee.</p> <p>Both James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, and General Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, are expected to be questioned on why they appears not to have informed either the White House or congressional oversight committees about the spying activities directed at foreign leaders revealed over the past weeks.</p> <p>Clapper is also under fire for misleading Congress on bulk domestic collection. Alexander caused controversy last week when he mused that “we ought to come up with a way of stopping” reporters’ stories about the NSA.</p> <p>Also today James Sensenbrenner, the Republican author of the 2001 Patriot Act, the act which authorised the bulk collection of phone records, will introduce a bill called the United and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet Collection, and Online Monitoring Act or USA Freedom Act, which would ban warrantless bulk phone metadata collection and prevent the NSA from querying its foreign communications databases to identify information on Americans. Patrick Leahy, the Democratic chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, will simultaneously introduce a counterpart to the bill in the upper house.</p> <p>The moves come as:</p> <p><strong>•&nbsp;The chair of the Senate intelligence committee, who has been a loyal defender of the National Security Agency, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/nsa-surveillance-dianne-feinstein-opposed-allies\">dramatically broke ranks</a>, saying she was &quot;totally opposed&quot; to the US spying on allies and demanding a total review of all<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\"> surveillance</a> programmes.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>California Democratic senator<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/dianne-feinstein\"> Dianne Feinstein</a> strongly criticised the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\"> NSA</a>'s monitoring of the calls of friendly world leaders such as German chancellor Angela Merkel.</p> <p>Feinstein, who has steadfastly defended the NSA's mass surveillance programs, added that both Barack Obama and members of her committee, which is supposed to received classified briefings, had been kept in the dark about operations to target foreign leaders.</p> <p>&quot;It is abundantly clear that a total review of all intelligence programs is necessary so that members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are fully informed as to what is actually being carried out by the intelligence community,&quot; Feinstein said in a statement to reporters.</p> <p>&quot;Unlike NSA's collection of phone records under a court order, it is clear to me that certain surveillance activities have been in effect for more than a decade and that the Senate Intelligence Committee was not satisfactorily informed.</p> <p>&quot;With respect to NSA collection of intelligence on leaders of US allies – including France, Spain, Mexico and Germany – let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed,&quot; she said.</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong>Obama told ABC News that he would not discuss classified information but accepted that security operations were being reassessed to ensure proper oversight of the NSA's technical abilities.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/29/obama-nsa-spying-questions-video\">He said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The national security operations, generally, have one purpose and that is to make sure the American people are safe and that I'm making good decisions. I'm the final user of all the intelligence that they gather. But they're involved in a whole wide range of issues. We give them policy direction. But what we've seen over the last several years is their capacities continue to develop and expand, and that's why I'm initiating now a review to make sure that what they're able to do doesn't necessarily mean what they should be doing.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/29/obama-nsa-spying-questions-video\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"1988262\" data-video-name=\"Obama sidesteps questions on NSA spying and what he knew – video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\" data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/29/1383036511250/Barack-Obama--014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-421182850\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/29/1383036506898/Barack-Obama--010.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/29/131029ObamaNSA-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/29/131029ObamaNSA_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/29/131029ObamaNSA/131029ObamaNSA.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/29/131029ObamaNSA_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>The White House's chief spokesman, Jay Carney, said the administration &quot;acknowledged the tensions&quot; caused by Snowden's disclosures, saying:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The president clearly feels strongly about making sure we are not just collecting information because we can, but because we should.

        "headline":"Congressional duo launch NSA overhaul bill and urge 'meaningful reform'",
        "body":"<p>The chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, Patrick Leahy, warned against cosmetic reform of US surveillance practices as he launched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/29/usa-freedom-act-jim-sensenbrenner-nsa-reform-full-text%20\">sweeping new legislation</a> to rein in the nation's intelligence agencies.</p> <p>\"It is time for serious and meaningful reforms so we can restore confidence in our intelligence community,&rdquo; he said in a statement accompanying the legislation's formal introduction before Congress.&nbsp;&ldquo;Modest transparency and oversight provisions are not enough. We need real reform.&rdquo;</p> <p>Leahy, the longest-serving US senator, launched the USA Freedom Act on Tuesday morning in partnership with congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, who in 2001 co-authored the Patriot Act, which first open the door to the wide-ranging surveillance programs.</p> <p>The two veterans of House and Senate legal oversight said it was time to restore the balance between privacy and security.</p> <p>&ldquo;Following 9/11, the Patriot Act passed the judiciary committees with overwhelming bipartisan support,&rdquo; said Sensenbrenner. &ldquo;But somewhere along the way, the balance between security and privacy was lost. It&rsquo;s now time for the judiciary committees to again come together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure the law is properly interpreted, past abuses are not repeated and American liberties are protected.&rdquo;</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/the-usa-freedom-act-a-look-at-the-key-points-of-the-draft-bill\">Their new legislation</a>, simultaneously introduced in both House and Senate, aims to ban the National Security Agency from using the Patriot Act to collect bulk telephone records in the US and close a similar loophole in the Foreign Intelligence&nbsp;Surveillance Act (Fisa) which has allowed the content of American communications to be targeted.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;The government surveillance programs conducted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance&nbsp;Act are far broader than the American people previously understood,&rdquo; said Leahy.</p> <p>The bill also calls for a special advocate to focus on the protection of privacy rights and civil liberties before the court that oversees Fisa requests by the NSA, and requires more detailed public reporting about the numbers and types of court orders that are issued.</p> <p>It does not yet include reforms of overseas activity, although such amendments are expected to be introduced soon, according to congressional staff involved in the drafting.</p> <p>The legislation draws on earlier reform efforts in the House that were narrowly defeated before further NSA revelations appeared over the summer, and has already attracted support from many members of Congress who were previously sceptical of the need for legal change.&nbsp;&ldquo;Washington must regain Americans&rsquo; trust in their government,&rdquo; said Sensebrenner. &ldquo;|The USA Freedom Act is an essential first step.&rdquo;</p> <p>The bill has 16 co-sponsors in the Senate including senators Mike Lee (R-Utah), Dick Durbin (D-Ill), Dean Heller (R-Nev), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tom Udall (D-NM), Mark Begich (D-Alaska), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-Mass), Mark Udall (D-Colo), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore), Jon Tester (D-Mont), and Joe Schatz (D-Hawaii).</p> <p>The measure also has more than 70 bipartisan co-sponsors in the House and enjoys the diverse support of groups ranging from the National Rifle Association to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p> <p>Efforts to reform the NSA are also gaining support from party leaders, including House speaker John Boehner.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don't think there is any question there ought to be a review,&rdquo; Boehner said on Tueday. &ldquo;We have got obligations to defend our people and obligations to our allies, but we have got to find the right balance. We are imbalanced as we stand here.&rdquo;</p> <p>The bill's publication was well received by independent experts who said it should address weaknesses in existing law. &ldquo;This bill would go a long way toward restoring the presumption of privacy for the communications and personal information of law-abiding Americans,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Goitein of the&nbsp;Brennan Center for Justice at&nbsp;New York University law school. &ldquo;The NSA and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court have secretly interpreted the law to allow the broad collection of Americans&rsquo; information, even where the law expressly prohibits the targeting of Americans or requires a showing of relevance to an international terrorism investigation. The bill is designed to put an end to this perversion of the law.&rdquo; </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421219066|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|7c2afff21ccb8486e64b0f2a32b0810640b6dfaf -->",

        "headline":"National security: learning the Feinstein lesson",
        "body":"<p>Senator Dianne Feinstein is a former mayor of San Francisco who has represented California in the US Senate for more than 20 years. But a stereotypical west coast Democrat she most certainly is not. She supported the Iraq war and co-sponsored a 2002 law banning entry to the US from nations that sponsor terrorism. She has defended the sweeping detention and intercept powers in George Bush's Patriot Act. In 2007 she backed immunity for telecoms companies which allowed the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on international phone calls. Since becoming chairman of the Senate intelligence committee – the key job in the US security oversight process – she has consistently defended the NSA against the issues raised in the Edward Snowden files. Ten days ago <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/10/20/nsa-call-records-program-sen-dianne-feinstein-editorials-debates/3112715/\" title=\"\">she again gave another trenchant defence</a> of the NSA's data trawling.</p><p>This week, however, Ms Feinstein did a spectacular about-turn. She called for a review of all US intelligence surveillance programmes. Not bits of them. Not this or that programme. All of them. The tipping point was the revelation that the NSA has been monitoring the calls of friendly world leaders such as Angela Merkel. Mrs Merkel's calls had been monitored since 2002, three years before she became German chancellor, the senator confirmed. And no one had thought fit to tell President Obama.</p><p>It is worth reading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/nsa-surveillance-dianne-feinstein-opposed-allies\" title=\"\">what Ms Feinstein said this week</a>. \"It is abundantly clear,\" she said, \"that a total review of all intelligence programmes is necessary so that members of the Senate intelligence committee are fully informed as to what is actually being carried out by the intelligence community.\" To repeat: these are the words of someone who has staunchly defended the agencies, their powers and their work throughout the recent past. They are the words of someone who takes her oversight function seriously. And they are also truly devastating words.</p><p>Her change of heart should be taken very seriously. Senator Feinstein has not suddenly become an anti-government agitator. She is still committed to the agencies, their powers and their work. She continues to defend the NSA's sweeping collection of phone records, which she believes is a lawful process. But the revelation that the US has been routinely monitoring the communications of at least 35 world leaders, including Mrs Merkel, has led her to believe that all US intelligence surveillance programmes need to be comprehensively reviewed. Note the words once more: \"Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing. To that end, the committee will initiate a major review into all intelligence collection programmes.\"</p><p>Britain's politicians should take careful note of what is happening in Washington – and in a succession of European and other capitals too, most recently in Madrid. Responsible investigative journalism has unearthed a situation that the oversight system had no idea was taking place. The right response to that is the one that Senator Feinstein, in common <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/nsa-surveillance-review-intelligence-chiefs-testify\" title=\"\">with many other US legislators</a> including the drafter of the Patriot Act, has now embraced. The NSA was not under proper control. It has extended its reach too far. It has misled the politicians. The systems of oversight and law therefore need to be re-examined. The problem is the surveillance programmes, not the journalism that has told the story.</p><p>Britain's parliamentarians have not yet measured up. It is time they did. Like the Americans, they need to focus on the message, not the messenger. They need to use their powers – they are there to be used – to probe and question the agencies and the oversight regime. They need to understand better, because Britain, like the US, needs a better balance between security and liberty in an era transformed by technologies that most politicians barely know exist. They need to look beyond Whitehall to Europe and the US. Look at the remarks of Senator Feinstein. She has set up a review of all intelligence surveillance programmes. If she can, why can't we?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421242131|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|f5bf3e00103cc3e1832779fb9b287be8f3aae381 -->",

        "body":"<p>US intelligence agencies were facing an increasingly hostile Congress on Tuesday as lawmakers prepared multiple efforts to rein in a series of surveillance programs from which even the White House was distancing itself.</p> <p>Director of national intelligence James Clapper and NSA director Keith Alexander were due to testify at an open hearing of the House intelligence committee amid growing signs of a split between the intelligence community and the Obama administration.</p> <p>The hearing comes just 24 hours after the intelligence chiefs found themselves abandoned by Washington's political establishment, with anonymous administration officials claiming President Obama was unaware of the extent spying on foreign leaders &ndash; a practice <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/nsa-surveillance-dianne-feinstein-opposed-allies\">unexpectedly rebuked</a> by Senate intelligence chair Dianne Feinstein, who has been a significant NSA ally.</p> <p>Meanwhile, legislative efforts to end bulk collection of Americans&rsquo; communications data gathered pace with two complementary bipartisan bills aimed at curbing &ldquo;a trust deficit&rdquo; sparked by the revelations by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, a veteran Wisconsin Republican and author of the Patriot Act, introduced his long-awaited USA Freedom Act, that would stop the NSA&rsquo;s bulk domestic phone records collection.&nbsp;The legislation would also stop the NSA from searching through its foreign communications databases for identifying information on Americans.</p> <p>A companion bill in the Senate was also being introduced Tuesday by Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chairs the Senate judiciary committee. Both bills have already attracted significant support: Sensenbrenner claims 60 co-sponsors, including eight who either opposed or abstained from a July effort in the House to stop the bulk phone records collection, a number that would have swung the earlier vote against the NSA. Both bills will come through the judiciary committees, whose members are far more sceptical of the surveillance activities than the intelligence committees.</p> <p>&ldquo;The intelligence community now faces a trust deficit with the American public that compromises its ability to do its job,&rdquo; Leahy and Sensenbrenner wrote<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/leahy-sensenbrenner-nsa-reform-98953.html#ixzz2j7AUumvn\"> in an op-ed for Politico</a> on Tuesday. &ldquo;It is not enough to just make minor tweaks around the edges. It is time for real, substantive reform.&rdquo;</p> <p>Those bills still face a tough ride through Congress, not least because they are up against Feinstein&rsquo;s own surveillance legislation which will be marked up, the process by which a congressional committee debates and rewrites proposed legislation,&nbsp;on Tuesday in a closed-door session of the Senate.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has launched a legal action against the NSA&rsquo;s domestic phone records collection in a New York federal court, threw its support behind the Leahy-Sensenbrenner effort.&nbsp;&ldquo;The legislation introduced today by Senator Leahy and Representative Sensenbrenner is a true reform bill that rejects the false and dangerous notion that privacy and our fundamental freedoms are incompatible with security,&rdquo; said Michelle Richardson, the ACLU&rsquo;s surveillance lobbyist.</p> <p>The first salvo in the fight against Leahy and Sensenbrenner&rsquo;s bill was due to come on Tuesday afternoon, in the House intelligence committee. Clapper, Alexander, NSA deputy director John C Inglis and deputy attorney general James Cole were due to testify about pending legislative reforms to their broad surveillance powers.</p> <p>The chairman of that committee, congressman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican and former FBI agent, is the NSA&rsquo;s strongest congressional supporter. He has pledged to introduce legislation that will increase transparency around NSA&rsquo;s bulk surveillance but leave the surveillance intact.</p> <p>Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who has long opposed the bulk collection, recently attacked Rogers and his ilk as the &ldquo;business as usual brigade,&rdquo; who plan on trading transparency for substantive surveillance reform.</p> <p>Until Monday afternoon, a charter member of that group and staunch ally of Rogers was his Senate counterpart, Dianne Feinstein. But Feinstein unexpectedly pledged that her committee to undertake a &ldquo;major review into all intelligence collection programs&rdquo;, a dramatic reversal of the unequivocal and vocal support she has given the NSA in the five months since the Guardian began publishing secret surveillance documents leaked by Snowden.</p> <p>Feinstein declared herself &ldquo;totally opposed&rdquo; to NSA spying on US allies like France and Germany and suggested that the White House was going to ban the practice &ndash; something the White House spent Monday evening knocking back.</p> <p>Her position left many longtime intelligence observers puzzled. NSA spying on foreign leaders is far more traditional than its domestic bulk collection, which Feinstein has not criticized.</p> <p>Regardless of Feinstein&rsquo;s motivations, intelligence veterans seemed to understand that the political momentum is not on their side.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really screwed now,&rdquo; an anonymous NSA official told <a href=\"http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/10/28/were_really_screwed_now_nsas_best_friend_just_shivved_the_spies\">Foreign Policy magazine</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Adding to their dilemma, the NSA and the White House have spent days trading and deflecting blame for the major diplomatic embarrassment caused by the revelation that the NSA had spied on the communications of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The White House has told reporters that it was unaware of the practice, which has left intelligence veterans feeling abandoned.</p> <p>On Monday, Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, said an internal reform panel was examining options to curtail spying on foreign allies &ndash; raising an expectation that Obama will rein in that relatively traditional NSA surveillance activity. In the background are reports from France, Germany and Spain that NSA collection on those countries has turned broader than typical spycraft, thanks to technological innovation and leeway from US policy.</p> <p>&ldquo;This is officially the White House cutting off the intelligence community,&rdquo; an anonymous senior intelligence official told the Los Angeles Times.</p> <p>Quotes like that and others raise the prospect of the first major split between the White House and the NSA since Snowden&rsquo;s revelations began. NSA veterans have bridled in the past at what they consider Obama&rsquo;s tepid support, but both sides earlier showed support for each other.</p> <p>The White House has yet to signal support or opposition for the Leahy and Sensenbrenner bills. On the eve of their introduction, congressional aides were unsure how strongly the White House will intervene in the unfolding legislative drama over surveillance reform.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421206004|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|1e631c4e6768cd8625206a42a423149e6b76d366 -->",

        "headline":"NSA spying on Europe reflects the transatlantic culture gap",
        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/27/barack-obama-nsa-angela-merkel-germany\" title=\"\">latest wave of spying scandals</a> should prompt close scrutiny of the often bizarre mechanisms that shape the transatlantic relationship. There are of course numerous European transatlantic apologists. For them, any hint of holding the US accountable as a responsible global power goes out the window. Such lofty talk is reserved for China.</p><p>And then there is a group of largely American analysts, diplomats and journalists who make a point of challenging the Europeans on any point of principle. Their mantra goes: everyone spies on everyone – what else did you expect? They regard Europeans collectively as naive, not cut out for the tough world that's out there.</p><p>What gets lost in all this is the root cause of the current scandals. It is decidedly not that Europeans live on Venus. It is the catastrophic lack of effective checks and balances in the US.</p><p>In one sense the spying revelations show that other nations have little to complain about. They are, after all, not being treated any worse by US authorities than American citizens themselves.</p><p>What the European unease, at both the popular and senior political levels, highlights, however, is the big difference between the US and Europe. Europeans still operate under the assumption that it is critical to uphold the rule of law. The US government is more than flexible with the rule of law by turning any notion of privacy into Swiss cheese. The dangerous implications this holds for the core ideas of democracy are obvious.</p><p>But it isn't just that the US government has undermined the rule of law at home. It is that American citizens themselves, to a stunningly large extent, have bought into the notion that the \"war on terror\" and \"Islamic extremism\" justify all means. Their acquiescence, if not active tolerance, is what allows Washington to operate above the law, from drones to routinely spying on the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Spanish people, to name but a few of the targets.</p><p>Being too flexible with the law imposes real costs. These begin with the hollowing out of basic democratic control mechanisms. When President Obama recently told the American people – amidst revelations about the existence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/prism\" title=\"\">the Prism programme</a> – that no American citizens' phone calls were being listened in on, it is hard to imagine that he did not know the truth. If he did, he lied. And if he didn't, he is clearly out of his depth and/or not in control of his administration.</p><p>Either way, such highly misleading statements by an American president are the stuff that impeachments proceedings were made for – not dalliances with interns of the Bill Clinton kind. Of course, Democrats would never dare to even mention this – and Republicans are too into spying to make a case of it.</p><p>What are law-abiding European citizens to make of all this? As allies, there is little we Europeans can do to make the Americans reconsider. If they don't believe in the rule of law for themselves, even in extenuating circumstances like dealing with a very broadly defined terrorist threat, then there is little we can achieve with Washington – other than keeping our distance.</p><p>There is one powerful weapon available, though and it's called treble damages. Before the current US supreme court turned law into a corporate handmaiden, there was a time in the last quarter of the 20th century when the United States was actually tough on itself. Specifically, American corporations that were caught in grave acts of failure really had reason to worry.</p><p>If and when a large corporation committed a major no-no, it could be sued for treble damages. The point was that, in applying a tough penalty on one company, a whole industry could be made to clean up its act – in order to avoid being exposed to similar penalties later.</p><p>The fact that US social media companies are effectively making common cause with the American government, in systematically hollowing out any rights of privacy of European citizens, provides us with a potent tool.</p><p>Americans, in the end, only take notice of things when it hits their pocket book. If and when we make European privacy regulations binding for US firms operating on our territory, and impose serious penalties (similar to treble damages) in cases of violation, only then will we have a chance of defending our European rights.</p><p>And if we do that, then today's stunningly cowed American citizens may also wake up and ask that not all rights of privacy get conveniently shredded in a treacherous double alliance of the US government and social media companies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421272985|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|e85be7687b9c803652825ab337adb82b2670ed92 -->",

        "headline":"Embattled NSA chief Keith Alexander rejects calls to limit agency's power",
        "body":"<p>The director of the National Security Agency forcefully and emotionally rejected calls to curtail his agency’s power on Tuesday, as legislation to reform the US security services was introduced in Congress against the backdrop of a growing diplomatic crisis.</p> <p>General Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, speaking “from the heart” before a Tuesday hearing of the House intelligence committee, said the NSA would prefer to “take the beatings” from the public and in the media “than to give up a program that would result in this nation being attacked.”</p> <p>Alexander spoke hours after bills came before the House and Senate judiciary committees that would end the NSA’s bulk collection of Americans’ phone records, sponsored by Congressman James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, and Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat.</p> <p>The program, performed under authorities claimed under the Patriot Act – which Sensenbrenner helped draft in 2001– was first revealed in June by the Guardian from material leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p> <p>Alexander said that in the past year the NSA collected “billions” of records from Americans under the program, but, as in past testimony, said it was only searched by a handful of NSA officials possessing “reasonable articulable suspicion” of connection to a specified terrorist group, and searched fewer than 300 times over the past year.</p> <p>Alexander, accompanied by the embattled director of national intelligence James Clapper and other NSA and Justice Department officials, argued that a continued threat of terrorism justified retaining the NSA’s post-9/11 powers. He and his colleagues have contended that since 9/11, they have prevented 54 terrorist plots, although under congressional pressure, they have not argued that the domestic phone records collection has been a leading factor in the thwarted plots.</p> <p>Addressing an international row over NSA spying on the US European allies over the past week, Alexander forcefully argued that reports of the agency collecting millions of phone calls were “absolutely false”. He said: “Those screenshots that show or at least lead people to believe that we, NSA, or the US, collected that information is false – and it is false that it was collected on European citizens. It was neither.”</p> <p>Alexander and Clapper focused mainly on a defense of their existing powers, although the hearing was called to solicit their perspectives on surveillance reforms.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ac1abf48-5945-4808-9956-e8bf65552413\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/29/1383080608997/8709546b-1f65-4946-bccb-3bc1ccf0000b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A member of Code Pink protests as NSA director Keith Alexander, centre, prepares to take a break from a House intelligence committee hearing.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A member of Code Pink protests as NSA director Keith Alexander, centre, prepares to take a break from a House intelligence committee hearing. Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>The pair testified they were open to greater transparency around their surveillance efforts. In a prepared joint statement, they proposed one major concession: saying their were “open to discussing” the creation of a public advocate who would appear before the foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court – a reiteration of an earlier stance, and one that several reform-minded legislators have already embraced.</p> <p>Clapper, who is under political fire after apologizing to the Senate for misleading it on domestic surveillance, invoked the specter of Vietnam-era abuses – a sign of how seriously the intelligence community sees its current political predicament – to say “the intelligence community today is not like that.”</p> <p>Clapper explicitly warned the panel to be mindful of the “risks of overcorrection” in surveillance reform – suggesting, as Alexander did, that proposed restrictions on bulk surveillance would leave the country in danger of a terrorist attack.</p> <p>That perspective has strong advocates on the House committee, which has proposed alternatives to the Leahy and Sensenbrenner bills. Chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, proposed increasing the public’s visibility into the NSA’s activities without substantially curtailing them.</p> <p>Rogers’s Democratic counterpart, Charles “Dutch” Ruppersberger of Maryland, said he favored a “meaningful process of reform that will enhance transparency and privacy, while maintaining the necessary capabilities to protect this nation.” He added: “We don’t want to make it easier to be a terrorist than a criminal in this country.”</p> <p>A complementary bill, supported by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, was marked up in the Senate intelligence committee, the first stage in a bill becoming law. A day earlier, Feinstein, a staunch NSA ally, rebuked the agency over spying on foreign leaders.</p> <p>But there is an increasing sense in Washington that Congress, and perhaps the White House, will impose some form of limitation on the NSA’s authorities – a rarity since 9/11. Even Ruppersberger, another staunch NSA ally, signaled he was open to transforming the collection of Americans’ call data.</p> <p>“Can we move away from bulk collection and toward a system like the one used in the criminal prosecution system, in which the government subpoenas individual call data records – phone numbers, no content – to be used for link analysis?” Ruppersberger asked.</p> <p>John Inglis, Alexander’s deputy at NSA, did not commit to moving away from domestic bulk collection, but said “numerous technical architectures” are “viable,” provided they have privacy procedures; the records are comprehensive; they can be stored for three to five years; and can provide “agility” to time-pressured intelligence analysts.</p> <p>The testimony of Alexander and Clapper came against another backdrop: an increasing acrimony, playing out through anonymous sources in the press, between the White House and the NSA.</p> <p>Ever since German chancellor Angela Merkel confronted President Obama over allegations that NSA spied on her phone, a struggle has broken out between Fort Meade and the White House over responsibility for a growing diplomatic controversy – particularly over how aware Obama was of the spying on his foreign counterparts.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7cffb188-cc16-480c-9421-24953f4ee160\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/28/1382994667763/Angela-Merkel-014.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Angela Merkel Photograph: Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media</figcaption> </figure> <p>That struggle came on the eve of the surveillance reform debate in Congress, raising questions about how strongly the White House will fight the reform efforts.</p> <p>Dancing around the central question of how much Obama knew about NSA spying on foreign leaders, Clapper testified that the intelligence agencies “do only what the policymakers, writ large, have actually asked us to do.” But he added that the “level of detail” about how those requirements are implemented rarely rises to the attention of presidents.</p> <p>Two Democratic representatives, Representative Adam Schiff of California and Jan Schakowski of Illinois, suggested that the House intelligence committee was not informed about the eavesdropping on foreign leaders. Clapper, without confirming that the spying took place, said that “we have by and large complied with the spirit and intent of the law”.</p> <p>Schiff drew a heated and unexpected rebuke from Rogers, who called his suggestion “disingenuous.” The committee has access to “mounds of product” from the NSA, Rogers said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Schiff shot back a direct question about whether Rogers in fact knew about the foreign leader spying, which Rogers said he could not answer without confirming – but invited the committee member to view reams of intelligence in private.</p> <p>Stewart Baker, a former NSA attorney, said the divide appeared to be driven by “mainly ex-officials,” and reflected a surprise that the Obama administration would back away from spying on foreign leaders, a traditional NSA activity.</p> <p>“I think it’s mainly people who know the agency but are no longer constrained by obligations to the president. Mainly ex-officials,” Baker told the Guardian. “I think they are genuinely shocked at the idea that intelligence agencies are supposed to respect the privacy of some global community. That’s very post-national; and intelligence agencies are the last places you’d expect to find post-nationalists. Even after 50 years of the European Union, they’re all still spying on each other.”</p> <p>Baker, who also testified at the House hearing, said the NSA had “neither the tools nor the disposition to defy the White House,” and there was little peril of a narrative of dispute “unless the Guardian tries to keep one alive.”&nbsp;</p> <p>“The risk for the White House is the Republicans in Congress will decide that the president is selling the intelligence community out,” Baker said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421229749|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|8087a6230a140bc081682bc9772e81ce0f0903cf -->",

        "headline":"White House offers tentative support for plans to rein in NSA surveillance",
        "body":"<p>The White House indicated on Tuesday that it would support at least some of the congressional efforts to rein in the controversial surveillance practices of the National Security Agency, as political opinion in Washington hardened against the country’s embattled intelligence community.</p> <p>The administration revealed that an internal government review in the wake of revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden had already led to changes in US intelligence-gathering activities – thought to be a ban on eavesdropping on the leaders of friendly governments and a curb on surveillance at the United Nations.&nbsp;</p> <p>But wider checks on domestic surveillance practices also looked increasingly likely on Tuesday, as bipartisan legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives and Senate and party leaders united in calling for reform.</p> <p>Even as the White House acknowledged that legislative reform of the NSA was inevitable, senior intelligence officials mounted a uncompromising defence of their current programs. At a congressional hearing, General Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, forcefully and emotionally rejected calls to curtail his agency’s power. Alexander, who declared he was speaking “from the heart”, said the NSA would prefer to “take the beatings” from the public and in the media “than to give up a program that would result in this nation being attacked”.</p> <p>At the White House, chief spokesman Jay Carney welcomed the various reform efforts in principle but declined to discuss specific recommendations until the conclusion of a separate White House investigation.</p> <p>“In general the president is supportive of the idea that we need to make some reforms,” Carney said in response to questions about the new legislation. He said that it was important “to increase the confidence that the American people have in these programmes, and to perhaps provide greater oversight and greater transparency as well as more constraints on the authorities that exist”.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-55a6d1c6-e115-48cf-99e8-263f61db24db\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/29/1383080083413/5c18aa97-c58b-4fe6-8139-c072e2d45386-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"White House press secretary Jay Carney speaks at the daily press briefing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>White House press secretary Jay Carney speaks at the daily press briefing in the Brady press briefing room of the White House in Washington, where he took questions on reviewing intelligence gathering of foreign allies. Photograph: Charles Dharapak/AP</figcaption> </figure> <p>Carney also revealed that the White House review would concentrate on whether the US acted appropriately in relation to surveillance activities on its allies. The White House has been under intense pressure in recent days since reports emerged that the NSA had targeted the cellphone of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. “The concerns raised by our allies cause us concern too,” Carney said.</p> <p>The House speaker John Boehner and Senate majority leader Harry Reid also expressed support for reform on Tuesday. &quot;The NSA situation is one we need to look at,&quot; said Reid. &quot;I support the complete review of all of these programs.&quot;</p> <p>On Monday night, President Barack Obama said his administration was conducting a complete review of intelligence activities. Interviewed on television network Fusion, Obama said: &quot;What we've seen over the last several years is their capacities continue to develop and expand, and that's why I'm initiating now a review to make sure that what they're able to do doesn't necessarily mean what they should be doing.”</p> <p>Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, called for a &quot;total review of all intelligence programs&quot; following the Merkel allegations. In a statement on Monday, the California Democrat said the White House had informed her that &quot;collection on our allies will not continue&quot;. Carney would not elaborate on that statement on Tuesday.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3bd14622-f4f9-46f6-b9c2-7eb23a4f515b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/29/1383080144539/d8b58319-4544-4454-8edb-9823a43be2cb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"US senator Dianne Feinstein arrives for a markup of the Senate select committee on intelligence.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>US senator Dianne Feinstein arrives for a markup of the Senate select committee on intelligence on Tuesday. Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>The near unanimity among political leaders left intelligence leaders striking an increasingly lonely defence of the practices at a hearing on Capitol Hill.</p> <p>At a hearing of the House intelligence committee, Alexander argued that a continued threat of terrorism justified retaining the agency’s post-9/11 powers. At the same hearing, the director of national intelligence James Clapper warned the panel to be mindful of the “risks of overcorrection” in surveillance reform – suggesting that proposed restrictions on bulk surveillance would leave the country in danger of a terrorist attack.</p> <p>Addressing the growing international row over NSA spying, Alexander forcefully argued that reports of the agency collecting millions of Europeans’ phone calls were “absolutely false”.</p> <p>But Clapper danced around the central question of how much Obama knew about NSA’s separate surveillance activities on foreign leaders. He said that the intelligence agencies “do only what the policymakers, writ large, have actually asked us to do”. He added that the “level of detail” about how those requirements are implemented rarely rose to the attention of presidents.</p> <p>Two Democratic representatives, Adam Schiff of California and Jan Schakowski of Illinois, suggested that the House intelligence committee was not informed about the foreign leader spying. Clapper, without confirming that the spying took place, said that “we have by and large complied with the spirit and intent of the law”.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b2d42d62-e8be-4031-93af-477641dc8b9f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/29/1383080299991/085ae522-d442-413d-9444-e434143dc822-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A protester against the practices of US security agenices sits in the audience as intelligence officials testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A protester against the practices of US security agenices sits in the audience as intelligence officials testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill. Photograph: JASON REED/REUTERS</figcaption> </figure> <p>Schiff drew a heated and unexpected rebuke from the committee chairman, Republican Mike Rogers, who called his suggestion “disingenuous”. The committee has access to “mounds of product” from the NSA, Rogers said. Schiff shot back a direct question about whether Rogers in fact knew about the foreign leader spying, which Rogers said he could not answer without confirming – but invited the committee member to view reams of intelligence in private.</p> <p>There is an increasing sense in Washington that Congress, and perhaps the White House, will impose some form limitation on the NSA’s authorities – a rarity since 9/11. Even Charles &quot;Dutch&quot; Ruppersberger, another staunch NSA ally, signalled he was open to transforming the collection of Americans’ call data.</p> <p>“Can we move away from bulk collection and toward a system like the one used in the criminal prosecution system, in which the government subpoenas individual call data records,” Ruppersberger told the House committee hearing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421232807|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|4dffa6ca9b23cc45e62e78f035bc6bb22557623c -->",
