The White House has been saying for weeks that &quot;everything's on the table&quot; in budget negotiations. Now the two sides have to figure out what's really on the table.</p> <p>The respective leaders of the budget negotiations, Rep. Paul Ryan for the Republicans and Sen. Patty Murray for the Democrats, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/390833992875769856\">had breakfast</a> this morning.

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to their stations. But the solution is temporary: the next shutdown deadline is 15 January 2014, three months away.</p> <p>The icebreaker legislation moved the debt ceiling until 7 February, pushing the risk of a Treasury default into March or beyond.</p> <p>The bill attracted 87 Republican votes in the House, on top of the entire Democratic caucus. It passed the Senate 81-18.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We’ve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis,&quot; President Obama said in a statement before signing the legislation. He called on members of a bipartisan budget conference created by the bill to strike a longer-term budget accord. Their deadline is 13 December. &quot;Hopefully next time it won't be in the 11th hour,&quot; the president said.</p> <p>The conclusion saw near-total capitulation by Republicans, who demonstrated, <a href=\"http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/a-teachable-moment/?_r=0\">in the opinion of </a>conservative columnist Ross Douthat, that they &quot;shouldn’t be trusted with the management of a banana stand,&nbsp;let alone the House of Representatives&quot;.</p> <p>But the beauty of the news is that you can choose your own headline:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/raju/statuses/390807459738447873\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Interesting A1 headlines <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WSJ\">@WSJ</a>: Congress Passes a Debt Bill <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytimes\">@nytimes</a>: Republicans Back Down, Ending Budget Crisis <a href=\"http://t.co/ANW9s2m98n\">pic.twitter.com/ANW9s2m98n</a></p>— Raju Narisetti (@raju) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raju/statuses/390807459738447873\">October 17, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T14:46:38.457+01:00\">at 9.46am ET</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420257734|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|a6d2e56f44b299f6d5d7764bc63a473e6c31d7de -->",

        "headline":"Extent of spy agencies' surveillance to be investigated by parliamentary body",
        "body":"<p>The extent and scale of mass surveillance undertaken by Britain's spy agencies is to be scrutinised in a major inquiry to be formally launched on Thursday.</p><p>Parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC), the body tasked with overseeing the work of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6, will say the investigation is a response to concern raised by the leaks from the whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the committee chair, said \"an informed and proper debate was needed\". One Whitehall source described the investigation as \"a public inquiry in all but name\".</p><p>The announcement comes four months after the Guardian, and leading media groups in other countries, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, began disclosing details of secret surveillance programmes run by Britain's eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency.</p><p>The Guardian has been urging a debate about programmes such as GCHQ's Tempora and the NSA's Prism, which allow the agencies to harvest vast amounts of personal data from millions of people – intelligence that is routinely shared between the two countries.</p><p>In a change from its usual protocol, the normally secretive committee also announced that part of its inquiry would be held in public.</p><p>It will also take written evidence from interested groups and the public, as well as assessing secret material supplied by the intelligence agencies. The Guardian will also consider submitting evidence.</p><p>Conceding that public concerns had to be addressed, Rifkind, a former foreign secretary, added: \"There is a balance to be found between our individual right to privacy and our collective right to security.\"</p><p>The ISC, which has been criticised for being too close to the agencies, has been under pressure to provide more robust scrutiny of the intelligence community. In recent weeks Lord King, a former chair of the committee, Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, and Stella Rimington, a former head of MI5, have all raised concerns about the laws governing the secret services and the amount of scrutiny they are subjected too.</p><p>Formally, the committee has decided to broaden an existing inquiry into whether the intelligence laws are \"fit for purpose\".</p><p>Rifkind said: \"In recent months concern has been expressed at the suggested extent of the capabilities available to the intelligence agencies and the impact upon people's privacy as the agencies seek to find the needles in the haystacks that might be crucial to safeguarding national security.\"</p><p>Nick Clegg, who had been asking for the oversight regime to be looked at afresh,  quickly welcomed the committee's move. A source close to the Liberal Democrat leader said on Wednesday night: \"We very much welcome the ISC's decision to broaden the scope of their investigation.</p><p>\"The deputy prime minister has been an outspoken advocate of the need for us to have a proper debate about these complicated and important issues. He very much backs other voices getting involved in that debate and looks forward to the ISC doing some of it in public.\"</p><p>The admission that legitimate issues have been raised by the Guardian investigation also undercuts those on the Conservative benches demanding that the primary response to the Guardian disclosures should be prosecution of the newspaper for breaking the Official Secrets Act. Those demands surfaced again in parliament on Wednesday.</p><p>At prime minister's questions David Cameron criticised the Guardian and urged select committees to hold inquiries, following a question from the former defence secretary Liam Fox asking whether it was double standards to prosecute newspapers that hacked the phones of celebrities, but not those papers that released information that endangered national security.</p><p>Responding, Cameron said: \"The plain fact is that what has happened has damaged national security and in many ways the Guardian themselves admitted that when they agreed, when asked politely by my national security adviser and cabinet secretary, to destroy the files they had, they went ahead and destroyed those files.\"</p><p>He added: \"So they know that what they're dealing with is dangerous for national security. I think it's up to select committees in this house if they want to examine this issue and make further recommendations.\"</p><p>But a spokesperson for the Guardian said: \"The prime minister is wrong to say the Guardian destroyed computer files because we agreed our reporting was damaging.</p><p>\"We destroyed the computers because the government said it would use the full force of the law to prevent a newspaper from publishing anything about the NSA or GCHQ.</p><p>\"That is called 'prior restraint' and it is unthinkable in the US, where the New York Times and Washington Post have been widely applauded – along with the Guardian – for reporting on the Snowden files. That reporting has so far led to a presidential review and three proposed bills before Congress.\"</p><p>Shortly after Cameron's intervention, it emerged that the Commons home affairs select committee would mount an investigation into the issues raised by the Guardian disclosures. It will also look into whether the paper has endangered national security and potentially broken the law, as part of a wider current investigation into counterterrorism. Rifkind said the ISC would be seeking contributions from outside the agencies \"to ensure that the committee can consider the full range of opinions expressed on these topics. Once it has considered those written submissions it will also hold oral evidence sessions, some of which it expects to hold in public.\"</p><p>Julian Smith, the Tory MP for Skipton who has written to the Metropolitan police calling for the newspaper to be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act and the Terrorism Act 2000, has been granted a debate in parliament next week in which \"he will lay out the reasons why I believe that the Guardian has crossed the line between responsible journalism and seriously risking our national security and the lives of those who seek to protect us\".</p><p>Elsewhere, privacy campaigners gave a cautious welcome to the intelligence committee's inquiry and said they would be prepared to submit evidence. But they all raised fears the ISC was still too sympathetic to the agencies and lacked the necessary clout to stand up to them.</p><p>Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: \"This is a welcome step forward given the widespread concern that Britain's laws are not fit for purpose. However, such a debate cannot be allowed to take place behind closed doors and without pressing questions being asked about the legal justification for what we know to be happening presently at GCHQ and elsewhere.\"</p><p>Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: \"Some will say better late than never, others fear a tactical whitewash to calm public concern. It's certainly significant that the committee feels compelled to dig a little deeper but that's no substitute for much broader public and political debate.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420185802|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|c7bfefaba9bb5e9c7fe5f7ef6e029eac58c727c0 -->",

Whoever realises this first will benefit.</p><p>\"Whoever does not realise it will find himself overboard, outside the political process.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420238083|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|396f502b7a8c44e999300ccb5462634c8c9735ac -->",

        "headline":"Cory Booker: the media-savvy mayor marching on Washington",
        "body":"<p>In the seven years that he has been mayor of Newark, New Jersey, Cory Booker, 44, has broken the mould of small-city politics and developed a new style of direct politicking through social media. In the process, he has acquired a nationwide following and reputation and gathered more than 1.4 million Twitter followers &ndash; five times as many people as live in Newark.</p> <p>With such a track record, it is not surprising that Booker won the special election replace <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/03/frank-lautenberg-new-jersey-senator-dies\">the late Frank Lautenberg in the Senate,</a> becoming the first black senator from New Jersey after winning by 56% to 43%.</p> <p>The deccisive result s partly a reflection of how Booker has used his charismatic personality and media savvy to build extensive name-recognition in his state and throughout the country, and then to convert that renown to his electoral advantage. Over the course of the short special election campaign, which began shortly after Lautenberg&rsquo;s death in June,&nbsp;he raised more than $11m, and thus far he has outspent Lonegan by a whopping ratio of eight to one. And tellingly, more than half of his funds came from out-of-state donors.&nbsp;</p> <p>The special election ends at an odd time &ndash; a Wednesday in October &ndash; because, it is widely assumed, the state&rsquo;s governor, Republican Chris Christie, didn&rsquo;t want Booker&rsquo;s name on the ballot to bring Democratic voters out for the general election in November, when Christie is up for re-election.&nbsp;</p> <p>Booker recruited his celebrity friends to fundraise and stump for him, headlined by Oprah Winfrey and Facebook&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg, with solid backup from Hollywood figures such as Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Steven Spielberg, billionaires Ron Burkle and Michael Bloomberg, and a slew of New York tycoons and hedge fund managers.</p> <p>In addition to the huge head-start he has had in cash and media reach, Booker also gained an advantage when he drew Lonegan as his opponent. Lonegan is a little known right-wing Republican who disapproves of gay marriage and abortion, backs the government shutdown and has strong Tea Party leanings &ndash; not a natural draw in the socially progressive state of New Jersey. Still, despite all these favourable conditions, Booker&rsquo;s march to Washington has not been as smooth as it was supposed to be.</p> <p>&ldquo;The reason that the race has been <a href=\"http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/1992fc4b-5224-4d5b-a1e9-e0c5691158b5.pdf\">much closer than most people expected</a> it to be is that attacks on Cory Booker over his character and record as mayor have taken hold,&rdquo; said Patrick Murray, head of the polling institute at Monmouth university.</p> <p>&ldquo;Holes were found in his personal story, and questions raised about whether his national ambitions were more important to him than public service.&rdquo;</p> <p>Lonegan pressed relentlessly at these perceived weaknesses, calling him a &ldquo;show pony&rdquo; and firing off the soundbite: &ldquo;We need a leader, not a tweeter&rdquo;. He also ran with speculation that Booker might have exaggerated some of the details of his relationship with Newark residents, including an anecdote the mayor has related on several occasions about a man dying in his arms, and accounts of how he personally helped homeless people in the streets.</p> <p>But the most substantive issue was an attack launched by the Republicans on Booker's record as mayor of Newark. Booker came to the office partly on a campaign pledge to reduce crime, and for a while he succeeded. But in recent months the rate has been creeping up again.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/10/cory_bookers_legacy_in_newark_under_spotlight_as_he_looks_to_senate.html\">Statistics gathered by the New Jersey Star-Ledger</a>&nbsp;show that there were 83 homicides in 2003 under the previous mayor, compared with 95 homicides last year. The number of violent crimes has also edged up from 2,848 to 3,220 over the same time period, though the city&rsquo;s population has remained relatively steady.</p> <p>Booker now has a year to put some of these doubts behind him before he has to face New Jersey voters in November 2014, when Lautenberg&rsquo;s term runs out and he will have to run again, in order to secure a full six years of his own. That might mean having to pull back on habits that have defined him so far: his tendency to seek the spotlight; his outreach to every individual voter with a gripe or a burning house; even his use of social media.</p> <p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s going to have to learn to be a little more circumspect with social media in the Senate,&rdquo; Murray said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so much because of the missteps he made in this election &ndash; it&rsquo;s more that if he continues to try and grab the limelight he&rsquo;s going to find there are 99 other senators who think they are in the line in front of him.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420191236|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|7262ac3c8c48b37d46091e5de114aa2f749e94a8 -->",

        "body":"<p>A prosecutor in Missouri who's faced intense criticism over his handling of a case involving a 14-year-old girl who says she was raped by a 17-year-old acquaintance will ask a special prosecutor to decide if new charges should be filed.</p> <p>Melinda Coleman, the mother of 14-year-old Daisy Coleman, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/15/maryville-missouri-rape-anonymous-investigation\">claims justice was denied</a> when Nodaway County prosecutor Robert Rice dropped felony charges in March 2012, two months after she says her daughter was plied with alcohol, raped, then dumped on the family's front porch in sub-freezing temperatures.</p> <p>Rice insists the investigation collapsed after the Colemans became uncooperative with investigators. Melinda Coleman says she and her daughter did co-operate and that investigators didn't do enough to push the case forward.</p> <p>Coleman says her family was forced to leave the small north-west Missouri town of Maryville after they were harassed over the allegations.</p> <p>Rice on Wednesday stood by his earlier statements, saying he's only asking for a special prosecutor because of recent media stories that questioned the integrity of the county's justice system.</p> <p>The incident happened in January 2012, after Daisy and a 13-year-old friend left the Colemans' house in the middle of the night to meet some boys.</p> <p>Daisy said the boys gave her alcohol and she doesn't remember much of what happened next. Another 17-year-old allegedly videotaped the incident involving Daisy on a cellphone. Daisy's 13-year-old friend also said she was forced to have sex with a 15-year-old. The boys said the sex was consensual.</p> <p>The 15-year-old was charged in the juvenile system. Charges against the 17-year-old accused of recording the incident were also dropped in March 2012.</p> <p>The Associated Press does not generally name victims of sexual assault but is naming Daisy Coleman because she and her mother have been granting public interviews about the case. The AP is not naming the boys because there are no active charges against them.</p> <p>Melinda Coleman did not return phone calls seeking comment after Rice's announcement. But in an interview with the AP earlier Wednesday, Coleman insisted she would help investigators in any way she could, even if the case never made it to trial.</p> <p>\"I think just having it looked at fairly and having other people know how much we were bullied goes a long way. Even if that's all that ever comes out of it,\" she said. \"That may be enough to move on and have some peace and some security.\"</p> <p>Coleman said her daughter made some mistakes, but that she was still the victim.</p> <p>\"She shouldn't have snuck out of the house. She shouldn't have drank. But I think a lot of 14-year-olds do that, and I'm sick of people saying she deserves this,\" Coleman said</p> <p>Robert Sundell, who earlier represented the teen accused of assaulting Daisy, was out of the office Wednesday and didn't return phone messages. In a statement Tuesday, Sundell said his former client cooperated with the investigation and freely admitted to the sexual encounter. He said that while many may find his former client's behavior \"reprehensible,\" the legal issue was whether a crime was committed.</p> <p>The case has drawn comparisons to one in Steubenville, Ohio, where two 17-year-old high school football players were convicted of raping a West Virginia girl after an alcohol-fueled party in 2012. The case was furiously debated online and led to allegations of a cover-up to protect the city's celebrated football team.</p> <p>Officials in Maryville say they've had to increase police patrols because of threats made against residents and the city in general.</p> <p>However, Coleman said the harassment her family faced was from just a few residents, mainly friends and family members of the boys accused, and that she otherwise liked Maryville.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420256434|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|dca16acb1d5439ff738d71baffc82266c9e1c982 -->",

        "body":"<p>Power plants across the US and Canada could overheat, shut down or be caused to malfunction because of&nbsp;vulnerabilities that leave them open to hacking, <a href=\"http://www.automatak.com/robus/\">according to new research</a>.</p> <p>If exploited, the vulnerabilities could be used to crash or potentially hijack the servers controlling electronic substations, water utilities and power plants.</p> <p>Adam Crain, Chris Sistrunk and Adam Todorski, who are working with industrial consultants Automatak, found 25 zero-day vulnerabilities &ndash; flaws&nbsp;which have never before been seen in the wild &ndash; in the protocol by which power plants and other parts of the electricity grid communicate internally.</p> <p>Such protocols are rarely examined by security researchers because they are isolated from the internet, the usual source of hacking attacks.</p> <p>In addition, the specificity of the protocols, known as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, means that the are thought to have a sort of security through obscurity: if few know how they work, then it is hoped no one will have the knowledge to exploit them.</p> <p>Crain warns this is a false comfort. &ldquo;If someone tries to breach the control center through the internet, they have to bypass layers of firewalls,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/10/ics/\">he told Wired&rsquo;s Kim Zetter. &ldquo;But someone could go o</a>ut to a remote substation that has very little physical security and get on the network and take out hundreds of substations potentially. And they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to get into the substation either.&rdquo;</p> <p>Project Robus, the name for the team&rsquo;s ongoing search for vulnerabilities, has so far reported nine of the potential exploits to the vendor who designed each one, as well as <a href=\"https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov\">the US Department of Homeland Security</a>.</p> <p>Most of the vulnerabilities allow potential attackers to send controlling servers into infinite loops, rendering them unable to respond to commands from controllers. That isn&rsquo;t the same as rendering them unable to control the utilities, but it could mean that the operators in charge of sections of the power grid are blind to conditions on the ground.</p> <p>The worst of the vulnerabilities exposed so far enables a potential buffer-overflow attack, whereby code stored for one purpose &ldquo;overflows&rdquo; its container, and can end up being executed when it shouldn&rsquo;t be. At its most serious, this allows for code to be injected into servers, which could allow attackers to take over the whole system.</p> <p><strong>&bull; This is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/18/smart-meters-uk-hacking-electricity\">cyber equivalent of a nuclear strike</a> &ndash;&nbsp;and yet our electricity grid is more vulnerable than ever&nbsp;</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420236828|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|51ad8a59052d8ad08ad6fae5fa135af95592e853 -->",

Thank you for your comments. Here's a roundup of how things stand:</p> <p>• <strong>Almost 1,500 firefighters are battling scores of bushfires across New South Wales in what has been described as the most serious fire risk to hit the state in more than a decade.</strong> Hundreds of homes are feared to have been destroyed.&nbsp;Many firefighters - particularly in the Winmalee area - were told that their homes were destroyed while they were out fighting fires.&nbsp;At least two firefighters were injured, with one man sent to Sydney's Concord Hospital with burns to his face.</p> <p>• <strong>The NSW premier, Barry O'Farrell, said it would be a miracle if there was no loss of life.</strong> He said were facing treacherous conditions and that it would be days before all the fires could be extinguished.&nbsp;&quot;This is as bad as it gets,&quot; he said.</p> <p>• <strong>There were around 100 fires blazing at midnight on Thursday, with more than 30 described as &quot;out of control&quot;| and four designated as emergencies.</strong> One of the emergencies was in the Blue Mountains area that began in Lithgow ran more than 25km and had burned 20,000 hectares of bushland.</p> <p>• <strong>Evacuation centres were set up across the state.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;In the Blue Mountains students from&nbsp;St Columba's school were kept in the building but St Thomas Aquinas School was evacuated.&nbsp;About 600 children from several schools were bussed to the Springwood Sports Club on Thursday evening. At its peak, 28,000 homes supplied by Endeavour Energy in the Blue Mountains and Southern Highlands regions were without electricity.&nbsp;The fires created traffic chaos around Sydney, with a 20km queue on the Hume Highway for city-bound traffic.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T14:46:03.046+01:00\">at 12.46am AEST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-525fde8fe4b0bbc67cfff412\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T13:58:14.812+01:00\">11.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The fire that started in Lithgow area&nbsp;and is heading in the direction&nbsp;of Bilpin and Mountain Lagoon&nbsp;in the Blue Mountains has now burnt more than 20,000 hectares of bushland, the fire service says.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21488&amp;CAT_ID=684\">An emergency warning remains in place for the blaze.</a></p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NSWRFS/statuses/390816359611133952\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>View of the Blue Mountains from Glenmore Park earlier this afternoon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NSWRFS&amp;src=hash\">#NSWRFS</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nswfires&amp;src=hash\">#nswfires</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/Mg4m3oa5bg\">http://t.co/Mg4m3oa5bg</a></p>— NSW RFS (@NSWRFS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSWRFS/statuses/390816359611133952\">October 17, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525fd6a5e4b0bbc67cfff40c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T13:26:23.191+01:00\">11.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Having been downgraded to a &quot;watch and act&quot; the Hank Street fire, in Heatherbrae, has been upgraded back up to an emergency.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21494&amp;CAT_ID=684\">The NSW rural fire service said:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Hank Street Fire has been burning under difficult weather conditions and has burnt around 3,500 hectares of bush land.

Hot and gusty winds are worsening conditions and residents have been warned to take care of flying embers and advised to put out spot fires on their properties.</p> <p>Roads, highways and at least one school have been closed.</p> <p><strong>A <a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21494&amp;CAT_ID=684\">fire near Heatherbrae</a></strong> in the Hunter region has breached containment lines, fueled by gusts of up to 7-80kmh. Thick smoke is visible from Newcastle CBD and the city’s airport has been closed.</p> <p>The hot dry and windy weather is expected to continue for another five or six hours at least, rural fire service (RFS) spokesman Joel Kursawe told ABC News.</p> <p>The RFS advises residents near the Heatherbrae fire to evacuate now if they are planning to leave or are not prepared, but only if the way is clear.</p> <p>The same advice has been issued to residents of <strong>Yanderra in the Southern Highlands</strong> where a fire is burning near the village and neighbouring Balmoral. Yanderra residents have been sent an emergency telephone message.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21493&amp;CAT_ID=684\">watch and act advisory</a> has also been issued over <strong>a fire east of Singleton</strong>, also in the Hunter region.</p> <p><strong>Near Wiseman’s Ferry in the Hawkesbury region</strong>, more than 30 firefighters and two aircraft are <a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21474&amp;CAT_ID=684\">battling a fire</a> which has only been partially contained.</p> <p>The bureau of meteorology (BOM) <a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/warnings/severe.shtml\">earlier issued severe wind and weather warnings</a> for the Hunter, Sydney, Illawarra, Central Tablelands, Southern Tablelands, ACT and Snowy Mountains regions.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420208459|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|0a4796d8b059361b66dd562e02a5f4eb0fa38db7 -->",

        "body":"<p>A typhoon has killed 17 people in Japan, but largely spared the capital and brushed by the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power station.</p><p>More than 50 people were missing after  typhoon Wipha roared up Japan's east coast, including two schoolboys engulfed by waves on a beach; 20 more were hurt by falls or being struck by flying debris. About 20,000 people were told to leave their homes because of the danger of flooding and hundreds of flights were cancelled.</p><p>Sixteen people were killed on Izu Oshima island, about 75 miles (120km) south of Tokyo, as rivers burst their banks. The storm set off mudslides along a mile-long stretch of mountains.</p><p>Wipha sustained winds of 78mph (126km/h) with gusts up to 180km/h.</p><p>Television footage showed roads clogged with wreckage and houses with gaping holes smashed into them.</p><p>\"I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,\" a woman on Izu Oshima told NHK television.</p><p>The storm brought hurricane-force winds and torrential rain to the Tokyo metropolitan area of 30 million people at the peak of the morning rush-hour.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The operator of the Fukushima nuclear plant, Tokyo Electric Power Corp, cancelled all offshore work and secured machinery as the storm approached.</p><p>The operator, known as Tepco, has been struggling to contain radioactive leaks since a 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused extensive damage and triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.</p><p>A Tepco spokesman said Typhoon Wipha had caused no new problems at the plant, which is on the coast 130 miles (220km) north of Tokyo.</p><p>The storm dumped heavy rain that had to be pumped out of protective containers at the base of about 1,000 tanks storing radioactive water, the byproduct of a jerry-rigged cooling system designed to control wrecked reactors.</p><p>The rainwater was checked for radioactivity and released into the sea, the company spokesman said.</p><p>Wipha has  been down-graded to a tropical depression.</p><p></p><p>During the height of the storm, more than 500 flights at Tokyo's Haneda and Narita airports were cancelled, and thousands of schools closed.Typhoon Wipha was the strongest storm to hit the region since October 2004. That cyclone triggered floods and landslides that killed almost 100 people, forced thousands from their homes and caused billions of dollars in damage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420096438|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|390dd9401166d6aa893ca7ae981cb60746b3a5e2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, has revealed more details of the media organization he is creating with journalist Glenn Greenwald.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/15/glenn-greenwald-announces-departure-guardian\">Greenwald announced on Tuesday that he was leaving the Guardian</a>, where he has broken a series of stories on the National Security Agency, based on documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p> <p>In an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pressthink.org/2013/10/why-pierre-omidyar-decided-to-join-forces-with-glenn-greenwald-for-a-new-venture-in-news/\">interview with Jay Rosen</a>, media critic and NYU professor of journalism, Omidyar said he was committing an initial $250m to the as-yet-unnamed venture. Omidyar told Rosen the decision was fuelled by his &ldquo;rising concern about press freedoms in the United States and around the world&rdquo;.</p> <p>Omidyar said he hopes the project will promote &ldquo;independent journalists with expertise, and a voice and a following&rdquo; while using Silicon Valley knowhow to build an audience. &ldquo;Companies in Silicon Valley invest a lot in understanding their users and what drives user engagement,&rdquo; Omidyar said. The company will be online only and all proceeds will be reinvested in journalism.</p> <p>In a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://omidyargroup.com/pov/2013/10/16/my-next-adventure-in-journalism/#.Ul7elruHe_H\">blogpost,&nbsp;</a>the eBay billionaire revealed that he had been exploring a purchase of the Washington Post, which was ultimately bought by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.</p> <p>&ldquo;That process got me thinking about what kind of social impact could be created if a similar investment was made in something entirely new, built from the ground up. Something that I would be personally and directly involved in outside of my other efforts as a philanthropist,&rdquo; wrote Omidyar.</p> <p>&ldquo;I developed an interest in supporting independent journalists in a way that leverages their work to the greatest extent possible, all in support of the public interest. And, I want to find ways to convert mainstream readers into engaged citizens. I think there&rsquo;s more that can be done in this space, and I&rsquo;m eager to explore the possibilities,&rdquo; he wrote.</p> <p>Omidyar said he was in the &ldquo;very early stages of creating a new mass media organization. I don&rsquo;t yet know how or when it will be rolled out, or what it will look like.&rdquo; He said the organization would cover general news as well as investigative journalism.</p> <p>&ldquo;As part of my learning process, I recently reached out to Glenn Greenwald to find out what journalists like him need to do their jobs well. As it turns out, he and his colleagues Laura Poitras [video documentarian] and Jeremy Scahill [author and national security expert], were already on a path to create an online space to support independent journalists. We had a lot of overlap in terms of our ideas, and decided to join forces,&rdquo; wrote Omidyar.</p> <p>&ldquo;I have always been of the opinion that the right kind of journalism is a critical part of our democracy,&rdquo; he told Rosen.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420187659|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|a0547ae8056392a4b08b78427c94d065994d91d4 -->",

        "body":"<p>Iran signalled the possibility of significant concessions over its nuclear programme in talks that closed on Wednesday, bringing the prospect of a breakthrough closer than at any time in the last decade, according to western diplomats.</p><p>A senior US official said that for the first time the two sides were at the start of negotiations \"where one could imagine that you could possibly have an agreement\". The White House said the presentation Iran brought to Geneva was \"a new proposal with a level of seriousness and substance\" not seen before.</p><p>However, both western and Iranian officials cautioned that there was a huge amount of diplomatic work still to be done to hammer out a trade-off between western sanctions relief and Iranian acceptance of curbs on its uranium enrichment and other nuclear work. All sides agreed to reconvene on a senior level on 7 November, with lower-level expert discussions before that.</p><p>Those discussions will focus on Iranian indications in Geneva that Tehran could agree limits on its nuclear programme that ensure it can be used for peaceful purposes, and ultimately accept more stringent international monitoring. Iran has also requested that the US delegation bring financial experts to go into detail on how the economic straitjacket on Iran could be loosened.</p><p>Diplomats from a six-nation negotiating group who took part in the two days of talks in Geneva said they were unlike any that had gone before. One western official said the two-day meeting in Geneva marked the beginning of the first true negotiations between Iran and the west since the Iranian nuclear programme first came to light in 2002.</p><p>\"Before, the Iranians came to make speeches. This had a completely different tone and atmosphere,\" said a western official. \"Everything was on the table and we discussed everything in depth.\"</p><p>In an unprecedented joint statement, the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who chairs the six-nation group, and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, described the two days in Geneva as \"substantive and forward-looking negotiations\". It noted that Zarif had begun the meeting by presenting \"an outline of a plan as a proposed basis for negotiation, which is being carefully considered by the [six-nation group] as an important contribution.\"</p><p>Very few details of Zarif's PowerPoint presentation, entitled Closing an Unnecessary Crisis: Opening New Horizons, were released. However, Iranian and western diplomats made clear that the plan involved a timetable that included initial confidence-building steps at the start, implemented within the first six months, leading eventually to a comprehensive and permanent settlement, in which Iran could pursue a peaceful atomic programme without suffering punitive measures.</p><p>Iranian officials said they had put on the table a variety of possible limitations on Iran's enrichment of uranium in return for sanctions relief and international recognition of Iran's sovereign right to carry out enrichment, which is necessary to make both power reactor fuel and fissile material for weapons.</p><p>To reassure the international community that the Iranian programme was entirely peaceful, the Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said Tehran could contemplate acceptance of more intensive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The inspections regime, known as the additional protocol, allows inspectors to go to sites where they suspect there could be nuclear-related activity, and not just those declared by Iran.</p><p>However, both Araqchi and Zarif, in a press conference at the end of the negotiations, stressed that acceptance of the protocol could only come at the end of negotiations and was currently ruled out by Iran's parliament, the Majlis.</p><p>In return, western officials have signalled that a final settlement could include a form of words that acknowledges Iran's enrichment of uranium as an established fact, as long as it is limited to producing low-enriched uranium necessary for a peaceful power-generating programme.</p><p>\"I've been doing this now for about two years,\" a senior US official said, \"and I have never had such intense, detailed, straightforward, candid conversations with the Iranian delegation before.\"</p><p>The official added: \"Although there remain many differences in each area, and what sanctions relief might be appropriate, specific and candid discussions took place.\"</p><p>The two days of talks were completed despite severe back pains that came close to immobilising Zarif. He was accompanied by a doctor, underwent acupuncture during the talks and arrived at a concluding press conference in a wheelchair to be lifted bodily onstage. However, his health problems provided common ground with his western counterparts.</p><p>\"There is no one among us that doesn't have a back problem with all the flying we all do,\" the American official said. \"Every one of us had a back story for him, and had suggestions for books he should read, things he could try.\"</p><p>William Hague hailed the Geneva talks as the first substantive discussions with Iran \"on how to address the international community's serious concerns about Iran's nuclear programme\".</p><p>\"I hope that negotiations will lead soon to concrete results. Iran will need to take the necessary first steps on its programme and we are ready to take proportionate steps in return. It is important that we maintain the positive momentum of the negotiations but we should not forget that Iran's nuclear programme is continuing to develop. There is a great deal of hard work ahead, but we must not waste this opportunity.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420183250|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|7197dbf33384e72af2f87f73ac0e3197c6aaebb5 -->",

We just hope and pray that they conduct this in a sensible manner.\"</p><p>Harris said they had managed to speak to Alexandra on Friday night and that she was doing well given the \"fairly basic\" conditions of her captivity.</p><p>\"She's not complaining about how she's treated,\" he said. \"She's terrified – she's certainly not used to living in that sort of situation – but mentally she was holding it together quite well, which surprises us because she's a very sensitive girl.\"</p><p>Andy Bryan, father of Kieron Bryan, a freelance journalist hired by Greenpeace to document the demonstration, said he hoped the matter could be resolved before it reached court.</p><p>\"We have to hope that there will be some diplomatic or political solution before then,\" he said. \"That's got to be our main hope.\"</p><p>Bryan said he could never have foreseen the turns events had taken.</p><p>\"Kieron took a job thinking that he was doing his job as a film-maker and even though he might have understood there was a slight risk, he certainly couldn't possibly – and we certainly never – imagined anything of this gravity,\" he said.</p><p>Kieron's brother, Russell, said the family simply could not understand why he had been arrested.</p><p>\"He should be free to provide reports to the media and I think it's a horrendous situation that he's in,\" he said.</p><p>He described the meeting with the FCO as \"very productive\", while his father said he had detected \"a deal of optimism that there's going to be a positive outcome\".</p><p>Sue Turner, the mother of Iain Rogers, a member of the ship's crew, defended the protest and said the Arctic Sunrise had been in international waters when it was boarded and seized by Russian security forces.</p><p>She said that although some protesters had entered the exclusion zone in small boats and climbed the rig, their demonstration had not been an aggressive act.</p><p>\"It wasn't a violent crime, it was very peaceful – as Greenpeace protests usually are,\" she said. \"I think especially the people who stayed on the Arctic Sunrise and were in international waters shouldn't have been arrested.\"</p><p>The families of the other detained Britons – Frank Hewetson, Anthony Perrett and Philip Ball – did not appear at Wednesday's press conference.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the FCO declined to discuss the meeting, but confirmed that officials had met the families of the detainees and Greenpeace representatives \"to update them on the current situation and to offer continued consular support\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420182572|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|9f1c33e22fd7783bd5f7b134e282d1521579687b -->",

        "body":"<p>More than 29 million people are living in slavery, according to the <a href=\"http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/\" title=\"\">first index to attempt to measure the scale of modern-day slavery</a> on a country-by-country basis.</p><p>The index, published by the Walk Free Foundation on Thursday, ranks 162 countries and identifies risk factors for enslavement and the government responses.</p><p>The research found that around 10 countries hold about 70% of the world's slaves. India has the highest number of people enslaved in absolute terms, approximately 14 million, almost half the total worldwide. China has 2.9 million enslaved and Pakistan is third, with an estimated 2 million.</p><p>Lack of data has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/aug/29/slavery-forced-labour-data\" title=\"\">long frustrated anti-slavery campaigners</a>, who argue that without knowing who is being exploited and where, it is impossible to properly tackle the problem.</p><p>Nick Grono, CEO of the Walk Free Foundation, said: \"There is no index out there, and it's critical to measuring the scale of the problem on a country-by-country basis because that informs policy responses. Measuring a hidden crime is very challenging, but there are efforts to measure domestic abuse and drug trafficking. A lot of it boils down to taking the best data on reported issues and then looking at the scale of the unreported or 'dark' problems.\"</p><p>The index builds on statistics compiled by the  International Labour Organisation, which estimates  <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_181961/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">21 million people worldwide are in forced labour</a>.</p><p>\"It's very similar to our method,\" said Grono, \"going country by country, taking the reported data and then estimating the 'dark' figures. They haven't published country-by-country data.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/socsci/staff/academic-staff/bales,-kevin.aspx\" title=\"\">Kevin Bales</a>, the lead academic behind the index, has written extensively about the issue of modern-day slavery. He said the index is the culmination of many years work looking at how to make campaigns more effective. \"I've been anxious to do this for getting on 15 years. It's a hidden crime, but there is a lot of collection of secondary source of information, NGO records, police records. We basically ransacked the planet to get those.\"</p><p>For Bales, the data is the first step in being able to tackle exploitation, wherever it exists. \"Let's really focus on those countries, all of those countries are going to get some very devoted attention,\" he said.</p><p>Grono acknowledged the controversial nature of any attempt to compile hard facts on slavery and human trafficking, which are by their nature conducted in the shadows.</p><p>\"We recognise the data is not that strong; we want to be open about this. If a government says they don't agree [with the data], we will say great, let's work with a national statistics office to do a study across the country to try and analyse the scale of the problem.\"</p><p>As well as a tool to hold governments to account, part of the challenge for the index authors will be to persuade researchers that the data is useful.</p><p>Not everyone is convinced. Bridget Anderson, deputy director of the <a href=\"http://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/?id=50\" title=\"\">Centre on Migration, Policy and Society</a> at the University of Oxford, who has researched and written about human trafficking, said any attempt to gather \"unjust situations\" across the planet and label them as \"slavery\" is already getting off on the wrong foot.</p><p>\"I wouldn't find it useful. You have a definitional problem, everything depends on the definition and if you use tricky words like 'forced', you are already straying into difficult territory,\" she said.</p><p>\"Say with sex trafficking: if you are dealing with people who have very constrained choices, and you are so horrified with the choices, you say you are not allowed to make that choice, it's too terrible for me on my nice sofa to tolerate. Is it right that you shut that choice down? It's unjust that someone could be in such a situation where poor options are seen as great opportunities.\"</p><p>\"Slavery is such an emotive term. It has an incredible emotive power, which is what a lot of campaigners use and draw on productively, but then people engage with their emotions but don't think about it politically. It becomes de-politicised.\"</p><p>But Bales is already working on next year's index, in which he plans to include more research on the ground in the form of random sample surveys. He is passionate about his cause and believes the accurate labelling and tracking of the \"disease\" of slavery is the first step in beating it.</p><p>\"It's a lot like epidemiology,\" he said, \"we have to get in there and vaccinate – but first we have to figure out where the disease is, what are the risk factors. So in the same way that you do that with an epidemic, it's not always in the same place, there are different supporting factors … It's been a lot of work but it's been very exciting.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420175205|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|676be874fa07ebe73201508b60f585d05d6222d8 -->",

        "body":"<p>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's conviction for theft has been upheld by an appeals court but his five-year jail sentence was suspended, allowing the prominent critic of Vladimir Putin to walk free.</p><p>However, the conviction will prevent Navalny, who emerged from a wave of street protests as the most prominent opposition leader, from seeking elected office for years. He has said he will appeal against the decision.</p><p>\"It's clear for me that the authorities are trying by all means to hound me out of politics, coming up with some restrictions and fabricated cases,\" he said after embracing his wife following the ruling in the provincial city of Kirov.</p><p>\"One thing is for sure, they will not succeed in pushing me and my allies out of political life,\" said Navalny, who posted a strong second-place showing against a Putin ally in a Moscow mayoral election last month.</p><p>Navalny was convicted in July of organising the theft of 16m roubles (£310,000) from a timber firm in 2009. He had appealed against the verdict and sentence, contending the case against him was fabricated and politically motivated.</p><p>But he was unexpectedly freed from custody the following day after thousands protested in central Moscow, allowing him to continue his mayoral campaign.</p><p>Jailing Navalny would have increased the risk of a new wave of opposition protests against Putin and done further damage to his image in the west as Russia prepares to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in February.</p><p>But Navalny and others suggested that Wednesday's ruling was carefully tailored by the Kremlin to avoid making him into what political analyst Liliya Shevtsova called \"a Russian Mandela\" while sidelining him from electoral politics.</p><p>\"The court decision means political isolation,\" prominent opposition activist Ilya Yashin, said on Twitter.</p><p>Navalny argued during the hearing that the case against him was fabricated and politically motivated, and afterward suggested that the ruling was the result of careful calculations in the Kremlin.</p><p>\"It's clear that the decision on suspending the sentence was taken not here but in Moscow,\" he said.</p><p>Putin denies exerting influence over the courts. His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had nothing to do with the ruling. Yet many Russians suspect that decisions in high-profile cases are dictated by the Kremlin.</p><p>It was not immediately clear how long Navalny will be barred from elections.</p><p>The Constitutional Court ruled last week that lifetime bans for convicts are unconsitutional, but the law has not been amended and previously convicts had been prohibited from seeking elected office for at least the length of their sentences.</p><p>In addition to the suspended sentence, the judge said Navalny was sentenced to five years probation. His lawyer Olga Mikhailova said the terms would be served consecutively, indicating Navalny could be barred from elections for 10 years.</p><p>Even a five-year ban would keep Navalny, who has aired presidential ambitions, out of the presidential vote scheduled for 2018. Putin, who has been in power as president or prime minister since 2000, has not ruled out running in that election.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420118794|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|0142307465481cfa7ec914f470507bc1b6f60ebe -->",

Until now, posts by those who registered their age as less than 18 could be viewed only by their friends, and by friends of their friends. </p> <p>\"Teens are among the savviest people using of social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, activism, or their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard,\" Facebook said in an announcement of the changes.</p> <p>\"While only a small fraction of teens using Facebook might choose to post publicly, this update now gives them the choice to share more broadly, just like on other social media services,\" the company said.</p> <p>Facebook is under increasing competition for younger users from a new crop of mobile and social services, such as SnapChat and WhatsApp.</p> <p>The executive director of the non-profit Center for Digital Democracy, Jeffrey Chester, said Facebook was sacrificing the safety and privacy of teenage users to further its business.</p> <p>\"Teens don't necessarily have good judgment and to the extent that they make themselves visible to the wider public, there's all kind of people &ndash; from predators to junk food marketers &ndash; who are surveilling Facebook for new kinds of targets,\" Chester said.</p> <p>Other social media services also allow teens to share information with the broader public. But Chester said the amount of personal information users had on Facebook was much more extensive than on other social services, where users can create accounts with pseudonyms.</p> <p>Facebook said teenage users would now also be allowed to use the \"Follow\" feature, which lets strangers automatically receive public posts from another user without requiring that the two be connected on the service as mutual friends.</p> <p>Facebook's manager of privacy and public policy, Nicky Jackson Colaco, said the changes would allow teenagers to share information that might benefit from dissemination to a broader audience, such as information about fundraising efforts, or a teen rock band trying to promote an upcoming performance.</p> <p>The 16-year-old Pakistani activist&nbsp;Malala Yousafzai would not have been able to use Facebook as a broad communication channel under the previous policy, said Stephen Balkam, of the Family Online Safety Institute, a non-profit body that receives funding from several internet companies, including Facebook.</p> <p>Facebook said it would show teenage users a special notice the first couple of times they attempted to post information to the public, reminding the user that the post can be seen by anyone.</p> <p>The restrictions on teen use of Facebook's private messaging feature will not change, with users under 18 able to receive messages only from their friends and from friends of their friends.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420198663|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|ff318e07042e5dfbe61d09accbac5cd9c0093052 -->",

While it is possible that Sunni insurgents could be carrying out mosque attacks, hoping to stoke sectarian hatred, Shia militias may also be behind such assaults.</p><p>The latest attack came despite tight security measures imposed by security forces to prevent attacks during the four-day Eid al-Adha celebrations.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419983484|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|93ab429889c503a2fdc9ead095fc94759eb8388c -->",

It could be one of the many thousands of posters issued by the Chinese Communist Party's Propaganda Department in the 1950s, of rosy-cheeked comrades brimming with vim and vigour. But something's not quite right.</p> <p>In the centre of this vision of optimism, where once might have beamed the <a href=\"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2012/11/09/01_posters_slide-f0f2ec5dd1b8ebd6728c4b47bce3054b673211b0-s6-c30.jpg\">cheerful face of Mao</a>, stands the twisted loop of the <a href=\"http://oma.eu/projects/2002/cctv-%E2%80%93-headquarters\">China Central Television (CCTV) headquarters</a>, radiating a lilac sheen. Framed by the vapour trail of a trio of jet-planes performing a victory flypast into the sunset, the building stands like a triumphal gateway to some promised land of <a href=\"http://maoist.wikia.com/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics\">Socialism with Chinese characteristics</a>.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8b52c4c4-77b4-450f-9c4b-5994f8b5ecfe\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938175770/67151242-ed21-4672-ae82-53dab521578b-307x420.jpeg\" alt=\"'CCTV Tower With Bountiful Harvest'\" width=\"307\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'CCTV Tower With Bountiful Harvest' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>The image could well be the mischievous work of its own architects, the Rotterdam-based practice OMA, which has made its own <a href=\"http://places.designobserver.com/media/images/dunham-jones-koolhaas-2_525.jpg\">collage&nbsp;of the building</a> alongside Kim Jong-il, George W Bush, Saddam Hussein and Jesus for a book cover, as well as an image of it <a href=\"http://file.u148.net/attachments/image/2009/08/cctvav/1.jpg\">bursting into flames</a> behind a spread-legged porn-star. But it is in fact the product of artists from a North Korean painting unit – the very same that used to produce such propaganda images for the Kim regime, but now find themselves designing food packaging in Pyongyang.</p> <p><a href=\"http://koryogroup.com/blog/?p=2087\">The Beautiful Future</a>, which comprises six such paintings to date, is the brainchild of British ex-pat duo Nick Bonner and Dominic Johnson-Hill, who both arrived in the Chinese capital 20 years ago and caught the Beijing bug. Bonner runs <a href=\"http://www.koryogroup.com/\">Koryo Tours</a>, a travel company specialising in trips to the DPRK, while Johnson-Hill presides over a street-wear empire, <a href=\"http://www.plasteredtshirts.com/\">Plastered</a>, producing T-shirts emblazoned with Maoist kitsch. The paintings, on show earlier this month as part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/oct/02/beijing-design-week-china-hutongs-preservation\">Beijing Design Week</a>, are the inevitable result of their mutual obsessions.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9511325e-c111-4475-8a59-f609b6b6fc1e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938299492/09154ddf-4166-426a-afc6-8989c83d820f-460x333.jpeg\" alt=\"'Bird's Nest, Home of the People'\" width=\"460\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'Bird's Nest, Home of the People' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>“North Korean artists are the best people at delivering a message without slogans,” says Bonner, who collects North Korean art and has produced documentaries exploring life in the DPRK – as well as what he describes as “North Korea's first feature-length rom-com” last year, <a href=\"http://www.comradekimgoesflying.com/\">Comrade Kim Goes Flying</a>. “We wanted to show contemporary China as it could have been, if it had continued with Maoist ideology.”</p> <p>One painting shows a line of excited comrades, obediently dressed in Mao suits, filing towards Herzog and de Meuron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/11/architecture.chinaarts2008\">Bird's Nest stadium</a>. The skyline is proudly choked with glassy skyscrapers on one side and a thicket of cooling towers on the other, belching smoke productively into the pink skies. An elderly tourist and his granddaughter look on in awe at the spirited scene.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b4e2afd7-15cf-4752-b7d2-fc89d4fe8074\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938435800/245eba41-2cb0-417b-860d-94604a41124d-460x328.jpeg\" alt=\"'KTV Gives Us a Voice'\" width=\"460\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'KTV Gives Us a Voice' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>Elsewhere workers are seen liberated from their collective drudgery, disco-dancing in nightclubs and singing in gaudy karaoke parlours. An office scene shows people working at networked computer terminals – painted by artists who in all likelihood have no experience of the internet.</p> <p>“The artists are in a situation where they are painting things they've never seen before,” says Bonner, “which gives the images an even more unreal, dreamlike quality.”</p> <p>An ongoing process since the pre-Olympic frenzy, the paintings are the result of Bonner and Hill sending detailed sketches to the North Korean artists, along with renderings of the buildings in question – as neither CCTV nor the Olympic venues existed at that stage. The artists were then left to fill in the blanks as they wished. The results give an intriguing insight into their vision of what Chinese modernity might be like in a land they will never know.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-53b98afb-9dde-4f21-8c5e-c89b9741ae44\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938601343/7c3c5f1c-29fc-4cb3-8bb5-464486fe9fc3-460x331.jpeg\" alt=\"'Water Cube for Clean Air and Healthy Life'\" width=\"460\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'Water Cube for Clean Air and Healthy Life' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>Thrusting China's contemporary icons into the aesthetic landscape of early Communist propaganda provides a striking image of quite how far the country has come since Deng Xiaoping began his policy of Reform and Opening in 1978. With the (historically disputed) motto “to get rich is glorious,” he catapulted the Middle Kingdom from grey uniformity to technicolour bling, the next 30 years seeing city skylines of chimneys replaced by glitzy baubles of the boom.</p> <p>But just as the billboards of Mao's Great Leap Forward, featuring hoards of <a href=\"http://i1195.photobucket.com/albums/aa383/reverserainbowstar/Vintage%20Ads/Great%20Leap%20Forward%20Propaganda%20Posters/Unknown/CCPIdealSociety.png\">grinning labourers in rude health</a>, masked the reality of work camps and mass starvation, so the glare of these state-sponsored mega-projects happily obscures the human rights abuses and migrant labour conditions that fuel their construction. The super-saturated, unadulterated joy shining out from the canvases is a stark reminder of exactly what is missing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420164584|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|2e1dbfbd0b922b46f1397a33f25a2832763bdd5f -->",
