        "headline":"Grangemouth oil refinery shuts as owners refuse to back down in dispute",
        "body":"<p>Scotland's biggest oil refinery was shut down on Wednesday  as the owners of the Grangemouth site refused to back down in an industrial dispute with the Unite trade union.</p><p>Ineos, which owns the plant on the Firth of Forth, said it will await a response from its 1,300 staff to proposed pension changes before deciding whether to reopen the plant. However, the pensions dispute is part of a tangled web of grievances between Ineos and Unite, including the involvement of Grangemouth's chief shop steward in the furore over the selection of Falkirk's Labour parliamentary candidate.</p><p>A spokesman for Ineos said workers would receive proposals on Thursday to replace their final salary pension scheme. He said: \"Grangemouth is shut down and it will remain shut down. When we have got a response from the workforce we will consult with our shareholders and make a decision.\"</p><p>Ed Davey, the energy secretary, assured motorists the shutdown would not affect Scotland's petrol and diesel supplies.</p><p>The plant processes about 200,000 barrels of oil a day and supplies most of Scotland's fuel. The closure could also disrupt the flow of North Sea oil into Scotland because BP's giant Kinneil processing terminal next door relies on Grangemouth for its power.</p><p>The decision to close Grangemouth came after talks between the company and Unite broke down on Wednesday morning. Unite called off a planned 48-hour strike set to start on Sunday and said it was doing so to protect the plant from being damaged by the shutdown.</p><p>The Scottish secretary, Alistair Carmichael, said he was concerned by Ineos's decision, and wanted to know why it had attached conditions to keeping the plant running. He said: \"It doesn't look constructive because this is a dispute which has enormous danger of damaging Scotland's economy and confidence. For that reason, I think there is a legitimate interest for government both in Edinburgh and London to hold both parties to account here. Be in no doubt that the stakes are exceptionally high. This could be seriously bad news for Scotland's economy.\"</p><p>Unite attacked Ineos for going ahead with a \"cold shutdown\" that would put Grangemouth out of action for a month even after the plant was reopened. The union had called for a partial \"warm\" shutdown during its strike to allow the plant to tick over and resume operation quickly. But despite the union's decision to cancel its strike, Ineos went ahead with its shutdown and upped the stakes by raising the prospect of permanent closure.</p><p>The dispute between Unite and Ineos is complicated by claims and counterclaims over a number of grievances.</p><p>The planned strike was over Ineos's treatment of Stephen Deans, Unite's convenor in Scotland who works at the plant. Deans was implicated in the furore over the selection of Falkirk's Labour parliamentary candidate, which ultimately saw the party and the police clear Unite of allegations of vote rigging.</p><p>After he was suspended from the Labour party, the police decided to bring no charges against him and Labour reinstated him as chairman of the local party. But Ineos has carried on with its own inquiry, based on the allegation that Deans recruited party members on the company's premises.</p><p>The talks also covered the future of Grangemouth and Ineos's proposals.</p><p>Ineos claims Grangemouth is losing £10m a month and cannot survive without huge investment and cost cuts. Last month it presented a \"survival plan\" to its employees that included the closure of the final salary pension scheme and a request for £150m of government support.</p><p>Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said the dispute would not affect fuel distribution and indicated that the Scottish government will invest in the site in a bid to help resolve the dispute. \"What is important – and what now is at stake – is the future of Grangemouth as a chemical complex and a refinery in Scotland, and that can only be brought about by investment in the plant.</p><p>\"The Scottish Government is happy to assist with such an investment package, but before that can happen there needs to be goodwill on both sides between management and the unions.\"</p><p>Ineos said it agreed to reopen Grangemouth as soon as possible if the union delayed any further industrial action until the end of March, but that Unite refused. Unite also refused to accept Ineos's version of Grangemouth's financial position.</p><p>A major sticking point was Unite's refusal to apologise for its claim that Ineos had taken money from the pension fund – an allegation that sparked a libel action. Unite said Ratcliffe demanded a public apology in return for withdrawing the suit.</p><p>Ineos is owned by its management, headed by chairman and chemicals industry veteran Jim Ratcliffe. The company expanded from its launch in 1998 by snapping up chemical works. It gained a reputation as a canny but hard-nosed operator and now has a turnover of $43bn (£27bn). PetroChina bought a stake in Grangemouth in 2011 in a deal that was meant to secure its future.</p><p>Grangemouth's Labour MP Michael Connarty said: \"This isn't 1970s management; this is 1920s management. Big companies shouldn't be able to hold our country to ransom. Major national assets shouldn't be left to the whim of a couple of hard men from the chemicals industry.\"</p><p>Grangemouth is Ineos's biggest production centre and operates refinery and petrochemicals plants on a 1,700-acre estate 25 miles from Edinburgh. Ineos bought the site from BP in 2005 when the oil giant decided to dispose of its olefins and derivatives businesses.</p><p>Connarty said Ineos acquired the plant when the economy was booming, enjoyed a year or two of bumper business and then suffered as demand fell in the global recession.</p><p>\"They made the mistake of buying these things when the world economy was turning down and now they blame the workforce,\" he said.</p><p>Unite yesterday released an analysis of Grangemouth's finances by tax consultant Richard Murphy. He disputed Ineos's claims and said Grangemouth Chemicals – the only accounts he could find – made a profit in 2012 and was expecting £117m of tax gains that could only occur if the company earned £500m over the next few years.</p><p>Murphy said total labour costs, including exceptional pension expenses, were 16.9% of revenue and total labour costs \"should not be a critical cause for concern\".</p><p>But with the stakes suddenly increased the future of Grangemouth is starting to look critical.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420184819|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|48fb6eff28c4446d0847ae00b5ad9a6ec0ecf670 -->",

        "headline":"Grangemouth oil refinery shuts as owners refuse to back down in dispute",
        "body":"<p>Scotland's biggest oil refinery was shut down on Wednesday  as the owners of the Grangemouth site refused to back down in an industrial dispute with the Unite trade union.</p><p>Ineos, which owns the plant on the Firth of Forth, said it will await a response from its 1,300 staff to proposed pension changes before deciding whether to reopen the plant. However, the pensions dispute is part of a tangled web of grievances between Ineos and Unite, including the involvement of Grangemouth's chief shop steward in the furore over the selection of Falkirk's Labour parliamentary candidate.</p><p>A spokesman for Ineos said workers would receive proposals on Thursday to replace their final salary pension scheme. He said: \"Grangemouth is shut down and it will remain shut down. When we have got a response from the workforce we will consult with our shareholders and make a decision.\"</p><p>Ed Davey, the energy secretary, assured motorists the shutdown would not affect Scotland's petrol and diesel supplies.</p><p>The plant processes about 200,000 barrels of oil a day and supplies most of Scotland's fuel. The closure could also disrupt the flow of North Sea oil into Scotland because BP's giant Kinneil processing terminal next door relies on Grangemouth for its power.</p><p>The decision to close Grangemouth came after talks between the company and Unite broke down on Wednesday morning. Unite called off a planned 48-hour strike set to start on Sunday and said it was doing so to protect the plant from being damaged by the shutdown.</p><p>The Scottish secretary, Alistair Carmichael, said he was concerned by Ineos's decision, and wanted to know why it had attached conditions to keeping the plant running. He said: \"It doesn't look constructive because this is a dispute which has enormous danger of damaging Scotland's economy and confidence. For that reason, I think there is a legitimate interest for government both in Edinburgh and London to hold both parties to account here. Be in no doubt that the stakes are exceptionally high. This could be seriously bad news for Scotland's economy.\"</p><p>Unite attacked Ineos for going ahead with a \"cold shutdown\" that would put Grangemouth out of action for a month even after the plant was reopened. The union had called for a partial \"warm\" shutdown during its strike to allow the plant to tick over and resume operation quickly. But despite the union's decision to cancel its strike, Ineos went ahead with its shutdown and upped the stakes by raising the prospect of permanent closure.</p><p>The dispute between Unite and Ineos is complicated by claims and counterclaims over a number of grievances.</p><p>The planned strike was over Ineos's treatment of Stephen Deans, Unite's convenor in Scotland who works at the plant. Deans was implicated in the furore over the selection of Falkirk's Labour parliamentary candidate, which ultimately saw the party and the police clear Unite of allegations of vote rigging.</p><p>After he was suspended from the Labour party, the police decided to bring no charges against him and Labour reinstated him as chairman of the local party. But Ineos has carried on with its own inquiry, based on the allegation that Deans recruited party members on the company's premises.</p><p>The talks also covered the future of Grangemouth and Ineos's proposals.</p><p>Ineos claims Grangemouth is losing £10m a month and cannot survive without huge investment and cost cuts. Last month it presented a \"survival plan\" to its employees that included the closure of the final salary pension scheme and a request for £150m of government support.</p><p>Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said the dispute would not affect fuel distribution and indicated that the Scottish government will invest in the site in a bid to help resolve the dispute. \"What is important – and what now is at stake – is the future of Grangemouth as a chemical complex and a refinery in Scotland, and that can only be brought about by investment in the plant.</p><p>\"The Scottish Government is happy to assist with such an investment package, but before that can happen there needs to be goodwill on both sides between management and the unions.\"</p><p>Ineos said it agreed to reopen Grangemouth as soon as possible if the union delayed any further industrial action until the end of March, but that Unite refused. Unite also refused to accept Ineos's version of Grangemouth's financial position.</p><p>A major sticking point was Unite's refusal to apologise for its claim that Ineos had taken money from the pension fund – an allegation that sparked a libel action. Unite said Ratcliffe demanded a public apology in return for withdrawing the suit.</p><p>Ineos is owned by its management, headed by chairman and chemicals industry veteran Jim Ratcliffe. The company expanded from its launch in 1998 by snapping up chemical works. It gained a reputation as a canny but hard-nosed operator and now has a turnover of $43bn (£27bn). PetroChina bought a stake in Grangemouth in 2011 in a deal that was meant to secure its future.</p><p>Grangemouth's Labour MP Michael Connarty said: \"This isn't 1970s management; this is 1920s management. Big companies shouldn't be able to hold our country to ransom. Major national assets shouldn't be left to the whim of a couple of hard men from the chemicals industry.\"</p><p>Grangemouth is Ineos's biggest production centre and operates refinery and petrochemicals plants on a 1,700-acre estate 25 miles from Edinburgh. Ineos bought the site from BP in 2005 when the oil giant decided to dispose of its olefins and derivatives businesses.</p><p>Connarty said Ineos acquired the plant when the economy was booming, enjoyed a year or two of bumper business and then suffered as demand fell in the global recession.</p><p>\"They made the mistake of buying these things when the world economy was turning down and now they blame the workforce,\" he said.</p><p>Unite yesterday released an analysis of Grangemouth's finances by tax consultant Richard Murphy. He disputed Ineos's claims and said Grangemouth Chemicals – the only accounts he could find – made a profit in 2012 and was expecting £117m of tax gains that could only occur if the company earned £500m over the next few years.</p><p>Murphy said total labour costs, including exceptional pension expenses, were 16.9% of revenue and total labour costs \"should not be a critical cause for concern\".</p><p>But with the stakes suddenly increased the future of Grangemouth is starting to look critical.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420184819|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|48fb6eff28c4446d0847ae00b5ad9a6ec0ecf670 -->",

        "headline":"Grangemouth oil refinery owner tells workers they face D-day",
        "body":"<p>The owner of the Grangemouth oil refinery has told its 1,300 workers they face \"D-Day\" as it demanded they accept cuts to jobs and pensions plus other changes to their working conditions to keep the plant open.</p><p>Ineos shut the refinery, Scotland's biggest, on Wednesday and said it would stay closed at least until it had considered the views of staff. An Ineos spokesman said closing the site permanently was \"ultimately one of the options\".</p><p>Grangemouth, on the Firth of Forth, processes about 200,000 barrels of oil a day and supplies most of Scotland's fuel. The plant also supplies steam for BP's neighbouring Kinneil North Sea oil processing operation and a prolonged closure could affect that site.</p><p>The Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, intervened on Thursday by holding talks with the trade union Unite and Ineos bosses in a bid to resolve the dispute.</p><p>\"Governments can't make agreements,\" he told the SNP conference in Perth. \"But we can encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found.\"</p><p>Ineos wants its employees to accept in full a \"survival plan\" put to them last month but rejected by Unite, which represents most of Grangemouth's workforce.</p><p>Ineos, headed by its billionaire chairman, Jim Ratcliffe, has bypassed Unite by holding \"town hall\" meetings and handing out forms for employees to fill in. It wants the forms back on Monday before it decides on Tuesday what action to take.</p><p>Talks between Unite and Ineos broke down on Wednesday morning and Ineos completed the shutdown of Grangemouth despite the union calling off a 48-hour strike planned for Sunday.</p><p>Calum MacLean, the chairman of Ineos Grangemouth, said on Thursday: \"This is D-Day for Grangemouth. We are going to give our employees a few days over the weekend to reflect on our proposals and then get their feedback. This feedback will be critical in influencing the shareholders in their decisions about what to do next\".</p><p>Ineos is Britain's biggest private company and its shareholders are Ratcliffe and other members of his top team. They are demanding that Grangemouth workers accept changes including an end to collective bargaining and the replacement of their final-salary pension scheme with a less secure money-purchase plan.</p><p>Ineos has tried before to get Grangemouth workers to accept pension cuts but Unite thwarted the move in 2008 by launching a strike that caused shortages at petrol pumps.</p><p>When talks collapsed on Wednesday one of the key sticking points was Ineos's demand that Unite agree to hold off strikes until April next year at the earliest. Unite refused and reserved the right to stage one 24-hour strike a month in the first three months of 2014.</p><p>The dispute between the two sides also includes Ineos's treatment of Stephen Deans, a Unite convener who works at Grangemouth. Deans's predicament was the main reason for a Unite strike that had been called for this weekend but was subsequently cancelled by the union in order to protect the plant during the Ineos shutdown.</p><p>Deans was implicated in the scandal over alleged ballot fixing for the Labour party candidate in the Falkirk constituency but the police and Labour cleared him of wrongdoing. However, Ineos has continued with its own investigation into Deans's Labour-related activity on its premises.</p><p>Unite attacked Ineos's \"menacing tactics\" and said it was considering legal action against attempts to end collective bargaining.</p><p>Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: \"The company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce. Menaces and threats will not secure the future of Grangemouth which now rests in the hands of a few faceless unaccountable shareholders.\"</p><p>Ineos claimed that Grangemouth was losing £10m a month and that the pension scheme it inherited from BP when it bought the business in 2006 is one of the major costs. It said if employees accepted its plan Ineos would invest £300m to ensure the plant's survival.</p><p>Unite questioned Ineos's claims and accused the company, which moved to Switzerland in 2010, of not paying sufficient UK corporation tax while asking for government subsidies.</p><p>Grangemouth's local MP, Michael Connarty, alleged in the House of Commons there may have been \"some sort of collusion\" between the government and Ineos so that the company could \"break the workforce\". The Labour MP for Linlithgow and East Falkirk said preparations had been made before the shutdown to ensure that Scotland receives fuel supplies if the dispute escalates.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420293982|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|1698a63c7dabeb01b5cc9c7342dd550257867129 -->",

        "body":"<p>Unions at Grangemouth oil refinery would happily agree not to strike until the end of this year in return for employers reopening talks about workers' future conditions, the Scottish secretary of the Unite union said on Friday.</p><p>Pat Rafferty's comments came after Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, called for a \"truce deal\" between unions and the refinery's operator Ineos, which has shut down the plant on safety grounds in the face of threatened industrial action.</p><p>Ineos director Tom Crotty said the company would be ready to reopen the complex on the Firth of Forth if it received formal assurances from Unite that there would be no strike between now and the end of December. The union has called off a 48-hour strike planned for Sunday.</p><p>Rafferty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We would happily sign up to having no more strikes until the end of the year.</p><p>\"We will enter happily into an agreement right now that will take us to Christmas, where we will have no industrial action and no ballots. In return for that, all we ask the company to do is sit down with us at the negotiating table over the next 45 days and look to try and seek agreement.</p><p>\"The plant should be turned on. There's no reason right now why that plant shouldn't be turned on, because there's no industrial action.\"</p><p>Rafferty said the same offer had been on the table at recent talks at the conciliation service Acas, but that Ineos walked away and moved to impose \"detrimental terms and conditions\" on workers.</p><p>Asked whether Ineos could reopen Grangemouth in response to the Unite offer, Crotty told Today: \"Of course we can. If we get the assurance, we will switch the plant on. If we get that formally, then that's great.\"</p><p>He added: \"What we are trying to do right now is talk to our employees about the urgent changes we need to make to this site.</p><p>\"We have a business that's losing £10m every month. We've put £1bn into that business. We need to put another £300m into it to get it sorted out, to build a new terminal that will allow us to bring new sources of gas in, because the gas in the North Sea is running out.</p><p>\"If we don't do that, that site will close. By 2017, it will not exist. That's a disaster for Scotland that we are desperately trying to avoid. We're working to save this site. To do that we need our employees to help. That's what we are talking to our employees about right now.\"</p><p>Ineos released a statement later on Friday confirming it would restart the Grangemouth site if it received a guarantee that there would be no further industrial action during the 60-day consultation period on the the firm's survival plan for the site.</p><p>Calum Maclean, Grangemouth's chairman said: \"We have been very clear that for compelling safety reasons, we cannot restart the site until we know that the risk of further industrial action has been removed. We can confirm that we would restart if there was a clear guarantee that there would be no further action during the next 60 days. This would allow us to complete a full consultation process with our employees on the changes that the site so urgently needs.\"</p><p>Ineos had previously said it was keeping the plant shut while workers are consulted about proposed changes to issues such as pensions.</p><p>Letters have been sent to Grangemouth workers detailing changes to their terms and conditions, including ending their final salary pension scheme, freezing pay and bonuses, reducing shift allowances and new agreements with unions including having part-time conveners.</p><p>The letter said: \"We expect to seek individual employee agreement to the final changes, and, where agreement is not forthcoming, to implement the changes in due course by issuing notices of termination and offering new contracts of employment to those employees which incorporate the new terms.\"</p><p>Unite said staff had been told to accept the new terms and conditions by 6pm on Monday, which amounted to a \"sign or be sacked\" ultimatum, and that it was considering legal action.</p><p>Ineos said it was going directly to the employees rather than deal with their union amid fresh clashes over the company's finances and its decision to close the plant.</p><p>The Grangemouth refining and chemicals complex has been shut down twice in the last 40 years, during a previous strike in 2008 and again in preparation for the latest walkout, according to Ineos.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420331385|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|4531542168e882ce2b3ec9ce68b7438a0a0131c0 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>Hopes of reopening the Grangemouth oil refinery were dashed  after its owner, Ineos, and the Unite union failed to reach agreement in talks spurred by Scottish secretary Alex Salmond.</p><p>Scotland's biggest oil refinery remains shut despite Ineos's offer to restart it if Unite agreed not to strike for the rest of this year. Ineos closed the site on Wednesday and demanded that workers accept drastic changes to their employment terms.</p><p>Ineos said Grangemouth would stay closed at least until Tuesday, when bosses will review workers' response to their demands. It has warned that permanent closure is an option. Unite said that it had agreed not to strike, but Ineos had to remove the \"sword of Damocles\" deadline of 6pm on Monday for workers to accept the new terms.</p><p>Talks encouraged by Salmond between Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean and Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty broke up on Friday morning.</p><p>Salmond told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"I set out as a proposal what both sides have indicated they are prepared to do, something that would allow the plant to get from its current cold state back up into safe operation, which I think would be a fundamentally better background in which to conduct negotiations and consultation.\"</p><p>Employing 3,400 permanent and contract staff, Grangemouth supplies most of Scotland's fuel. Prolonged closure could spark panic at petrol pumps and damage the country's economy.</p><p>Ineos's demands include abolishing Grangemouth's final salary pension scheme, freezing wages and scrapping bonuses until 2017 as well as cutting shift allowances, overtime pay, holidays and redundancy terms. Ineos has bypassed Unite to offer one-off payments to workers who agree to the new terms by Monday's deadline.</p><p>Unite said the offer was designed to cause fear and called on Ineos to restart talks. Ineos said Grangemouth's fate was urgent and that Unite had been more concerned with the fate of a suspended official, Stephen Deans, than the plant's future. Ineos has said Grangemouth is losing £10m a month and the workforce will have to accept changes for a planned  £300m investment plan to be viable.</p><p>Unite has asked HMRC to investigate Swiss-based Ineos's tax affairs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420393191|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|37429bd140b0ed181a20599e3b79f14e1fa9015a -->",

        "headline":"Grangemouth oil refinery 'faces permanent closure'",
        "body":"<p>The owner of Scotland's largest oil refinery has warned he is not bluffing about threats to close the site permanently this week if 1,300 staff do not agree to pensions cuts.</p><p>Grangemouth, which provides 85% of Scotland's petrol, was shut down last Wednesday in an escalation of a rancorous industrial dispute between Ineos, the plant's owner, and Unite, Britain's largest trade union.</p><p>Jim Ratcliffe, the chairman of Ineos, said a decision on the site's future would be announced on Tuesday following a staff consultation.</p><p>\"This is not a bluff. The clock is ticking, Grangemouth could have a future but that is absolutely in the hands of the workers,\" he said in an interview with the Sunday Times. \"The situation is very serious but I want to emphasise that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Grangemouth can have a potentially exciting future.\"</p><p>Grangemouth has been shut since Wednesday after Unite called a two-day strike, which it later cancelled. On Sunday the union staged a protest at the plant on the Firth of Forth near Edinburgh.</p><p>At the rally, Unite's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, urged Ineos to resume negotiations over changes to terms and conditions, which include the company's demand for an end to a final salary pension scheme.</p><p>Rafferty said: \"It's the company that set this deadline so we're not quite sure what happens after that. We still believe there is time for it to be called off and to get back to negotiations, as has been called for.</p><p>\"We're recommending to our members that they do not opt in and sign this offer, we want them to reject it and then get it back to us and we can negotiate with Ineos.\"</p><p>Despite the disagreement over pensions, the dispute is rooted in a row over the site's chief shop steward, Stephen Deans, who was implicated in allegations of ballot fixing for the Labour party candidate in the Falkirk constituency. The police and Labour have cleared him of wrongdoing but Ineos has angered Unite by continuing its own investigation into Deans.</p><p>Ineos said more than 250 workers had accepted the new terms and conditions by the end of Saturday, which it viewed as a positive development. The company sent out a letter on Thursday to all 1,350 workers at the site asking them to indicate their support or rejection of the company's plan by 6pm on Tuesday.</p><p>Calum MacLean, head of the Grangemouth site, said: \"Whilst it's early days, the initial response to the survival plan has been pleasing. We weren't expecting many returns before Monday, so we are taking this as a positive development.\"</p><p>Ineos also plans to build a £300m gas import terminal at Grangemouth.</p><p>Workers who accept the company's pension proposals will receive a transitional payment of up to £15,000 which the company said they can use as they wish, plus an enhanced employer contribution to a new money-purchase pension scheme. Ineos claims that Grangemouth is losing £150m a year, with the shutdown costing the company at least £20m.</p><p>Ratcliffe said: \"If it stays shut, Grangemouth runs out of money quite quickly on that basis. Ineos won't continue funding it beyond a reasonable amount of time and certainly has no obligation to.\"</p><p>The Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, has urged Ineos to \"fire up the plant and do it now\".</p><p>Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, he added that Unite should accede to the company's demand for a no-strike pledge.</p><p>He said: \"I think Unite should give a no strike – without strings – guarantee. Once that is done Ineos should fire up the plant and then the various discussions, negotiations, consultations on terms and conditions, should take place against the background of a working plant, not a plant that is lying cold.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420481148|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|93859c00c64b6d0952efcf98d1667c68081de0d5 -->",

        "body":"<p>The biggest company you've probably never heard of is engaged in a titanic battle with Britain's biggest union. Ineos, the world's fourth largest chemicals conglomerate, which is also the largest privately owned company in Britain, has issued its 1,400 Grangemouth workers with what has been called <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/unite-accuses-ineos-of-cynical-blackmail-and-threatens-legal-action/\" title=\"\">a \"sign-or-be-sacked\" ultimatum</a>. Drastic reductions in pay and pensions are demanded of its workers if they want a continued livelihood. Their union, Unite, has urged them to return their ballot papers unmarked.</p><p>The battle's significance lies not just in the size of the protagonists and the employment issues at stake – it's also found in the economic and political ramifications. The plant includes Scotland's only oil refinery and it powers the Forties pipeline (which supplies a third of Britain's North Sea oil). This occasioned Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, to intervene and broker fresh but failed talks late last week.</p><p>The now \"hot\" war began as a \"cold\" one back in June. Stephen Deans, the lead shop steward, is accused of misusing company time and property to recruit Unite members to Labour. He was suspended and reinstated by the company, but continues to be investigated <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/how-we-help/listofregions/scotland/latestnews/unite-scotland-statement-on-falkirk-clp/\" title=\"\">even though he was exonerated by Labour</a>.</p><p>Unite began to suspect something more was at stake than Deans' continued employment. It began to think the likelihood of his sacking <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/unite-urges-action-to-avoid-grangemouth-dispute/\" title=\"\">was an attempt to decapitate the union</a> in order to allow Ineos to <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/union-anger-at-the-reckless-decision-of-ineos-to-reject-call-to-attend-acas-talks/\" title=\"\">push through reductions in terms and conditions</a>.</p><p>This is known as a reforming conflict. Presented with such an opportunity, management decides to use it to drastically reconfigure the balance of power between it and the union by systematically escalating a dispute, going far beyond what is required to settle it.</p><p>In other words, it's union-busting and industrial blackmail. Management seeks not only to win the issues at hand, but also to impose a crushing defeat so that the union is no longer an effective bargaining opponent.</p><p>Ineos repeatedly refused meaningful talks over Deans. Unite then <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/unite-vows-to-defend-grangemouths-workers-and-their-future-rippleffectold\" title=\"\">balloted members </a>to defend him, <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/grangemouth-ballot-result-is-a-wake-up-call-to-ineos-bosses/\" title=\"\">returning an overwhelming mandate</a>. Unite again called for Ineos <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/unite-calls-on-ineos-to-drop-cannonball-diplomacy/\" title=\"\">to enter talks</a> (with Acas if necessary). Ineos refused, so <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/patience-runs-thin-as-grangemouth-workers-announce-action/\" title=\"\">Unite began an overtime ban and work-to-rule</a>, and re-issued calls for talks. Ineos refused again so <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/unite-serves-notice-of-strike-action-to-ineos/\" title=\"\">Unite issued a strike notice</a>.</p><p>Finally, the Acas talks then happened but <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/ineos-team-walk-from-talks---unite-calls-off-strike-to-protect-national-asset-from-owners-scandalous-behaviour/\" title=\"\">Unite believed Ineos deliberately torpedoed them </a>by demanding an apology to its founder and main shareholder Jim Ratcliffe. Then Ineos pressed the nuclear button.</p><p>A strike at the plant requires an orderly shutdown for safety reasons. Ineos could have used a \"hot\" shutdown – where the plant is on standby so that operations can be quickly restarted. Instead, it went for a \"cold\" shutdown, which takes much longer to come back up to operational level.</p><p>Simultaneously, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/18/grangemouth-shut-talks-fail\" title=\"\">it issued demands directly to employees, deliberately bypassing Unite</a>: abolishing the final salary pension, freezing wages and scrapping bonuses until 2017, and cutting shift allowances, overtime pay, holidays and redundancy terms. Workers were given three working days to agree if they wanted to secure the one-off compensation payments for the concessions.</p><p>The deadline expires at 6pm on Monday. Otherwise, they'll be imposed without compensation after a 60-day consultation period, and continued employment is not guaranteed. Indeed, Ineos said production would not restart until it obtained its concessions.</p><p>Along the way, Unite called the strike off and offered talks on the plant's future because Ineos repeatedly stated Grangemouth was losing £10m a month and without £300m investment it would close in 2017.</p><p>Ineos stated Grangemouth was financially \"distressed\", demanding Unite sign a legal document agreeing to the company's analysis. <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/experts-blow-hole-in-ineos-claims-over-finances/\" title=\"\">Unite refused</a>, commissioning research suggesting that Ineos may have used creative accounting methods to engineer the distress.</p><p>Ineos in Latin and Greek means \"dawn of something new and innovative\". If it gets its way, this is what Ineos will achieve – a subservient staff and a busted union.</p><p>While there are many idiosyncrasies to the Ineos case, it does indicate that more employers are approaching industrial relations with a \"put-up-or-shut-up\" attitude.
