We expect it to move below 7% by mid-2015, a year ahead of the Bank of England's current forecast. However, given the positive developments in the last couple of months, the Bank is likely to downgrade its unemployment forecast in its next Inflation Report due next Wednesday. This will probably be accompanied with upward revisions to growth as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers, World First, said:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The services sector is flying.&nbsp;Records in both output and employment have guided the PMI to the highest level since Tony Blair took power in the UK back in 1997, as confidence around the long-term ability for recovery continues to increase. Combined with the manufacturing figure from Friday and yesterday’s 6 year record construction number, we can safely say that momentum is firmly gathering in the UK economy. The wind is very much in our sails.</p> <p>We would have to say that growth is now running at close to 5% on an annualised basis, on these initial estimates, and, at the moment, shows little sign of abating. We must now wait for the Bank of England’s appraisal of this run of numbers. There will be a fair few of the economic fraternity of who will be looking forward to next week’s Quarterly Inflation Report and expecting some form of outlook change from the MPC; a change that will see rates rising sooner than the 2016 expectation that was originally forecast…</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andy Scott, associate director at HiFX:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following positive surprises in the manufacturing and construction sector indexes, the early indicators for the fourth quarter look like 2013 could see the economy grow at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Markit, the company that measures and releases the data for all three sectors, said that combining the three indexes points to GDP growth this quarter of 1.3%. This should serve to ease some concerns that have arisen over the past few weeks that the recovery won’t be sustained. The buoyancy of the housing market where prices have been rising steadily helped by increasing mortgage approvals and the government’s help to buy scheme has been what a lot of commentators have put the recovery down to but clearly it’s broader based. With unemployment continuing to fall at a modest but steady pace, confidence will be maintained which should boost consumer spending and corporate investment. </p> </blockquote> <h2>And here's our full story:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\">Service sector growing at fastest pace since 1997</a></h2> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c878e4b08cac6a3300fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:29:47.754Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">MPs grill Wonga: Payday lenders admit making changes</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Wonga has also admitted it was forced to make changes to its sales practices following an Office of Fair Trading investigation,as the hearing before MPs continued...</strong></p> <p>It was told to highlight risk factors more prominently on its website and make clearer disclosures around APRs (percentage interest rates).</p> <p><strong>QuickQuid</strong> and <strong>Mr Lender</strong> admits that they have been ordered by the Office of Fair Trading to change their procedures on 'roll overs' where hard-pressed borrowers ask for a loan to be rolled over at the end of the term.</p> <p>In total, Mr Lender admits that it was told to make around 30 changes to its procedures.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:31:44.278Z\">at 10.31am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c778e4b00d1cb164472b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:28:59.928Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Back to parliament, and&nbsp;MPs are pressing payday lenders on how they check whether borrowers can afford a payday loan. </strong></p> <p>Adam Freeman, chief executive of Mr Lender, admits that it has no idea if a borrower is taking out new loans from Wonga or other lenders at the same time.&nbsp;</p> <p>He gives an example of a person taking home &pound;1,500 a month with &pound;600 left after rent and other expenses.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We might then lend them &pound;300 or &pound;350.

Chief executive Flemming Omskov said:</p><p><blockquote><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Binge-eating/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">Binge eating disorder</a> is a condition for which there is no currently approved pharmacologic treatment and yet there is a significant unmet patient need, as was demonstrated with the faster than expected enrolment of participants in our clinical trial programme.<br /><br />Our development of Vyvanse for [the disorder] also aligns well with Shire's growth strategy of developing innovative treatments to address significant unmet patient needs.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>The disorder was officially recognised as a psychiatric disorder in the US in May, affecting 2.8% of adults in their lifetime. Shire added:</p><p><blockquote>[It] is characterized by recurring episodes of binge eating, feeling out of control while binging, and feeling guilt and shame afterward.<br /></blockquote></p><p>With positive updates on other treatments in its pipeline, Shire's shares climbed to a record £28.92 before slipping back to £28.71, still 51p higher on the day so far. Brian White at Shore Capital issued a buy note, saying:</p><p><blockquote>Reassuringly the safety for Vyvanse in these two studies appears to be generally consistent with the known profile established in studies in adults with ADHD.<br /><br />Our Shire model includes risk adjusted forecasts for Vyvanse in binge eating disorder with the first revenues ($50m) expected for 2015, in line with current filing timelines. Although with positive phase 3 data we can foresee the potential for off label prescribing of Vyvanse by physicians in the disorder to begin ahead of regulatory approval.<br /></blockquote></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421690640|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|f7ed4a0f628124d1f1a70fc7295201731fe21269 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's services sector enjoyed its strongest growth since 1997 as new business flowed in at a record pace last month, according to the latest survey to suggest the recovery is strengthening.</p><p>The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK services PMI beat City forecasts to jump to a headline activity reading of 62.5 in October, from 60.6 in September. The forecast was for a slight slowdown to 59.8.</p><p>The index for new work was the highest since records began in 1996 and companies took on new staff at the fastest pace since 1997, according to the survey of a range of businesses in Britain's dominant service sector such as transport, IT and restaurants.</p><p>The report follows upbeat news in recent days on the smaller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/uk-construction-output-property-market\" title=\"\">construction</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/uk-manufacturing-demand-exports-employment-pmi\" title=\"\">manufacturing</a> sectors in sister PMI surveys and is likely to raise expectations that the UK economy can keep up its recent pace of growth.</p><p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit, said the reports suggested growth would accelerate further in the final quarter of this year.</p><p>\"The UK economic recovery moved up a gear again in October, with the PMIs indicating record growth of output and employment,\" he said.</p><p>\"Historical comparisons of the PMI against gross domestic product suggest the latest survey data are consistent with a 1.3% quarterly rate of GDP growth, up sharply from previous quarters.\"</p><p>The latest official data put GDP growth at 0.8% in the third quarter. Some economists have questioned whether that can be matched in the final months of the year, especially given the pressures on consumers from soaring bills and slow pay growth.</p><p>But Markit suggested that pressures on consumers from the tough labour market were easing with the surveys signalling the private sector is creating more than 100,000 jobs per quarter.</p><p>Economists said the recent run of mostly upbeat indicators would likely prompt the Bank of England to raise its outlook for growth when it publishes its latest forecasts next week.</p><p>James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets, said the survey cast doubt over the Bank's outlook for unemployment. Policymakers have said that they will not raise interest rates from their record low at least until the jobless rate falls to 7%, barring various knock-out clauses being triggered.</p><p>\"Taking all of the PMIs together, the composite reading is suggesting that fourth quarter GDP growth could rise as much as 1.5% - equivalent to around 6% annualised growth,\" said Knightley.</p><p>\"It is difficult to believe that any other major economy will come close to that in the fourth quarter so sterling is likely to remain strong, particularly against the euro. It will also inevitably lead to further questions over whether the Bank of England seriously believes that it will be three years before the unemployment rate falls to 7%. We still think interest rates could rise in early 2015.\"</p><p>But Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, questioned how much markets and policymakers should read into Tuesday's report.</p><p>\"The survey feels a bit frothy,\" he said.</p><p>\"No doubt conditions are robust, improving and better than thought at the start of the year. But I am a little wary that the hard data lives up to what the surveys suggest they should be doing.\"</p><p>Experts have also questioned the sustainability of the UK's recovery, arguing the government's much espoused rebalancing towards manufacturing and exports is a long way off.</p><p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said this morning that while it expects growth to pick up from 1.4% this year to 2% in 2014, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/uk-growth-2014-niesr\" title=\"\">the economy will remain over-dependent on squeezed consumers</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421689020|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|557f76c3609f251e3f306be23b0bd17a74455c2b -->",

        "headline":"RSA Insurance shares swept away after recent storms",
        "body":"<p><strong>RSA Insurance</strong> has seen its forecasts blown away by the recent severe weather, leaving its shares floundering.</p><p>In an earlier than expected third quarter update, the insurer said the windstorm across the UK and northern Europe would cost the company £45m to £65m, with the majority of this coming in Scandanavia. Floods in Canada have added to the problems, meaning weather losses in 2013 would be \"materially above planning assumptions\" and return on equity would be below 10%. Chief executive Simon Lee said:</p><p><blockquote>Assuming no further major weather events in 2013, we now expect the impact of adverse weather across the group to be around 1.5% above our assumption.<br /></blockquote></p><p>The news has sent RSA shares 7.2p or 5.5% lower to 121.9p, making it the biggest faller in a downbeat FTSE 100. Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes repeated his sell recommendation, saying:</p><p><blockquote>RSA has brought forward its third quarter management statement to today as a result of the European windstorm losses that are expected to cost around £45-65m. The result of this is likely to result in a 1.5% deterioration on the Combined Operating Ratio which is now expected to be worse than the previous \"95% or better\" stated target. The 2013 expected return on equity is now expected to be below 10%.<br /><br />We have assumed that the impact will be a £55m hit to operating profit in 2013 resulting in us cutting our 2013 forecast earnings per share by 9% to 10.7p per share. We maintain our sell recommendation and 117p target price believing that the current valuation is too great. Whilst one cannot rule out a bid approach [from one of its European competitors] in our view the press rumoured 190p per share bid speculation is pure puff.<br /><br />RSA being a bid target is an old chestnut but 190p per share? In our view there is more chance of Gareth Bale returning to Tottenham in January than there is of a bid of that size.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said the update was disappointing and said that a review of its bodily injury reserves in Ireland was \"rarely a good thing.\" He added:</p><p><blockquote>The shares have performed well in recent weeks but we expect weakness this morning. We would view such weakness as a buying opportunity, highlighting the 30% premium to net asset value and the around 4.8% forward yield.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Oriel Securities said:</p><p><blockquote>RSA released its [update] early in light of adverse weather losses. The announcement was due on Thursday 7 November.<br /><br />Claims from the recent UK and European storms are estimated to £45-65m. The majority of these losses were in Scandinavia. We note Willis recently estimated industry losses of $1.1bn-1.8bn.<br /><br />The group has incurred further losses from previously announced July floods in Toronto estimated to be £37m, further adverse weather conditions in Canada and an uptick in bodily injury claims in Irish motor.<br /><br />Whilst weather conditions have been tough, today's announcement will disappoint the market. The company's longer term strategy of refocusing the UK business and building up its international exposure in Canada and emerging markets, where growth prospects and margins should be higher, may see the shares react positively in the longer term. But the shares look up with events and we struggle to see any near term catalysts to drive a re-rating. Hold.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently down 25.50 points at 6738.12, with the fall accelerating after a stronger than expected UK service sector PMI survey, raising the prospect of an earlier than expected end to QE or even an interest rate rise.</p><p>On a busy day for company results - scheduled or otherwise - <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> has added 15.9p to 503p despite a ninth consecutive quarterly fall in general merchandise, including clothing. But the update was much as expected, so the share reaction has so far been positive.</p><p>Primark owner <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> fell 69p to £21.86 despite reporting higher full year profits, as investors took profits and analysts pointed to a cautious outlook for the coming year.</p><p>Elsewhere <strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> added 68p to £23.78 as full year operating profits rose 29% to £1.95bn despite a dip in revenues. The company also announced a 10% hike in the full year dividend, and said chairman Ian Napier would step down in February.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421684560|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|c4a3cd9fea04440c878446502c5eb7d6622c6483 -->",

The second quarter decline was 1.3%, only a slight slowdown on the first quarter fall of 1.6%, despite the much-vaunted new clothing range.</p><p>This was in the stores for three weeks of the first half and Bolland said it had been \"well received by customers\". He would not be drawn on whether management are expecting third quarter like-for-like clothing sales to grow.</p><p>\"This is the start.

        "body":"<p>The UK is one of best places to live and work, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, although income inequality has risen by more than in other countries since the global financial crisis struck in 2007.</p><p>The Paris-based thinktank has been seeking to measure wellbeing for the 34 nations of the OECD, based on aspects of life such as incomes, education, housing and security. It says the UK ranks above the OECD country average on environmental quality, personal security, jobs and earnings and housing among other measures. It is close to average for work-life balance, but below in education and skills.</p><p>That puts the UK alongside Switzerland, Australia, Nordic European countries, Canada and New Zealand in a clutch of highest-performing countries on the latest work for the OECD's <a href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\" title=\"\">Better Life Index</a>.</p><p>The thinktank's &quot;traffic light&quot; system for how countries perform on various elements ranks the US, Ireland, Germany and France as average. Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Estonia, Hungary, Greece and Chile are among the countries with a relatively low performance.</p><p>Overall, the latest part of the OECD's attempt to find new ways to measure wellbeing beyond simple GDP numbers, paints a picture of substantial pain caused by the financial crisis.</p><p>The average British household was only &quot;modestly&quot; affected, said the OECD, but looking across its club of mostly rich nations many people were blighted by higher unemployment, involuntary part-time work, financial insecurity and poverty.</p><p>&quot;Life satisfaction and confidence in institutions declined substantially in countries severely hit by the crisis, while people reported soaring stress levels,&quot; the How's Life 2013 report says.</p><p>&quot;However, there was little or no change in health outcomes for the population at large.&quot;</p><p>Looking at the UK, the OECD says that over 2007 to 2011 there was a cumulative increase in real household disposable income of around 1%, while in the euro area, income dropped by 2%.</p><p>However, income inequality increased by more than average in the UK over that period.</p><p>The report adds: &quot;In the OECD as a whole, the poor employment situation had a major impact on life satisfaction. This trend is not visible in the United Kingdom where, from 2007 to 2012, the percentage of British people declaring being very satisfied with their lives increased from 63% to 64%.&quot;</p><p>In OECD countries most severly hit by the crisis, people's trust in institutions and in the way democracy works had also declined during the crisis. But the percentage of British people reporting that they trust the government increased from 36% to 47% between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>Looking at gender gaps in OECD countries, the research found British women were still less likely than men to have a paid job or be elected to parliament, and more likely to spend many hours performing household tasks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680273|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|86578cce787f983d56958dc78f28b7d5a03657bf -->",

        "body":"<p>Payday lender Wonga has defended its record ahead of an expected grilling by MPs on Tuesday.</p><p>The company's chief operating officer, Niall Wass, warned against \"jumping to conclusions\" about his company, which has come under fire over the way it treats customers.</p><p>\"I am not sitting here today saying that everything we do is perfect; what we are trying to do is use great technology to give a really fair, transparent service to customers,\" he said in an interview with ITV News at 10.</p><p>Wass challenged the Archbishop of Canterbury,  Justin Welby, who has criticised  payday loan companies, to use Wonga services.</p><p>\"What I am asking him and others to do – go use the service, see if you think it is fair and transparent. Take out £30 for 10 days, pay it back after a week and then judge us by our customers,\" he said.</p><p>His remarks came as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/wonga-film-premieres-london\" title=\"\">Wonga made a film showing the positive experience of the \"silent majority\" of its customers</a>, ahead of a session in the House of Commons when MPs will question payday loan companies.</p><p>Representatives from Wonga, QuickQuid and Mr Lender – three of the biggest payday lending firms – will appear before the Commons business, innovation and skills select committee.</p><p>MPs are expected to follow up on a damning report by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which found \"deep-rooted\" problems in the way payday loans attract and treat customers.</p><p>Lenders have come under intense scrutiny from the Competition Commission and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) since the OFT report was published in September amid reports of widespread impropriety in the sector.</p><p>The committee hearing pre-empts the transferral of regulatory powers in the consumer credit market from the Office of Fair Trading to the FCA on 1 Apri 2014. The new body, which came into being in April this year, has promised to strengthen protection for consumers.</p><p>It has been equipped with the power to impose unlimited fines and compel businesses to give people their money back when they have lost out due to poor treatment.</p><p>New curbs proposed by the body in October will force lenders to place \"risk warnings\" on their promotions and advertising, urging consumers to \"think\" before taking out a payday loan.</p><p>Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which?, will also appear before the committee on Tuesday. He welcomed the FCA's new role but said \"the government and regulators must go further to clean up the wider credit market\".</p><p>Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice Bureau, will also address the committee.</p><p>She said: \"MPs have the opportunity to hammer home some hard truths from their constituencies. The payday loan industry has boomed as people struggle to cope with the rising cost of living, but it has failed to act responsibly.</p><p>\"When I speak to MPs at the select committee, I will tell them how evidence from Citizens Advice finds that people are being given loans without any proper checks to make sure they can afford to pay them back. This sends borrowers into a spiral of debt which is very hard to get out of.</p><p>\"Some payday lenders are misusing continuous payment authorities by emptying their customers' bank accounts without prior warning – leaving them without any money to get to work, pay the bills or buy food.\"</p><p>Payday lenders have also been criticised for aggressive advertising campaigns that reportedly mislead potential consumers. In July, the FCA's chief executive, Martin Wheatley, indicated that offending firms could face a complete advertising ban.</p><p>He said previously: \"Clearly that is an option that could be considered if it was felt that the way that advertising was being used couldn't be dealt with through any other measures short of that.\"</p><p>The MPs' intervention follows research by a government-backed body that found more than 1 million people plan to take out a payday loan to cover the cost of Christmas.</p><p>The Money Advice Service (MAS) said one in 40 (2.44%) people surveyed for its research, equating to around 1.2 million across the UK, is thinking about turning to a payday lender to fund their seasonal spending.</p><p>One-third (32%) of the 2,000 consumers questioned also said they will increase their credit card debts to pay for the festivities, while one in  11 (9%) people said they are still paying off what they owe from last Christmas.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680058|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|d90ccc2894a156b8b73afb22b5c8fdaf8e06beec -->",

        "body":"<p>UK retailers are looking forward to a jump in online shopping this Christmas as they battle for the custom of hard-pressed shoppers with deals and express delivery offers.</p><p>Online retail revenues will be up sharply on last Christmas and December takings will break though the £10bn barrier for the first time, according to industry group IMRG and consultants Capgemini.</p><p>A separate report from the British Retail Consortium suggests online trade rose to a record portion of all sales last month. The BRC's monthly sales monitor with consultants KPMG said volumes were up 0.8% on a like-for-like basis from October 2012 as unseasonably warm weather saw clothing sales fall but gadgets, games and home accessories all enjoyed growth. That compared with an annual fall of 0.1% in October 2012.</p><p>Of last month's sales, 18.3% were online, the highest proportion since the BRC's records on internet shopping volumes began two years ago.</p><p>The BRC's director general, Helen Dickinson, said: \"It's expected that many of us will 'click into Christmas' more than ever before this year, and retailers have invested significantly in user-friendly websites, fast deliveries and convenient ways of buying in-store, at home or on the move.\"</p><p>The report from IMRG and Capgemini pointed to conversion rates – those people who buy online after browsing – reaching a five-year high of 5% in the run-up to this Christmas.</p><p>It forecast consumer spending with online retailers will reach £10.8bn in December.</p><p>The busiest day overall in terms of sales volume will be Monday 2 December although the peak day does vary by retailer, the report added. Department store chain John Lewis predicts the busiest day in the run-up to Christmas will be 'Cyber Sunday', 1 December, when shoppers, armed with one of the final pay packets of the year, will buy most of their presents.</p><p>Tina Spooner, chief information officer at IMRG, said the latest signals on the rising conversion rate were promising for the industry.</p><p>\"For the first time in three years we expect annual e-retail growth to exceed the level recorded in the previous year, with 2013 sales on target to achieve 15% growth on last year,\" she said.</p><p>\"Already we are seeing a number of retailers ramping up their online offering in the run-up to Christmas. Click and collect, next-day delivery and even one-hour delivery slots are just a few of the options on offer to attract the lucrative festive shopper at this highly competitive time of year.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421635432|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|c4cc3108d7ea471108b151b8391500a08270dcb2 -->",

        "headline":"Construction and retail – contrasting perspectives on UK economic recovery",
        "body":"<p>Construction and retailing offer contrasting perspectives on Britain's economic recovery. On the UK's building sites, things are looking up . The monthly construction industry health check from CIPS/Markit showed jobs growth and output rising at their fastest for six years. Although that may be more a reflection of the deep hole the sector plunged into during the recession, sentiment has certainly improved. The Government's Help to Buy scheme has boosted house building, but Monday's report suggests demand for commercial property is also on the up.</p><p>Tuesday's report from the British Retailers Consortium is more mixed. After a strong summer, spending growth in the high street has cooled in the last couple of months. That could be because sales of new winter fashions have been hit by unseasonally warm weather, or it could be that consumers are saving up for a big splurge at Christmas. It could be that individuals are finding it hard to make the sums add up during a prolonged period when prices have been rising more quickly than wages. In all probability, the cautious mood is a combination of all three.</p><p>Rising consumer spending is the reason economic activity picked up in the second and third quarters of the year. There was little boost from the other components of growth -– investment, exports and the state – so the expansion was the result of higher household spending. How is this possible when real earnings are falling? In part, spending has been encouraged by rising employment. In part, it has been aided by stronger consumer confidence, which has led to people running down the precautionary savings they built up when they were more pessimistic about the future.</p><p>Clearly, consumers will be unable to continue dipping into their savings to fund their spending for ever. That's why forecasting groups such as the National Institute for Economic Research have only modest expectations for growth in 2014: a 2% increase in GDP following 1.4% in 2013. NIESR sees little prospect of stronger investment kicking in, and with the prospects for exporters decidedly mixed that means consumers will again bear the strain.</p><p>Even so, the NIESR forecast looks too low. There will be some recovery in investment in response to stronger consumer spending. More significantly, perhaps, the housing market now has real momentum and that will lead to some further drop in the savings ratio to compensate for squeezed incomes.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421650083|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|7357e6d468d940461b4539063d1e4a1046c3d18c -->",

        "headline":"UK growth to pick up in 2014 – NIESR",
        "body":"<p>UK growth will pick up next year but the economy will remain over-dependent on squeezed consumers, a leading thinktank has warned.</p><p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) forecasts growth will come in at 1.4% this year and quicken to 2% next year. Both those forecasts are up by 0.2 percentage points since NIESR's last outlook was published in August.</p><p>The group attributed the upgrade to a better out-turn for the economy at the start of this year and in the third quarter, when official data put growth at a quarterly 0.8%. The thinktank's 2% growth forecast for next year is ahead of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/08/imf-raises-uk-growth-forecasts-economy\" title=\"\">1.9% from the International Monetary Fund</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/20/office-budget-responsibility-uk-growth\" title=\"\">1.8% predicted in March</a> by the the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury's independent forecaster. But NIESR argued growth was not built on solid foundations.</p><p>\"After two years of stagnation, economic growth has returned, underpinned by an increase in consumer spending,\" the thinktank said.</p><p>\"Consumer spending growth is necessary for an economic recovery in the UK, but a consumer-driven recovery will not be 'balanced', let alone one reflecting the required long-term 'rebalancing' towards an economy with greater net national saving.\"</p><p>While the Treasury is likely to welcome a forecast of accelerating growth, the report comes as a blow to chancellor George Osborne's push for the economy to wean itself off dependency on consumer spending. NIESR predicts the UK will have to wait until 2016 to see a positive contribution to growth from net trade.</p><p>NIESR's view is that consumers will drive growth by running down their savings as they continue to suffer from falling real wages. Because pay growth has failed to keep pace with living costs, households have been left with dwindling disposable incomes. Simon Kirby, author of NIESR's UK outlook, expects more of the same next year.</p><p>Real wages will not start growing again until 2015, he said. Even then, growth will be \"gradual\" and wages will only be rising when taken as an average across earners, meaning many will wait even longer to see their real pay grow again.</p><p>\"It's going to take a number of years for real consumer wages to just get back to levels seen before 2008,\" he said.</p><p>NIESR predicts real wages will only be back to their pre-recession peak in 2019 – a year after per capita GDP recovers its pre-crisis peak. It expects unemployment to fall only slowly from 7.7% now to 7.4% by the middle of next year.</p><p>The Bank of England has said under its forward guidance scheme that it will not consider raising interest rates until unemployment drops to at least 7% – unless one of various knock-out clauses are triggered, such as an excessive outlook for inflation. NIESR does not see 7% being reached until 2016 but it believes the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) will raise rates in the second half of 2015, possibly using the financial stability knockout as justification.</p><p>\"There has been little notice taken of the MPC's forward guidance to date … To some extent we are ignoring forward guidance as well,\" said Kirby.</p><p>Those in financial markets that bet that the Bank will raise rates sooner than it has signalled took further support from a stronger-than-expected report on the construction sector.</p><p>Robust business for housebuilders against the backdrop of rising housing market activity helped the overall construction sector enjoy its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/uk-construction-output-property-market\" title=\"\">strongest growth for six years</a>, according to the Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI survey.</p><p>Civil engineering and commercial projects also enjoyed a boost in October helping the report's output measure rise to 59.4 from 58.9 in September, above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for the sixth straight month. It was the highest reading since September 2007 and beat the forecast of 58.9 in a Reuters poll of economists.</p><p>A bright UK economic outlook helped boost output and client spending, construction companies said in the survey. They took on workers at the fastest pace for six years as a majority expected output to continue rising over the year ahead.</p><p>The retail industry had a more challenging October, according to the latest British Retail Consortium report. Its monthly sales monitor with consultants KPMG said volumes were up 0.8% on a like-for-like basis from October 2012 as unseasonably warm weather saw clothing sales fall but gadgets, games and home accessories all enjoyed growth. That compared with an annual fall of 0.1% in October 2012. On a less volatile rolling three-month basis, sales growth slowed to 1.0% in August to October, the weakest pace since the start of the summer.</p><p>David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG said: \"October was another difficult month for retailers reminding us that recovery is a slow, relentless slog. Whilst the summer months hinted at increased consumer confidence, retailers will struggle to maintain a sustained sales recovery until wage growth outpaces price inflation. While confidence may lead consumers to browse, it's cash that's needed in the tills.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421646400|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|77fe6a53535a2d2dd482e1228dec5e6644d8b058 -->",

        "headline":"Twitter claims $13.6bn market valuation as tech rivals take aim",
        "body":"<p>Twitter, after canvassing professional investors for a week on how much they would be willing to pay for its shares, raised the asking price of its stock by 25% on Monday.</p> <p>The company said it would value its IPO at between $23 and $25 a share, up from the&nbsp;$17 to $20 range, indicating that it was a popular potential investment. Traditionally, however, the banks advising companies on their public debuts start out with a modest asking price, in the hopes that investors will prove willing to pay more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter also stopped selling its shares a day early, according to a news report by Reuters. It's common for companies to keep order books open for investors until the day before the IPO, but Twitter plans to close the books on Tuesday at noon, Reuters said. In the traditional signals of Wall Street, that move could be interpreted in two ways: it could indicate either high demand for the shares or that investors are tapped out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter, which plans to list its shares for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, can now claim a market value of $13.6bn before its shares have even started trading. The company could raise as much as $1.4bn in the offering.&nbsp;</p> <p>MKM Partners, a research firm for professional investors, said Twitter will be in the competitive \"elite\" of tech companies by its market value.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"We look at a [comparison] group including Facebook, LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Yelp and Zillow,\" MKM analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a client note late last week. \"These companies are regarded as 'category killers', each with very strong operating momentum, disruptive characteristics and open-ended opportunities.\"</p> <p>That doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing ahead, however. Twitter is facing business challenges from rivals as well as skepticism from investors burned by the Facebook IPO.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter is not seen as a good investment by nearly half of active investors, according to<a href=\"http://marketingland.com/poll-public-skeptical-about-twitter-ipo-63942\"> a new CNBC-AP poll out Monday</a>.</p> <p>\"That sentiment is stronger from higher-income respondents; some 56% of those with incomes of $75,000 a year have doubts about its investment prospects,\" <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101165620\">CNBC wrote</a>.</p> <p>In addition, as Twitter's profile rises, rivals are taking aim at its business prospects. \"We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow,\" the company said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter revealed on Monday, for instance, that <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312513424297/d564001dfwp.htm\">tech giant IBM has claimed that Twitter has violated three of its patents</a>. The patents involve the presentation of advertising and the process of searching for user contacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>By striking at Twitter's advertising plans, IBM is striking at the company's heart. Twitter gained&nbsp;85% of its revenue from advertising in 2012, and an even higher percentage &ndash; 89% &ndash; in the first nine months of this year. \"We generate substantially all of our advertising revenue through the sale of our three promoted products: promoted Tweets, promoted accounts and promoted trends.\"</p> <p>Twitter said IBM was not suing, however, and only inviting a negotiation. In its public filing, Twitter said \"we believe we have meritorious defenses,\" although it also said \"there can be no assurance that we will be successful\" in resolving the dispute.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421639031|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d4fda2e255281427f59be713aa75341c2971fe92 -->",

        "headline":"SAC Capital agrees to plead guilty to insider trading charges",
        "body":"<p>SAC Capital has become the first hedge fund to plead guilty to insider trading after an extensive six-year dragnet by government regulators, who issued a warning to future \"Gordon Gekkos\" and imposed fines that totalled $1.8bn.</p> <p>\"No institution should rest in the belief that is too big to jail,\" said Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York. \"That is a moral hazard.\"</p> <p>April Brooks, who heads the New York field office of the FBI, said the proposed settlement should act as a warning to \"those who venerate Gordon Gekko\", referring to the Machiavellian capitalist in the 1987 movie Wall Street who popularized the phrase \"greed is good\".&nbsp;</p> <p>SAC has agreed to a passel of penalties, which follow a July indictment by Bharara's office. It must pay a&nbsp;$900m fine and forfeit another $900m to the federal government, though $616m that SAC companies have already agreed to pay to settle parallel actions by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be deducted from the $1.8bn.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most of the money will come from founder&nbsp;Steven A Cohen rather than outside investors. Bharara said the fine would not be tax-deductible.</p> <p>Anyone working at SAC currently will also have to face obstacles to their futures. No one at the firm, even those who co-operated, will have immunity from further prosecution, Bharara said.</p> <p>SAC also agreed to accept a five-year probation period &ndash; in which any employee seeking to start a new investing business would require government permission &ndash; and agreed to shut down its advisory business, which accepts money from outside investors.&nbsp;</p> <p>The agreement still has to be approved by a judge, officials said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The move isolates SAC, which once reigned at the center of the hedge-fund world and whose founder was listed by Forbes as being worth $8.8bn. \"SAC will no longer be able to invest anyone's money but their own,\" said Brooks.</p> <p>Brooks quoted the July indictment, which called the insider trading at SAC \"substantial, pervasive and on a scale without known precedent\", adding that \"it was nothing short of institutional failure\".&nbsp;</p> <p>She also indicated that government regulators, including the Department of Justice, FBI and the SEC, plan to use SAC as a lesson to other fund managers. Brooks said officials will \"relentlessly pursue\" insider traders. \"How your employees make their money is just as important as how much they make,\" she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a statement, FBI assistant director George Venizelos said SAC Capital's plea demonstrates \"that cheating and breaking the law were not only permitted but allowed to persist\".</p> <p>In the July indictment, prosecutors said evidence against SAC was \"voluminous\" and included electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prosecutors said a work culture at SAC permitted, if not encouraged, insider trading. Authorities alleged that SAC Capital earned hundreds of millions of dollars illegally from 1999 to 2010 as its portfolio managers and analysts traded on inside information from at least 20 public companies. Bharara in July said SAC Capital \"trafficked in inside information on a scale without any known precedent in the history of hedge funds&rdquo;.</p> <p>Of the roughly $15bn in assets that SAC managed as of earlier this year, about half belonged to Cohen and his employees. The rest was client money.</p> <p>Cohen was not named as a defendant in the case. He was repeatedly referenced in court papers at the \"SACowner\" who \"enabled and promoted\" insider trading practices.</p> <p>In a separate case, the SEC is pursuing Cohen, SAC's founder, in an attempt to ban him from the securities industry for failing to prevent insider trading at the company, which he founded in 1992. Cohen has disputed the SEC's allegations. That case remains unresolved.</p> <p>As part of the deal announced Monday, prosecutors said they will not assert claims for financial recovery against any present owner or shareholder of the SAC defendants for insider trading on behalf of the SAC up to 21 December last year, except for criminal fines or forfeiture claims related to insider trading profits or avoided losses. The agreement also reserved the right of prosecutors to charge others criminally.</p> <p>Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business who studies corporate reputation, said the settlement, despite its size and impact, would likely not serve as a deterrent to others who might be pondering insider trading.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Think about how many people didn't get fined today that should have,\" Argenti said. \"Think about how many companies have done things like this before, over a long period of time. When I track how people think of reputation in the financial sector and business, it's never been worse. Trust in business is at an all-time low. People look at this and say, 'Look at this. They made tons of money and now we know how.'\"</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421649512|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|7b5e1ec74dc246c57ee8d5d90ea770f9d47bcad6 -->",

        "headline":"BlackBerry fires CEO Thorsten Heins as $4.7bn Fairfax rescue bid collapses",
        "body":"<p>Struggling smartphone maker BlackBerry has fired its chief executive and abandoned a $4.7bn (£3bn) rescue bid from its largest shareholder as it turned to a $1bn fundraising plan in a battle to stay afloat.</p><p>Thorsten Heins, brought in to run the company in January 2012, will leave with a $22m payoff, and be replaced by John Chen, a seasoned technology industry executive. The surprise move by BlackBerry indicates that it has failed to find a buyer for the company after a six week process in which it has discussed deals with industry powerhouses including Google, Cisco and Facebook.</p><p>The company said it will raise $1bn in convertible bonds instead of pursuing a deal with Fairfax Financial, its 10% shareholder. Fairfax, whose ability to raise the financing for its $4.7bn bid was widely questioned, has pledged to buy $250m worth of the bonds.</p><p>The company, which has endured a rapid fall from grace, did not say why it was trying to raise the extra money amid predictions that it will burn through its $2bn cash pile within 18 months. Its last quarterly results showed revenues and handset sales plunging and it is trying to cut costs by firing almost a quarter of its staff. BlackBerry controlled close to 50% of the handset market in the US in 2009 but its share now stands at less than 3% after it buckled under competition from Apple and Samsung.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421643557'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383586583276/BlackBerry_Sales_WEB.png' alt='BlackBerry sales' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>BlackBerry handset sales: units shipped per year</figcaption></figure><p>\"This does look like panic stations,\" said Neil Mawston, executive director at the research company Strategy Analytics. \"The trouble is that when a company's in that downward spiral, nobody wants to catch a falling knife – so operators don't want to work with them, and retailers don't want the stock.\"</p><p>BlackBerry's chairwoman, Barbara Stymiest, thanked Heins for his \"significant accomplishments\" at the company he joined in 2007. His interim replacement Chen is an adviser to Silver Lake, the private equity group that played a leading role in the recent buyout of Dell. In an interview with Reuters, Chen said he had no plans to shut down the company's handset business, thought to be a significant loss maker.</p><p>\"I know we have enough ingredients to build a long-term sustainable business. I have done this before and seen the same movie before,\" he said. \"BlackBerry is an iconic brand with enormous potential – but it's going to take time, discipline and tough decisions to reclaim our success.\"</p><p>BlackBerry shares plunged by 13% to $6.79, from $7.70 before the market opened, far below the $9 per share that Fairfax was attempting to offer ahead of Monday's bid deadline.</p><p>There are growing expectations that the handset business will be severely cut back after market failure of the new BB10 handsets. \"BlackBerry needs to use the new cash infusion to change its market approach [to one] where saving the devices business is not the main priority,\" said Carolina Milanesi of the research group Gartner, which recently advised business clients using BlackBerry to examine alternatives. The new unsecured funding will be in the form of debentures, convertible into BlackBerry shares priced at $10, a premium of 28.7% to Friday's closing price, within seven years.</p><p>But analysts remained sceptical about the future of the firm formerly known as Research in Motion. \"If you wouldn't lend money to buy BlackBerry, why would you lend money to BlackBerry?\" queried Benedict Evans, of Enders Analysis.</p><p>BlackBerry was believed to have held talks with a number of companies while Fairfax said it was working on its bid. The bid was announced on 23 September, just after the company had announced disastrous results with a second quarter loss of $965m – largely due to a $934m writeoff on unsold Z10 handsets – on revenues of just $1.6bn.</p><p>Among the companies which BlackBerry is understood to have spoken to about a buyout are Google, Cisco, SAP and China's Lenovo. But no bids materialised to challenge the putative one from Fairfax – that itself failed to materialise.</p><p>\"Looks like nobody was interested in buying BlackBerry outright,\" commented Avi Greengart, research director at Current Analytics. \"The announcement does not even hint at what BlackBerry does next.\"</p><p>Having concluded a strategic review with Monday's short statement, BlackBerry must now rely on the $1bn fundraising and its own finances, having seen former arch-rival Nokia capitulate this year with the sale of its handset business to Microsoft. BlackBerry says it has taken measures to cut costs – but equally could see increasing pressure on margins if its business continues to decline.</p><p>The company's cash position could also be hit if suppliers begin demanding payments on shorter terms, which would mean paying cash for components before they can be sold as finished items. One major supplier, Jabil, warned in September that it might stop building parts for the company, which could completely kill off the handset business.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421642880|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|9d20449233f3e022cfd8b2649a5e032b1e868bd4 -->",

        "headline":"HSBC drawn into global currency market investigations",
        "body":"<p>HSBC has become the latest bank to admit it is co-operating with the global investigation into possible manipulation of the £3tn-a-day currency markets.</p><p>The admission came on Monday as the UK's biggest bank revealed it had more than doubled the number of staff dealing with legal and regulatory issues to 4,700.</p><p>Reporting a 30% rise in profits to $4.5bn (£2.8bn) in the third quarter, the bank also disclosed it was reviewing sales to 200,000 customers in the UK who bought wealth management products after 2008. It also said it needed to increase its provisions against possible regulatory action by US authorities over US residents with accounts at its Swiss banking operations.</p><p>Stuart Gulliver, HSBC's chief executive, said the bank had increased the number of staff working on regulatory issues from 2,000 at the start of 2011, hiring 1,600 more compliance staff since the end of December alone to bring the total to 4,700. Gulliver has set the bank on a track to cut costs, making $4.5bn of savings since 2011 – some of which has now been ploughed into expanding the bank's compliance functions.</p><p>HSBC's shares were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100 in early trading, gaining 2% to 700p even though there was some anxiety that the bank might miss its own targets for returns to shareholders. Its upbeat outlook statement – pointing to better growth in China and the UK – helped bolster sentiment.</p><p>Hit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-bank-us-money-laundering\" title=\"\">last year by a record £1.2bn fine for breaching money laundering laws in the US</a> and allowing drug traffickers to move money around the financial system, HSBC has been forced to take a series of steps to increase its compliance and legal functions. Other banks have been doing the same – America's biggest bank, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/17/jpmorgan-banking\" title=\"\">JP Morgan, has hired 3,000 compliance staff this year.</a> In the third quarter, HSBC set aside an additional $514m for the cost of compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and $132m for businesses mis-sold interest rate products.</p><p>Gulliver said a new investigation into the way its wealth management division had sold products had led to a $149m provision after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) conducted a mystery shopping exercise into its sales practices. The bank had to appoint Grant Thornton as a \"skilled person\" under the instruction of the regulators to review its sales practices and now expects to pay out up to $30m in compensation, the rest of the $149m being administrative costs.</p><p>Gulliver said the bank had not had to suspend anyone in connection with the investigation into the possible manipulation of a foreign exchange benchmark that has been under way around the globe for the past few weeks. The FCA is among a number of regulators known to be looking at the way a price for currencies is set during a 60-second trading window. The \"names we've been given\" no longer worked at the bank, Gulliver said.</p><p>HSBC is adding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/regulators-contact-banks-currency-manipulation\" title=\"\">its name to the growing list of banks admitting to co-operation with the regulators</a>, including Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, UBS, JP Morgan and Citigroup. Gulliver would not deviate from a statement issued by the bank. \"The Financial Conduct Authority is conducting investigations alongside several other agencies in various countries into a number of firms, including HSBC, relating to trading on the foreign exchange market. We are co-operating with the investigations, which are at an early stage.\"</p><p>The bank said there was uncertainty about the amount of capital it might need to hold because of changes being discussed with regulators. Gulliver gave few clues as to how the bank would deal with the cap on bonuses being imposed by the EU after the bank had warned in the summer it was considering increasing salaries.</p><p>Gulliver was upbeat about the UK and Hong Kong, and appeared to express commitment to the UK, where the bank has been headquartered since taking over Midland Bank in the mid-1990s.</p><p>\"Our home markets of the UK and Hong Kong contributed more than half of the group's underlying profit before tax. Hong Kong performed well in the quarter, reflecting broad-based revenue growth. Hong Kong continues to benefit from its close economic relationship with mainland China. We remain well positioned to capitalise on improving economic conditions in these markets,\" Gulliver said.</p><p>He was positive about China and also the UK, which he said \"should see positive growth and outperform the eurozone\". But he warned that economic growth in Latin America would remain slow, although the Mexican economy should strengthen in 2014.</p><p>The bank's forecasts for global growth remain constant at 2.0% in 2013 and 2.6% in 2014.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421610350|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|6a99c21b1674cac49afb517a4eab5cbc935733e3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sony's credit rating could be cut to junk, ratings agency Moody's warned Friday, after the electronics giant issued a profits warning amid faltering sales.</p><p>Moody's said it had placed Sony's Baa3 long-term senior unsecured bond rating on review for a downgrade. Baa3 is Moody's lowest investment-grade rating.</p><p>On Friday Sony's shares dropped 11% in Tokyo after the company slashed its earnings forecast for the year by 40% blaming tepid demand for televisions, digital camcorders, cameras, personal computers and box office flops from its film division.</p><p>The move comes ahead of the all important Christmas shopping season and just weeks before the release of Sony's latest game console, the PlayStation 4. In August the company said it had already received over 1m pre-orders for the new consoles. The company expects to sell 5m PS4's between the launch date and the end of the Japanese fiscal year in March.</p><p>\"Conditions are harsher than what we had anticipated,\" Sony chief financial officer Masaru Kato told reporters on Thursday. Sony posted a net loss of 19.3 billion yen ($196.65m) for its second quarter. </p><p>The news marked a dramatic reversal for Sony which posted its first full-year profit in five years in May and has seen its share price soar. This quarter, Sony's TV operation dropped from a 5.2 billion yen ($53m) operating profit to a 9.3 billion yen ($94m) loss.</p><p>\"The rating actions reflect the slow progress being made in improving overall profitability,'' Moody's said in its statement. \"Weak earnings across the majority of reporting units suggests the potential for a much longer period of restructuring and financial weakness than previously expected.\"</p><p>Sony rival Panasonic has been shifting its focus to business and industrial products as sales of consumer electronics have been hit by cheaper Asian rivals. The company has moved into solar panel manufacturing and recently struck a deal to supply electronics to electric car manufacturer Tesla. Kazuo Hirai, Sony's chief executive, has said he intends to focus the company on gaming, imaging technology and mobile devices.</p><p>Its latest results were also hampered by flops at the box office. Both of Sony's film studio's big-budget tentpole movies released in the quarter, After Earth, with Will Smith, and White House Down, with Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx, attracted lackluster attention. Hedge fund billionaire Daniel Loeb has been pushing for Sony to spin off its entertainment assets.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421465673|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|cadfbe02826c3a787ef6f4b0e440dafc784613ae -->",
