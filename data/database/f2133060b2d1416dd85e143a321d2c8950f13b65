        "body":"<p>It has been reported that only a small proportion of funds raised during <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/pink\">\"A Crucial Catch\", the league's month-long campaign</a> to support breast cancer research through the sale of pink merchandise and memorabilia, will actually go to help breast cancer research. </p><p>The NFL's campaign, which aims to increase awareness of the need for annual breast cancer screenings \"especially for women who are 40 or older\", runs throughout October and sees many players wearing items of pink equipment during games. All such apparel and a number of other items, including pink game balls, will later be auctioned in aid of the American Cancer Society's Community Health Advocates National Grants for Empowerment (CHANGE) programme. The league also gives fans the chance to donate $10 to the American Cancer Society, by sending a special \"NFLPINK\" text message.</p><p>However, citing data obtained from the NFL, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/388747414066450432\">Darren Rovell of ESPN tweeted</a>: \"On pink gear, the NFL says it takes a 25% royalty from the wholesale price (1/2 retail), donates 90% of royalty to American Cancer Society.\"</p><p>At <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/small-amount-of-money-from-pink-nfl-merchandise-goes-to-breast-cancer-research-2013-10\">Business Insider</a>, Cork Gaines wrote: \"In other words, for every $100 in pink merchandise sold, $12.50 goes to the NFL. Of that, $11.25 goes to the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the NFL keeps the rest.\" Gaines added: \"The remaining money is then divided up by the company that makes the merchandise (37.5%) and the company that sells the merchandise (50.0%), which is often the NFL and the individual teams.\"</p><p>Most pink NFL merchandise is sold through the NFL's online store, making the NFL the company which sells the merchandise and thus receives 50% of the money received.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420276928'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382023835248/A-Pittsburgh-Steelers-fan-001.jpg' alt='A Pittsburgh Steelers fan supports Breast Cancer Awareness Month' width='220' height='372' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A Steelers fan supports Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

This weekend, <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000264728/article/oregons-pink-helmets-being-used-to-raise-money-for-charity\">the University of Oregon Ducks will wear pink helmets for their game against Washington State</a>. They will also wear pink cleats, socks and gloves, in an effort to raise money for the Kay Yow Cancer Fund, which is named for a North Carolina State women's basketball coach who died from the disease in 2009. Twenty-five of the pink helmets will be auctioned.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420270443|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|eb924297ff9b2d2a53b92ad1ed052cab8ff56637 -->",

        "headline":"Kansas City Chiefs are 6-0, but their luck is about to run out",
        "body":"<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are the biggest (positive) surprise of this still (relatively) young NFL season. Led by new head coach Andy Reid, the Arrowhead natives are 6-0 and have only won one game by less than two scores. They are almost certainly heading towards the playoffs on the strength of their defense. Yet, the Chiefs may end up packing their bags earlier than you might think. </p><p>Why?</p><h2>1. The Chiefs offense is a big ball of meh</h2><p>No team is going to be the best in every facet of the game. The Broncos defense leaves much to be desired. Yet, the Chiefs offense is really something else, which could come back to haunt them. </p><p>Quarterback Alex Smith ranks 22nd in the league for <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/passing/sort/quarterbackRating\">passer rating</a>. He is averaging 6.16 yards per attempt, which is worst in the league for starting quarterbacks. He's tied for eighth for the most sacks. </p><p>Running back Jamaal Charles is averaging only 4.2 yards <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/rushing/sort/yardsPerRushAttempt\">per rushing attempt</a>–good enough for only 20th in the league. Advanced NFL Stats says that Charles is 60th for all running backs in win probability added for every play he's directly involved in. </p><p>The Chiefs simply have no good or great receivers statistically speaking. The top pass catcher for the Chiefs, Donnie Avery, ranks 51st in <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/receiving/sort/receivingYards/qualified/false\">receiving yards</a> with only 310. No Chiefs receiver has more than two touchdown receptions. </p><p>Overall, Advanced NFL Stats rates the Chiefs offense as 30th in <a href=\"http://www.advancednflstats.com/2013/10/team-efficiency-rankings-week-6.html\">offensive efficiency</a>. </p><h2>2. The Chiefs haven't been playing tough opponents</h2><p>This is actually true of the Broncos and Seahawks as well, but look at who the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs have played</a>. They beat the Giants and Jaguars, who are terrible. The took down the Cowboys, Eagles, Raiders, and Titans, who are at best .500 teams. The only one of these going down in the record books is the Jaguars – and that is for awfulness. </p><p>Taking a more advanced statistical look, we can look at Football Outsiders' Defense-adjusted Over Average (DVOA). This breaks down every NFL play and compares teams against a league baseline average. By this measure, the Chiefs have the 31st <a href=\"http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff\">hardest schedule to this point</a>. </p><p>If they had a more even schedule, they'd probably have at least one loss already.</p><h2>3. The Chiefs will start playing tough opponents </h2><p>DVOA suggests that the Chiefs' luck may run out. They are expected to have the seventh most difficult schedule the rest of the season. They have to play the Broncos (more on that below) and a decent Chargers team twice, the Colts, and an underrated Bills team that plays pretty well at home. </p><p>The chance that the Chiefs can stay near perfect is pretty slim. Football Outsiders has them going only 6-4 the rest of the season. </p><h2>4. The Broncos and homefield</h2><p>There's room for more than one great team in the NFL. The problem is there really isn't room for two great teams in the same division. The Chiefs and Broncos both play in the AFC West. The Broncos, by most measures, including <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/standings\">point differential</a> and advanced stat team efficiency ratings from both <a href=\"http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff\">Football Outsiders</a> and <a href=\"http://www.advancednflstats.com/2013/10/team-efficiency-rankings-week-6.html\">Advanced NFL Stats</a>, look like the better team. </p><p>That's an issue for Chiefs, because they have to play the Broncos twice. The Broncos also have the easier remaining schedule. That would suggest that the Broncos are more likely to end up with the better record. </p><p>Thus, the Chiefs are probably going to end up with the fifth spot in the AFC's playoff brackets. That means they'll have to win three times on the road to make the Super Bowl. That's not impossible, though the odds are against it. </p><p>The home team has won a little more than <a href=\"http://www.fieldgulls.com/2013/1/4/3780668/nfl-playoffs-seahawks-vs-redskins-homefield-advantage\">60% of its games in the playoffs</a> since 2002. Three teams have won three road games to win the Super Bowl <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/visuals/post/_/id/10921/graphic-which-nfl-playoff-seeds-succeed\">over the past decade and none before that</a>. This suggests that the homefield advantage may be waning, but it still exists. </p><p>You can add <a href=\"http://www.twominutewarning.com/hfa.htm\">2-3 points to the home team's margin</a> than what would you expect on a neutral field. In a league where games are often won by a few points, this can make all the difference in the world. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Chiefs are a good football team. I'm not sure, however, they are good as their 6-0 record indicates. Their offense and strength of opponent has been weak. A tougher upcoming schedule and the looming Broncos in the same division argues for a team that will have a more difficult time moving forward.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420264962|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|6ac86a2031a509cb6c555b3eef38734ef59ed499 -->",

        "headline":"Wales regions in limbo and pondering future without prime assets",
        "body":"<p>These may be taxing times for the Welsh regions, struggling to keep their heads above water despite liquidity problems, but there could be no excuses for the abject display of Cardiff Blues in the opening half at Exeter on Sunday, opponents with considerably less Heineken Cup experience who are in the middle tier of the Premiership.</p><p>The regions are concerned, with the future of European club rugby still to be settled, that they will lack the means to make realistic offers to players who are out of contract at the end of the season, including Leigh Halfpenny, Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Jonathan Davies.</p><p>They will need to tie them down before the end of the year, when they will be able to speak to potential new employers, but with the market value of those who were an integral part of the Lions' success in Australia in the summer increasing by at least 50%, they need an increase in revenue just to stand still: if there is no Heineken Cup, or a replacement, they will be some £1.5m worse off each.</p><p>The regions had hoped to resolve the contract issues before the start of next month's internationals: Warburton and Davies have publicly said that they want to stay with the Blues and the Scarlets respectively, but they are in limbo, not far from the point when they will have to look at other options.</p><p>The Blues fielded 13 internationals, five of whom were Lions, at Sandy Park but they looked a team of novices, 41–3 down before they found it in them to respond. They showed no spirit in adversity and neither, more surprisingly, did Ospreys at home to Leinster on Saturday night.</p><p>Alex Cuthbert, the Wales and Lions wing, scored two tries for the Blues and was their one player who rose above the mess, wearing such a look of disbelief in the first-half that if it as if he were asking himself why he last season signed a three-year contract extension with the region.</p><p>Similarly the Ospreys captain, Alun Wyn Jones, had to suppress his anger when discussing the defeat to Leinster a few minutes after the final whistle.  Jones has played for Ospreys all his senior career and the region regards him as the central figure in the squad, someone worth even as much off the field as he is on it, but whereas his heart will tell him to sign a new deal, once figures are attached  his head may tell him that, at the age of 28, it may be time to leave.</p><p>While the Blues had no excuses for their abject start against Exeter, Ospreys had a bench made up largely of emerging players against Leinster, a consequence of injuries and a budget that is lower than their French, English and Irish rivals. They had no one to turn a game that was ebbing from them and the fear of all four regions is that, if there is a European settlement, they will play no part in it and could end up poorer  in relative, if not real, terms.</p><p>The Welsh Rugby Union, which in recent years has been more of a rival than a support to its regions, has said it alone will be involved in whatever form negotiations take, with European Rugby Cup Ltd's survival prospects looking more remote by the day. The regions will remain on the outside.</p><p>The WRU's policy has been to find an ERC solution, that is to perpetuate the Heineken Cup, but the obduracy of the French and English clubs, who are adamant they will not after this season play in a tournament organised by ERC - and unlike previous disputes over Europe, in 1998 and 2006–07, they have not gone into the conference room naked, having armed themselves with what they describe as a lucrative television deal - has prompted it to consider an alternative.</p><p>Premiership Rugby has not specified exactly how much its BT television deal would add to the £44m shared by the six nations from the Heineken Cup. A figure of £70m has been quoted, but that would leave the four Welsh regions barely better off if the English and French clubs' demand for a three-way split between the leagues that feed into the European tournaments is accepted.</p><p>Currently, the four RaboDirect Pro 12 unions have 52% of the pot with the English and French clubs each banking 24%. If the pot increased to £70m and was divided three ways, the Rabo nations would have £23.33m, barely more than the £23m they had last season. It is understood that there is a proposal that 15% of the total should be apportioned on a merit basis: if that happened, the £70m would shrivel to less than £60m, meaning the basic sum for all three leagues would be less than £20m.</p><p>The Rabo unions share their money disproportionately, with Italy and Scotland receiving more per team than Ireland and Wales. The ideal for the four regions would be a division by 12, the number of teams in the Pro 12, which would give them a similar increase to the English and French clubs.</p><p>They will have no say in the carve-up, being reliant on the WRU, and the governing body has yet to say that it will be looking to secure the best possible deal for its professional sides. Its priority is to get the regions to sign a participation agreement with the union to replace the one that runs out at the end of the season, with the offer of an extra £1m to help retain players if they do.</p><p>The fear of the regions is that the WRU is waiting for the day when they collapse and the union will then set up its own sides, two or three in number and run them in the manner of Ireland's provinces.</p><p>It is a reason why the mood in the regions is so down, notwithstanding the Scarlets' ebullient display at Harlequins. They feel they will be worse off whatever the European outcome, losing not just their Lions but the next wave of Wales internationals. Their destiny will be decided by others and they need to find a way to get involved in the discussions.</p><p></p><p>• <a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/email/subscribe?emailListId=219\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Breakdown, our free weekly take on the world of rugby union.

        "body":"<h2>Today's best bets, by Chris Cook<br /></h2><p>The final declarations are out for Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday, with the immediate point of interest being the fact that Ryan Moore is aboard Ruler Of The World in the Champion Stakes, rather than Hillstar. It appears that Sir Michael Stoute has let him off Hillstar, so that he can maintain his association with the Aidan O'Brien-trained Derby winner. If you'd backed Hillstar, you'd have to be worried about that, though Richard Hughes is a pretty darned good substitute.</p><p>Perhaps it's a one-off arrangement that has no significance for future riding contracts. Moore has yet to offer public comment but I don't imagine for a moment that he would be rash enough to do a Dettori and jump ship without making sure the boss was OK with it.</p><p>The fields for Champions Day have held up pretty well, despite the prospect of soft going, with an average of 11 runners in the Group races. The withdrawals were widely predicted: Toronado, Sky Lantern, Declaration Of War, Magician, Sole Power and Trading Leather are the most significant.</p><p>There has been a further 1mm of rain at Ascot this morning and the going remains soft all round. The rest of today is expected to be dry but showers are forecast tomorrow and on Saturday.</p><p>Here are the declared runners for the <strong>Queen Elizabeth II Stakes</strong>:</p><p>Burwaaz<br />Caspar Netscher<br />Gordon Lord Byron<br />Gregorian<br />Maxios<br />Soft Falling Rain<br />Dawn Approach<br />Elusive Kate<br />Kingsbarns<br />Leitir Mor<br />Olympic Glory<br />Top Notch Tonto</p><p>And here are those entered for the <strong>Champion Stakes</strong>:</p><p>Cirrus Des Aigles<br />Farhh<br />Hunter's Light<br />Main Sequence<br />Mukhadram<br />Parish Hall<br />Hillstar<br />Morandi<br />Ruler Of The World<br />Triple Threat<br /><a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings/0,14906,17-10-2013%5E2,00.html\"><br />You can see declarations for all Saturday's Flat races here</a>.</p><p>I like the look of the QEII. The Champion Stakes, I'm afraid, has not attracted the sort of field that the prize money deserves. Still, that's what happens when the ground turns at this time of year: the fast, flashy animals don't turn up.</p><p>But it seems there is no prospect of moving Champions Day to an earlier point in the year, so we're just going to have to keep hoping for unseasonably dry weather for Ascot in mid-October. Jumps fans will simultaneously be hoping for plenty of rain in the West Country, so that Cheltenham's first autumn fixture can offer safe, spongey ground on the same weekend.</p><p>Cheltenham's two-day meeting starts tomorrow. To tide us over, there's Wincanton this afternoon, when I think <strong>Sugar Hiccup (2.20) </strong>has an excellent chance of extending her winning run to four.</p><p>Sugar Hiccup is another of those Jim Best-trained beasts who showed nothing in novice hurdles, was given a break and then showed dramatic improvement in handicaps. Best is not uniformly popular among punters but at least we should all be familiar with the fact that his horses do sometimes follow this kind of career arc.</p><p>Eventually, arcs return to earth, of course, and Sugar Hiccup will be beaten one day soon. She has been raised 33lb, more than two stones, since the first of her three recent wins, on 22 August, and it is hard to believe she can still have anything in hand.</p><p>But she has had a month off since her last outing and should again be ready to put in her maximum effort. The runner-up that day has since won from a 5lb higher mark, while the third was beaten 20 lengths.</p><p>Sugar Hiccup really might be able to win again from a mark 8lb higher than last time. The market will be wary because Tony McCoy, who has such a great record for Best and was aboard for all three of the mares' wins, has gone to Uttoxeter today. The ride passes to Tom Scudamore, but he also has a good record for the yard (nine winners at 19% over five seasons) and I like their chances at the current 5-1.</p><p>The favourite is Buckthorn Tom, from the Colin Tizzard yard that has yet to hit its stride. Tizzard is 0/16 in October so far.</p><p>McCoy has a couple of good rides at Uttoxeter, notably <strong>Foundation Man (4.30)</strong>, making his chase debut in a novice handicap. He has always had the look of a chaser and has the family connections for this game, as well, being a half-brother to Captain Chris and a son of Function Dream, who won the Victor Chandler and beat Flagship Uberalles in the Game Spirit.</p><p>Foundation Man has been handicapped on his hurdles form and should have plenty in hand if ready to go today. Still, at 5-2, the bookies are not giving much away and it's a pity the going has gone soft.</p><h2>Flat racing tips, by Greg Wood<br /></h2><p>The going will be soft for the final afternoon of the season at Brighton and one of the shortest-priced horses of the year, too, in the opening maiden, but the bulk of the card is competitive, with a couple of very open handicaps later in the afternoon.</p><p><strong>Compton Bird (3.40)</strong> is up 8lb since winning over course and distance last week but did so in a style which suggested she stands every chance of following up. Smokey Oakey, a Group Three winner on soft ground in the past, has fallen a long way in the weights since then and will be a danger, but it was good to soft here last week and Hans Adielsson's four-year-old coped impressively.</p><p><strong>Sword Of The Lord (4.10)</strong> won at the same meeting and should also follow up in the next, while <strong>Hamis Al Bin (4.40)</strong> is a big price for a horse with a course and distance success this year who has now dropped back to his winning mark that day.</p><h2>Tipping competition, day four<br /></h2><p>Our winners so far:</p><p><strong>Monday</strong></p><p>Hasopop 7-2</p><p>Layla's Oasis 22-1</p><p>Eric The Grey 11-1</p><p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p><p>Embsay Crag 10-1</p><p>Dom Lukka 5-2</p><p>Ty Gwr 12-1</p><p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p><p>Grandads Horse 2-1</p><p>Tahaamah 6-1</p><p>The Great Gabrial 5-1</p><p>And our leader is:</p><p><strong>Tommy2002</strong> +29.50</p><p>… who is plainly not interested in tipping winners at 6-1 or shorter and struck out yesterday, as, indeed, did his only near pursuers, <strong>15244</strong> (+27) and <strong>ID3220887</strong> (+25). <strong>23skidoo</strong> (+13) had a double.</p><p>Today, we'd like your selections, please, for these races: <strong>3.40 Brighton</strong>, <strong>3.50 Wincanton</strong>, <strong>4.00 Uttoxeter</strong>.</p><p>This week's prize is a copy of <strong>Timeform's Chasers &amp; Hurdlers</strong> annual, the much-loved and lovingly produced book which serves as a complete record of the last jumps season (and, hopefully, offers some insights into the new one). Costing £75 if you actually pay for it, the latest annual is newly published and will shortly be reviewed on this site by m'colleague Tony Paley. You can <a href=\"http://www.timeform.com/show_article.asp?num=73\" title=\"Timeform\">buy a copy here</a> or <a href=\"http://v.calameo.com/2.0/cviewer.swf?bkcode=000362465232732dfe24c&amp;langid=en\" title=\"Calameo\">read a sample here</a>.</p><p>As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of £1 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers.</p><p>If you have not already joined in this week, you can do so today, but you will start on -9.</p><p>In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/sep/07/talking-horses-tipping-competition-terms-and-conditions\" title=\"Ts  Cs\">For terms and conditions click here</a>.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Click <a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings\" title=\"racecards\">here for all the day's racecards</a>, form, stats and results.</p><p><em>And post your tips or racing-related comments below.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246816|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|d152bfcbd56fdeed2dbea04adbe0ac0aba693ee3 -->",

He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association.</p><p></p><p>\"He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken.</p><p>\"Roy has spoken with Andros Townsend and a number of the players since the game and he has been assured there are no problems within the squad whatsoever. Additionally, the FA has not had a complaint from any squad member or player representative, and we have today talked extensively to the squad.\"</p><p></p><p>The joke is one that became popular at Nasa, the US space agency, in the 1960s and 1970s after it sent monkeys into space before humans. One version of the joke is that the first time Nasa sends a man up into space a monkey goes with him and does all the skilled technical jobs inside the rocket. Finally the astronaut gets frustrated and radios Nasa to ask what he should do. Nasa replies: \"Don't touch anything – just feed the monkey.\"</p><p></p><p>In his earlier statement, Hodgson said: \"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p></p><p>Townsend, whose father, Troy, works for Kick It Out as its mentoring manager, insists he was not offended and cannot understand why it has generated so much coverage, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andros_townsend/status/390770514849181696\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> the player said: \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p></p><p>Wayne Rooney tweeted: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420265064|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|edae5ca1215679581a4cdd15f666b010c1c4b8b0 -->",

I explained to Mr Ince the reason why he had politely been asked to leave the technical area. It was then a clearly frustrated Mr Ince had said 'and where's your busy fucker of a fourth?'</p><p>\"Mark Pottage, the fourth official, was stood behind Mr Ince at the time and said: 'I'm here.'</p><p>\"Mr Ince then turned around and violently shoved Mr Pottage with two hands in to the chest. Stewards then quickly stepped in and tried to usher Mr Ince to the dressing room area.</p><p>\"As this occurred Mr Ince, being restrained by stewards and players of Blackpool, was repeatedly shouting in an aggressive manner: 'I'll knock you fucking out you cunt,' to Mr Pottage.\"</p><p>In an examination during the hearing, Langford added that \"Mr Ince's eyes were bulging\" as he squared up to Pottage.</p><p></p><p>Giving his own evidence Ince, who denied using the word 'cunt' said: \"As I turned around, Mr Pottage stepped forward and was 'fronting me up' in my face. I felt intimidated, so I instinctively pushed him away.</p><p>\"The push was not aggressive; only enough to move him away from where I was, only in order to avoid a real possibility of a one-to-one confrontation. However, I know I should not have pushed him and I wholeheartedly apologise.\"</p><p>The FA, though, found all three breaches of the Rule E3 were proven and imposed a five-match stadium ban on Ince as a result.</p><p>Ince had told the Blackpool Gazzette on Wednesday that he thought the ban was \"very, very harsh\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420257610|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|1cb9426379ab9ccd4ad9f11a1ab956a6d3a59bc6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Moving day at the England and Wales Cricket Board, a cabinet reshuffle if you like. First came a surprise in the announcement of the former England wicketkeeper Paul Downton as the new managing director of England cricket in succession to Hugh Morris, thereby simultaneously giving headline writers a field day and securing the populist vote.</p><p>Then hot on the heels came a further announcement that Geoff Miller, the national selector, and a good diligent one at that, had, during the Ashes series this summer, asked to stand down at the end of the year. He will be replaced by James Whitaker, a natural progression for him as he has been one of three selectors for the past five years.</p><p>Downton, 56, who kept wicket first as a young prodigy for Kent and then, following a frustrating time as understudy to Alan Knott, Middlesex, as well as playing 30 Test matches for England, is an intriguing choice. His cricket career came to an abrupt end when a bail deflected into his eye while standing up to the stumps, severely damaging it in much the same way as was to happen to the South African keeper Mark Boucher last year.</p><p>He was, though, already pursuing a career in the City, and he went into this full time with JP Morgan Cazenove, the investment bankers with whom he has been for 17 years. His business experience will sit alongside a law degree from Exeter University as well as his playing and coaching qualifications. In addition to international success, which included playing in the 1981 and 1985 Ashes wins, the 1984-85 winning tour of India and the 1987 World Cup final, he won six county championship titles with Kent and Middlesex, and played in six winning finals at Lord's. He has for many years been an active committee member with Middlesex, the MCC and the ECB.</p><p>It is quite a CV and certainly he would appear to have the multifarious qualities that none of the numerous names mentioned in connection with the job could match and will be well received by both Andy Flower and England's one-day coach, Ashley Giles, both of whom were consulted and met Downton as part of the appointment process. On top of that he is an extremely decent fellow, which was not part of the job description but will stand him in good stead nonetheless.</p><p>The task he faces might well be seen as a different one to that of Morris, who came into the job - indeed was a party to creating it as part of the committee that produced the Schofield Report following the 2006-07 Ashes debacle. Most if not all of those recommendations are in place now, including the upgrading of the academy to a performance centre of excellence, and a beefing-up of the coaching structure. There has been a feeling that in the past year or so the system, if not stagnating exactly, had lost some dynamism. The new broom might just pep it up.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420174650|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|debf58a4eca5bcc4dc32113bfb4102feafe553fa -->",

        "body":"<p>There will be no tears or fears for England in Australia, according to Jimmy Anderson. In the face of expected hostility from fiery crowds, England's second-highest wicket-taker insists the squad are well prepared for another Ashes tour full of drama, tension and \"pommy-bashing\".</p><p>Alastair Cook's side depart for the southern hemisphere on Wednesday in search of a fourth successive Ashes series win for the first time since the 19th century. Three years have passed since the start of England's last campaign down under, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/07/the-ashes-2010-11-england-australia\" title=\"\">which ended in a 3-1 victory for the tourists and a first series win on Australian soil since 1986-87</a>, and since then tensions between the two teams have simmered gently below boiling point.</p><p>For Anderson, who on Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/england-james-anderson-new-deal-lancashire\" title=\"\">signed a one-year contract extension with Lancashire until 2015</a>, he will embark on his third tour of Australia having played in the 2002-03 one-day international series. A number of other players in the squad have featured twice in Ashes series on Australian soil and Anderson believes they already know what to expect from the home crowds.</p><p>\"In 2006-07 when we played there it was very apparent that they were not our greatest fans, so I don't think what has happened [since] will make it any worse. I think it will be a very partisan crowd, it always has been and it always will be,\" Anderson says.</p><p>\"It can't really get more hostile than when we've played there before. Australia in general is a quite intimidating place to play, they are very passionate and very vocal. It's something that thankfully we have experienced in the team, having played there before in good times and bad times. Hopefully we have enough experience to cope with it well.</p><p>\"I think the focus this time will be on Pommy-bashing. The best way to shut them up is to perform well, certain players cope with it in their own way. First and foremost it's important to win and hopefully that will silence the crowd.\"</p><p>The Australia coach, Darren Lehmann, stated in August that he wanted home fans to \"give it\" to Stuart Broad and make him cry following his decision not to walk in the opening summer Test at Trent Bridge when edging to slip.</p><p>Broad may be the prime target for abuse from spectators but Anderson has no concerns about his team-mate's ability to handle the pressure.</p><p>\"He got quite a lot in 2010-11 and dealt with it brilliantly,\" Anderson says. \"We all get stick when we go there, some more than others, and I think if you accept that, prepare for it and have a plan of how to deal with it, that goes a long way to dealing with it once you are there.\"</p><p>Anderson points to the change of management in 2009 as a key moment when the players' ability to handle abuse improved. During the ill-fated 2006 tour he admits the squad were too \"guarded\" but after Andy Flower's appointment as team director he says there was a fresh approach when confronted with hostility.</p><p>\"In 2006 I definitely felt that, and I certainly know that a number of wives and girlfriends felt that, walking down the street we were getting abuse,\" he says. \"But I think in 2010 we dealt with it better, we tried to interact more with the public and embrace their culture. In 2006 we were quite guarded and tried to stay in our own little bubble. I think we did things slightly wrong, we learned from that and last time we went there and tried to embrace it.</p><p>\"I remember a situation where we played golf and there were some people in the clubhouse by the tee, a couple of our guys duffed it and they said: 'I bet you're cricket is the same,' something like that. It was light-hearted and we had some interaction, rather than getting our heads down and shooting off.\"</p><p>The players <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/10/hot-spot-england-ashes-australia\" title=\"\">will not have the benefit of Hot Spot when reviewing decisions during the upcoming series after Channel Nine opted to drop the infrared camera system</a> because of funding reasons – something Anderson describes as \"frustrating\".</p><p>However, the 31-year-old is relishing the opportunity to move closer to Ian Botham's record of 383 Test wickets and is hoping more consistency across the board will see England return victorious.</p><p>\"Australia are going to be fairly confident, I imagine, that they can beat us,\" Anderson says. \"We're going to have to improve on our performances throughout the summer if we are going to have a chance of winning out there.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420189401|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|dfff07cba2ce490beaaea2252094a365fb6d7722 -->",

The international window had rather dragged, a manager left with only a handful of first-team players to drill forced to break up the tedium by paying a fleeting visit to Belgrade to see Branislav Ivanovic and Serbia defeat Japan, and then an evening at Wembley watching England qualify for the World Cup.</p><p>In between there was an enjoyable weekend spent with his family, but the days still felt \"empty\" without league fixtures to demand his attention. \"I got bored,\" he said. \"I'm not the kind of person to tell my assistants to stay here and train the four or five guys we have in while I go on holiday. I don't do that. I can't do that. I was here at the training ground all the time, and that frustrated me because I like to work with the players and I could not. So I prepared, for Cardiff this weekend, for Schalke next week. I went to watch Ivanovic last Friday, England on Tuesday. I watched every match my players were in on television. But you always want to get back to it, for it all to start up again.\"</p><p>The two-times European Cup winner's enthusiasm and intensity are retained, with the latest early-season hiatus unwelcome. Mourinho, at 50 and back where he feels he belongs, is already consumed by the new kind of project he has accepted at Chelsea. Where his task first time around had been to establish this club's reputation as winners, breaking a league title drought that had extended for half a century, now the Portuguese is rising to another challenge. This team has claimed London's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/19/bayern-munich-chelsea-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">first European Cup</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/15/chelsea-benfica-europa-league-final-live\" title=\"\">Europa League </a>under interim managers over successive seasons, fine achievements given they have either felt like a squad in constant transition or a side too often reliant upon pragmatism to secure success against classier opposition. Mourinho must bring style and panache to the party.</p><p>He is aiming to ally work-rate with pizzazz, establishing an industrious flamboyance, and his players are buying into what is required, even if the likes of Juan Mata and Kevin De Bruyne have already been subjected to some tough love en route. That is all part of the process, with results on the pitch solid rather than spectacular to date. It would have been folly to expect anything else. The restored manager points regularly to a lack of key personnel at the peak of their powers, in an age bracket from 26 to 30. Instead he has inherited, or seen purchased, prospects with burgeoning reputations who are eager to prove their pedigree while an older generation work to maintain their own standards and help guide the youngsters through the clutter of an English calendar.</p><p>Figures such as Frank Lampard and John Terry were mainstays of Mourinho's initial Chelsea lineups in that glittering first spell at Stamford Bridge and, where they might otherwise have faded into the background, are restored to prominence now. The midfielder has featured in all matches bar a League Cup tie at Swindon this season. Terry has started each of the club's Barclays Premier League fixtures and should maintain that record against Cardiff City on Saturday. The older heads remain pivotal to the project.</p><p>Take Terry. The centre-half  has endured much since Mourinho departed back in 2007, the list of controversies, plenty of them self-inflicted – from twice losing the England captaincy to being banned over the Anton Ferdinand affair, to the nagging injuries and missing the Champions League final through suspension – trip off the tongue too easily. At times he felt like a bit-part player under Rafael Benítez's stewardship last season, and even the veteran club captain is not immune to self-doubt.</p><p>Now, though, he is revived. \"He's recovering his self-esteem,\" said Mourinho. \"In the last few years he was not playing a lot, he had problems on the pitch, he had problems outside the pitch, he had suspensions for different reasons, he had injuries, he had managers who didn't trust him enough. And it looked like, at a certain moment, his career was going in the wrong direction.</p><p>\"Even I was questioning, from far away, what was happening to this guy: physical problems, psychological problems, what is going on? I'm happy he's proving he's still a top player. He plays in a position where age doesn't make a huge difference. It's a position where players rely more on positioning, on reading the game, and being in the right place at the right time. Experience helps. Look at how many top teams have experienced players at centre-half: go to Barcelona and Carles Puyol is there; go to Manchester United and there's Rio Ferdinand; Jamie Carragher at Liverpool was playing until last season and was important for them. You go to many clubs and top clubs and central defenders are 30 to 34. John is proving his quality. With what he did at Chelsea in the last decade, I think he deserves to be back on track.\"</p><p>Then there is Lampard, the club's record goalscorer whose box-to-box style, all late charges into the penalty area to catch opponents unawares, is being tweaked as time overtakes him. The onus these days is to transform a player capped 102 times by his country into an English Andrea Pirlo, a deep-lying distributor and an asset in possession. Personalised drills are aimed at coaxing different qualities from his game. \"Of course Frank can become that,\" said the manager. \"He has to adapt and learn every day how to play with this 'new body'. A player can still learn new skills at his age, for sure. I'm 50 and have been a manager since 2000, and I'm learning every day, every match, with every experience. You can always learn new skills, especially if the player has an open mind like he does.</p><p>\"He's a player who can keep the side's balance, a player who thinks about the game and can work with kids around him. For him, it was very good that I'm back because the trust is so big. He knows that every decision I make on him is for my team – because that's the most important thing – but also for him. So if, one day, I bring him off at 70 minutes, or if I leave him on the bench or give him a rest and don't select him, it's for his own good. He knows, without me speaking to him every day – which I don't do with my players – that I'm doing it for him, and that I might need him round the corner to play often. The trust and friendship is so big that he is happy, he's calm, he's cool. At this moment of his career, it was very important for him to have somebody like me around. For him, it's very good.\"</p><p>That pair, along with Ashley Cole, are out of contract next summer and yet, even now, the glowing praise for their early-season endeavours suggests the experienced English heartbeat in the midst of Mourinho's latest Chelsea lineup might be retained beyond this term.</p><p>\"I like that local core, not just in England but when I've worked in Portugal, Spain and Italy,\" said Mourinho. \"You owe some respect to the country and the national team, so to give some options for them is important. To keep the culture of the country in your own team's style is also very important, and you cannot lose characteristics of the local football. Sometimes people think: 'Ah, we want to play like this or like that team, like a Barça or a Bayern.' But, first of all, you have to play like the culture of the country you're in.</p><p>\"I like that loyalty. I also like the fact the foreign players arrive and find a spine in place, a nucleus of local players who can tell them and explain to them where they are, how things work here, the way they have to behave, and even the way they have to play in this league. They have to understand what they've joined. For example, an English player knows what it's like to play eight matches in three weeks at Christmas time. For a foreigner, that can come as a shock, so you need locals around who can explain what it means to people, why you can't complain and why you have to buy into it. Ideally it's not just about having British players either, but having players who are made in Chelsea. In three or four years' time, if we don't have other Englishmen to replace this nucleus of players – when Lamps is 39, John is 36 – I will be very sad. Every club needs that.</p><p>\"So we are working on that [new generation]. We have some players on loan, like [Nathaniel] Chalobah, and we have some others working and growing in the under-21s. Their standard is improving. Before, these age groups in England did not have a good level of competition at that age, but now there is a national championship, an under-19s Champions League, and it's improving them. The conditions in our academy cannot be better – the facilities and coaches are amazing – but while the quality of the coaching and the philosophy can be excellent, you really need competition to develop the kids.\"</p><p>Such observations will presumably be noted in Mourinho's testimony to the Football Association's commission when Greg Dyke's nominees come calling. The Portuguese is ever eager to impart his opinion and, having worked successfully across Europe, his experience should be tapped.</p><p>Mourinho enjoys his role as an educator these days. The manager was speaking after a Barclays community event at the training ground where grassroots coaches had been given the chance to question him on his coaching philosophy as part of the sponsors' initiative to thank community heroes this season. Those coaches who had taken their seats temporarily in the media suite lapped up his anecdotes, whether he was addressing modern-day tactical trends or the highlights of his time spent as Sir Bobby Robson's interpreter in Portugal and Spain.</p><p>\"Hopefully, one day when I have finished my managerial career, I will have time just to do that, to tell those stories and help the next generation,\" said Mourinho. \"I've always been happy talking to coaches, and my office door is open. I like doing it, especially with kids who want to be something, or with people who might have other jobs but who are really just in love with the game. I understand their curiosity. They want to know details and to try and learn from your experience.\" Some of those in his audience at Cobham were clad in Chelsea kit. Others piped up expressing alternative allegiances, even if they still hung on his every word.</p><p>The Premier League has welcomed Mourinho back. His return has helped offset the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, providing Chelsea supporters with a hero to cleanse the discord from last term, and opposition fans with a pantomime villain to heckle. \"I don't think the Premier League, or the country, missed me,\" he said. \"The country is too strong in relation to football, and the Premier League is too strong to miss somebody. It's not a question of 'missing'. But it's certainly a question of me loving it here and people know that.</p><p>\"I enjoy playing at home, feeling the Chelsea fans' passion, that they are happy to have me on their side; but I also enjoy playing away and feeling the opponents support their own team, giving me that 'hostility'. It's a 'pure hostility'. It's not aggressive. If Chelsea fans at Norwich are singing: 'José Mourinho', and the other guys sing: 'Fuck off Mourinho', I don't think it's aggressive hostility. It's better than them ignoring me. If, one day, I was Norwich manager, they'd be singing my name too. It's pure. You go, for example, to countries like Spain and when they say: '<em>Hijo de puta Portugues</em> [Portuguese son of a bitch]', you know it's a deep feeling. A real hatred. They mean it. Here, even the hostility is different. More tongue in cheek. When I'm not winning I'm 'not special any more'. I understand that and I like it.</p><p>\"It is good to be back. I feel as if I belong here. Take Tuesday, for example, at Wembley. I did not celebrate [England's qualification] by jumping up or drinking because that's not in my nature, but inside I was celebrating. I was happy. A World Cup without England is not a World Cup. They're one of the big football countries and, even if at any particular moment the national team is not at a high level, England has to be always in a World Cup. Of course, part of me was also happy that my players won't have the pressure of the play-offs in November and can play two friendly matches instead, rather than worrying if they would go to Brazil. They deserve to be there. The tournament will be better for having them there.\"</p><p>Yet, with that next international window a month away, Mourinho will plunge himself back into club matters with relish. His players returned from their national set-ups to discover the manager had armed himself with new statistical resources while they had been away. Fine-tuning is being taken to extremes. There really is no hiding from the analysis any more. \"This week we finished work with my staff comparing the way we defend when some players are in the team, and the way we defend when some are not playing. It was all trying to bring more of a scientific approach to everything. I wanted to see if my eyes were seeing exactly what the numbers suggest they should be.\" And are they? \"Yes. Oh yes.\" That was said with a smile and then, with a shake of the hand and work to be done, he was gone.</p><p><em>José Mourinho was speaking at a Barclays community event.

Johnson offers Lancaster cover for Tom Wood on the blindside flank with Tom Croft ruled out for the season with a knee injury.</p><p>Alex Corbisiero is included in the squad despite also picking up a knee problem that could rule him out of the start of the series, which begins against Australia on 2 November at Twickenham followed by games on successive weekends against Argentina and world champions New Zealand. Lancaster expects the prop, who has had fluid drained from the knee that has troubled him in recent seasons, and will not be able to put weight on it for another week, to be back in action in a few weeks.</p><p>\"We have not ruled out Alex from any of next month's internationals,\" said Lancaster. \"He has to put his knee up this week as part of his rehab. I hope he will come through and be available for some if not all of the matches. I am optimistic about his long-term prospects: with good management, we can see him through beyond 2015.\"</p><p>Lancaster will decide his captain when the squad gathers next week having refused to answer speculation that he would be replacing one back rower, Chris Robshaw, for another, Tom Wood. He said he was happy with the form of his players, but nearly half the squad, 16, are playing for clubs who were wither poor or fickle in the first five weeks of the season, including Robshaw's Harlequins.</p><p>The squad will assemble in Leeds next Monday after this weekend's Heineken Cup games for a pre-series camp.</p><p>Speaking at Lloyd's of London, Lancaster said: \"We have been looking forward to this QBE Internationals series ever since we got back from Argentina. As a coaching group we have watched a lot of rugby and we are pleased with the form of the squad. The camp is an important part of our preparation and we are looking forward to meeting up.</p><p>\"Inevitably there have been some injuries and there is still a big European weekend ahead. But injures always create opportunities and we are pleased to call up Tom Johnson, Joel Tomkins, Henry Trinder and Luther Burrell into the senior EPS, with Luther joining us as injury cover. We have three major Tests ahead of us and we are looking forward to the challenge.\"</p><h2>England's EPS squad for the QBE autumn internationals</h2><p><strong>Forwards</strong> David Attwood (Bath), Dan Cole (Leicester), Alex Corbisiero (Northampton), Tom Johnson (Exeter Chiefs), Dylan Hartley (Northampton), Matt Kvesic (Gloucester), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Ben Morgan (Gloucester), Geoff Parling (Leicester), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Billy Vunipola (Saracens), Mako Vunipola (Saracens), David Wilson (Bath), Tom Wood (Northampton), Tom Youngs (Leicester )</p><p><strong>Backs</strong> Chris Ashton (Saracens), Mike Brown (Harlequins), Freddie Burns (Gloucester), Luther Burrell (Northampton), Danny Care (Harlequins), Lee Dickson (Northampton), Kyle Eastmond (Bath), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Toby Flood (Leicester), Ben Foden (Northampton), Alex Goode (Saracens), Henry Trinder (Gloucester), Joel Tomkins (Saracens), Billy Twelvetrees (Gloucester), Christian Wade (Wasps), Marland Yarde (London Irish), Ben Youngs (Leicester)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420117519|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|8f6ace63566a01a13fc5474d82cfeb4aaa9ab70c -->",

        "body":"<p>Only one of three Burgess brothers will start for England in their World Cup warm-up game against Italy in Salford on Saturday. Sam Burgess, the eldest and most established of the three siblings included in the squad, has been named at loose-forward with George, one of the 21-year-old twins, on a seven-man interchange bench.</p><p>Tom Burgess, who only forced his way into the South Sydney team late in the National Rugby League season and was therefore a surprise inclusion in the England squad, is one of two players, along with Zak Hardaker of Leeds, who drop into a Knights team to face Samoa in the first part of a double header at the City of Salford Stadium.</p><p>Perhaps significantly, Hardaker is listed at centre, rather than at full-back, where he has played all season for Leeds – suggesting that the England coach, Steve McNamara, sees him as a possible contender for that position, which has become a problem area since the loss of the Yorkshire-born Brisbane Broncos centre Jack Reed through injury.</p><p>McNamara has switched Carl Ablett, another Leeds player who has spent most of the season in the second row, to the centre against Italy, where he will be partnered by Huddersfield's Leroy Cudjoe, with the fourth centre contender, Kallum Watkins, on the interchange bench.</p><p>Other eye-catching and potentially significant selections are Tom Briscoe ahead of Josh Charnley on the wing and Michael McIlorum ahead of James Roby at hooker. But McNamara will be anxious to avoid giving too much away to Australia's coach, Tim Sheens, who has chosen not to arrange a warm-up game in the run-in to the tournament opener, between England and the Kangaroos, at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on Saturday week.</p><p>Two members of England's 24-man squad were not considered – Sean O'Loughlin, the Wigan captain who has played only two matches in the past two months because of achilles problems, and the Warrington second-row Ben Westwood, who is suspended.</p><h2>England team to play Italy, Saturday 4.30pm</h2><p>S Tomkins (Wigan); Briscoe (Hull), Cudjoe (Huddersfield), Ablett (Leeds), Hall (Leeds); Chase (Castleford), Sinfield (Leeds, capt); Graham (Canterbury), McIlorum (Wigan), Mossop (Wigan), Hock (Widnes), Farrell (Wigan), S Burgess (South Sydney). Interchange: Charnley (Wigan), Watkins (Leeds), Widdop (Melbourne), Burrow (Leeds), Hill (Warrington), Roby (St Helens), G Burgess (South Sydney).</p><p>England Knights (v Samoa, Saturday 2pm): Makinson (St Helens); Thornley (Wigan), Jones (St Helens), Hardaker (Leeds), Cockayne (Wakefield); Sarginson (London Broncos), Powell (Wigan); T Burgess (South Sydney), Hodgson (Hull KR), Taylor (Wigan), Ferres (Huddersfield), Whitehead (Catalan Dragons), Crosby (Wigan).
