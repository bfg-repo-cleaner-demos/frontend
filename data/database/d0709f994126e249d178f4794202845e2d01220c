        "headline":"NFL inquiry: Miami Dolphins rookies allege racial and financial abuse",
        "body":"<p>The National Football League has launched an inquiry into alleged locker-room bullying at the Miami Dolphins, including claims that one junior player was racially abused and that lower-paid newcomers were expected to finance the expensive luxury lifestyles of multi-millionaire teammates.</p> <p>Club officials suspended Richie Incognito, a senior offensive guard, for “conduct detrimental to the team” after receiving a formal complaint from representatives of Jonathan Martin, a young player who walked out during a training session a week ago and who has not returned to Miami since.</p> <p>Incognito, a self-described “wild child” on his Twitter profile, is alleged to have sent Martin a series of threatening text messages and at least one voicemail in which he<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9926139/richie-incognito-miami-dolphins-used-slurs-messages-jonathan-martin\"> called Martin a &quot;half nigger&quot;, according to ESPN. </a>They added that the “intimidation” stretched back into the 2012 season.</p> <p>The wider inquiry by NFL officials is also expected to look into an alleged culture of bullying in the Dolphins locker room, especially charges that rookie players who are paid the league minimum salary of $390,000 were almost bankrupted by the financial burden imposed on them by veteran players.</p> <p>One of the reported claims against Incognito, which he has denied, is that he pressured Martin, a left tackle in his second year with the Dolphins, to pay $15,000 towards an unofficial players’ trip to Las Vegas that he did not attend.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another senior Dolphins player posted on Twitter a photograph of teammates enjoying a lavish seafood dinner with the caption: “Everything tastes better when rookies pay for it.”</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JaredOdrick98/statuses/396497315357523968\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Everything tastes better when rookies pay for it <a href=\"http://t.co/KGaisEfap2\">pic.twitter.com/KGaisEfap2</a></p>— Jared Odrick (@JaredOdrick98) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaredOdrick98/statuses/396497315357523968\">November 2, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>A colleague tweeted that he had seen a dinner bill for $30,000, which the junior players were expected to pay, prompting one anonymous participant to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/11/04/3729152/incognito-dolphins-push-back-against.html\">tell the Miami Herald&nbsp;</a>that several seniors on the team used their rookie colleagues as their “personal ATMs”.</p> <p>On Monday, a spokesman for the Dolphins referred media inquiries to the official club website, which contained a series of three statements released through the day on Sunday as events unfolded.</p> <p>In the first, the club’s tone appeared defiant. The statement did say that accusations of player misconduct were always taken seriously, but it denied that the NFL Players’ Association was investigating and included a line that said: “The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally.”</p> <p>Later, after Martin’s representatives filed his formal complaint, a second statement announced that an internal review would take place, and that the club had asked the NFL to “conduct an objective and thorough review.”</p> <p>“As an organisation, we are committed to a culture of team-first accountability and respect for one another,” it said.</p> <p>Finally, the club announced its indefinite suspension of Incognito, a decision it said it believed was: “in the best interest of the organisation at this time”.</p> <p>Incognito, 30, is in the final year of a three-year, $11m contract with the Dolphins. When the allegations against him were first aired on ESPN on Sunday, he ranted on Twitter against Adam Schefter, the journalist who reported them, and dismiss the claims as “lies”.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Stop slandering my name. You hide behind ‘sources’ who are not man enough to put their name behind the BS you report,” he wrote in one tweet. In another, he tells Schefter: “Enough is enough. If you or any of the agents you sound off for have a problem with me, you know where to find me.”</p> <p>In the last message posted before just before his suspension was announced, Incognito wrote: “I want my name CLEARED.” His account has been inactive since.</p> <p>On the field, Incognito’s suspension comes at a crucial time for the Dolphins, who beat Cincinnati in overtime on Halloween night to end a three-game losing streak and reach the halfway point of the season at 4–4, still with hopes of reaching the end-of-season play-offs.</p> <p>Martin has told friends he plans to take a few weeks away from the club to deal with “emotional issues,” according to Fox Sports. Joe Philbin, the Dolphins head coach, and several teammates have said he would be welcomed back “with open arms”.</p> <p>DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFL Players’ Association, said his organisation would “take a hard look, and stay on top of” Martin’s situation.</p> <p>An official statement from the NFL on Sunday said the league had been talking to the Dolphins since last Monday, when Martin, 24, left the club after an alleged lunchtime prank in which a group of players stood up and walked off as he joined their table with his tray of food.</p> <p>“We have been in contact with the team on this matter since last week and we will conduct a thorough review,” the statement said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647963|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|ebceb8805dcac6f8fc02008190a518d4128385a5 -->",

        "headline":"Can David Beckham succeed in Miami where others have failed?",
        "body":"<p>David Beckham has taken a break from being a Disney Knight, modeling underwear, going out on loan to Europe, and all other important Beckham-matters to express a strong interest in <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/premierleague/story/david-beckham-refuses-to-criticize-sir-alex-ferguson-for-comments-made-in-autobiography-103013\">owning an MLS franchise</a>&hellip;in Miami.</p> <p>MLS fans recall the two stages of Beckham-mania in the US. The first stage &ndash; lots of teeny boppers pay money to see Beckham play, gate receipts go up, but Beckham is often injured and the Galaxy suck. Then, the second era &ndash; Beckham gets his fitness, the Galaxy win trophies, but the aura and gate receipts return to earthly levels.</p> <p>Beckham the player had a great impact on MLS. He succeeded as a promoter and player. But Beckham the owner? I have doubts, largely irrespective of Sir David. Rather, I&rsquo;m suspicious about anything sports-related in Miami.</p> <p>I begin with a simple question: is Miami <em>really</em> a sports town? Let&rsquo;s look at the attendance stats for the current professional teams. The Miami Dolphins play in the NFL and American Football is easily the most popular sport in the US. Miami is currently <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/attendance\">20th out of 32</a> teams in terms of attendance. Sun Life Stadium has a <a href=\"http://www.sunlifestadium.com/about\">capacity of 75,000</a>, but the Dolphins draw about 67,000. That&rsquo;s still a pretty good occupancy rate. The Dolphins are also a middling team, so the interest is very good taking into account how poor the on-the-field product is.</p> <p>The next most popular sport is baseball. Miami&rsquo;s team, the Florida Marlins, succeed in hisses and fits. They&rsquo;ve won a few World Series, but also fielded some pretty bad teams during rebuilding years. Right now, the team&rsquo;s attendance is <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/attendance\">29th out of 3</a>0. That is awful. Deadspin <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/marlins-attendance-is-going-to-be-a-disaster-458672192\">predicted an attendance drop</a> this year and gleefully mocked <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2013/01/27/miami-marlins-have-become-baseballs-most-expensive-stadium-disaster/\">the public/private partnership responsible for the stadium</a>. On the plus side, the blue seats make for a serious deep blue sea &ldquo;<a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5903097/there-are-already-lots-of-empty-seats-at-marlins-games\">ocean vibe</a>&rdquo; when folks don&rsquo;t show up. Still, if Miami fans turn on a team in a league with a luxury tax like MLB, what would be they do when a team in a league with a salary cap (like MLS) has to rebuild? Then again, every team that fields a bad product will fail on some level. MLS is no exception.</p> <p>Soccer won&rsquo;t catch up with American Football or baseball for several decades, but is close behind basketball and hockey. Thus, comparisons to those sports may be more warranted. Still, the Miami Heat&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2012\">attendance is amazing</a>, but probably down more to winning championships and fielding the league&rsquo;s best player than general sports interest. In fact, if you look back at the team pre-Lebron, their attendance was usually <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2009\">middle of the pack</a>. In 2009, they drew about 18,000 and ranked 15th out of 30 teams. They were even ranked <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2001\">15th in 2001</a> before drafting Dwayne Wade, so they&rsquo;ve gotten consistent support even when the team was not so hot.</p> <p>Of course, inter-sports comparisons are not perfect. While in each American city there exists a roaming pack of casual fans that only follow winning teams (the herd), each sport has dedicated fans (the pack). Miami has an admittedly large Hispanic population, but&hellip;but&hellip;a large chunk is Cuban. Going by totally unresearched stereotypes within the Latin community, Cubans&hellip;like baseball. Soccer, not so much. True, Miami is home to plenty of South American expats. But how will their cultured tastes adapt to MLS (and that pesky salary cap)?</p> <p>Sports and demographics aside, there&rsquo;s history. I speak of the Toros and the Fusion. The who? Exactly. The Miami Toros sprang into life in 1973, after the Washington Darts of the North American Soccer League decided to move down South. The Toros lumbered along for three years in the Orange Bowl before moving to Ft. Lauderdale and rechristening as The Strikers. The team never won the NASL, but did finish runner-up in 1974. Their dynamic forward tandem of Warren Archibald and Steve David lit the nets aflame, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough: the team left town in 1983 for Minnesota.</p> <p>Thus, soccer has tried and failed in Miami. Neither Miami proper nor Ft. Lauderdale could support a team. The NASL collapsed under its own weight, you say. True, but other teams lasted longer than a decade. The intra-city moves are an ominous sign. And the more recent history is even more depressing.</p> <p>In 1996, MLS opened its doors and rode the wave of soccer interest after the 1994 World Cup in the US. In 1997, the Miami Fusion entered the league and ominously played in the old home of the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers (a converted high school stadium). The team barely lasted four years. They were shut down due to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Fusion_F.C.#Demise\">low season ticket sales and no corporate sponsorships</a>. The Miami Fusion have the wikipedia game honor of winning the Supporters Shield at the best regular season team right before being contracted. Not relocated. Contracted.</p> <p>Can Beckham reverse this trend? Could he build a winner to win over sometimes fickle Miami fans? Could a stadium misstep lead to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2013/01/27/miami-marlins-have-become-baseballs-most-expensive-stadium-disaster/\">Marlins-esque disaster</a>? I am sure that Beckham would invest more than the old Fusion owners <em>and</em> land some corporate sponsorships on brand alone, but I&rsquo;m not sold on decent season ticket sales. Twice, Miami has had a pro soccer team. Twice, it has failed. A Prince Charming has come along, but three times may not be the charm.</p> <p><em>Elliott Turner blogs about soccer at </em><a href=\"http://futfanatico.com/\"><em>Futfanatico.com</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421643116|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|7f1b39c9d7679a5fd700f0e09747fa6fb91ff6b3 -->",

        "headline":"MLS playoffs: Timbers and Galaxy hold advantage in the West",
        "body":"<h2><strong>First leg nightmares for Seattle</strong></h2> <p>Seattle's MLS life is only five years old, but the franchise is already strong on tradition, be it their supporters' six-block walk from Occidental Park to CenturyLink Field (March to the Match) or the players' post-match lap of gratitude after each home performance. Unfortunately, despite being a constant presence in MLS's postseason, the Sounders have developed another more dispiriting tradition: Underperforming in opening legs.</p> <p>• In 2009, Seattle was held to a 0-0 at home against Houston in the conference semifinals.</p> <p>• The next year, LAwon 1-0 in Seattle, putting the Sounders on a path to another semifinal exit.</p> <p>• In 2011 Seattle were blitzed in Utah, losing 3-0 to Real Salt Lake.</p> <p>• Last year, the team out-performed RSL in the first leg at home, even though the match ended 0-0. In the conference final, however, the Galaxy won the opening leg in Carson, 3-0.</p> <p>Coming into this postseason, Seattle had played five opening legs, lost three, and have never scored a goal, a pattern of underachievement that continued through 90 minutes Saturday at CenturyLink. Opening a series which will serve as the final say for regional bragging rights, the Sounders gave up a goal to rival Portland against the run of play in the 15th minute. Just after the hour, a sublime touch before a right-footed blast allowed Darlington Nagbe to double Portland's lead:</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j66XDaOf-U\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4j66XDaOf-U?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>Seattle had played fine – their quantity of chances serving as a post-match silver lining – yet there they were: at home, in a playoff opener, against their arch rivals, down by two.</p> <p>Seattle were the much more dangerous side through the match's final moments, their desperation paying off in the 90th minute when Osvaldo Alonso broke through, recording the first opening leg goals in the team's playoff history. Yet though it ended a 540-minute scoreless drought, the score did little to change the bigger picture. There's something endemic to this team that's causing this 'First Leg Syndrome'.</p> <p>Is it mentality? That's been suggested before. Preparation may be a different way of saying the same thing. Are these results the product of most of these first legs being at home against higher seeds? Or maybe we're assuming home field is worth more than it is? (More on that subject in a while).</p> <p>Regardless, Seattle's down 2-1 after Saturday's result and with a tough assignment to win through in Portland. <strong>RF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Is this finally New York’s year?</strong></h2> <p>Fans and media keep looking for fissures, scanning for signs that these are the same old Red Bulls, a talented team of anti-destiny that never, ever seems to equal the sum of its pricey parts.&nbsp;Once past some early season struggles, first-year manager Mike Petke’s club found its feet (it’s extremely talented feet, it must be said) and has reliably improved through the months, consistently gathering momentum, steadily identify the best individual roles.</p> <p>The Red Bulls may have to squint to see it today, after&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/houston-dynamo-vs-new-york-red-bulls-live\">a match that got away somewhat in Houston, but Petke’s men remain in fairly good shape following a 2-2 road draw</a>&nbsp;in the first leg of a home-and-away conference semifinal series. The loss of commanding center back Jamison Olave to a (needless, heedless and careless) red card gives Wednesday’s return leg a more tenuous feel, but there is every reason to believe this Red Bull version, locker room intact and egos mostly in check, can manage this one out just fine.</p> <p>Two main reasons, in fact: The first, blindingly illuminated over a telling first-half on a sunny fall Sunday in Texas, is the yawning talent gap that exists between these two Eastern Conference clubs.</p> <p>That, and the fact that Dominic Kinnear’s strange mastery (wizardry, really) of the MLS playoffs can only go so far. The Dynamo manager clearly knows his way around the post-season, but … well, see the first reason.</p> <p>Petke’s tactics were perfect for a match at BBVA Compass Stadium, which features the league’s narrowest pitch. New York perfected the approach while winning twice there in the regular season by a combined 7-1. The field is too small to dilly-dally with pretty possession, so Petke’s team doesn’t bother. They sit and counter, and do so with brutal efficiency thanks to wily and sophisticated vets like Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill. Even newfound playmaker Peguy Luyindula, a Frenchman schooled at Lyon, Marseille and PSG, knows just where to find the space, where and when to quickly collect the ball in transition. From there, Henry and Cahill’s movement, instinctive and sharp, can be overwhelming for younger, less sophisticated defenders.</p> <p>And it didn’t help that Houston was missing one center back, underrated Jamaican international Jermaine Taylor. Replacement Eric Brunner had a bad, bad day, culpable on both of the visitors’ first-half goals, one on Cahill’s sharp header and one from Eric Alexander. New York took a 2-0 lead into intermission.</p> <p>The return leg will be tense because Houston, abetted by Olave’s 65th minute ejection –staying on the field was always the guy’s issue, whether due to injury or suspension, which is why Real Salt Lake traded the big Colombian in winter, even though he could dominate like so few in MLS – found two second-half strikes through shear will, pressure, one deflection and one stoppage time goal-mouth scramble. It was classic Dynamo defiance, determined stuff from a team that gets the very most from its collection of draft picks and bargain bin finds. (New York started three Americans and a bunch of foreign-trained types; Houston’s lineup featured nine home-grown Americans.)</p> <p>But will this be enough? Can Houston, a straight 4-4-2 bunch with two midfield toilers but not an ounce of central creativity, dig up enough chances on the road? Cahill sounds confident, and rightly so. Here’s how he explained the squandering of a two-goal lead, while sounding quite resolute about the impending result: “We had a red card, and on the second goal we didn’t pick up the runner. It happens in football. But we’re a strong team; we can play away from home … so there’s a lot of good things we can take away from this.”&nbsp;<strong>SD</strong></p> <h2><strong>Real Salt Lake playing with fire</strong></h2> <p>It was the turning point in last season's march to MLS Cup. Los Angeles had left Carson down a goal to San Jose, but after an early Robbie Keane goal had pulled the Galaxy even, Landon Donovan pulled the strings on one of LA's trademark counter attacks, finding Keane cutting across the back of the defense for an easy go-ahead goal. The Galaxy never relinquished that lead, their counter attack key to eliminating the Supporters' Shield winners on their way to a second-straight MLS Cup.</p> <p>During their run to back-to-back titles, that type of ruthless precision has become their calling card: Donovan pressing forward with the ball while Keane's runs dissect a defense. Transcending two years and seven playoff matchups, no opponent has stopped LA's most dangerous weapon, a reality that defined Real Salt Lake's approach to Sunday night.</p> <p>The West's second seed made the surprise choice of injecting Yordany Alvarez into the lineup, giving the Claret and Cobalt a destroyer to accompany Kyle Beckerman at the base of midfield. Though LA found other ways to threaten, their transition was muted, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/la-galaxy-vs-real-salt-lake-live\">only Sean Franklin's early second half blast</a> separating the sides:</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU81vwk2JuU\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jU81vwk2JuU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>By the hour mark, Jason Kreis wanted that goal back. Not content to take a one-goal deficit back to Utah, the RSL boss pulled Alvarez, brought on Robbie Findley, and left Beckerman to protect the defense. What ensued was 30 minutes of increased RSL pressure and seemingly endless Galaxy counters.</p> <p>Surprisingly, RSL survived. Donovan and Keane stayed high, were found with relative ease by their teammates, yet could not break down Nat Borchers and Chris Schuler. RSL's central defenders, playing as if they'd spent the last 10 days working on counters, elected to give space, allow Donovan to carry the ball deep before making a decision, and refrained from making any commitments that would open space for Keane to exploit. Eventually, Donovan was either forced into a low percentage decision or hurried by players tracking back.</p> <p>Whether that plan is sustainable for leg two depends on your interpretation of the results. Despite numerous chances on the break, Keane and Donovan didn't break through, but there were so many times a sprawling block or bad touch decided the outcome, you can't help but think RSL are playing with fire. Then again, maybe you can't stop LA's counter unless you risk getting burned. <strong>RF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Lessons learned by Sporting Kansas City … or were they?</strong></h2> <p>Almost exactly one year ago, a strong Kansas City side with two standouts who would soon be Premier League men, went into Houston for an MLS playoff. Peter Vermes’ side, driven then by Roger Espinoza industry and Kei Kamara’s shear physical capacity, fell behind by a goal in the first-leg.</p> <p>Thing is, Vermes’ club had just one gear then, only one hell-bent, hard-pressing speed. And they leaned into it, chasing the deficit, straining to scoop the draw and hoping to jet home sitting pretty in the home-and-away clash.</p> <p>Instead, Sporting KC conceded a second goal, and Vermes quickly wondered aloud if perhaps his team should have re-considered those critical moments? Sure enough, back at home a few nights later, KC pressed and shot and crossed and huffed and puffed … but could ultimately put just one goal past Houston’s besieged back line. Houston advanced. Vermes, having watched a formidable bunch ousted for a second consecutive year in maddeningly similar style, reconfigured his team’s approach to the game. He wanted a little less hurry and harry, a little more possession and thoughtful design.</p> <p>So, uh … what happened?</p> <p>Saturday night outside Boston, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/02/new-england-revolution-sporting-kansas-city-live\">his men of ample playoff experience came up against a far less experienced New England Revolution bunch</a>, one that hasn’t seen playoff soccer since former Liverpool man Steve Nicol took the team to the 2009 post-season. Only, it was New England that managed the match with prudence rather than Sporting KC.</p> <p>The soccer was fairly terrible thanks to a hideous field – artificial turf, shortened to just 106 yards, slick from rain and blighted by those dizzying American football lines that crush the game’s aesthetic, pretty much the sum of all fears for anyone hoping to enjoy a match. But New England made the safe plays, only bothered on occasion when Sporting’s U.S. international Graham Zusi could pick out a pass or two. Zusi, in fact, was the only attacking player who found the passing speed through the messy first 45 as the defenses were clearly in charge.</p> <p>New England was better after the break, slowly adding players into the attack, and the controversial first goal came from Andy Dorman. Three men were clearly offside – or clearly onside – depending on which way your Twitter feed leaned. Truthfully, this was a tough one, as a ball pinged around before Dorman’s tap-in. (The original shot came from 18-year-old Diego Fagundez, the team’s fabulously talented 13-goal scorer.) Incensed Kansas City men did not handle this well, immediately undone, frustrated, lobbying, hollering, pressing, fouling, etc. And what happens then?</p> <p>Yep, a second goal. Just 12 minutes later, Stoke City-bound Juan Agudelo and playmaker Lee Nguyen sliced through the visitors’ defense, <a href=\"http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=1217310cfc944c6abc338a459554666&amp;ec=4yY2hwZzrZEhDBGcEGT98g6EMQZK8may\">arranging a sly finish from underrated second-year man Kelyn Rowe</a>.</p> <p>Vermes’ team got a little lucky when the Revolution’s impulsive midfielder Dimitry Imbongo fouled unnecessarily along the flank. The resulting free kick, parlayed with some marking that simply will not cut it, halved deficit. But that was somewhat lucky – and now Kansas City must return home, needing to two goals to advance.</p> <p>Does that sound familiar?&nbsp;<strong>SD</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/mlscup/2013/bracket\">Playoffs format</a> questions</h2> <p>For eight months the teams of Major League Soccer slog through a long-haul regular season for the right to go to the playoffs. Nine teams out of 19 are eliminated by this process. Six more are eliminated in the next week. Twelve days into the playoffs, only three games of the MLS season will remain. And yet these three games will be spread out over a month.</p> <p>MLS pushes through the playoffs with indecent haste. On Wednesday playoff games are even scheduled at the same time when these are surely the games that the league hopes all fans will watch, not just the supporters of those teams.&nbsp;(And that's not even getting into the bewildering array of broadcasters that are showing the games).</p> <p>So, the playoffs are complicated by an international weekend breaking up the pattern. Regular season games went ahead during the international weekends, though. With the USA playing on Friday and Tuesday, would it not have made sense for a big weekend of US soccer to feature internationals&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;playoff games?&nbsp;</p> <p>The compressed nature of <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/mlscup/2013/bracket\">the early playoff schedule</a> is also surely to the detriment of the teams that have battled all year for the better regular season record? Because the higher seeded teams play the first leg on the road, it means that they will face more travelling in a very short time. If the Red Bulls overcome Houston in the second leg, they will then travel to SKC or New England. Two aways game and one at home in ten days. What advantage is there in that? The higher seed will have the benefit of hosting extra-time and penalties should the ties be level after 180 minutes (with no away goals rule in use). But that's it.</p> <p>This is the showpiece time of year for MLS. Surely they would want to make the most of it?&nbsp;<strong>SB</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421629650|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|37b2554277b385dd8ead9f6f96ed59a19cd0d63b -->",

        "body":"<p>Houston Texans coach Gary Kubiak \"awake and coherent\" after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/03/houston-texans-coach-gary-kubiak-collapses-on-field\">collapsing on the field at half-time of game against Indianapolis Colts</a>.</p> <p>Kubiak&nbsp;hunched over and dropped to his knees at the 24-yard line and was immediately surrounded by medical personnel. He was lifted off the field on a stretcher and taken to an ambulance.</p> <p>\"We were all very worried,\" quarterback Case Keenum said. \"When we went back out they told us he was ... stable. We were all upset about that but trying to stay focused at the same time.\"</p> <p>The Texans didn't reveal what was wrong with&nbsp;Kubiak, but did say he didn't have a heart attack. The team said the 52-year-old coach, a former NFL quarterback who calls the team's plays, was conscious and was with his family as he was taken to the hospital.</p> <p>\"He had an episode; he was light-headed and dizzy,\" Houston general manager Rick Smith said. \"He was evaluated by a number of specialists ... he is awake and coherent.\"</p> <p>\"Hopefully, Gary will be back with us tomorrow.\"</p> <p>As the Houston Texans trickled into the locker room at halftime and learned that their coach&nbsp;had collapsed leaving the field, their excitement over a big first-half lead quickly disintegrated into dread.</p> <p>They were soon informed that he was in stable condition, but the rattled team unraveled in the second half as Indianapolis rallied for a 27-24 victory Sunday night.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of unknown,\" said defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who coached the team after halftime. \"Everything was unknown as to what was going on and what happened to Kube.\"</p> <p>Up 21-3 when&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;collapsed, the Texans struggled after halftime for their sixth straight loss.</p> <p>Kubiak's collapse came a day after Denver Broncos coach John Fox was hospitalized in North Carolina as he awaits aortic value replacement surgery. The 58-year-old Fox will have surgery in a few days and will miss several weeks while recuperating.&nbsp;Fox had been told earlier about his heart condition and was hoping to put off the operation until February.</p> <p>On Saturday, Fox became dizzy playing golf near his offseason home in Charlotte and was taken to a hospital, where tests revealed he couldn't wait any longer to have the surgery.</p> <p>Kubiak&nbsp;has long been known as a top offensive coach, mentoring quarterbacks in Denver under Mike Shanahan and now Matt Schaub and Case Keenum in Houston.&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;has had no known public health problems.</p> <p>Kubiak&nbsp;was hired in 2006, along with general manager Rick Smith, after the Texans finished with two wins from 16 games. Smith spent 10 years with&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;while the coach was offensive coordinator of the Broncos. Smith was Denver's defensive assistant for four seasons before moving into the front office for his last six years with the Broncos.&nbsp;The pair have transformed the Texans, who began to play in 2002, from league laughingstock to contender.</p> <p>His original contract was due to expire after the 2010 season, but owner Bob McNair has stepped up to keep&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;and defended him several times amid the bumps.&nbsp;Last year, the Texans announced contract extensions for both Smith and&nbsp;Kubiak, rewarding them for taking the team to the playoffs last year for the first time.&nbsp;Kubiak's three-year agreement has him under contract through 2014.</p> <p>Kubiak&nbsp;made his mark as Denver's offensive coordinator under Mike Shanahan, winning two Super Bowls. An eighth-round pick out of Texas A&amp;M, he spent nine years as John Elway's backup. He finished his career 4-1 as a starter, all in emergency relief of Elway.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421627352|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|92ad13ded6e9e1a3a05e8488271deca64939433e -->",

        "headline":"Nick Foles is seventh NFL quarterback to throw seven touchdown passes",
        "body":"<p>Nick Foles didn't know he had etched his name in NFL history until after he came out of Philadelphia's 49-20 win over the Raiders. That must have been because he was too busy shredding Oakland's defense to keep up with his impressive statistics.</p> <p>Foles equaled an NFL mark with seven touchdown passes and threw for 406 yards on Sunday to revitalize Philadelphia's struggling offense.</p> <p>\"A couple people came up to me and said that I tied the record with seven touchdowns,\" Foles said. \"It's a great honor. Hats off to our guys for doing a great job.\"</p> <p>The backup quarterback connected three times with Riley Cooper to become the seventh passer in NFL history with seven TD tosses in a game. Peyton Manning did it for Denver on opening night this season against Baltimore.</p> <p>Foles also threw scoring passes to Brent Celek, Zach Ertz, LeSean McCoy and DeSean Jackson and the Eagles, with four wins from nine games, looked nothing like the offense that failed to score a touchdown in each of the past two weeks.</p> <p>\"Every defense the past couple of weeks has been stopping us,\" McCoy said. \"So today we were kind of feeling bottled up and we released everything. It's tough when you're not winning and you're not putting points up.\"</p> <p>Among the other 10 NFL games on Sunday, the Seahawks produced the greatest comeback in the club's history to beat the Buccaneers 27-24 in overtime, the Chiefs extended their winning stretch to nine games equaling a club record to open the season with a 23-13 result against the Bills, and Nick Folk maintained his 100 percent accuracy for the season with four field goals in the Jets' 26-20 upset win over the New Orleans Saints.</p> <p>In the night game, the Colts rallied from an 18-point deficit to win 27-24 after&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/03/houston-texans-coach-gary-kubiak-collapses-on-field\">Texans&nbsp;coach Gary Kubiak collapsed leaving the field at half time and had to be taken by ambulance to hospital</a>.</p> <p>The&nbsp;Texans&nbsp;didn't reveal what was wrong with Kubiak, but did say he didn't have a heart attack. The team said the 52-year-old coach was conscious and was with his family as he was taken to the hospital.</p> <p>Andrew Luck got off to a slow start before throwing three second-half touchdowns to T.Y. Hilton as the AFC South-leading Colts secured their sixth win in eight games.&nbsp;Case Keenum threw for 350 yards and three touchdowns in his second career start, but had trouble moving the offense after halftime as the&nbsp;Texans, up 21-3 when Kubiak collapsed, lost their sixth straight game.</p> <p>At Oakland, Foles completed 22 of 28 passes as he frequently exploited mismatches and blown coverages, starting with a 42-yard quick pass to Cooper on the opening drive when the Raiders had two defenders trying to match up with three receivers.</p> <p>McCoy took a short pass and ran 25 yards untouched for his score in the third quarter and Jackson raced past Mike Jenkins on his 46-yard touchdown later in the third.</p> <p>Foles then tied the record with a 5-yard pass to Cooper with 4:28 remaining in the third quarter, matching the mark also held by Sid Luckman, Adrian Burk, George Blanda, Y.A. Tittle and Joe Kapp. Burk did it for the Eagles in 1954 against Washington.</p> <p>With more than a quarter to go to break the record, Foles was unable to get the Eagles back into the end zone on the next two drives before being replaced by Matt Barkley.</p> <p>\"I know what the record is,\" Kelly said. \"But this isn't about records, it's about going out and getting a win. If I put Nick out there to try to get a record and he gets hurt, that's being silly. Records are meant to broken when they're supposed to be broken.\"</p> <p>That was about all Foles couldn't do in his first game since being held to 80 yards on 29 passes before leaving with a concussion two weeks ago against Dallas.</p> <p>Foles only got another shot this week because regular starter Michael Vick reinjured his hamstring in a loss to the New York Giants last week. But now, it will be tough to take out Foles, who has 13 touchdown passes and no interceptions this season.</p> <p>\"Everybody started acting like his career was over after that Dallas game but they forgot that he had played some good football before that,\" center Jason Kelce said. \"A lot of that criticism will probably be halted for at least one week.\"</p> <p>At Seattle, Steven Hauschka kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8:11 left in overtime as the Seahawks overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Buccaneers.</p> <p>Trailing 21-0, Russell Wilson rallied Seattle (8-1). He threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin with 1:51 left in regulation to pull the Seahawks even. Wilson then led Seattle on a nine-play, 51-yard drive in overtime capped by Hauschka's winner.</p> <p>The Chiefs gave up a season-worst 470 yards to Buffalo, but had enough for a ninth straight win with Sean Smith returning an interception 100 yards for a touchdown and Tamba Hali scoring on an 11-yard fumble return.&nbsp;The Chiefs held an opponent to 17 points or fewer for the ninth straight time matching the NFL record set by the Atlanta Falcons in 1977.</p> <p>The Browns had a 24-18 win over the Ravens their first over Baltimore since 2007 with Jason Campbell throwing three touchdown passes, and the Patriots beat the Steelers 55-31 with Tom Brady throwing for season highs of 432 yards and four touchdowns.</p> <p>At Arlington, Tony Romo threw for 337 yards and two touchdowns, including the go-ahead score to Dwayne Harris with 35 seconds left, as the Cowboys beat the Vikings 27-23.</p> <p>The Panthers recorded their fourth straight win with a 34-109 victory over the Falcons, Washington edged the Charges 30-24 in overtime with Darrel Young scoring three times, and the Titans had a 28-21 win over Jeff Fisher's Rams.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421626346|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|18be427a9a8d83e1968e4db8cdb848d562aa8685 -->",

He hunched over and dropped to his knees and was carried off the field on a stretcher.</p> <p>A statement from the Texans said: \"Coach&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;has been taken to a local hospital, he is conscious and his family is with him. The head coach was transported to a local hospital in an ambulance as a precaution.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>The Texans later said that Kubiak did not suffer a heart attack.</p> <p>The Texans led the Colts 21-3.&nbsp;The second half of the match continued, with Texans defensive co-ordinator Wade Phillips taking over&nbsp;Kubiak's duties.&nbsp;</p> <p>The game was televised by NBC, whose touchline reporter Michelle Tafoya was nearby when the incident happened and reported that&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;\"was speaking, but also looked to be in extraordinary pain\".&nbsp;</p> <p>Kubiak is the second NFL head coach to be hospitalized this weekend.&nbsp;</p> <p>Denver Broncos coach John Fox was taken to a hospital in the Charlotte North Carolina on Saturday after feeling light-headed while playing golf.&nbsp;After testing and further observation, it was determined Fox should undergo surgery for an aortic heart valve replacement early next week.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"He will take a leave of absence from coaching for at least the next several weeks,\" the Broncos said in a statement.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421589884|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|267be7f9aa2fabf0cb881cf929eef9c6be6932eb -->",

Robbie Keane had a couple of chances at least that he'd have buried on anther day, and despite Sean Franklin's emphatic shot giving LA the lead, the longer the game went on, the more RSL looked like taking something from the first 90 minutes.</p> <p>They didn't in the end — though Salt Lake looked a lot better when not playing with two deep midfielders and letting Beckerman clean up in front of defense on his own as he more usually does in their normal diamond formation. The introduction of Velasquez took the game back to LA, and they looked less than confident at times when not being permitted to work their way through and around the RSL defense (where Chris Schuler was immense). Food for thought for Kreis in the second leg, even as he has to think about the continued threat of Keane and Donovan.</p> <p>As with every other semi-final, this one remains finely poised for the second leg. We'll have coverage of all of them and thanks for joining us so far. For now, good night.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52771bf0e4b0ad7c52b60663\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T04:01:01.567Z\">11.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: LA 1-0 RSL</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Final thoughts in a moment</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52771b70e4b0be3ac2bf4be9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T04:00:42.243Z\">11.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">90 mins +2</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A final set piece chance possibly for RSL (three minutes added on by the way). A fairly central free kick 45 yards out.

He's come on for Sarvas. Garcia's first act — he gets booked for a foot in on Velasquez.</p> <p>More intricate approach play from RSL walking the tightrope of conceding an LA break, which duly comes and here comes Keane racing into the box one on one again, but he pulls his shot wide of the far post. Another let off for RSL. That could have killed the tie.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527718f9e4b01fc33230d5b9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:49:47.033Z\">10.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">82 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Beltran and Sandoval combine in the box but Gil can't get a clean shot. Then Donovan forces a turnover near the halfway line and strides towards the RSL goal, only for his final touch to let him down.</p> <p>Bad news for RSL. Morales is rubbing his hamstring and has slowed up.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52771848e4b0020e1b719a76\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:48:05.170Z\">10.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">80 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>We're going to see a third RSL sub and it's a striker, Devon Sandoval, coming on for Saborio. So like for like, but essentially Kreis still going for it rather than settling for the one goal deficit to take back too Salt Lake.&nbsp;</p> <p>And they nearly get it! A scramble in the LA box and suddenly the ball is scooped tantalizingly in front of a diving Sandoval inches from an empty net. It somehow evades him though, but it's all RSL at the moment. Still <strong>LA 1-0 RSL</strong>, but this one's not done yet.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527717c4e4b0020e1b719a75\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:45:08.213Z\">10.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">78 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So, playoff soccer is different, and all that, but RSL have scored a lot and LA conceded a lot in the last 15 minutes of games this year.</p> <p>Of course as soon as I write that Zardes goes close to scoring a second for LA as he gets to the byline, cuts back and is only just boxed out by Borchers as he shapes to shoot.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gil does get a shot off at the other end though, after patient work from Morales on the edge of the box. End to end...</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5277176de4b0ad7c52b6065d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:42:57.755Z\">10.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">76 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Keane ends another LA break by looping a shot up and harmlessly into Rimando's hands. Then it's Zardes turn to run at the defense and he earns a corner off Beltran, but again Rimando is in the perfect place to pluck the resulting in swinger out of midair.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527716ece4b01fc33230d5b6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:41:28.828Z\">10.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">74 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Better again from RSL. Findley chases down a ball into the corner and works the ball back to where Beckerman sends a curling shot towards Penedo's near post, forcing a save and a corner.</p> <p>Then Penedo's in action again, making a spectacular punch clear from the corner at the back post. This game opening up again in the manner of the start of the match.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5277168ce4b0be3ac2bf4be7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:39:20.910Z\">10.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">72 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Keane waits and waits as LA spring forward, then slips the ball wide to Zardes and peels off looking for the return. The cross is cleared though. Franklins' goal (which I'm still not quite sure really happened) is the only thing breaking the deadlock at the moment.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527715f9e4b0020e1b719a74\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:37:44.143Z\">10.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">70 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The corner is flicked clear by Beckerman, but the ball is knocked back in to where the lurking Gonzalez forces Rimando to be alert.&nbsp;</p> <p>RSL attack again and Velasquez does some spirited running at the heart of the LA defense and sips the ball to Saborio, who's just offside. Velasquez has looked lively since coming on. But it's still <strong>LA 1-0 RSL</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5277157be4b0be3ac2bf4be6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:35:18.384Z\">10.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">68 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Half a chance for RSL as a ball takes an eternity to bounce in the box as Velasquez shapes to shoot. by the time he does an LA body is in the way and the ball deflects away for a throw. For a second there, that looked alarming for LA, anymore to the point RSL are getting men forward in space now.</p> <p>Undaunted, LA go up to the other end and Schuler has to do well to get his body between Franklin and the ball in the box, at the expense of a corner...</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52771513e4b0020e1b719a73\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:33:11.869Z\">10.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">66 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Patient build up play ends up in Gil teeing up Saborio on the edge of the box and he spins and loops a dipping shot just past the near post. Not a great chance, but he did well to get his shot off. At the other end the Galaxy have a flowing move of their own that end when Donovan can't pick out a return pas for Jimenez as he races into the box.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52771499e4b0020e1b719a72\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:31:27.580Z\">10.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">64 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A break for LA and Donovan is driving a 3-on-3 attack, but he's not quite on the same page as Keane on the final ball and Schuler is able to recover and save the attempt on goal. He's been very good tonight — he's needed to be.</p> <p>RSL looking a little more liberated in playing a slightly more open formation now.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52771448e4b0be3ac2bf4be5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:29:24.588Z\">10.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">62 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A looping cross finds an unmarked Zardes at the back post, but he takes too much of a touch and RSL recover before he can get a clean shot.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527713b6e4b0020e1b719a70\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T03:28:02.332Z\">10.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">60 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>For all LA's dominance there's only a goal in this, but they're looking for more. Zardes again found out wide, but again his low cross is cut out.</p> <p>Another RSL change soon - Sebastian Velasquez will be coming in. For now his team mates just beginning to push up the field a little more. They have half an hour to salvage something from this leg. <strong>LA 1-0 RSL</strong>. Grabavoy out, Velasquez in.

Despite that the Galaxy couldn't score, and while they weren't unduly troubled at the other end, with RSL reduced to long range shots, the first fifteen minutes of the second half will be interesting. On the balance of probability on what's gone so far, you have to believe LA are going to score, but the longer this goes on, the better the scoreline looks for RSL, taking the game back home.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52770ccfe4b0ad7c52b60658\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T02:56:50.575Z\">9.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Half time: LA 0-0 RSL</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Half time thoughts in a minute.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52770c5de4b0be3ac2bf4be1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T02:56:10.189Z\">9.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">45 mins +1</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Jason Kreis has a lot to think about at half time.

We’ll see how effective he is tonight. Key will be whether Juninho can silence Javier Morales in midfield, and also whether Robbie Rogers can build on recent signs that he is finally coming into form out wide. He’s had a rough time with comparisons to Mike Magee, the MVP-contending player he was traded for in mid-season. Can he earn a little sweet vindication in these playoffs?</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276fd75e4b0020e1b719a61\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T01:55:21.224Z\">8.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">A stat to ponder...</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Courtesy of OptaJack:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OptaJack/statuses/397178974096613376\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>12 - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LAGalaxy\">@LAGalaxy</a> have won 12 of their 17 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MLS\">@MLS</a> playoff games since the start of 2009.

Having seen the team he’d built and taken to the CCL final finally salary-cap out, he faced some tough choices in the off-season and had to say goodbye to the likes of Will Johnson, Fabian Espindola and Jamison Olave. In case you doubt the value of said players, Johnson is the mainstay of the Western Conference-winning Portland Timbers, and the latter two have been regular first-teamers for the Supporters Shield-winning New York Red Bulls, alongside another RSL castoff, Johnny Steele.</p> <p>Kreis then stuck to the fabled recruitment policy that favors serviceable players for his system, rather than more mercurial talents one needs to shuffle things around for. He brought in the likes of Luis Gil, who proved to be an excellent young player in his first year, while also asking existing veterans like Kyle Beckerman, Nick Rimando, Alvaro Saborio and Nat Borchers to hold the spine of the side together. Other players like Ned Grabavoy have arguably had career years, shuttling up and down the field, patrolling midfield and generally assuming more responsibilty than ever themeselves.</p> <p>Rather than the expected transitional year, he's taken RSL to within a game of winning the Open Cup and in contention for the Supporters Shield until the final weekend. They slumped a little late in the year, and there’s been some suggestion that that’s related to the prospect of losing their coach to the startup NYCFC, who’ve reportedly targeted the man who’s guided his team to five consecutive 50-point-plus seasons. Frankly, the prospect of losing Kreis <em>should</em> be alarming.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276f9d3e4b0020e1b719a60\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T01:39:34.515Z\">8.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">LA Galaxy</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>While New England were making a stagey move to swoop for Andrew Farrell as the number one draft pick at the start of the year, elsewhere in the draft hall the young man who would probably have been number one pick had he entered the draft, Gyassi Zardes, was discussing signing for the Galaxy as a homegrown player.</p> <p>The talk at the end of last year was the departure of David Beckham and the imminent sabbatical of one of the other DP’s, Landon Donovan, but the likes of Zardes, Jose Villareal, Jack McBean and Charlie Rugg have all played their part throughout the season, as the Galaxy have juggled both their league campaign and a Champions League campaign, while also dealing with Gold Cup and World Cup qualifying absences and the demands of a bunch of high profile friendlies against European sides in the summer.</p> <p>Of those youngsters Zardes in particular has been in good form of late and will start tonight, for sure, but perhaps the most important youngster in the side in the run-in has been the central defender Kofi Opare, who came into the side late on but has been very solid alongside his more celebrated peer, Omar Gonzalez.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276f2a1e4b0ad7c52b60650\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T01:16:28.456Z\">8.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Hello, and welcome back to the Guardian’s MLS playoff coverage. And it’s the final semi-final first leg before the second legs that follows the first legs of the weekend in midweek, between LA Galaxy and Real Salt Lake. And that much should be clear...</p> <p>Matchups between these two tend to be rather attractive affairs. They’ve faced each other in recent years in playoff tussles, with the Galaxy generally having the upper hand in playoffs overall — though in the one that really counted, the 2009 MLS Cup, it was RSL who came out on top, on penalties.</p> <p>Since that final, indeed since last year’s playoffs, both sides have seen significant personnel changes — yet both have managed an impressive continuity to get this far. Both have head coaches who have brought remarkable consistency to their teams despite all the contingencies of MLS forced parity, and both sides have historically tended to bring out the best in each other in games.</p> <p>Hopefully that's the same tonight. We've already had three finely poised games in the other first legs, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/02/new-england-revolution-sporting-kansas-city-live\">New England being pegged back but still holding a 2-1 lead</a> over Sporting KC, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/02/seattle-sounders-vs-portland-timbers-live\">Seattle being stunned by Portland at home</a>, but still stealing back a goal to keep them in the hunt at 2-1, and this afternoon, the proverbial game of two halves as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/houston-dynamo-vs-new-york-red-bulls-live\">New York gave up a 2-0 half-time lead</a> to lose Jamison Olave to a red card, multiple players picking up yellows, and most crucially giving up a stoppage time equalizer to Houston Dynamo.&nbsp;</p> <p>So there's been plenty of drama (and rather too many NFL field markings) so far. Let's hope we can go four for four in a game that, on paper, should be tighter than any of them.</p> <p>I'll be back shortly with more build up and team news. In the meantime get your tweets coming in to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/KidWeil\">@KidWeil</a>, or email <a href=\"mailto:graham.parker.freelance@theguardian.com\">graham.parker.freelance@theguardian.com</a>&nbsp;and watch what happened when these two sides met last, and I'll see you in a bit.

New York looked imperious in the first half — frustrating Houston with a disciplined defense and hitting them on the counter with a pair of clinical goals.</p> <p>But then a sloppy defensive clearance was hammered home early in the second half by Ricardo Clark, and despite a brief attempt by New York to impose their will by going on the attack, they lost all momentum when they lost their key defender Jamison Olave to a dubious red card. After that it was always going to be a siege and in the end Omar Cummings first goal for Houston almost seemed like an inevitability. And any complaints New York might have had about the Olave red card had to be set against the fact they were very lucky not to give up a penalty at the death.</p> <p>No Olave for the second leg and that could be huge. He's key for their defense and they looked ragged without him. And most importantly the Dynamo have finally taken something from a game against New York this year and will go to the second leg with their hopes high. Their record in New York is poor, but as we've just seen regular season precedents don't mean much in playoff soccer.</p> <p>We'll be back later with <strong>LA vs RSL</strong>. For now, good evening.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276d22ee4b0020e1b719a58\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T22:47:19.073Z\">5.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Houston 2-2 New York</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Final thoughts in a moment.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276d1e9e4b0020e1b719a57\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T22:46:01.185Z\">5.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">90 mins +4</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Ooooooooh.

If Houston level they'll come to Red Bull Arena on a high and facing a second choice defense.

Houston trying to pull New York around with their passing now, but Barklage and Cahill get it clear, only to invite another attack.&nbsp;</p> <p>Luyindula tries to put his foot on it and runs wide, but only into trouble, and his attempted pass forward is cut out by Boswell.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276cc05e4b0be3ac2bf4bce\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T22:21:55.747Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">70 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>New York happy to hoof the ball clear any old how as it bounces around their box for a moment. Referee Ricardo Salazar may have changed the whole series there. Looking at the replay it still looks a very harsh red.&nbsp;</p> <p>Andrew Driver comes on for Creavalle as The Dynamo go for it in attack. <strong>Houston 1-2 New York</strong> — for now...</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276cba4e4b0020e1b719a52\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T22:19:44.198Z\">5.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">68 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>As much as Henry or Cahill, Olave is probably one of the key players on the New York team. Without him on the field, the Red Bulls are a lot more vulnerable at the back, even with ten men.&nbsp;</p> <p>Barklage comes on for Johnny Steele in the wake of the decision.

They were organized and compact to restrict Houston in attack, and their second goal in particular was straight out of the Mike Petke folder marked &quot;game plan&quot;. Henry's invention made the first, and it was his pass that started the move that led to the second. He and Cahill look up for this.</p> <p>Inevitably, Houston had a lot of possession, but with the exception of Boniek Garcia, who was lively throughout, and a couple of flashes from Sarkodie, didn't seem to have a lot of urgency about them until they were already 2-0 down. They will go in with a little encouragement at some glimpses of goal they got in the last five minutes, when we finally saw Bruin and Barnes get involved, but they need more invention from those front players. Houston can not afford to give up another goal or this tie is surely over, so they can't commit too many men forwards or New York will destroy them on the counter.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:51:18.919Z\">at 4.51pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5276c2d0e4b0be3ac2bf4bca\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:40:50.912Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Half time: Houston 0-2 New York</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Half-time thoughts in a moment.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276c25ae4b0020e1b719a50\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:40:28.318Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">45 mins +1</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Houston gather themselves for one more attack, but Boswell, who had the right idea, can't pick out Sarkodie or Garcia as he tries to pass down an open lane on the right and New York have a goal kick.

Admittedly this game will probably give us a clearer sight of their playoff credentials than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/31/houston-dynamo-vs-montreal-impact-live\">the game against Montreal </a>which saw the Impact’s helter skelter slide down the standings take a small skip over the cut off barrier for the playoffs, before careening to an ungainly halt in a pile of red cards, recriminations and Will Bruin goals.</p> <p>Aside from the ease of a three goal win and having the likes of Ricardo Clark, Bruin, Oscar Boniek Garcia and Brad Davis all available for this playoff run (something they've not been able to rely on throughout the regular season), the Dynamo will take the following positives into tonight’s game:</p> <p>• Bruin, as well as scoring, generally looked sharp and confident and was getting shots on target all evening</p> <p>• Clark continued the good form of the last couple of months - how he does in midfield may be key to their hopes in this series</p> <p>• Corey Ashe didn’t get himself suspended for this one, despite being understandably incensed by Marco di Vaio appearing to rake his face in the game-end melee on Thursday.</p> <p>They’ll also take the following negatives.</p> <p>• That central defense still looks awfully vulnerable</p> <p>• Their coach is suspended after encroaching on the field during the above-mentioned game-end melee. No Dominic Kinnear in the locker room or bench tonight. How that influences the Dynamo’s vaunted playoff-game-management we shall see.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527562d9e4b0020e1b7199dc\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T19:50:48.496Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>It's not often that the coach and players of a team who topped the regular season league table, and who beat their forthcoming opponents three times by a combined total of 9-1 during said season, get to claim to be &quot;underdogs&quot; for that imminent match-up without being laughed out of town for undue caution. But it's a measure of the weight of playoff history in favor of Houston Dynamo and against New York Red Bulls, that nobody is awarding this Eastern Conference semi-final to the Supporters Shield-winning New York before it's started — least of all their coach Mike Petke.</p> <p>You can understand why. In the last three years alone the Red Bulls have been at this stage three times and three times they've been beaten — as San Jose, LA Galaxy and DC United have pushed past them over two games. And let's not even get into what happened before that — the fact is that the Red Bulls are generally bad at playoffs, while their opponents Houston Dynamo have been to four of the last seven MLS Cup finals, including the last two.</p> <p>But another fact changes forever last week — the one that read, &quot;New York Red Bulls have never won a trophy&quot;. Sunday's emphatic and cathartic 5-2 victory over Chicago Fire brought the Red Bulls the Supporters Shield and ensured that former player turned first year coach Mike Petke will never have to pay for a sweater vest in Harrison ever again.</p> <p>The next goal is to navigate the playoffs and bring an MLS Cup final to New York, as number one seeds. But they couldn't have asked for a more challenging start. The Dynamo, under Dominic Kinnear, probably came into these playoffs in some of the least convincing form they've ever mustered at this stage of the year, after a season marked by injuries and international absences had robbed them of personnel and injuries.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Houston could scarcely have hoped for better tune up opponents than a wretched Montreal Impact in the playoffs and they duly bounced past all-remaining eight men of them, and with non-scoring goalscorer Will Bruin getting a brace to get his personal form right back on track. Their confidence will be high and if they could get their noses in front early, this game could get very interesting indeed.</p> <p>We'll find out how it unfolds shortly. I'll be back soon with more team news and build up, but for now watch how Houston got here below, and start getting your tweets and emails coming in to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/KidWeil\">@KidWeil </a>or <a href=\"mailto:graham.parker.freelance@theguardian.com\">graham.parker.freelance@theguardian.com</a>&nbsp;and I'll be back in the time it takes to stare down the person trying to start a Mexican Wave in the seat next to you...</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Montreal Houston wild card\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script height=&quot;369px&quot; width=&quot;460px&quot; src=&quot;http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=1217310cfc944c6abc338a459554666&amp;ec=tobnNtZzqkE4SbIx_c3r3-p-dQ7qgAHB&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421532793|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|2b368a391f067df450e8748d15deee8c0dcc8b73 -->",

This concludes the main part of the live blog, although we will continue to update this blog with the final scores from all the rest of the day’s games, while the comments section will remain open for you to continue discussing the action below the line.</p> <p>Before I go, here is the latest from the 4.05pm ET and 4.25pm ET games:</p> <p>Eagles 21-3 Raiders</p> <p>Buccaneers 14-0 Seahawks</p> <p>Ravens 3-7 Browns</p> <p>Steelers 0-7 Patriots</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276c75be4b0ad7c52b60645\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T22:00:01.302Z\">5.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Quick Take</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A few immediate reactions to those early games:</p> <p>- Does defense still win championships? Perhaps not, but it has certainly won games for the Chiefs this season, and today’s win over Buffalo might be the clearest case yet. The Bills looked poised to take a 17-3 lead early in the second half, but instead Sean Smith intercepted third-string quarterback Jeff Tuel and took the ball back 100 yards for a touchdown. Then Tamba Hali took a fumble back to the house, and that was all she wrote. Kansas City did not score an offensive touchdown, but they did not need to. The sceptics will remain, but one way or another this team is 9-0.</p> <p>- The Dallas Cowboys still look like the most likely team to win the NFC West, and at 5-4 they do at least have a winning record, unlike their division rivals. But does anyone really believe in this team? A more ruthless team than the Vikings would have punished that Romo interception late in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>- Adrian Peterson remains the best running back in the NFL. Probably one of the best to have ever lived. He might be playing on a bad team right now, but that 11-yard run to put his team on top in the fourth was just ridiculous. It is a privilege every time to watch that guy play. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276c212e4b01fc33230d593\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:37:35.825Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fantasy update</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So, who were the star performers from today’s early games? Here are a few of the statistical stand-outs:</p> <p>&nbsp;- Zac Stacy: 27 carries for 127 yards, 2 TDs; 6 receptions for 51 yards</p> <p>- Chris Johnson: 23 carries for 150 yards, 2 TDs; 3 receptions for 20 yards</p> <p>- Jimmy Graham: 9 receptions for 116 yards, 2 TDs</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276c0e9e4b0ad7c52b60641\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:32:50.915Z\">4.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Around the league</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>OK, I can at last give you a sweep of all the final scores from the 1pm ET kickoffs:</p> <p>Chiefs 23-13 Bills</p> <p>Vikings 23-27 Cowboys</p> <p>Titans 28-21 Rams</p> <p>Falcons 10-34 Panthers</p> <p>Saints 20-26 Jets</p> <p>Chargers 24-30 Washington</p> <p>The 4.05pm ET/4.25pm ET games are also now underway.

Washington beat the Chargers: 30-24!</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Who else could it be but Darrel Young, the Washington fullback and today’s most unlikely hero? On third-and-inches from the four-yard line, he bulldozes his way over the right-hand side of the line and into the end zone to seal the overtime victory.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276bf5ce4b0ad7c52b6063d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:25:59.163Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Washington knocking on the door …</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>… very nice drive being constructed by the home team here, and Alfred Morris very nearly went in just now on a nine-yard run around left tackle.

It’s 24-24, we’re into overtime and Alfred Morris just ripped off a nice run to take the home team across halfway. This is the first possession of overtime, so bear in mind that if his team only kick a field goal, San Diego would get the chance to respond.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276bd73e4b01fc33230d58b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:17:44.108Z\">4.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Saints 20-26 Jets</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Rex wins the Ryan Bowl at at MetLife Stadium, leading his team to an upset victory over the heavily-favoured Saints. Rather than Rob’s New Orleans defense, it was the corresponding New York unit that stole the show, twice intercepting Drew Brees and limiting the Saints’ running backs to 50 yards on 11 carries. The Jets move to 5-4, and stay alive in the AFC East.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:17:59.974Z\">at 4.17pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5276bc70e4b0ad7c52b60634\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:13:25.680Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal! Chargers 24-24 Washington</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>San Diego thought they had a game-winning score – with Danny Woodhead initially awarded a touchdown after he was forced out of bounds right by the pylon with 29 seconds left in the game – but officials overturned that call on review, and the Chargers were unable to punch the ball into the end zone despite having three attempts from the one-yard line. Instead Nick Novak makes the 19-yard field goal, and this game is going to overtime. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276bbaae4b0ad7c52b60632\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:10:15.235Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Vikings 23-27 Cowboys</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Minnesota’s unlikely upset never comes to pass.

It wasn’t pretty, and at times it appeared they might lose to a Jeff Tuel-led Bills team, but when your defense can not only shut down opponents but also put up two scores in a game, you’re always in with a shout.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276babee4b01fc33230d585\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:06:11.624Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Falcons 10-34 Panthers</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A rout in the NFC South, as Carolina confirm their upward trajectory, and Atlanta’s spiral continues.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276ba50e4b01fc33230d583\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:04:51.737Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">TOUCHDOWN! Vikings 23-27 Cowboys</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>For a moment there it looked like the story of this game was going to be yet another Tony Romo choke job, after the Dallas quarterback threw an interception to leave his team three points down and out of possession deep in the fourth quarter, but he makes amends by orchestrating a 90-yard scoring drive here, capped with a seven-yard pass to Dwayne Harris. With just 35 seconds left in the game, the Cowboys have surely snatched victory here from the jaws of defeat.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b9a5e4b0ad7c52b60630\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:01:30.723Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Titans 28-21 St Louis</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Yup, that’s now official.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b978e4b01fc33230d582\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:00:48.332Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turnover on downs!

Vikings 23-20 Cowboys</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>What? How?! But … no, really, how??? Adrian Peterson puts the Vikings up over the Cowboys with an utterly impossible 11-yard touchdown run, appearing to be tackled by two defenders at about the five-yard line, but somehow landing back on his feet without ever going to ground, before dragging said defenders with him into the end zone. That play, simply put, did not make any sense. But when Adrian Peterson is involved, these things often don’t.</p> <p>Oh, and then Blair Walsh misses the extra point! The TV producers were so sure that he was going to make it, they had already updated their graphic to show the Vikings as 24-20 ahead, but the kick actually sailed wide right.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:43:23.577Z\">at 3.43pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b3f2e4b01fc33230d578\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:37:11.116Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal!

For this reason he is unstoppable when protected - no matter his receivers - but not unstoppable if you break the line (ie Giants Superbowls). In this way I think he is like Montana.</p> <p>The Patriots have been one of the smartest teams too, in that they build a rounded team, never forgetting the lines and the use of veterans, and allowing rookies to quickly fill roles.</p> <p>Brady is getting a bit older, and his team is in flux. There are mistakes. yet he is on a 6-2 team. It is a slow decline, not a crisis. His stats reflect his age and the flux, but they are still winning.</p> <p>When Brady starts getting sacked 5+ times, then there will be a real problem.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p>A lot of valid points there, on all fronts. It’s always tricky when successful athletes start to age in team sports. In individual sports, you are simply good enough, or you are not, but in teams it is always hard to know how much is down to the player in question. And how long do you keep showing faith in someone just because he is ‘your guy’, and you know what he has done for you in the past?

Namely: what is wrong with Tom Brady?</p> <p>So far this season, Brady is posting his worst-ever completion percentage (55.7%), yards per attempt (5.94), and passer rating (74.9) figures. Of course he has been working with a substantially weakened receiving corps - one that lost four of its top five receivers from last season (Wes Welker, Danny Woodhead, Brandon Lloyd and Aaron Hernandez) and has also had to do without the fifth, Rob Gronkowski until very recently due to injury. </p> <p>But at a certain point Brady does also have to take responsibility for some erratic performances. His former wide receiver Troy Brown even argued during the quarterback's first-half struggles against Miami last week that it might soon be time to pull Brady out of the game. That is certainly going too far for me, but it does not make it unreasonable to ask: do the Patriots have a Tom Brady problem? And if so, what is the solution?</p> <p>Let me know what you think on Twitter <a href=\"twitter.com/Paolo_Bandini\">@Paolo_Bandini</a>, by email at <a href=\"mailto:paolo.bandini.freelance@guardian.co.uk\">paolo.bandini.freelance@guardian.co.uk</a> or in the comments section below.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276898ce4b0be3ac2bf4ba0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T17:44:20.658Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">John Fox</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The other big story in the NFL right now relates to the health of Denver Broncos head coach John Fox, who will undergo aortic valve replacement surgery on Tuesday after being rushed to hospital over the weekend. The team has said that Fox will be out for &quot;several weeks&quot; but given that this is an open-heart procedure, even speculating about a return feels like putting the cart before the horse. This is very serious surgery, and one would hope that everyone's first priority will simply be to make sure that everything is done to ensure that Fox can eventually return to good health.</p> <p>We are in the middle of an NFL season, though, so contingencies must also be made for his team. The Broncos are yet to announced who will fill in as interim head coach, but defensive co-ordinator Jack Del Rio, who previously served as head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, is the current favourite. How it will affect the team remains to be seen. They are, at least, not in action this weekend, and so have a few more days to put together a plan. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52768613e4b0020e1b719a21\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T17:33:08.716Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Injury updates</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Some very interesting developments revealed by the injury reports submitted around the league this morning. Here are the biggest headlines:</p> <p>- Jeff Tuel will start at quarterback for the Buffalo Bills after Thad Lewis was unable to recover sufficiently from his rib injury in time to face the Chiefs. A lot of people had been predicting that this might be Kansas City's first defeat of the season, but can the Bills really win with a third-string signal caller taking the snaps?</p> <p>- Zac Stacy is active and will start at running back for the St Louis Rams, despite the ankle sprain he suffered on Monday against Seattle. His backup, Daryl Richardson, is inactive, meaning that rookie Bennie Cunningham should see some action in relief of Stacy.</p> <p>- Saints tight end Jimmy Graham missed practice time this week with a foot injury, but he is good to go against the Jets. Wide receiver Marques Colston, however, is out with a knee complaint.</p> <p>- Roddy White's gammy hamstring will keep him out of a third-straight game for the Falcons, who are pretty much into do-or-die mode already in this week's game against the Panthers. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52768562e4b0020e1b719a20\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T17:21:13.405Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pick Six contest</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Just about 40 minutes left to kickoff, and that is also the time you have left to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/01/nfl-talkboard-week-nine-chiefs-bills\">make your predictions for this week's games over on the NFL Talkboard</a>.

Already this season we’ve watched Peyton and Eli Manning go head-to-head in New York, and you only have to go back as far as February for the latest instalment of the Harbowl. Now it’s the turn of the Ryan boys, as the New York Jets head coach Rex seeks to unlock his twin brother Rob’s New Orleans Saints defense.</p> <p>The pair shared a handshake and warm pat on the back on the field a few moments ago, but affections will soon be put aside. In fact, the New York Daily News speculated this morning that <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/myers-rob-rock-rex-future-jets-article-1.1505015\">a strong performance from Rob’s unit today could even go a long way towards costing Rex his job</a>.</p> <p>The Jets have overperformed to this point, reaching the halfway stage at a respectable 4-4, when many had expected them to struggle in the wake of a tempestuous offseason. Instead they have alternated wins and losses since week one, and if the current pattern holds, they should emerge victorious this afternoon. Given the calibre of their opposition, it seems highly unlikely.</p> <p>That is not all we have to look forward to, of course, although a heavy round of byes this week mean that there are only six games in the 1pm ET time slot. Here is the full list:</p> <p>Kansas City Chiefs @ Buffalo Bills</p> <p>Atlanta Falcons @ Carolina Panthers</p> <p>Minnesota Vikings @ Dallas Cowboys</p> <p>New Orleans Saints @ New York Jets</p> <p>Tennessee Titans @ St Louis Rams</p> <p>San Diego Chargers @ Washington</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T17:15:39.495Z\">at 12.15pm ET</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421559722|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|6f55e120436153b10049ccbf52efd9f1c0a3b193 -->",

        "body":"<p>The New York City Marathon returned after a one-year absence with big crowds, heightened security and a familiar champion.</p><p>Geoffrey Mutai successfully defended his title Sunday, while fellow Kenyan Priscah Jeptoo came from behind to win the women's race. Bronx resident Buzunesh Deba finished runner-up for the second straight time in her hometown event.</p><p>Fans again packed the 26.2-mile course, undaunted by the events of the past year. The 2012 NYC Marathon was canceled because of the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, but not before many New Yorkers were enraged by initial plans to hold the race.</p><p>After the bombings at April's Boston Marathon, bomb-sniffing dogs roamed the course, and barricades limited access points to Central Park. A record 50,740 runners started the race through the five boroughs.</p><p>Mutai pulled away around Mile 22 and beat Ethiopia's Tsegaye Kebede by 52 seconds. On a windy morning, Mutai's time of 2 hours, 8 minutes, 24 seconds was well off his course record of 2:05:06, set in nearly perfect conditions two years ago. He's the first man to repeat in New York since Kenya's John Kagwe in 1997-98.</p><p>Kebede, the London Marathon champ, clinched the $500,000 bonus for the World Marathon Majors title. South Africa's Lusapho April was third.</p><p>Jeptoo trailed Deba by nearly 3½ minutes at the halfway point. But she started making her move as the race entered Manhattan and passed the Ethiopian with just over two miles to go.</p><p>Jeptoo, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist and 2013 London Marathon Champ, won in 2:25:07 to clinch the $500,000 World Marathon Majors bonus.</p><p>The women's race played out almost identically to the last NYC Marathon two years ago. But this time, Deba was pursued, not the pursuer. In 2011, Mary Keitany pulled away to a big early lead, and Deba and countrywomen Firehiwot Dado chased her down. Dado, who won that day, was 14th Sunday as the defending champ.</p><p>This time, Deba and training partner Tigist Tufa separated themselves right from the start. Deba wound up finishing 48 seconds behind Jeptoo, while Tufa fell back to eighth.</p><p>Jelena Prokopcuka of Latvia, the 2005-06 New York champ, placed third at age 37.</p><p>Security was tight from the moment the runners arrived on Staten Island. They were corralled into long bag-check lines, and officers and volunteers repeatedly reminded them to keep cellphones out.</p><p>\"Security is 100% tougher than what I've seen at other races,\" said Chris Patterson of Rochester, New York, who was signed up for the marathon last year and ran in Boston this April.</p><p>Elizabeth Hutchinson of Seattle recalled the joy at the starting line in Boston this year. People were handing out sunscreen, Band-Aids and energy gels.</p><p>On Staten Island, she said, \"the machine guns are very visible.\" \"The atmosphere is so different,\" she said, \"It kind of makes me sad.\" </p><p>Charles Breslin, who lost his home in the storm and was volunteering at the marathon, welcomed the race's return. \"I don't know how the rest of Staten Island feels about, but it can only be a good thing,\" he said. \"You have to get back to normalcy.\"</p><p>As the professional women approached Central Park, only a sprinkling of onlookers stood at the police barricades. Ginny Smith, a Manhattan resident who comes to watch each year, said she felt \"very frustrated\".</p><p>Three hours after she first arrived at the park, she was finally allowed to walk in. At Columbus Circle, near the 26th and last mile of the route, police kept her waiting for two hours.</p><p>\"It was difficult, it was horrible for something that's basically for the people,\" she said. \"It's unbelievable; you would think there was a war in the city.\"</p><p>Ashley O'Brien of Brooklyn was ready with a bullhorn to cheer members of her running group, the Hudson Dusters. She got teary-eyed remembering the events of the past year.</p><p>\"It's a nice time to all come back together,\" she said. \"You still remember why it was canceled last year and you remember Boston. So it's a little bittersweet.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421576093|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|62f6d6fa1c4d68701a52ed469473c041d1d4c77c -->",

        "headline":"NFL inquiry: Miami Dolphins rookies allege racial and financial abuse",
        "body":"<p>The National Football League has launched an inquiry into alleged locker-room bullying at the Miami Dolphins, including claims that one junior player was racially abused and that lower-paid newcomers were expected to finance the expensive luxury lifestyles of multi-millionaire teammates.</p> <p>Club officials suspended Richie Incognito, a senior offensive guard, for “conduct detrimental to the team” after receiving a formal complaint from representatives of Jonathan Martin, a young player who walked out during a training session a week ago and who has not returned to Miami since.</p> <p>Incognito, a self-described “wild child” on his Twitter profile, is alleged to have sent Martin a series of threatening text messages and at least one voicemail in which he<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9926139/richie-incognito-miami-dolphins-used-slurs-messages-jonathan-martin\"> called Martin a &quot;half nigger&quot;, according to ESPN. </a>They added that the “intimidation” stretched back into the 2012 season.</p> <p>The wider inquiry by NFL officials is also expected to look into an alleged culture of bullying in the Dolphins locker room, especially charges that rookie players who are paid the league minimum salary of $390,000 were almost bankrupted by the financial burden imposed on them by veteran players.</p> <p>One of the reported claims against Incognito, which he has denied, is that he pressured Martin, a left tackle in his second year with the Dolphins, to pay $15,000 towards an unofficial players’ trip to Las Vegas that he did not attend.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another senior Dolphins player posted on Twitter a photograph of teammates enjoying a lavish seafood dinner with the caption: “Everything tastes better when rookies pay for it.”</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JaredOdrick98/statuses/396497315357523968\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Everything tastes better when rookies pay for it <a href=\"http://t.co/KGaisEfap2\">pic.twitter.com/KGaisEfap2</a></p>— Jared Odrick (@JaredOdrick98) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaredOdrick98/statuses/396497315357523968\">November 2, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>A colleague tweeted that he had seen a dinner bill for $30,000, which the junior players were expected to pay, prompting one anonymous participant to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/11/04/3729152/incognito-dolphins-push-back-against.html\">tell the Miami Herald&nbsp;</a>that several seniors on the team used their rookie colleagues as their “personal ATMs”.</p> <p>On Monday, a spokesman for the Dolphins referred media inquiries to the official club website, which contained a series of three statements released through the day on Sunday as events unfolded.</p> <p>In the first, the club’s tone appeared defiant. The statement did say that accusations of player misconduct were always taken seriously, but it denied that the NFL Players’ Association was investigating and included a line that said: “The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally.”</p> <p>Later, after Martin’s representatives filed his formal complaint, a second statement announced that an internal review would take place, and that the club had asked the NFL to “conduct an objective and thorough review.”</p> <p>“As an organisation, we are committed to a culture of team-first accountability and respect for one another,” it said.</p> <p>Finally, the club announced its indefinite suspension of Incognito, a decision it said it believed was: “in the best interest of the organisation at this time”.</p> <p>Incognito, 30, is in the final year of a three-year, $11m contract with the Dolphins. When the allegations against him were first aired on ESPN on Sunday, he ranted on Twitter against Adam Schefter, the journalist who reported them, and dismiss the claims as “lies”.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Stop slandering my name. You hide behind ‘sources’ who are not man enough to put their name behind the BS you report,” he wrote in one tweet. In another, he tells Schefter: “Enough is enough. If you or any of the agents you sound off for have a problem with me, you know where to find me.”</p> <p>In the last message posted before just before his suspension was announced, Incognito wrote: “I want my name CLEARED.” His account has been inactive since.</p> <p>On the field, Incognito’s suspension comes at a crucial time for the Dolphins, who beat Cincinnati in overtime on Halloween night to end a three-game losing streak and reach the halfway point of the season at 4–4, still with hopes of reaching the end-of-season play-offs.</p> <p>Martin has told friends he plans to take a few weeks away from the club to deal with “emotional issues,” according to Fox Sports. Joe Philbin, the Dolphins head coach, and several teammates have said he would be welcomed back “with open arms”.</p> <p>DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFL Players’ Association, said his organisation would “take a hard look, and stay on top of” Martin’s situation.</p> <p>An official statement from the NFL on Sunday said the league had been talking to the Dolphins since last Monday, when Martin, 24, left the club after an alleged lunchtime prank in which a group of players stood up and walked off as he joined their table with his tray of food.</p> <p>“We have been in contact with the team on this matter since last week and we will conduct a thorough review,” the statement said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647963|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|ebceb8805dcac6f8fc02008190a518d4128385a5 -->",

        "headline":"MLS playoffs: Timbers and Galaxy hold advantage in the West",
        "body":"<h2><strong>First leg nightmares for Seattle</strong></h2> <p>Seattle's MLS life is only five years old, but the franchise is already strong on tradition, be it their supporters' six-block walk from Occidental Park to CenturyLink Field (March to the Match) or the players' post-match lap of gratitude after each home performance. Unfortunately, despite being a constant presence in MLS's postseason, the Sounders have developed another more dispiriting tradition: Underperforming in opening legs.</p> <p>• In 2009, Seattle was held to a 0-0 at home against Houston in the conference semifinals.</p> <p>• The next year, LAwon 1-0 in Seattle, putting the Sounders on a path to another semifinal exit.</p> <p>• In 2011 Seattle were blitzed in Utah, losing 3-0 to Real Salt Lake.</p> <p>• Last year, the team out-performed RSL in the first leg at home, even though the match ended 0-0. In the conference final, however, the Galaxy won the opening leg in Carson, 3-0.</p> <p>Coming into this postseason, Seattle had played five opening legs, lost three, and have never scored a goal, a pattern of underachievement that continued through 90 minutes Saturday at CenturyLink. Opening a series which will serve as the final say for regional bragging rights, the Sounders gave up a goal to rival Portland against the run of play in the 15th minute. Just after the hour, a sublime touch before a right-footed blast allowed Darlington Nagbe to double Portland's lead:</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j66XDaOf-U\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4j66XDaOf-U?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>Seattle had played fine – their quantity of chances serving as a post-match silver lining – yet there they were: at home, in a playoff opener, against their arch rivals, down by two.</p> <p>Seattle were the much more dangerous side through the match's final moments, their desperation paying off in the 90th minute when Osvaldo Alonso broke through, recording the first opening leg goals in the team's playoff history. Yet though it ended a 540-minute scoreless drought, the score did little to change the bigger picture. There's something endemic to this team that's causing this 'First Leg Syndrome'.</p> <p>Is it mentality? That's been suggested before. Preparation may be a different way of saying the same thing. Are these results the product of most of these first legs being at home against higher seeds? Or maybe we're assuming home field is worth more than it is? (More on that subject in a while).</p> <p>Regardless, Seattle's down 2-1 after Saturday's result and with a tough assignment to win through in Portland. <strong>RF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Is this finally New York’s year?</strong></h2> <p>Fans and media keep looking for fissures, scanning for signs that these are the same old Red Bulls, a talented team of anti-destiny that never, ever seems to equal the sum of its pricey parts.&nbsp;Once past some early season struggles, first-year manager Mike Petke’s club found its feet (it’s extremely talented feet, it must be said) and has reliably improved through the months, consistently gathering momentum, steadily identify the best individual roles.</p> <p>The Red Bulls may have to squint to see it today, after&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/houston-dynamo-vs-new-york-red-bulls-live\">a match that got away somewhat in Houston, but Petke’s men remain in fairly good shape following a 2-2 road draw</a>&nbsp;in the first leg of a home-and-away conference semifinal series. The loss of commanding center back Jamison Olave to a (needless, heedless and careless) red card gives Wednesday’s return leg a more tenuous feel, but there is every reason to believe this Red Bull version, locker room intact and egos mostly in check, can manage this one out just fine.</p> <p>Two main reasons, in fact: The first, blindingly illuminated over a telling first-half on a sunny fall Sunday in Texas, is the yawning talent gap that exists between these two Eastern Conference clubs.</p> <p>That, and the fact that Dominic Kinnear’s strange mastery (wizardry, really) of the MLS playoffs can only go so far. The Dynamo manager clearly knows his way around the post-season, but … well, see the first reason.</p> <p>Petke’s tactics were perfect for a match at BBVA Compass Stadium, which features the league’s narrowest pitch. New York perfected the approach while winning twice there in the regular season by a combined 7-1. The field is too small to dilly-dally with pretty possession, so Petke’s team doesn’t bother. They sit and counter, and do so with brutal efficiency thanks to wily and sophisticated vets like Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill. Even newfound playmaker Peguy Luyindula, a Frenchman schooled at Lyon, Marseille and PSG, knows just where to find the space, where and when to quickly collect the ball in transition. From there, Henry and Cahill’s movement, instinctive and sharp, can be overwhelming for younger, less sophisticated defenders.</p> <p>And it didn’t help that Houston was missing one center back, underrated Jamaican international Jermaine Taylor. Replacement Eric Brunner had a bad, bad day, culpable on both of the visitors’ first-half goals, one on Cahill’s sharp header and one from Eric Alexander. New York took a 2-0 lead into intermission.</p> <p>The return leg will be tense because Houston, abetted by Olave’s 65th minute ejection –staying on the field was always the guy’s issue, whether due to injury or suspension, which is why Real Salt Lake traded the big Colombian in winter, even though he could dominate like so few in MLS – found two second-half strikes through shear will, pressure, one deflection and one stoppage time goal-mouth scramble. It was classic Dynamo defiance, determined stuff from a team that gets the very most from its collection of draft picks and bargain bin finds. (New York started three Americans and a bunch of foreign-trained types; Houston’s lineup featured nine home-grown Americans.)</p> <p>But will this be enough? Can Houston, a straight 4-4-2 bunch with two midfield toilers but not an ounce of central creativity, dig up enough chances on the road? Cahill sounds confident, and rightly so. Here’s how he explained the squandering of a two-goal lead, while sounding quite resolute about the impending result: “We had a red card, and on the second goal we didn’t pick up the runner. It happens in football. But we’re a strong team; we can play away from home … so there’s a lot of good things we can take away from this.”&nbsp;<strong>SD</strong></p> <h2><strong>Real Salt Lake playing with fire</strong></h2> <p>It was the turning point in last season's march to MLS Cup. Los Angeles had left Carson down a goal to San Jose, but after an early Robbie Keane goal had pulled the Galaxy even, Landon Donovan pulled the strings on one of LA's trademark counter attacks, finding Keane cutting across the back of the defense for an easy go-ahead goal. The Galaxy never relinquished that lead, their counter attack key to eliminating the Supporters' Shield winners on their way to a second-straight MLS Cup.</p> <p>During their run to back-to-back titles, that type of ruthless precision has become their calling card: Donovan pressing forward with the ball while Keane's runs dissect a defense. Transcending two years and seven playoff matchups, no opponent has stopped LA's most dangerous weapon, a reality that defined Real Salt Lake's approach to Sunday night.</p> <p>The West's second seed made the surprise choice of injecting Yordany Alvarez into the lineup, giving the Claret and Cobalt a destroyer to accompany Kyle Beckerman at the base of midfield. Though LA found other ways to threaten, their transition was muted, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/la-galaxy-vs-real-salt-lake-live\">only Sean Franklin's early second half blast</a> separating the sides:</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU81vwk2JuU\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jU81vwk2JuU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>By the hour mark, Jason Kreis wanted that goal back. Not content to take a one-goal deficit back to Utah, the RSL boss pulled Alvarez, brought on Robbie Findley, and left Beckerman to protect the defense. What ensued was 30 minutes of increased RSL pressure and seemingly endless Galaxy counters.</p> <p>Surprisingly, RSL survived. Donovan and Keane stayed high, were found with relative ease by their teammates, yet could not break down Nat Borchers and Chris Schuler. RSL's central defenders, playing as if they'd spent the last 10 days working on counters, elected to give space, allow Donovan to carry the ball deep before making a decision, and refrained from making any commitments that would open space for Keane to exploit. Eventually, Donovan was either forced into a low percentage decision or hurried by players tracking back.</p> <p>Whether that plan is sustainable for leg two depends on your interpretation of the results. Despite numerous chances on the break, Keane and Donovan didn't break through, but there were so many times a sprawling block or bad touch decided the outcome, you can't help but think RSL are playing with fire. Then again, maybe you can't stop LA's counter unless you risk getting burned. <strong>RF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Lessons learned by Sporting Kansas City … or were they?</strong></h2> <p>Almost exactly one year ago, a strong Kansas City side with two standouts who would soon be Premier League men, went into Houston for an MLS playoff. Peter Vermes’ side, driven then by Roger Espinoza industry and Kei Kamara’s shear physical capacity, fell behind by a goal in the first-leg.</p> <p>Thing is, Vermes’ club had just one gear then, only one hell-bent, hard-pressing speed. And they leaned into it, chasing the deficit, straining to scoop the draw and hoping to jet home sitting pretty in the home-and-away clash.</p> <p>Instead, Sporting KC conceded a second goal, and Vermes quickly wondered aloud if perhaps his team should have re-considered those critical moments? Sure enough, back at home a few nights later, KC pressed and shot and crossed and huffed and puffed … but could ultimately put just one goal past Houston’s besieged back line. Houston advanced. Vermes, having watched a formidable bunch ousted for a second consecutive year in maddeningly similar style, reconfigured his team’s approach to the game. He wanted a little less hurry and harry, a little more possession and thoughtful design.</p> <p>So, uh … what happened?</p> <p>Saturday night outside Boston, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/02/new-england-revolution-sporting-kansas-city-live\">his men of ample playoff experience came up against a far less experienced New England Revolution bunch</a>, one that hasn’t seen playoff soccer since former Liverpool man Steve Nicol took the team to the 2009 post-season. Only, it was New England that managed the match with prudence rather than Sporting KC.</p> <p>The soccer was fairly terrible thanks to a hideous field – artificial turf, shortened to just 106 yards, slick from rain and blighted by those dizzying American football lines that crush the game’s aesthetic, pretty much the sum of all fears for anyone hoping to enjoy a match. But New England made the safe plays, only bothered on occasion when Sporting’s U.S. international Graham Zusi could pick out a pass or two. Zusi, in fact, was the only attacking player who found the passing speed through the messy first 45 as the defenses were clearly in charge.</p> <p>New England was better after the break, slowly adding players into the attack, and the controversial first goal came from Andy Dorman. Three men were clearly offside – or clearly onside – depending on which way your Twitter feed leaned. Truthfully, this was a tough one, as a ball pinged around before Dorman’s tap-in. (The original shot came from 18-year-old Diego Fagundez, the team’s fabulously talented 13-goal scorer.) Incensed Kansas City men did not handle this well, immediately undone, frustrated, lobbying, hollering, pressing, fouling, etc. And what happens then?</p> <p>Yep, a second goal. Just 12 minutes later, Stoke City-bound Juan Agudelo and playmaker Lee Nguyen sliced through the visitors’ defense, <a href=\"http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=1217310cfc944c6abc338a459554666&amp;ec=4yY2hwZzrZEhDBGcEGT98g6EMQZK8may\">arranging a sly finish from underrated second-year man Kelyn Rowe</a>.</p> <p>Vermes’ team got a little lucky when the Revolution’s impulsive midfielder Dimitry Imbongo fouled unnecessarily along the flank. The resulting free kick, parlayed with some marking that simply will not cut it, halved deficit. But that was somewhat lucky – and now Kansas City must return home, needing to two goals to advance.</p> <p>Does that sound familiar?&nbsp;<strong>SD</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/mlscup/2013/bracket\">Playoffs format</a> questions</h2> <p>For eight months the teams of Major League Soccer slog through a long-haul regular season for the right to go to the playoffs. Nine teams out of 19 are eliminated by this process. Six more are eliminated in the next week. Twelve days into the playoffs, only three games of the MLS season will remain. And yet these three games will be spread out over a month.</p> <p>MLS pushes through the playoffs with indecent haste. On Wednesday playoff games are even scheduled at the same time when these are surely the games that the league hopes all fans will watch, not just the supporters of those teams.&nbsp;(And that's not even getting into the bewildering array of broadcasters that are showing the games).</p> <p>So, the playoffs are complicated by an international weekend breaking up the pattern. Regular season games went ahead during the international weekends, though. With the USA playing on Friday and Tuesday, would it not have made sense for a big weekend of US soccer to feature internationals&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;playoff games?&nbsp;</p> <p>The compressed nature of <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/mlscup/2013/bracket\">the early playoff schedule</a> is also surely to the detriment of the teams that have battled all year for the better regular season record? Because the higher seeded teams play the first leg on the road, it means that they will face more travelling in a very short time. If the Red Bulls overcome Houston in the second leg, they will then travel to SKC or New England. Two aways game and one at home in ten days. What advantage is there in that? The higher seed will have the benefit of hosting extra-time and penalties should the ties be level after 180 minutes (with no away goals rule in use). But that's it.</p> <p>This is the showpiece time of year for MLS. Surely they would want to make the most of it?&nbsp;<strong>SB</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421629650|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|37b2554277b385dd8ead9f6f96ed59a19cd0d63b -->",

It feels like the NBA season just came to an end, but that might just be a byproduct of how long its postseason lasts. Weren't the San Antonio Spurs like <em>just</em> about to win the NBA Finals, it was so clear that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/19/san-antonio-spurs-miami-heat-nba-finals-live\">Miami Heat fans left American Airlines Arena rather than witness the end of all-but-certain end of their season</a>. Of course, then Ray Allen hit the biggest three of his life, and he has hit many threes in his long basketball life, and suddenly the Miami Heat weren't just alive they were in command of the series as they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2013/jun/21/miami-heat-nba-champions-in-pictures\">won their second straight NBA Finals in Game Seven</a> to cap off an end of a surprisingly entertaining postseason. </p><p>In case you missed it, it went something like this:</p><p><em></em><br />So what now? Can the Heat plan for a three-peat? Can a team emerge from the Eastern Conference that could challenge them? Who will emerge from a tough, crowded Western Conference to make the NBA Finals. What will the networks do if both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics suck? Will Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook be healthy? Will JaVale McGee make any sense? (Spoiler alert: No.) Will fans start to like Dwight Howard again? Will we, gasp, actually end up missing outgoing commissioner David Stern, set to retire midway through the season?</p><p>(For a more in depth look at most of the major moves franchises made this offseason, there's this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/31/nba-offseason-winners-losers-celtics-nets-lakers-rockets\">guide to the major free agent signings and trade acquisitions</a> as well as this breakdown of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/28/nba-draft-number-one-anthony-bennett\">David Stern's farewell edition of the NBA Draft</a>.)</p><h2>EASTERN CONFERENCE</h2><h2>Atlantic Division</h2><p><strong>NEW YORK KNICKS</strong></p><p>Can the New York Knicks win it all with a team built around Carmelo Anthony? It's not a particularly fair question mind you, especially in a league where the bigger question is \"Can any team in the East win when built around Not LeBron James?\" With rebuilding Boston Celtics solidly in the Knicks' rear-view mirror, although their old friends will still visit in the guise of the Brooklyn Nets, this might be the team's best shot to prove they could make the Eastern Conference Finals with the talented but limited Anthony as their leader.</p><p>Now, how far can they get? Well, the Miami Heat are more vulnerable this year than they were last year, and don't let Michael Jordan fool you, three-peating ain't easy and the Knicks have an interesting lineup. While Carmelo Anthony's game might be almost as underrated by current statistics as it is overrated by the eye test, he will get his team points and Tyson Chandler still should be able to help on the defensive end. They'll see what they can get out of the legally-obligated-to-call-him-enigmatic Andrea Bargnani and the hard-partying J.R. Smith, who wants to jump from Sixth Man role to the starting rotation. Metta World Peace is a Knick now, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiZ-XgJKAIk\">in a very real Jack Torrance in \"The Shining\" sense, he's always been a New York Knickerbocker</a>. The 2013-14 Knicks are very talented yet also exceedingly flawed, which makes them maybe the most Eastern Conference-y team in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>While the Heat could very easily find itself fighting with the risen Derrick Rose's Chicago Bulls or in a rematch with the Indiana Pacers, it seems inevitable that LeBron and the Miami Heat would have to face off against Melo and the New York Knicks at least once with an NBA Finals visit on the line. Do the guys from Gotham have an actual shot to knock out the King? That might be a tougher thing to predict.

Yes, after a somewhat disappointing first year in Brooklyn the Nets have decided to become the Knicks' newest rival by incorporating bits of their previous biggest rival, trading for Boston Celtics legends Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett (and also, to a much lesser extent, Jason Terry). Combined with Deron Williams, Joe Johnson and Brook Lopez, this configuration gives the Nets one of the best looking starting lineups on paper, or at least one of the most expensive ones. Can they all cohere into a proper team before Russian owner Mikhail Prokhorov gets sick of paying for his new toy? It's up to first year coach Jason Kidd, just months after the end of his playing career, to mold this group of past and present All-Stars into something remotely resembling a team. Will the fact that he's still seen more of as a player make him the perfect choice to lead this pack of veterans, or will his lack of any (seriously any at all) managerial experience come back to haunt Nets ownership?</p><p>Overall this feels like another failed \"fantasy dream team\" experiment that franchises keep trying to piece together out of big-named big-budget players. If the guys who used to play in New Jersey (Deron Williams, Brook Lopez) don't step up, expect them to go the way of last season's Lakers.</p><p><strong>X-factor</strong>: <strong>Brook Lopez</strong>. He has the opportunity to establish himself as the best center in the Eastern Conference, particularly if the Pacers' Roy Hibbert has another rough regular season and Andrew Bynum is once again in \"back of the milk carton\" mode.</p><p><strong>TORONTO RAPTORS</strong></p><p>The Toronto Raptors reminded casual fans that they exist last season when they traded for Rudy Gay, a strange all-in moment for a team that wasn't likely to reach the playoffs last year and only have a shot this year because the Eastern Conference is as watered down as the liquor bottle in an Eugene O'Neill play. An all-scoring ballplayer, Gay's numbers have been on the downswing for a few years now, but Toronto hopes that he will be better now that <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/rudy-gay-vision-problems-terrible-could-hardly-license-181035727.html\">he's getting a vision problem corrected</a>. </p><p>Sure, the Raptors' second option might be Kyle Lowry at point guard, but still things are looking a little sunnier for the Raptors this season, if only because they can't quite possibly disappoint Toronto as much as the Blue Jays did over in MLB. The Raptors hired new GM Masai Ujiri, a move that was solidly praised and they are contemplating rebuilding . There's even talk of a long overdue name change, which is even better news unless one happens to be a huge \"Jurassic Park\" fan.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Rudy Gay</strong>. It had to be tough to see the Memphis Grizzlies not only succeed without him but for being on the receiving end of \"addition by subtraction\" arguments. Expect him to be beyond motivated this season.</p><p><strong>BOSTON CELTICS</strong></p><p>The Boston Celtics will not be good next season, and, in fact, if they are good and in danger of departing from the realm of lottery teams, management will start to trade away pieces. If Rajon Rondo recovers from his ACL injury faster than expected and shows he's still the same player, GM Danny Ainge will trade him if he gets the right offer. If the Celtics <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/22/boston-red-sox-al-east-playoffs\">take a page from their baseball brethren and go on some sort of unexpected win spree</a>, ownership will put an end to all that and dismantle them. The only reason to watch the Boston Celtics play basketball this season is that they will be incredibly interesting, but not interesting in a \"score more points than the other team\" sort of way.</p><p>The Big Three are all gone. Ray Allen is now a Miami postseason hero. Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett are out there in Brooklyn as part of the World's Most Expensive Fantasy Team. Doc Rivers is a Clipper now, working with Chris Paul is his reward for having to deal with Rondo for all of these years. In his place Boston has hired college coach Brad Stevens, <a href=\"http://www.deseretnews.com/top/132/4/Butler-did-it-Top-NCAA-Tournament-moments-so-far.html\">the man most responsible for all of those \"Butler Did It\" headlines</a>. Stevens could be a fine NBA coach, but this almost certainly will be a training wheels year for him. No wonder longtime Celtics flagship WEEI <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/sports/touching_all_the_bases/2013/08/celtics_will_no_longer_air_on_weei.html\">didn't renew their contract this year</a>.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Avery Bradley</strong>.

Instead, their clear priority is landing one of the top picks in what promises to be <a href=\"http://www.sheridanhoops.com/2013/10/17/nba-draft-2014-very-early-mock-lottery/\">one of the most loaded NBA Drafts in recent memory</a>.</p><p>So, the goal this season is to land the best chance of winning one of the first two slots in the draft lottery, which means losing as many game as possible, which means the likes of Evan Turner and rookie Michael Carter-Williams will be on your 76ers program guides. \"Tanking\" of course is such an ugly word for fans who want to believe that their team is at least trying to win, so let's just call it something like \"being strategically noncompetitive\". And this season, this 76ers team has a shot to be the most strategically noncompetitive team in NBA history.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Nerlens Noel</strong>. Wait, what he's going to be out the entire season, man that's gotta hurt the team's win total. (Cut to 76ers executives partying gleefully to the tune of Loverboy's \"Working For The Weekend\")</p><h2>Central Division</h2><p><strong>CHICAGO BULLS</strong></p><p>Keys to the game: Derrick Rose. Derrick Rose, Derrick Rose, Derrick Rose. The Chicago Bulls season will be entirely about the return of their former MVP from ACL injury, he injured his before it was cool. Derrick Rose <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/23355728-761/vindicated-derrick-rosesilences-critics-bulls-go-8-0-in-preseason.html\">has looked good in the preseason</a>, which is encouraging because \"seeing how players returning from injuries look\" is quite possibly the only worthwhile reason to pay attention to preseason games. If he stays healthy and productive he can return to his 2011 peak era identity as LeBron's Eastern Conference Rival.</p><p>In hindsight, the idea that the Chicago Bulls could have beaten the Miami Heat last year with Derrick Rose back at 75% seems absolutely ludicrous, the byproduct of two memorable Heat defeats (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/28/chicago-bulls-end-miami-heat-streak\">one in the regular season</a>, the other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/07/nba-playoffs-heat-bulls-spurs\">in the playoffs</a>). Still, they revealed they had the heart of a championship team. In Rose's absence, Joakim Noah developed more of a leadership role and Jimmy Butler flourished. Luol Deng should continue to be the rotation's rock if head coach Tom Thibodeau avoids overworking to the point of exhaustion and/or possible death. </p><p>Assuming that Rose's return doesn't negatively affect this newfound chemistry, and the core three (Rose, Noah, Deng) stay healthy, the Bulls should be the second best team in Eastern Conference and Miami's clearest rival. That might be too much of an \"if' though, especially considering that no one player has shown the difference that injuries can make than their former MVP.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Every internet and sports radio tough guy who called out Derrick Rose last season</strong>.

Although they played the Miami Heat tough in the 2012 NBA playoffs, Paul George made that all-important \"leap to the next level\" last season <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/02/heat-pacers-game-six-seven-nba-playoffs\">as his team pushed the Heat to seven games</a>. For a moment it seemed possible that Roy Hibbert, who struggled for much of the regular season, may have just figured out LeBron James.</p><p>He hadn't, of course, LeBron James isn't a math problem to be solved. Miami survived the challenge in the Eastern Conference Championship and moved on to an even closer match against the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals. While the Finals might have obscured what Indiana did in the series before, it shouldn't have because at this point the Pacers clearly aren't a fluke. This is a complete team, George, Hibbert, George Hill and David West play off each other as well as almost anybody in the league, maybe even the vaunted Spurs. The bad news for the Pacers is they won't be sneaking up on anybody this year, not with Paul George rapidly approaching star status around the league, and the league gets a lot more difficult once people start building expectations around you.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Danny Granger</strong>. Do the Pacers incorporate him back into the lineup when he's healthy, or does he become trade bait? There are worse problems a team could have.</p><p><strong>CLEVELAND CAVALIERS</strong></p><p>What happens when you surround one of the best young players in the game with an injured big man who never played a meaningful minute with his previous team, a sixth man whose shooting was too inconsistent even for the Golden State Warriors, a player trying to switch shooting hands mid-career and one of the most surprising number one draft picks of all time? It sounds like the Cleveland Cavaliers are taking cues from their baseball brothers in the Cleveland Indians, or at least the movie version of them in \"Major League\", but this might actually be the lineup that takes the Cavs to their first post-LeBron postseason.</p><p>After having the number one pick in the NBA Draft two out the last three years, it feels like the Cavs will finally compete for their first post-Decision playoff spot. Besides snagging Anthony Bennett in this year's draft, the Cavaliers made several seemingly shrewd moves. They signed Andrew Bynum to a short-term deal, he could flourish as the best center in the conference or he could provide nothing, think of him as a lottery ticket, high upside and low risk. They signed Jarrett Jack fresh off a productive sixth man season for the Golden State Warriors. While Tristan Thompson isn't exactly new to the team, he might as well be, he has spent the offseason <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/14/tristan-thompson-talks-switch-from-left-to-right-handed-shooter/\">switching his shooting hand from his left to his right.</a></p><p>Who's the guy in charge of keeping together this ragtag group of misfits, it's Mike Brown straight off of being fired by the Los Angeles Lakers and, before that, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Apparently ownership is hoping that reviving this off-again/on-again relationship will result in the Cavs getting stronger on the defensive end, a key thing they'll need to improve this season. The good news is that no matter what works out and what doesn't, they have a constant in Kyrie Irving, one of the best ten players in the Eastern Conference as long as he can, and this is always the caveat, stay on the court.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Andrew Bynum</strong>. Well, for starters, it would be nice if he actually plays in a NBA game at some point.</p><p><strong>DETROIT PISTONS</strong></p><p>Welcome back to the NBA Playoffs Detroit! Okay if the Pistons do make it back to the playoffs, it will be more of an indictment on the Eastern Conference than a sign that the Pistons are moving forward. Still, if you're a Detroit fan it has to be nice to see this once proud franchise actually be in competition, if only for an eighth-seed.</p><p>With the Celtics, 76ers and Bucks all looking beyond vulnerable, Detroit ownership opened up their wallets in the free agent market and... picked up Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings. <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/7/31/4574400/brandon-jennings-trade-josh-smith-pistons-fans-shooting\">That sounds like fun and games until it happens to your favorite franchise</a>. The Pistons will win more games, but that's a lot of money tied up to a volatile combination that could be amazing but could also be a complete car wreck. </p><p>Speaking of possible car wrecks: <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/2013/news/09/25/pistons-add-wallace-as-coach.ap/\">Rasheed Wallace, Player Development Coach</a>. This is internet basketball comedy writing gold, people. Just imagine Sheed telling impressionable young players the correct way to pick up technical fouls, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5L_QkUZ-3s\">imparting wisdom about basketballs and the veracity of their claims</a> and telling them how to transform their public image from being one of the league's dirtiest players to a beloved b-ball eccentric.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Andre Drummond</strong>. It's been a while since the Pistons had a young star, most experts think they have a budding one in center Andre Drummond. (<a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/andre-drummond-may-be-dating-nickelodeon-star-jennette-mccurdy-after-meeting-on-twitter-090413\">He also has the best \"meet cute\" dating story of the NBA offseason.</a>)</p><p><strong>MILWAUKEE BUCKS</strong></p><p>It's not that the Milwaukee Bucks will be absolutely terrible, in fact that's their problem. Has any other NBA franchise desperately courted mediocrity for a longer time than the Milwaukee Bucks? Last season, the Bucks once again landed in the postseason only to be quickly knocked out by a far superior team. The only memorable moment about the whole affair was when Brandon Jennings <a href=\"http://thegoodpoint.com/brandon-jennings-guarantee/\">guaranteed a victory in their opening round series against the Miami Heat</a>. To no one's surprise this didn't pan out, and the Bucks actually traded away Jennings during the offseason: it's not really helpful to try to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIxIRkiThak\">channel Joe Namath</a> when you really have more in common <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdEAwFH4I34\">with Glass Joe</a>.</p><p>Still, there are reasons to watch the Bucks unlike some of the other Eastern Conference teams that have decided they would rather court Andrew Wiggins. Most of those reasons are thanks to Larry Sanders, who established himself as one of the league's most ferocious defenders and a surprising offensive threat. They've also picked up O.J. Mayo and Caron Butler and they still have John Henson, giving them not one but two players <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwxKAwQ669g\">who share their names with talk show hosts</a> (either real or fictional). That's something right?</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>LARRY SANDERS!</strong> Has any athLete gone from \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zosx1JialxE\">pop culture joke name</a>\" to potentially a difference making All-Star this quickly?

Photograph: Joe Skipper/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><h2>Southeast Division</h2><p><strong>MIAMI HEAT</strong></p><p>The Miami Heat come into the season once again as favorites to win the NBA Finals. A three-peat isn't out of the question, but this team has more question marks than it did this time last year and, keep in mind, their 2013 playoff run was more difficult than anyone expected. Dwyane Wade's knee is an issue, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/nba-durant-wade-jordan-lebron-trash-talk\">Kevin Durant may be right when he says that he might not be a top 10 player in the NBA any more</a>. Chris Bosh was underwhelming in last year's playoffs and he has quite possibly already peaked himself. Still, LeBron is the greatest player in basketball, possibly the best athlete in American sports right now, and in the NBA that will always be the biggest advantage a team could have. </p><p>This of course would be a different narrative coming into the season <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/19/san-antonio-spurs-miami-heat-nba-finals-live\">had Ray Allen not hit the greatest three-pointer in NBA Finals history</a>. Imagine if the Spurs had handed the Heat a season-ending defeat rather than going on to win game seven <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/21/miami-heat-san-antonio-spurs-finals-game-7-live\">to sew up their second straight championship</a>. Last year's playoffs remind us that the role players will always get their chance to make a difference. Last postseason the Heat got key contributions from Allen, Chris Andersen and Shane Battier. Former draft busts Greg Oden and Michael Beasley might not be locks to even make the team, but they aren't here as part of a charity program.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>LeBron James's impending free agency</strong>. You are going to be so, so sick of hearing about this. Even from this corner of the internet, we apologize in advance.</p><p><strong>ATLANTA HAWKS</strong></p><p>Al Horford is one of the best players in the league, Jeff Teague might be the best point guard that gets left off the \"best point guard\" conversation and now the Hawks have Paul Milsap, who somehow leaves Utah to a situation which is about as equally easy to overlook.</p><p>So once again the Atlanta Hawks put out a lineup that will end up being anywhere from aggressively mediocre to good-but-not-great. This appropriately enough puts the Hawks in about the same category as their compatriots in the Braves and Falcons. It's been 56 years since the Hawks won more than one playoff series which a) is ridiculous even for an Atlanta pro sports team and b) it also feels like it's been a lot longer. It also doesn't feel like this will end soon.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Lou Williams</strong>. He's still rehabbing from an ACL injury – who isn't in the NBA these days – but the guy can be a serious offensive weapon off the bench/Six Man of the Year candidate. <a href=\"http://www.peachtreehoops.com/2013/9/25/4768398/lou-williams-injury-return-date-atlanta-hawks\">The Hawks hope to have him back by December</a>.</p><p><strong>WASHINGTON WIZARDS</strong></p><p>Will this be John Wall's breakout year? The Washington Wizards hope so because they signed Wall to <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/7/31/4576108/john-wall-max-contract-extension-wizards\">a maximum extension worth $85 million during the offseason</a> with the hope that the talented young point guard would start to tap into his unused potential. Certainly the way he ended last season suggests that this could be the first fun year of Washington hoops <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/sports/2012/04/gilbert-arenas-finally-explains-why-he-pulled-out-four-guns-in-the-wizards-locker-room-in-december-2009\">since before Gilbert Arenas decided to pay tribute to the old Washington Bullets name</a>. (It would help if he were able to, you know, hit three-pointers.)<br /> <br />What about his supporting cast? As with everything in the NBA these days, it's all about health, particularly with the oft-injured Nene penciled in as the team's second option. Plus they have Emeka Okafor... <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/10/25/trade-marcin-gortat-emeka-okafor/\">what's that? Out indefinitely? And traded for Marcin Gortat? Oh uh well this is embarrassing</a>. Okay, if Nene and Gortat are actually in the lineup, and Bradley Beal expands his game in his second year in the bigs, Wall won't be doing this entirely alone.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>John Wall's ridiculous self-confidence</strong>. During this offseason, Wall <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/22999156/wizards-john-wall-believes-hes-the-best-point-guard-in-the-nba\">told reporters that he considers himself the best point guard in the league</a>. Laugh all you want, but if you're a Wizards fan that's exactly what you want to hear from your franchise star.</p><p><strong>ORLANDO MAGIC</strong></p><p>So, during the offseason, <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/9/12/4619946/orlando-magic-dwight-howard-trade-nikola-vukevic-arron-afflalo\">the Orlando Magic officially won the Dwight Howard trade</a>, and Magic fans should celebrate if only because there won't be very many more wins coming any time soon. Andrew Bynum didn't play a single game for the Philadelphia 76ers. Dwight Howard played most of the year of the Lakers, although some fans wished that weren't the case, almost certainly deliberately fouled out of his final game with the Lakers and then moved on to Houston. While Andre Iguodala ended up providing the most value to the Denver Nuggets, he opted out of his contract during the offseason to sign with the Golden State Warriors. That leaves Orlando as the only franchise to still have anything of any real value leftover (Aaron Affalo, Nikola Vucevic, Maurice Harkless) from the biggest trade of last year's offseason.</p><p>They also maybe have the most interesting player that came out of this year's draft in Victor Oladipo, whose preseason performance suggests that he may be one of those rare rookies capable of immediately doing some major offensive damage in his first year. But yeah, Orlando still needs a few more pieces to be a contending team, even in the Eastern Conference, so look for them to be fighting for lottery position with the 76ers and Suns this season.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis</strong>. Wait, he's still with Orlando right?</p><p><strong>CHARLOTTE BOBCATS</strong></p><p>The big news of the offseason? The Charlotte Bobcats have signed a big name free agent! Okay, so Al Jefferson isn't the biggest name available but the former Celtics prospect turned Utah Jazz semi-star is a name that casual NBA fans MAY actually recognize. That's rare for a Bobcats player, unless we're talking about \"recognizing as a punchline in a joke\". (In some circles, you can get laughs just by saying \"Adam Morrison\".)</p><p>Since changing one's team name is the hip things to do these days, unless you're Daniel Snyder, <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/the-charlotte-hornets-are-coming-back-824093267\">Charlotte is in line to reclaim the \"Hornets\" nickname next season</a> from the newly renamed New Orleans Pelicans. This works best for all sides, as the Hornets were meant to be a Charlotte team from the very beginning. It's always nice when an area has a nickname that really fits the surrounding area, your move next Utah.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Hornets mojo</strong>! It's not quite an exorcism, but a name change is as good a start as any at resetting this woeful NBA team.</p><h2>WESTERN CONFERENCE</h2><h2>Southwest Division</h2><p><strong>HOUSTON ROCKETS</strong></p><p>The Houston Rockets made a huge splash during the offseason when they convinced Dwight Howard to leave what was an increasingly bad – think Alex Rodriguez in New York bad – situation with the Los Angeles Lakers. While Howard should be healthier and more comfortable in Houston than he was in L.A., this is still Dwight Howard, a man as temperamental as he is talented. The Rockets look pretty dangerous now that James Harden, with a breakthrough year under his belt, is teamed up with the best center in the league, but will the two be able to play together?</p><p>After being relegated to Sixth Man duties with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Harden seemed absolutely liberated in his first full year with Houston. Will Harden be willing to return to more of a supporting role if Dwight Howard plays like his old Hall of Fame self? Will Omer Asik, whose skill set overlaps with Howard, demand a trade, and what could Houston get from him? The Houston Rockets already made the leap last season when Harden emerged as a MVP-caliber player, but Howard has a knack of solving some problems while creating others and the Western Conference is only getting tougher. The Rockets made the biggest and best move of the offseason, yes, but that doesn't guarantee that they will be anything but a tough out in the playoffs.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Jeremy Lin</strong>. Still a thing, although that thing may not end up being \"starting point guard in the NBA\".</p><p><strong>SAN ANTONIO SPURS</strong></p><p>Did Ray Allen kill the Spurs dynasty with his dagger three in Game Six of the NBA finals? Did the Heat shut down the Gregg Popovich/Tim Duncan Spurs' last real chance at winning another title by coming back in game six and winning it all in game seven? Let's go with \"probably not, because the Spurs never die\".</p><p>No one expected the 2012 team to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/02/boston-celtics-miami-heat-deshawn-stevenson-atm\">keep a winning streak alive until halfway through the Western Conference Finals</a>. No one expected the Spurs to make the NBA Finals, let alone be thirty seconds away from eliminating the Heat in a game six. Manu Ginobili may have had a rough postseason, but Kawhi Leonard put himself a half-step away from superstardom in this latest Spurs playoffs run. Tony Parker: Still a Top Five MVP voting threat. Tim Duncan: Still not making us believe he's anything other than a cyborg. Danny Green: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/12/danny-green-gary-neal-spurs-heat-3-point-record\">The dude can hit three-pointers</a>, just a little. Gregg Popovich: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ2W3wqNdHs\">Still awesomely curmudgeonly</a>. </p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Manu Ginobili</strong>. Will the Spurs actually have to deal with the consequences of aging to one of their key players this season? Nah, a New York team will probably just trade for him and give him a five year extension for no reason.</p><p><strong>MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES</strong></p><p>Congrats to Memphis for finally becoming interesting. Just one year ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/30/nba-2012-2013-season-preview\">thIS writer was resorting to Chuck Berry parodies</a> in lieu of saying anything about Zach Randolph, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. Then, of course, the club hired <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5980649/adrian-wojnarowskis-latest-column-features-a-sick-burn-on-john-hollinger\">some former cable sports employee </a>and did the number one thing designed to get more people talking about them: They traded away their best known player to Canada and then got better.</p><p>Can they make the Western Conference Finals again? That might be too much to ask for, although it would be great to see another Clippers/Grizzlies series in the playoffs. They have formed a true, natural rivalry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/26/clippers-grizzlies-best-action-playoffs\">that is quickly becoming one of the most interesting in the NBA</a>. Wherever Memphis goes, they will have to make it there without head coach Lionel Hollins, one of the most surprising victims of \"First thing we get rid of the head coaches\" uprising in the NBA this offseason. If the Grizzlies regress under the watch of new coach Dave Joerger, expect that move to be second-guessed, but this organization clearly doesn't mind risking their fanbase.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Tony Allen's Twitter account</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2013/2/17/3999480/tony-allen-twitter-nba-all-star-2013\">It's the best</a>.</p><p><strong>NEW ORLEANS PELICANS</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/69527/whats-in-a-name-why-the-pelicans-should-be-known-as-the-pellies\"><br />No we are not calling them the Pellies.</a></p><p>Say goodbye to the New Orleans Hornets. Despite the initial mocking, New Orleans have stuck with their decision to rename the team after Louisiana's state bird. Back when the Tampa Bay Devil Rays changed their name to the Tampa Bay Rays, all they did was make it to the World Series after not having a winning record before then. Can the New Or-</p><p>No. No they can't. The Western Conference is too darn stacked for them to have any hope of a Finals appearance, but will they be competitive this year? Absolutely. Certainly management thinks they will be, why else would they make a move to trade for Philadelphia's Jrue Holiday? Watch for Anthony Davis and his Unibrow to unleash a statement game or two against tough competition this season, and for Eric Gordon to quietly put up some nice numbers, just keep the expectations low. At least this year.<br /> <br /><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Austin Rivers</strong>: The goal is to improve on <a href=\"http://www.bourbonstreetshots.com/2013/04/24/season-in-review-austin-rivers/\">one of the worst NBA seasons anyone has ever had</a>.

Photograph: LM Otero/AP</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>DALLAS MAVERICKS</strong></p><p>Have the Dallas Mavericks already wasted Dirk Nowitzki's prime? Well, if nothing else this offseason, Mavericks fans have at least got to hear owner Mark Cuban's side of the story. After the Mavericks once again failed to rope a big name free agent to join along with Nowitzki in Dallas, this time it was that Dwight Howard fellow that everyone was coveting, Cuban <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/08/04/mark-cuban-dallas-mavericks-tanking/\">took to the internet to explain what the Mavs were trying to do and how they, well, failed</a>.</p><p>Is there hope? Let's hear it from their big free agent acquisition Monta Ellis <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/24/dallas-monta-ellis-says-he-is-passing-too-much/\">about his new role as the number two guy in the Mavs offense</a>: \"I'm looking for the pass too much\". Of course you are Monta. (Writer pencils them in for a 0% chance at making the postseason.) Oh and Ellis, <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-mavericks/headlines/20131011-new-stat-shows-mavs-monta-ellis-to-be-nba-s-worst-shooter-jose-calderon-league-s-best-from-outside.ece\">by at least one statistical measure the worst shooter in the NBA</a>, <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/01/monta-ellis-on-bad-shots-im-gonna-play-monta-ball/\">also is adamant that he is gong to play \"Monta-ball\"</a>. (Writer grabs pen, writes prediction that Dallas misses the playoffs again, this time in ink.)</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Shark Tank</strong>. Would owner Mark Cuban do some crazy, conference-shattering move <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E_TPgKMp-g\">just to promote his TV show</a>? Would you put it past him?</p><h2>Northwest Division</h2><p><strong>OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER</strong></p><p>It's been a tough twelve months for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Once thought to be the next dynasty of the Western Conference, the successor to the Lakers and Spurs, the Thunder instead traded James Harden to the Houston Rockets for a bunch of mostly departed spare parts, lost Russell Westbrook to injury in the middle of the playoffs and watched as Serge Ibaka did his best Sue Storm impression and turned invisible throughout the remainder of the postseason. </p><p>In other words, until Westbrook returns and is at something close to 100% this will be the Kevin Durant show, and you know what: The Kevin Durant Show is going to be awesome. We saw how Durant tried to put his entire team on his back after Westbrook went down in their series against the Rockets, it wasn't enough for a return trip to the Western Conference Finals but there's something incredibly fun about watching a guy as talented as Durant do everything. However, the team is going to need Russell Westbrook completely healthy and in full \"Beast Mode\" to reach their ultimate goal.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Kendrick Perkins</strong>. It's really remarkable to see how far Kendrick Perkins has gone without being amnestied: he's like the Inspector Clouseau of the bellow-average centers.</p><p><strong>DENVER NUGGETS</strong></p><p>What a weird year for George Karl, he received the Coach of the Year award and a pink slip from his bosses within the span of about a month. It has been a rough year for a Denver Nuggets team once again dealing with the aftereffects of an early playoff loss. Although the Nuggets got the best year out of Andre Iguodala that any team involved in the Dwight Howard Mega-Deal got out of any player, they weren't able to convince him to stay: Iguodala left for the Warriors at the end of the season. Injured Danilo Gallinari won't be back for the first few weeks of the season. </p><p>So, this is a franchise that has taken a step back. The main reason to follow the Nuggets is Kenneth Faried, which makes it bad news for Denver fans if <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9860683/32-bold-predictions-2013-14-nba-season\">Zach Lowe's prediction is right and he gets traded</a>. The second best reason to follow the Nuggets is JaVale McGee, who is also one of the major reasons not to pin one's hope and dreams on the Nuggets. </p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>JaVale McGee</strong>. The Human Lowlight Reel might just be <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lbB0M7dYPg\">the X-Factor of the entire league</a>.</p><p><strong>MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES</strong></p><p>The Minnesota Timberwolves of the last few years have gifted us <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAxARJyaTEA\">the basketball version of Burgess Meredith's glasses</a>. They look like they'll be the most fun team in basketball, and we'll have all the time in the world, but then Kevin Love and Ricky Rubio shatter into pieces during the regular season and it's just not fair... not fair at all. If you're a NBA fan, just pray to your preferred deity that we will have time enough to enjoy them at last.</p><p>Well, sometimes franchises make their own luck, and, for the most part at least, <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/david-kahn-ends-minnesota-timberwolves-career-blaze-excuse-173816338.html\">former GM David Kahn has been targeted as the T-Wolves' cooler</a>. Now that he's gone, Minnesota fans will have no one to blame for the things that will inevitably go wrong for them. Okay, other than when Kevin Love leaves because Kahn didn't want to offer him a maximum extension, that will totally be on him. </p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Kevin Love's health</strong>. And isn't it always for this team? </p><p><strong>UTAH JAZZ</strong></p><p>There will be no more slipping into the Western Conference playoffs via the seventh or eighth seed for the Utah Jazz. There are just too many strong teams, and it's not like the Jazz teams of the last few years was ever designed to do much damage in the postseason.</p><p>The Jazz could afford to let Al Jefferson and Paul Milsap go because they have a lot of young talent in the metaphorical pipeline. Plus, it's not like Jefferson and Milsap were LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, not exactly irreplaceable cogs of a legit title contender. It's safe to say that one or two of the Jazz's young players will perform well enough to get a decent sized feature in Sports Illustrated and maybe an All-Star Game appearance, but don't expect this year to be the one where you'll find many Jazz games on national television.</p><p>Unless of course, the Jazz make the playoffs and are interesting enough that the NBA won't be forced to hide them on NBA TV (unofficial home of every Atlanta Hawks playoff game). The trouble with that is, well, their competition in the West has become far more, well, competitive. Their best chance at finding themselves as high as the sixth seed in the postseason lies in a Conference shakeup. Salt Lake City is Eastern enough, right?</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Derrick Favors</strong>. Somebody's going to have to step up without Jefferson and Milsap and he's the most likely candidate.</p><p><strong>PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS</strong></p><p>Congrats Portand, you've become this year's Hardest Team To Say Anything Interesting About. Don't feel so bad, that was the Memphis Grizzlies last year and they ended <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/grizzlies/news/grizzlies-best-overall-pro-sports-franchise-espn-2013-ultimate-standings-130918\">up being named number one on \"ESPN: The Magazine\"'s best franchise list</a> after their 2012-13 campaign ended. The Trail Blazers's roster suggests that they most likely won't be making the same leap.</p><p>Damian Lillard was the deserved rookie of the year, in admittingly was somewhat of a down year for rookies, and LaMarcus Aldridge is the perennial Guy Who Will Become A Big Star When Inevitably Is On A Major Market Team. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/brook-lopez-dunks-twin-brother-robin-continuing-lifelong-022337324--nba.html\">Hey there's their big offseason acquisition: Brook Lopez... 's brother</a>.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: Let's go with <strong>Damian Lillard</strong> again here. Will he regress, step up or stay the same? That might be the story of Portland's season right there.</p><h2>Pacific Division</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421545864'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/29/1356792449097/Blake-Griffin-008.jpg' alt='Blake Griffin' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Can Blake Griffin and the Clippers finally break through?Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS</strong></p><p>The Los Angeles Clippers: Western Conference Champions. Don't laugh, it's more likely than you think. The San Antonio Spurs will have to start playing like they're older at some point, right? The Oklahoma City Thunder will most likely have to rely too much on their superstar Kevin Durant, while, conversely, that's exactly what their arch-enemies, the Memphis Grizzlies, lack. The Houston Rockets improved by picking up Dwight Howard, but that also means that they now have to deal with Dwight Howard. Ask the Los Angeles Lakers about the difference between Dwight Howard on paper and Dwight Howard in the locker room.</p><p>With the Clippers getting a huge upgrade at the coaching level by replacing Vinny del Negro with Doc Rivers, and adding a three-point threat with the signing of J.J. Redick, it's beyond time for the Clippers to finally go deep into the playoffs. The team most likely to block their way in the NBA Finals could very well be the Golden State Warriors, whose short-term success is wrapped up in the precarious health of Steph Curry and Andrew Bogut. Hey, worst case scenario they are still essentially guaranteed to be the best basketball team in Los Angeles for the second year in a row, that's not something Clippers fans will take for granted.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Blake Griffin</strong>. He seems willing to change his game and become more of an all-around player, he's even spoke about the Clippers moving away from their \"Lob City\" monicker. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IOSX-Hdqx0\">Maybe his time-traveling car could help him unlearn his previous bad habits</a>?</p><p><strong>GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS</strong></p><p>What if last year was their peak? While their surprising run to the Western Conference Finals, which included the two best NBA Playoff games that didn't involve a Ray Allen three at the buzzer, back-to-back, looked to have finally taken that jump from Fun Offensive Team to serious contender. However, with transcendent shooting guard Steph Curry's recurring ankle issues and center Andrew Bogut's recurring everything issues, they are not guaranteed to go that deep again. </p><p>What the Warriors need is health and a bit more emotional intelligence: Great teams need to learn how to close out games something which <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPAEj7U02B0\">they failed spectacularly at last season</a>. This is why one of the best moves any team made during the offseason was when Golden State let often great but sometimes inconsistent sixth man Jarrett Jack go to Cleveland while stealing Andre Iguodala away from the Denver Nuggets. Plus they still have Klay Thompson, David Lee, Harrison Barnes. Man, this team is going to be fun to watch. If healthy.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Steph Curry's ankle</strong>. Steph Curry can hit any shot. Literally anything. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/golden-state-warriors-hopes-rest-steph-currys-ankles-212900589.html\">He just needs to be able to get on the floor and that's not always possible</a>.</p><p><strong>SACRAMENTO KINGS</strong></p><p>The big news about the Sacramento Kings <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/17/sacramento-kings-arena-seattle-supersonics\">is that they actually still exist</a>, which looked like a complete improbability just nine months ago. The other big news is that DeMarcus Cousins will be a King for the foreseeable future. Notice the lack of differentiation between \"good news\" and \"bad news\" in those statements. Simply put: The good news is that Sacramento is keeping their sole pro team and their biggest athlete, the bad news is that this is referring to the Kings and Cousins respectively.</p><p>The Maloof family is on its way out, which is good news for everyone involved, and the seemingly-inevitable move to Seattle seems completely dead, sorry SuperSonics fans. Sacramento Kings fans have already witnessed two miracles, so any further positive developments this season would just be bonuses. It's not certain yet what the new owners will have as far as a long-term plan to improve their woeful team any better but, hey, unlike the Maloofs they will at least be interested in pretending like they have one.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/9750405/demarcus-cousins-signs-4-year-contract-extension-sacramento-kings\">DeMarcus Cousins's 4-year, $62 million contract</a>. Will the Kings' new owners be rewarded for their faith in their should-be franchise icon or will Cousins's newfound security just embolden him further?</p><p><strong>LOS ANGELES LAKERS</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/15/kobe-bryant-achilles-heel-la-lakers\">Kobe Bryant is recovering from an Achilles injury</a>. Owner Jerry Buss has sadly passed away. Steve Nash and Pau Gasol have gotten very old, very quickly. Dwight Howard is in Houston. It might be time for the L.A. Lakers to re- to rebu- to rebu- It's hard to even say the phrase the \"Lakers must rebuild\" let alone imagine them doing it. That's just not an acceptable option for Hollywood's preferred sports entertainment entity, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-doc-rivers-says-lakers-fans-can-blame-boston-for-their-covered-banners-20131024,0,6219863.story\">especially not when some coach from Boston has moved into their arena and is covering up all of their banners</a>!</p><p>Even if Kobe Bryant returns at 100%, and make no mistake he will be far from that when he makes his return as early as physically possible, the Lakers are a flawed team. This year will probably be remembered for the depressing sight of Steve Nash making friends with the necessity of his career dying, Pau Gasol not looking much better and Nick Young getting far, far too many minutes of playing time for a supposed contender. </p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Kobe Bryant's mysterious German doctors</strong>. <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2011/12/28/yankees-a-rod-saw-german-doctors-on-advice-from-kobe/\">Unless they're too busy working with A-Rod.</a></p><p><strong>PHOENIX SUNS</strong></p><p>Remember when a team that included Shaquille O'Neal, Steve Nash, Grant Hill and Amar'e Stoudemire was an actual Phoenix Suns roster with real postseason expectations rather than a rejected script for a basketball-related spinoff of \"The Expendables\"?</p><p>Well those were different times. These days, Shaq and Grant Hill are breaking into the media side of things. Steve Nash is decaying in L.A. and Amar'e Stoudemire's New York career is on life support. Now the Phoenix Suns turn to... turn to (flips through a media guide in a desperate search for any good news) uh Gerald Green? Okay, it doesn't appear that the Suns will actually be fielding anything close to an actual basketball team this season and are going all-in for the NBA Draft lottery. Can they out-do the 76ers in the \"strategically noncompetitive\" department? Stay tuned.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Not sure they have one</strong>.

        "headline":"Seabiscuit vs War Admiral: the horse race that stopped the nation",
        "body":"<p>President Franklin D Roosevelt had a lot on his plate at the White House on November 1 1938. Nazi Germany was building up for World War II. The stock market was struggling to find a way to come out of the Great Depression. And the country nearly went into a panic two days earlier when a young producer named Orson Welles broadcast a fictional alien attack on America with “War of the Worlds.”</p> <p>But during a cabinet meeting, he stopped all business of presiding over the nation to listen to the radio broadcast of a race between two horses 40 miles up the road in Baltimore.</p> <p>FDR, like an estimated 40 million people listening around the world, was captivated by the match race at Pimlico Race Course between Seabiscuit and War Admiral – one of the most anticipated sporting events of the 20th century.</p> <p>“Horse racing was in its heyday, and Seabiscuit was an enormous cult hero,” said Laura Hillenbrand, author of the best-selling book “Seabiscuit.”</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“He was the number one newsmaker in 1938, a star with the kind of magnitude you don’t see today.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>This race between two legendary horses was an event for the times, with America trying to climb out of the Great Depression. “It captured the imagination of the public,” said Edward Bowen, author of “War Admiral.”</p> <p>“It had all kinds of social implications,” he said.</p> <p>“The race gave people a temporary respite from the daily hardships caused by the Great Depression,” said Allan Carter, historian at the National Museum of Racing.</p> <p>Seabiscuit was the underdog, the Cinderella Man of racing. “He was the horse from the other side of the tracks who became a champion,” Hillenbrand said.</p> <p>War Admiral was the regal ruler of racing, the son of the great Man O’War (though Seabiscuit was related as well) who had won racing’s Triple Crown in 1937, an aristocratic horse that seemed unbeatable.</p> <p>And, like the great match race of 1823 between Eclipse and Henry that became a battle between the North and the South, Seabiscuit and War Admiral was a geographical war. War Admiral was the favorite of the established East Coast, while Seabiscuit was the upstart from West Coast racing.</p> <p>“It really was a territorial thing,” said horse trainer and racing historian John Shirreffs. “Anything west of the Rockies in those days in racing was not really taken seriously. That helped make this a big national event.”</p> <p>Match racing between two horses had been common in the 18th and 19th century, but had become less common in the 20th century. Still, there were some historic one-on-one races that took place, but none as big as Seabiscuit vs. War Admiral.</p> <p>Seabiscuit, who was also related to Man O’War through his son, Hard Tack, had fallen out of favor with its owners, a lazy, underachieving three-year-old who was pawned off to horse owner Charles Howard for just $8,000 in 1936.</p> <p>Howard hired trainer Tom Smith to work with Seabiscuit, and, as has been well documented in books and film, he and jockey Red Pollard began a remarkable rehabilitation of the previously-disappointing horse. After winning a few races in the East, Howard shipped Seabiscuit out West, where he would become the darling of racing and established his reputation as a winner. He would win 11 of 15 races in 1937 and was leading money winner in horse racing – the same year that War Admiral was winning the Triple Crown and given the prestigious American Horse of the Year Award.</p> <p>Horse racing dominated the sports pages during this time, and sportswriters began clamoring for a match race between War Admiral and Seabiscuit. “A horse race had the potential to attract a frenzy that would be difficult to imagine today,” Bowen said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Horse racing occupied a higher place in the public consciousness than it does now. Baseball, boxing and horse racing were the dominant sports of the time. And this horse race had all the ingredients that made a terrific story.”</p> </blockquote> <p>It had a hero – Seabiscuit – and a villain in War Admiral.</p> <p>“The media made War Admiral the villain,” Bowen said. “Bob Considine, one of the top sportswriters of his time, wrote an outlandish column that painted War Admiral as a spoiled kid who never had to work hard in his life. It was completely trumped up, but it reflected the image that other people had – that War Admiral was not a true champion. He had a piece of his hoof sliced off in the Belmont Stakes and still won the Triple Crown. He was a very game race horse himself.”</p> <p>His owner, though, Samuel Riddle, was not game for a match race against Seabiscuit. At least not in the beginning.</p> <p>Howard, Smith and Pollard were willing participants, eager for a chance for their horse to go up against the Triple Crown champion. The owner of Pimlico Race Course, home of the Preakness, Alfred Vanderbilt, was eager to host the race. But Riddle balked several times at attempts to make the match race.</p> <p>“Horse racing in the West was considered second rate,” Hillenbrand said. “War Admiral’s owner did not consider it dignified to have his horse run against a horse like Seabiscuit.”</p> <p>Howard worked the media to create pressure for the race. Weather, scheduling and money issues thwarted attempts to stage the race at various tracks around the country. After repeated offers by Vanderbilt, Riddle finally agreed to the race, for a surprisingly low purse of $15,000. But it had become a pride issue at that point. Each owner was determined to show their horse was the best in the land.</p> <p>Riddle, however, dictated the terms, and one key term appeared to heavily favor his horse.</p> <p>War Admiral did not fare well in starting gates. He hated the contraptions, and cut off a piece of his hoof struggling in the gate coming out of the Belmont Stakes, but was such a great horse, still managed to win the race.</p> <p>If Riddle was going to race his prize horse against Seabiscuit, he wanted it without a starting gate. They would use a bell to start the race, which gave the advantage to War Admiral. He was a speed horse – a fast starter -- and the horse that got out front first in these match races often wound up winning. Seabiscuit liked to run with the pack and then take the lead.</p> <p>Remarkably, Smith would change Seabiscuit’s racing style – something very difficult to do to a horse at this stage of their racing career. Secretly, he set up an alarm clock to get Seabiscuit to take off at the sound of a bell, until Seabiscuit became fast right out of the break.</p> <p>Before the race, Pimlico’s starting bell mysteriously disappeared, so track officials asked Smith if they could use his bell. “No one was ever able to confirm if Tom (Smith) took it,” Hillenbrand said. “But reporters said there was a sparkle in his eye when asked about it.”</p> <p>An important, emotional part of the Seabiscuit story was the rider. In February 1938, his jockey, Red Pollard, fell while riding Fair Knightess, another Howard horse. Pollard suffered chest and rib injuries, along with a broken arm. Howard picked a friend of Pollard’s and a successful jockey, George Woolf, to ride Seabiscuit.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-90981d10-0da0-4f4a-b178-90fd6d24211c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383315408596/192c79ac-4180-414b-8b9e-13e63693ac9c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Seabiscuit gets a carrot from owner Mrs Charles Howard in Baltimore\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Seabiscuit gets a carrot from owner Mrs Charles Howard in Baltimore the day after the big race. Photograph: AP</figcaption> </figure> <p>It rained in Baltimore in the days leading up to the race, and Seabiscuit did not like muddy tracks. The night before the face, Woolf walked the track in the dark, and found one particular track that was hardened a few feet from the rail. It would be Seabiscuit’s path to victory.</p> <p>The match race dominated the news leading up to the event. The country awaited the showdown between two great horses. Vanderbilt feared that Pimlico, which could handle a crowd of about 15,000 comfortably, couldn’t handle the crush of people that would want to see the race. So he scheduled it on a Tuesday, figuring the work day would keep the crowd down.</p> <p>But the country stopped for Seabiscuit vs. War Admiral. More than 40,000 people descended on the Baltimore track. An estimated 40 million more – including FDR – were listening on the radio.</p> <p>“They didn’t know what to do with all the people,” Hillenbrand said. “They funneled 10,000 people into the infield. People were hanging from the rafters in the grandstand. Thousands more were outside the track, hanging from trees, standing on rooftops. All of America was holding its breath for this race.”</p> <p>Hundreds of reporters descended on Pimlico. The track was lined with newsreel cameras. Here is how the legendary Grantland Rice, reported on the race:</p> <p>“A little horse with the heart of a lion and the flying feet of a gazelle yesterday proved his place as the gamest thoroughbred that ever faced over an American track.</p> <p>“In one of the greatest match races ever run in the ancient history of the turf, the valiant Seabiscuit not only conquered the great War Admiral but, beyond this, he ran the beaten son of Man O’War into the dirt and dust of Pimlico…..the drama and the melodrama of this match race, held before a record crowd keyed to the highest tension I have seen in sport, set an all-time mark.”</p> <p>Seabiscuit, who was 2-1 on the board at post time, while War Admiral was 1-to-4 on the board shocked War Admiral by getting off to a stunningly fast start and wound up winning the race by four lengths, posting a time of 1:56 3/5, breaking the track record.</p> <p>Thousands of fans descended on the track. It was a glorious, historic moment on the American landscape, with each horse playing its part. Seabiscuit was America’s darling, but War Admiral was his dance partner to racing immortality, the two of them stopping the world together on the first day of November in 1938.</p> <p><em>Thom Loverro is a Washington, D.C.-based writer , who also co-hosts a sports talk radio show on ESPN 980 in Washington and is the author of 11 books.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421391025|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|071e8389a6c44b3d8f9dc7ab1955fbb07ecc70f7 -->",

        "body":"<p>David Beckham has taken a break from being a Disney Knight, modeling underwear, going out on loan to Europe, and all other important Beckham-matters to express a strong interest in <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/premierleague/story/david-beckham-refuses-to-criticize-sir-alex-ferguson-for-comments-made-in-autobiography-103013\">owning an MLS franchise</a>&hellip;in Miami.</p> <p>MLS fans recall the two stages of Beckham-mania in the US. The first stage &ndash; lots of teeny boppers pay money to see Beckham play, gate receipts go up, but Beckham is often injured and the Galaxy suck. Then, the second era &ndash; Beckham gets his fitness, the Galaxy win trophies, but the aura and gate receipts return to earthly levels.</p> <p>Beckham the player had a great impact on MLS. He succeeded as a promoter and player. But Beckham the owner? I have doubts, largely irrespective of Sir David. Rather, I&rsquo;m suspicious about anything sports-related in Miami.</p> <p>I begin with a simple question: is Miami <em>really</em> a sports town? Let&rsquo;s look at the attendance stats for the current professional teams. The Miami Dolphins play in the NFL and American Football is easily the most popular sport in the US. Miami is currently <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/attendance\">20th out of 32</a> teams in terms of attendance. Sun Life Stadium has a <a href=\"http://www.sunlifestadium.com/about\">capacity of 75,000</a>, but the Dolphins draw about 67,000. That&rsquo;s still a pretty good occupancy rate. The Dolphins are also a middling team, so the interest is very good taking into account how poor the on-the-field product is.</p> <p>The next most popular sport is baseball. Miami&rsquo;s team, the Florida Marlins, succeed in hisses and fits. They&rsquo;ve won a few World Series, but also fielded some pretty bad teams during rebuilding years. Right now, the team&rsquo;s attendance is <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/attendance\">29th out of 3</a>0. That is awful. Deadspin <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/marlins-attendance-is-going-to-be-a-disaster-458672192\">predicted an attendance drop</a> this year and gleefully mocked <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2013/01/27/miami-marlins-have-become-baseballs-most-expensive-stadium-disaster/\">the public/private partnership responsible for the stadium</a>. On the plus side, the blue seats make for a serious deep blue sea &ldquo;<a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5903097/there-are-already-lots-of-empty-seats-at-marlins-games\">ocean vibe</a>&rdquo; when folks don&rsquo;t show up. Still, if Miami fans turn on a team in a league with a luxury tax like MLB, what would be they do when a team in a league with a salary cap (like MLS) has to rebuild? Then again, every team that fields a bad product will fail on some level. MLS is no exception.</p> <p>Soccer won&rsquo;t catch up with American Football or baseball for several decades, but is close behind basketball and hockey. Thus, comparisons to those sports may be more warranted. Still, the Miami Heat&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2012\">attendance is amazing</a>, but probably down more to winning championships and fielding the league&rsquo;s best player than general sports interest. In fact, if you look back at the team pre-Lebron, their attendance was usually <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2009\">middle of the pack</a>. In 2009, they drew about 18,000 and ranked 15th out of 30 teams. They were even ranked <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2001\">15th in 2001</a> before drafting Dwayne Wade, so they&rsquo;ve gotten consistent support even when the team was not so hot.</p> <p>Of course, inter-sports comparisons are not perfect. While in each American city there exists a roaming pack of casual fans that only follow winning teams (the herd), each sport has dedicated fans (the pack). Miami has an admittedly large Hispanic population, but&hellip;but&hellip;a large chunk is Cuban. Going by totally unresearched stereotypes within the Latin community, Cubans&hellip;like baseball. Soccer, not so much. True, Miami is home to plenty of South American expats. But how will their cultured tastes adapt to MLS (and that pesky salary cap)?</p> <p>Sports and demographics aside, there&rsquo;s history. I speak of the Toros and the Fusion. The who? Exactly. The Miami Toros sprang into life in 1973, after the Washington Darts of the North American Soccer League decided to move down South. The Toros lumbered along for three years in the Orange Bowl before moving to Ft. Lauderdale and rechristening as The Strikers. The team never won the NASL, but did finish runner-up in 1974. Their dynamic forward tandem of Warren Archibald and Steve David lit the nets aflame, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough: the team left town in 1983 for Minnesota.</p> <p>Thus, soccer has tried and failed in Miami. Neither Miami proper nor Ft. Lauderdale could support a team. The NASL collapsed under its own weight, you say. True, but other teams lasted longer than a decade. The intra-city moves are an ominous sign. And the more recent history is even more depressing.</p> <p>In 1996, MLS opened its doors and rode the wave of soccer interest after the 1994 World Cup in the US. In 1997, the Miami Fusion entered the league and ominously played in the old home of the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers (a converted high school stadium). The team barely lasted four years. They were shut down due to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Fusion_F.C.#Demise\">low season ticket sales and no corporate sponsorships</a>. The Miami Fusion have the wikipedia game honor of winning the Supporters Shield at the best regular season team right before being contracted. Not relocated. Contracted.</p> <p>Can Beckham reverse this trend? Could he build a winner to win over sometimes fickle Miami fans? Could a stadium misstep lead to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2013/01/27/miami-marlins-have-become-baseballs-most-expensive-stadium-disaster/\">Marlins-esque disaster</a>? I am sure that Beckham would invest more than the old Fusion owners <em>and</em> land some corporate sponsorships on brand alone, but I&rsquo;m not sold on decent season ticket sales. Twice, Miami has had a pro soccer team. Twice, it has failed. A Prince Charming has come along, but three times may not be the charm.</p> <p><em>Elliott Turner blogs about soccer at </em><a href=\"http://futfanatico.com/\"><em>Futfanatico.com</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421643116|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|7f1b39c9d7679a5fd700f0e09747fa6fb91ff6b3 -->",

        "trailText":"<p><strong>Hunter Felt:</strong> No player reflected the fall and rise of the World Series-winning Boston Red Sox more than embattled starting pitcher John Lackey</p>",
        "headline":"John Lackey's revival mirrors that of the Red Sox",
        "body":"<p>When Boston Red Sox starting pitcher John Lackey left the mound in the 7th inning with a 6-1 lead <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/30/st-louis-cardinals-boston-red-sox-live\">in what turned out to be the deciding game of the 2013 World Series</a>, it was exactly what Red Sox ownership had imagined when they first signed him. What they couldn't have imagined back when they offered him a 5-year $82.5m contract in 2010, was the path it would take to get there. Where once John Lackey represented the worst of the overpaid, under-performing players on the Red Sox roster, he has become a symbol of how these Red Sox turned their fortunes around right when their home city desperately needed to root for something.</p><p>In 2010, the Red Sox were perennial championship contenders, swooping in to give Lackey one of the biggest contracts in team history seemingly simply because they could. The media guide proclaimed Lackey as part of Three Aces along with homegrown left-hander Jon Lester and 2007 ALCS MVP Josh Beckett. When that team failed to make the postseason, the Sox traded for San Diego Padres first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, giving him a seven-year, $158m extension. Then, two days after trading for Gonzalez, they signed Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Carl Crawford to a 7-year, $142m contract just to put an exclamation point on the fact that at least for once Boston, and not the rival New York Yankees, had won the offseason.</p><p>As it turns out the 2011 offseason was the last time the Sox would win for a while. The Best Red Sox Team Ever Assembled, as the hype went, <a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/sports/red_sox_mlb/clubhouse_insider/2011/09/thats_wrap_best_team_ever_suffers_worst_collapse_ever\">went through a historic September collapse</a>, falling out of the playoff mix on the last day of the season. The chief culprit was lousy starting pitching, and John Lackey became public enemy number one in Boston. The former Angels ace put up a 6.41 ERA in 2011, the worst of any Sox starter who had thrown 150 innings or more. </p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.awfulannouncing.com/2011-articles/september/is-john-lackeys-personal-life-fair-game.html\">details about Lackey's personal life began to circulate towards the end of the season</a>, Lackey's attitude both on the field, where he would become visibly upset at fielders who failed to make plays behind him, and with the media made him an easy target of ire from frustrated fans. At season's end, <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2011/10/12/red_sox_unity_dedication_dissolved_during_epic_late_season_collapse/\">reports describing a fractured clubhouse,</a> including the immortal image of Lackey and others eating fried chicken and drinking beer while their teammates were still in games, effectively turned Lackey from overpaid pitcher to season-killing villain.</p><p>The fallout was swift. The Red Sox fired manager Terry Francona, who had led the team to two World Series wins after an 86 year drought. General Manager Theo Epstein left for a higher position with the Chicago Cubs. Boston promoted assistant GM Ben Cherington who received his biggest praise when he announced that Lackey <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/7148697/boston-red-sox-john-lackey-tommy-john-surgery\">would miss the next season after undergoing Tommy John surgery</a>.</p><p>Red Sox fans didn't miss Lackey much in 2012, and Lackey didn't miss much while he was gone. Francona's replacement Bobby Valentine came in to \"change the culture\" and he did. Instead of narrowly missing the playoffs, the Red Sox finished last in the AL East and put up their worst win-loss record in decades. At least the losing made it easy to justify striking a deal that sent Gonzalez, Crawford and Beckett (and their gigantic contracts) to the suddenly cash-flush Los Angeles Dodgers.</p><p>His role as roster laxative no longer necessary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/04/boston-red-sox-bobby-valentine-fired\">the Red Sox let Valentine go</a> and Cherington began what was euphemistically called a \"rebuilding project\". His offseason acquisitions ended up being more puzzling than encouraging to skeptical fans.</p><p>Cherington signed former Phillies outfielder Shane Victorino, perceived to be a platoon player in decline, to a 3-year, $39 million contract, a move some experts tagged as the worst free agent signing of the winter. He also signed nomadic veteran Jonny Gomes despite the fact that he was more of a pinch-hitter than reliable outfielder at this point. The Sox signed strikeout-prone Mike Napoli, catcher-by-trade, to be their starting first baseman despite a degenerative hip condition bad enough to reduce his three-year contract down to a single season. Nobody much noticed the signing of Japanese relief pitcher Koji Uehara, after all the Red Sox had traded for Andrew Bailey and Joel Hanrahan in back-to-back seasons to fulfill the role of closer. The Red Sox even brought in shortstop Stephen Drew on a one-year deal, despite the fact that Boston fans disliked his older brother J.D. almost as much as they did John Lackey.</p><p>The players that returned in 2013 almost all had something to prove as well. The Red Sox brought in former pitching coach John Farrell, after two fairly regrettable years managing the Toronto Blue Jays, partly to see if he could help a struggling Jon Lester regain his ace-status. Designated Hitter David Ortiz, centerfielder Jacoby Ellsbury and starter Clay Buchholz all were question marks thanks to their recent injury histories. Daniel Nava, <a href=\"http://fullcount.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/red-sox/2010/06/12/the-sox-1-investment-in-nava-pays-off/\">the minor league player bought for a dollar who hit a grand slam off the first big league pitch he ever saw</a>, just wanted to show that he belonged in the majors. Above and beyond all that, John Lackey had to prove to a skeptical fanbase that his pitching struggles were because his arm was torn to shreds not because he was an out-of-shape beer-guzzler hated by his fielders.</p><p>Although many predicted the Red Sox would once again finish the year on the bottom of the AL East, there were some optimists out there. There were some who noted that if all of this panned out, maybe the Boston Red Sox could make one of the two Wild Card spots this season and clinch a spot in that one-game playoff. Playing without the usual attention and pressure, the Red Sox started off well, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_04_15_tbamlb_bosmlb_1&amp;mode=box&amp;c_id=bos#gid=2013_04_15_tbamlb_bosmlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=bos\">bringing their record to 8-4 after Mike Napoli hit a game-winning double to beat the Rays on the traditional early morning Patriot's Day game</a> on April 15, the day of the 2013 Boston Marathon. </p><p>Hours later, grim reality overshadowed everything <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/boston-marathon-explosions?guni=Article:in%20body%20link\">when bombs went off at the Boston Marathon</a> finish line at Boylston St, killing three and injuring over 200 others. On April 19th, the greater Boston area effectively shut down as police went on a manhunt for the surviving suspect. The Red Sox postponed that game, which was to be the first game at Fenway Park since the tragedy. The next day, with the surviving suspect in custody, a still shell-shocked city turned to Fenway <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gadX75KeyIM\">which held a solemn ceremony to honor the victims</a>.</p><p>It's easy to make too much out of how organized sports, particularly wealthy professional teams, can help the healing process or provide a temporary sense of normalcy. Still, it didn't hurt to see how the Red Sox players, many of whom were brand new to Boston, <a href=\"http://www.overthemonster.com/2013/10/31/5049800/boston-strong-world-series-2013-red-sox\">embraced the city following the attacks and their violent aftermath</a>. Maybe the coverage was a bit overblown, I'm not sure <a href=\"http://nesn.com/2013/04/red-sox-jonny-gomes-make-regional-cover-of-sports-illustrated-with-strong-headline-photos/\">if even Jonny Gomes thinks that Jonny Gomes should have been on the regional cover of Sports Illustrated,</a> and the Boston Strong slogan has probably lost all meaning outside of Massachusetts, but these things did mean something to the local communities. They still do.</p><p>It didn't hurt that this was a winning team that local fans had not seen in a while, filled with role players taking starring roles, Red Sox veterans seeking to redeem past failures and, quite frankly, a few guys nobody but the hardcore geeks knew. A few failed, but most succeeded beyond anybody's expectations. Koji Uehara had one of the best, and most fun to watch, seasons a relief pitcher has had ever. David Oritz, no longer sidelined by injury, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/30/david-ortiz-boston-red-sox-world-series\">went back to being David Ortiz</a>. Jon Lester looked more like an ace, and at least became less grumpy about home plate umpire calls. Shane Victorino abandoned switch-hitting, a key reason the Sox wanted him, and ended up being Mr. Bases Loaded during the World Series. Jonny Gomes slumped his way out of the postseason starting lineup before hitting the three-run home run that turned the entire Series around. When Mike Napoli, the converted catcher with the bad hip, wasn't nominated for a Gold Glove at first base, it was considered a snub. Daniel Nava had one of the best on-base percentages in baseball. And then there was John Lackey.</p><p>At no point during the season was John Lackey the best starting pitcher on the Red Sox. Clay Buchholz began the year on a Cy Young pace before he was hurt. Jon Lester struggled in the summer before ending the year as the Sox's undisputed number one starter. Even Felix Doubront, one of the less heralded homegrown Red Sox pitchers, had a stretch where he was all but unhittable. </p><p>Yet, it was Lackey who emerged as Boston's most consistent starter. Two years ago he was considered the biggest reason that the Red Sox collapsed but now he was the guy who kept it together. He was the guy who continued to pitch brilliantly even though a lack of run support meant he ended the regular season with a 10-13 record. He was the guy who went 3-1 in the postseason and recorded the biggest win of the entire season. He was <em>the guy</em>.</p><p>When Red Sox fans chanted \"Lackey\" on Wednesday night they weren't forgiving him so much as admitting that they had gotten Lackey wrong. John Lackey had faced some troubled times for most of his Boston career, <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22297882/29253260\">he even once flat out said \"everything in my life sucks right now\" back in the bad days of 2011</a>, but that didn't mean anything anymore. The fans now saw the side of Lackey that they could identify with, he was someone who rebounded right when things seemed the worst. Just like the 2013 Boston Red Sox. Just like Boston.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421344610|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|962f559aa4dfbee84952585585698cf3c3e64135 -->",

        "headline":"Ben Ainslie aiming for first America's Cup win for Britain after US victory",
        "body":"<p>Sir Ben Ainslie, the greatest Olympic sailor and now surely the undisputed king of the comeback following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/sep/26/america-cup-ben-ainslie-oracle-dramatic-victory-video\" title=\"\">his team's stunning victory in the America's Cup</a>, is vowing to win the oldest competition in world sport again, this time in a British boat.</p><p>Ainslie was celebrating an extraordinary win but, as is his wont, was already turning his thoughts to his new challenge. \"It would be great to get out a British boat next time,\" said Ainslie on Thursday. \"We have the sailors; it's just about getting the money together.\"</p><p>Ainslie, 36, was drafted in as tactician on Oracle Team USA to help reverse a losing streak that looked terminal. His skill – and his legendary steel – helped Oracle claim an amazing last-gasp 9-8 victory over Emirates Team New Zealand, having trailed 8-1.</p><p>Ainslie said he hoped the excitement would generate interest in his next goal. \"We've got a very proud maritime heritage in the UK. In terms of the sailors and the designers, we have the talent in the UK, that's for sure.\"</p><p>It has been an incredible 12 months for Ainslie, who won his fourth Olympic gold medal at London 2012. His comeback then was remarkable enough – he had trailed the genial Danish sailor Jonas Høgh-Christensen throughout the regatta and a lesser man would have pulled out with the awful back pain he was suffering.</p><p>Somehow Ainslie hung in and engineered the result he needed in the final race of the series, unfurling a union flag and letting off a red flare after crossing the finishing line off the Dorset coast – creating one of the most memorable images of the Games.</p><p>Again a lesser man would have spent days celebrating in the bars of Weymouth. But by then he already had the America's Cup in his sights. He made one last appearance in his beloved Finn class dinghy, Rita, sailing in front of Big Ben on the Thames. And then it was off to try to fulfil his boyhood ambition of winning the America's Cup.</p><p>The cup is a complicated competition. Ainslie spent the winter in California and Italy taking part in an event called the <a href=\"http://bar.americascup.com\" title=\"\">America's Cup World Series</a>, a sort of testing ground for sailors with ambitions of competing in the America's Cup proper, with his own Ben Ainslie Racing team.</p><p>The team did well, finishing on the podium in third place.</p><p>Then came possibly the biggest test of his career, the call-up to try to turn around Oracle Team USA's fortunes in the series with its New Zealand rival. Even the biggest of Ainslie's supporters could be forgiven for thinking that not even he could pull that one off.</p><p>But race by race Oracle got better and better. The New Zealand team stuttered and in the final contest, the Oracle team won on San Francisco Bay by a reasonably comfortable 44 seconds.</p><p>Ainslie, who has made his name competing in single-handed boats, clearly relished the team effort that went into this most dramatic of comebacks. \"We just grew and grew and in the end we were too strong for the Kiwis,\" he said. \"Everyone had written us off. \"The opposition had written us off. The experts had written us off.</p><p>\"I never gave up hope but I knew it would be hard. When I came in everyone was a bit down but I was a new face and that gave everyone a lift. I tried to be Mr Positive and we gelled well.\"</p><p>The stunning finish could not have been better for the sport. Even before the turnaround the series had won handsome audiences around the world, drawn by the sight of huge, powerful catamarans locked in combat with impressive Californian backdrops. Coverage on BBC2 has helped bring a new British audience to sailing.</p><p>There was sadness, too, in Ainslie's win, after the death in May of the British sailor Andrew \"Bart\" Simpson, who was killed in an accident during America's Cup training. Ainslie dedicated his part in the win to his friend. \"I looked up to the stars after it all settled down at the end and thought of Bart. In some ways this was for him. He loved sailing and he loved the America's Cup. He would have been so excited about this series.\"</p><p>After his Olympic win last year Ainslie recalled how he started sailing, on the creeks around Falmouth in Cornwall as an eight-year-old in a duffel coat and wellies. His America's Cup win prompted him to recall watching an America's Cup team off Falmouth in 1987. \"I remember as a kid watching them training and preparing and thinking about maybe one day being involved with the America's Cup. To be part of a winning America's Cup team is for me personally part of a lifelong dream.\"</p><p>But he is also a patriot. The America's Cup was first staged off the Isle of Wight in 1851 – but Britain has never won it. \"It's about time we changed that,\" he said.</p><p>Of course, Ainslie is realistic. Funding an America's Cup challenge costs millions. \"It takes a lot to bring us together in terms of the commercial support, financial support, to run one of these teams,\" he said.</p><p>Still his website puts it simply: \"Ben Ainslie Racing has a long-term aim to be a competitive challenger for the 35th America's Cup as Ben aims to win the oldest trophy in sport and bring the cup back to Britain where it all began over 160 years ago.\"</p><p>The course will be long and hard, but it would foolish to write Ainslie off.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418386095|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|49f841cb6224d193f593cd529aa3a5bced66ec72 -->",

Just a week ago the America's Cup, a plutocratic sailing tournament that everyone loves to hate, was sinking into pre-ordained ignominy.</p><p>Accidents, boycotts and bickering marred the build-up, then the defending champion, Oracle Team USA lost eight of the first nine races in a desultory surrender to the challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand. Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who sponsored the team and brought the tournament to San Francisco bay, was gleefully trashed for his hubris. This cup would be remembered, if at all, as a damp squib.</p><p>Then the script changed. Oracle, a zephyr from defeat, rejigged its crew and mounted a spectacular comeback which electrified the contest and set the scene for a climactic, winner-take-all duel on Wednesday.</p><p>\"We're not going to stop – we're going to keep going all the way to the end,\" said skipper Jimmy Spithill after winning two races, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/25/oracle-team-new-zealand-americas-cup\">evening the score</a> at 8-8 on Tuesday. \"We really want this. You can sense it on board.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418278454'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/25/1380112338698/fb89d760-a668-44c5-9bac-71341ec0b673-460x276.jpeg' alt='Oracle Team USA leads Emirates Team New Zealand during race 18 of the America's Cup.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Oracle Team USA leads Emirates Team New Zealand during race 18 of the America's Cup.

Downcast Kiwis bemoaned another lost chance to take the cup to Auckland.</p><p>The drama of the greatest comeback in the cup's 162-year history has saved it, regardless who prevails. Gripes have turned into wonder at the spectacle of two huge catamarans, specially built for this event and crewed with elite sailors, duelling at more than 50mph.</p><p>\"Just when you thought it was safe to leave the water, the America's Cup has blossomed into a fantastic affair,\" marvelled <a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/americascup/2013/09/23/americas-cup-oracle-team-usas-amazing-comeback/\">the San Francisco Chronicle</a>. Oracle, it said, was on the cusp of the most improbable nautical victory since Nelson at Trafalgar.</p><p>Just a few weeks ago, the paper had floated a rather different comparison during the preliminary Louis Vuitton Cup: \"Perhaps the worst nautical launch since the Titanic set off across the North Atlantic.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418278453'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/25/1380112452376/58f6e12b-e820-4963-87f8-16ba3b45f02f-460x276.jpeg' alt='Oracle Team USA crosses the finish line during the 18th race of the America's Cup sailing event against Emirates Team New Zealand.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Oracle Team USA crosses the finish line during the 18th race of the America's Cup sailing event against Emirates Team New Zealand. Photograph: Ben Margot/AP</figcaption></figure><p>The about-turn came after Oracle's superstar sailors lost eight of the first 11 races. Ellison, who famously hates to lose, was going to lose. In a bold move the team replaced personnel, notably the tactician John Kostecki, a Bay Area native, with <a href=\"http://benainslie.com/\">Ben Ainslie, a Briton who has won four Olympic gold</a>. To widespread astonishment, Oracle then won nine of 13 races, including the two wins on Tuesday which tied the contest. Even when the Kiwis started with an advantage, the Oracle crew found a way to overtake.</p><p>\"The boat is just getting faster and faster,\" said Spithill. \"The boys are really starting to believe now. There's a lot of good energy on board.\" Wednesday's final, which is due to start at 1.15pm Pacific time, will be the most exciting day in their lives, he said.</p><p>The Team New Zealand skipper, Dean Barker, who may be about to enter the record books for the wrong reasons, called Tuesday's latest losses \"an absolute shocker\" and faulted himself for making a premature approach to the line, incurring a penalty.</p><p>The American side has actually won 10 of 18 races, having begun two races down because of a penalty for cheating in the America's Cup world series.</p><p>Ellison missed a keynote speech he was due to deliver at the Oracle OpenWorld conference to watch Tuesday's race, a scene Hollywood will surely mine should it make a movie.</p><p>A few months ago the America's Cup <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/11/americas-cup-disaster-san-francisco\">was in deep trouble</a>. What was billed as a glory of California's summer – 15 teams competing for sailing's most prestigious prize, generating $1.4bn in the process – had shrivelled into a bickering rump of just four teams. Accidents destroyed or damaged two catamarans and killed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/10/andrew-simpson\">Andrew Simpson, a British Olympic gold medallist with Sweden's Artemis Racing team</a>, prompting rule changes.</p><p>Italy's Luna Rossa Challenge team sat out some Louis Vuitton races – the warm-up contest to select the challenger – in protest. A major sponsor demanded a refund and San Francisco braced for a financial loss instead of a promised bonanza.</p><p>Oracle's initial rout deepened the sense of debacle as the main event got underway. Then began the comeback, and a cup dismissed as a tycoons' bauble became nail-biting drama.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418239774|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|9239899b24127065c45c5dd123f4881b8531241b -->",

        "body":"<p>The head of NBC Sports has responded to calls for the TV network to put a spotlight on Russia's draconian new anti-gay laws in its coverage of the upcoming Winter Olympics, saying there would be reporting of the issue but only if it should emerge as a problem during the games.</p><p>Mark Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Sports division, told an audience at the Television Critics Association in Beverly Hills that the issue of Russia's clampdown on gay men and lesbians had already been dealt with by the International Olympic Committee. \"The IOC has addressed it with the Russian government and has assured athletes, fans and media that there won't be any issues,\" he said, adding that should the new laws impacted any part of the Winter Olympics \"we will make sure we are acknowledging it and recognising it\".</p><p>The comments from Lazarus are unlikely to tamp down calls from the LGBT community for NBC to highlight Russia's aggressively anti-gay laws in its coverage of the Winter Olympics that is begin in Sochi on 6 February and run for 18 days. There have been widespread calls for protests and a boycott of the games.</p><p>Last week the Washington-based LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/ChadGriffin_NBCUniversal_07242013.pdf\">wrote to the NBC parent company</a> urging the network to use its broadcasting reach to expose \"this inhumane and unjust law to the millions of American viewers who will tune in to watch the games\". Specifically, HRC called on the network to refuse to air the opening ceremony of the games.</p><p>The new law, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/30/russia-passes-anti-gay-law\">signed by President Vladimir Putin last month</a>, imposes fines on those who spread propaganda \"directed at forming nontraditional sexual setups\" or that gives the \"distorted understanding\" that homosexuals are \"socially equivalent\" to heterosexuals. The \"homosexual propaganda\" penalised under the legislation includes wearing a rainbow flag or tweeting positive messages about gays or lesbians.</p><p>The law also provides for the arrest of foreigners engaging in such activities for up to 15 days followed by deportation. The IOC said last week that it had been given assurances from the Russian government that the sanctions for foreign nationals would not be applied to those participating in the games.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413821717|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d6d8f36b0a3c6f2a0146f9e14da791a9f7296e2e -->",

        "trailText":"<p><strong>Graham Parker:</strong> Jürgen Klinsmann's side are right now better than Mexico, and Seattle Sounders' Eddie Johnson is a striker in form</p>",
        "headline":"USA v Honduras: five things we learned",
        "body":"<h2>Right now, the US is edging Mexico</h2><p>The balance of power in Concacaf has tended to edge back and forward between the US and Mexico over the last 20 years, with Mexico generally held to be in the ascendancy – owing primarily to the superiority of their domestic league and the emphasis on youth development, which bore fruit with last year's stunning Olympic win.</p><p>This year, though, has been an ugly one for El Tri. They've struggled through the Hex phase of qualifying, and since the USA's symbolic win in the Azteca last summer, that stadium has hardly been the fortress of yore. The only surprise about their opening loss to Panama in the Gold Cup group stages was that it wasn't that big a surprise. Even after steadying and going through to the knockout stages, they were pushed all the way by Trinidad and Tobago, before being found wanting yet again by Panama in the semi-finals, as the Panamanians reached their first final since 2005 and ended any hope of a Mexican threepeat over the US.</p><p>And while Fifa rankings that regularly assert England as world-beaters need always be taken with a pinch of salt, the fact that the US overtook Mexico in the rankings felt about right as an assessment of where both squads are – regardless of the skewing of the stats caused by largely B teams playing in the Gold Cup. Whether they stay there through next year is perhaps not down so much to the US, who are playing as well as could be expected, but how much ground a floundering Mexico can make up with the talent at their disposal.</p><p>Certainly expect a very awkward inquest for José Manuel 'Chepo' de la Torre on his return to Mexico. Being pelted with cups, as he was after the first Panama loss, may be the least of his worries. There was doubt about him keeping his job even had Mexico retained the Gold Cup. The chances of him being on the sidelines in Brazil look very slim indeed.</p><p><em></em></p><h2>Can we now regard Honduras part I as a blip?</h2><p>It all seems so long ago now — the opening game of the Hex in Honduras, where the US went down to a defeat that prompted a spiral of soul-searching that reached its nadir just before the infamous Costa Rica snow game. At that point the prospect of a 10-game winning streak for this side looked remote indeed, and the Klinsmann project was being subjected to critical scrutiny and off-the-record briefings to journalists that suggested all was far from well.</p><p>Not so, insisted Klinsmann this week, calling the first game against Honduras \"a blip\" on what had otherwise been a steadily upward trajectory over the past two years. The US won the return in a tight game in Utah last month, and on Wednesday night they blew past the Hondurans in imperious style, suggesting there was substance to Klinsmann's claims.</p><p>The latter game of course was a game largely between players who may be on the fringes of their national teams' first XI (though the incumbent Graham Zusi may have been exhaling particularly hard while watching Landon Donovan's displays in this Gold Cup). And while it seems prudent to take some of the best and worst performances of the national team as outliers when considering where they truly stand, the improvement of those depth players since the particularly awful game against Canada in MLS pre-season is a definite marker for progress.</p><p>The passing is crisper, the understanding greater, and perhaps most impressively the midfield personnel are able to be rotated without a noticeable loss of fluidity. Beckerman, Holden and Diskerud have all played their part at the base of the midfield, while Bedoya came in for Corona against Honduras and had one of his best games for the US. The ability to change pace and spring defenses is night and day, as both the first two goals against Honduras perfectly illustrated.</p><p>That idea of players not just as stopgaps, but as active and serviceable depth with an individual understanding of their role and responsibility in the system, is where we can fairly talk about real progress in the US team. It doesn't make the USA world-beaters, but it does mean that compared to just six months ago, or even some of their turgid midfield slogs of 2012, they are certainly a team.</p><p><em></em></p><h2>Goodson makes a case for himself</h2><p>The consensus at the end of the most recent round of World Cup qualifiers was that the first choice center-back pairing was now Gonzalez and Besler, after the latter had played his way into contention at the start of the year and apparently solved one of the longstanding questions over Klinsmann's selection choices. And when Klinsmann exercised his right to exchange four squad players after the group stages, it was perhaps no surprise to see those two brought in to the squad, presumably to slot straight into the side.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly though, only one of those players went into the team – and it wasn't the (barely) more experienced Gonzalez, but the more thoughtful Besler who has stepped in. The other center-back role has been filled by Clarence Goodson, who followed up his first international goal in two years against Guatemala in the tune-up game for the tournament, with the opener against El Salvador in the quarter final – in both cases showing an unlikely predator's instincts in the box.</p><p>He kept his place against Honduras and continued another trait of recent performances – looking up and trying to get the ball forward quickly.</p><p>It's precisely what Klinsmann wants from his team, and precisely what they've lacked during the formative part of his reign – players willing to play the percentages and trust that possession per se means less than the number of chances created by forward movement. Goodson has been doing his chances of being one of the four central defenders for Brazil no harm at all.</p><h2>Eddie Johnson has put down a marker </h2><p>It's not exactly \"watch the throne\" – maybe more \"watch the third or fourth in line for the throne\", but Klinsmann must be delighted at the heating up of competition for striker spots in his squad. First of all it was Chris Wondolowski who responded to his heels being held to the fire by Jack McInerney's MLS form and inclusion in the Gold Cup squad, by opening his international account with a flurry of goals at the start of this tournament, to keep the young pretender in his place.</p><p>And then when Eddie Johnson was called into the squad after the group stage, he too wasted no time in sending a message to Wondolowski in turn. Jogging onto the field and heading a goal within seconds to better the efforts of the man he'd replaced was one thing, but having duly claimed the starting spot for the semi-final, Johnson quickly sent another finish with his burst through on goal and emphatic finish to open the scoring.</p><p>The goal was more than just one that gave the US an early lead – it was a sickener for Honduras. They'd already come out playing with their instinctive conservatism – dropping deep to counter US balls over the top and hoping to spring on the counter to snatch a goal to defend.</p><p>Johnson's goal confirmed their worst fears about what the game might bring and saw them sink deeper and deeper in the wake of the goal, to the extent that the US defensive midfielders were able to have potshots from near the edge of the box, and the Honduran attack looked negligible.</p><p>It's possible that Wondolowski would have taken that goal, though when he did eventually come on to the field with a two goal cushion in place, it was hard to escape the feeling that that was about the right order of things – a now proven poacher, with the ability to constantly move and occupy defenses so that they can't commit to helping chase the game, replacing a man more likely to get goals for this team against stronger opposition.</p><h2>'Overboiling'</h2><p>Jurgen Klinsmann's English is a million times better than my German, and he speaks as he asks his teams to play – without fear. </p><p>And as Clint Dempsey can testify, occasionally he has harsh words for his own players, though usually within the frame of expecting the absolute best from them. Even after Donovan's standout performances in this tournament Klinsmann was keen to emphasize that he expected more, and had told the player as much:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Your benchmark is the best Landon Donovan ever. I'm not taking anything less than that — and he's trying to catch up with that.</p></blockquote><p>It's the kind of statement that looks harsher in transcript than it does when delivered in Klinsmann's usual affable manner, where even the most critical comments are delivered with indulgent chuckles. </p><p>With his self-deprecating interview persona it's easy to forget sometimes that Klinsmann is a fierce competitor, though we got a glimpse of it against Honduras when a furious Klinsmann was ejected after vehemently protesting a foul on Beasley just in front of his technical area. The coach should have known better given the whimsical nature of concacaf refereeing — indeed his outburst had been prompted by it — but after the game he was back to his even self in apologizing (\"I just kind of overboiled it\"). </p><p>Under Concacaf Gold Cup rules there isn't an automatic suspension for Klinsmann for the final, and it's possible he will be allowed to take his seat on the bench, depending on the results of a disciplinary enquiry. If he isn't on hand however, this will be an interesting test for the cohesion of the team and possibly an unwelcome distraction from what's been an absolute procession of a tournament so far.</p><p>But if Klinsmann's claims about the steady upward trajectory of the team are correct, and if the level of understanding is truly what the Gold Cup performances have suggested it is at, then it might perhaps be intriguing to watch this side on autopilot for one game.</p><p><em></em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413634557|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|8aca5fc08c447f6737811971ca873e4c94100137 -->",

        "body":"<p>For a while on Saturday, March Madness had subsided into, at best, mere March Irrationality. Halfway through the second game of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament doubleheader, it felt the first day of Elite Eight action was a complete bust. The opening game, Syracuse's low-scoring win over Marquette, had been something of a dud, and it looked as though ninth-seeded Wichita State was headed towards a surprisingly easy victory over second-seeded Ohio State. In the end, the Wichita State Shockers would pull out the victory, securing a Final Four appearance that few saw coming, but nothing about it would be easy.</p><p>At times during the West Regional finals, not even a struggling Ohio State looked like it believed that Ohio State were capable of a final push against Wichita State. At halftime the score was 35-22 in favor of Wichita State, who would push the lead up to as many 20 points for stretches during the second half. At times at the Staples Center, it looked all the world like Ohio State were the inexperienced lower-seeded Cinderella team and Wichita State were the favorites. </p><p>Coming out of the half, however, officials did start calling the game significantly tighter, and this changed the match's entire flow. Ohio State were able to adjust while Wichita State weren't. While the Buckeyes were having trouble getting shots to fall, especially three-pointers (5-25),<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/31/ohio-state-lost-wichita-state-ncaa_n_2986751.html\"> they were able to go 19-for-22 on the free throw line in the second half</a>, a big reason they were able to cut into Wichita State's lead. The nonstop whistles for fouls and the cavalcade of timeouts used by both teams, not to mention the network, may have also disrupted Wichita State's offensive rhythm as much as they irritated the television audience. Not even counting fouls and other breaks of action, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaolaBoivin/status/318166024837009408\">including a pause for a player to recover his contact lens</a>, there were nine official timeouts in the last 6:30 of game time. It felt like hundreds.</p><p>So Ohio State, coming off back-to-back games won on last second shots thanks to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/25/florida-gulf-coast-sweet-sixteen-upset\">Aaron Craft</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/29/march-madness-indiana-eliminatied-by-syracuse\">LaQuinton Ross</a>, looked as if they were making a comeback and Wichita State apparently knew it. Late in the game, an obviously rattled Wichita State began making bad fouls and unforced errors. With less than three minutes left on the clock, Ohio State cut the once insurmountable 20 point lead down to 3, it looked like Wichita State were re-enacting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/30/march-madness-michigan-defeats-kansas-fgcu-eliminated\">Kansas's collapse against Michigan the day before</a>. Then Wichita State's Tekele Cotton responded with this key three:</p><p>With the Wichita State lead now doubled, the Buckeyes responded with a Deshaun Thomas layup to cut it closer, but then Fred Van Vleet essentially the iced the game with a jumper, making it 67-61 Shockers with exactly one minute to spare. The Ohio State Buckeyes were not going to get a chance to make a last second game-winner this night. When the game ended, the Permanent Timeout so to speak, Wichita State had beaten Ohio State 70-66. Wichita State was heading to its first Final Four since 1965. As Fox Sports Radio's Ben Maller <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benmaller/status/318139571655307264\">pointed out on Twitter</a>: \"Last time Wichita State was in Final Four, gas cost 31 cents, St. Louis Gateway Arch was completed, Lyndon B. Johnson was President\".</p><p>Wichita State's run through the tournament makes them a spiritual successor, in a way, of 2006's George Mason whose Final Four appearance <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/-college-basketball-mens-tournament/news/20130330/wichita-state-ncaa-tournament/\">redefined what so called mid-majors could accomplish</a>. Much like George Mason, Wichita State might be a Cinderella team, but that doesn't mean that they were relying on any magic tricks to get there. To make it to the Final Four, the Shockers had to win four straight games, along the way eliminating both a one-seed in Gonzaga and a second-seed in Ohio State. Nothing they accomplish from here on out, no matter their initial seeding, will truly count as an upset because they've proven themselves to be a flat-out good basketball team. Which is a good thing, because Saturday's hard won victory means that head coach Gregg Marshall gets to prepare his team to face the winner of Sunday's game between overall top-seeded Louisville and dangerous second-seeded Duke. </p><p>So the West Regional final ended up being thrilling, way more thrilling than Wichita State fans probably wanted, especially compared to the East Regional final that came before it. The Elite Eight opened on Saturday afternoon with third-seeded Marquette facing fourth-seeded Syracuse, and the game continued with this year's tradition of starting every new round of the NCAA tournament with an absolute snoozer. The Syracuse Orange defeated the Marquette Golden Eagles in a 55-39 game that was even less enthralling than the score indicates.</p><p>After their blow-out win against Miami Hurricanes, Marquette reverted back to the inconsistent team that probably should have lost to either Davidson or Butler in its first two games. Meanwhile Syracuse brought the same smothering defense that the brought during their shocking upset of Indiana. The results? The Marquette Golden Eagles hit 12-53 from the field, a staggeringly ridiculous statistic that questions how much of it was great defense on Syracuse's part and how much was just Marquette incompetence. Syracuse's offense wasn't exactly easy on the eyes either, with, as usual, the very notable exception of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/michael-carter-williams-is-the-point-man-of-syracuses-run.html?_r=0\">star guard Michael Carter-Williams</a> who scored 12 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists. Carter-Williams most likely will declare for the 2013 NBA Draft, and it's absolutely frightening to imagine this Syracuse offense without him.</p><p>The highlight for those watching the game at Washington DC.'s Verizon Center might have been spotting <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2013/03/30/president-obama-robert-griffin-iii-are-at-the-syracuse-marquette-game/\">the most influential man in the city</a>. Yes, Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III was there watching the game, along with noted Chicago politician Barack Obama. It was actually rather brave of the president to show considering <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/21/president-obama-march-madness-ncaa-bracket\">that he had predicted this would be an Indiana-Miami matchup</a>. When the score was 18-7 a full six and a half minutes into the game, I'm sure he could even the staunch Republicans in the crowd were wishing Obama's predictions were right.</p><p>Not that the Syracuse Orange and their fans cared at all that they hadn't been involved with the most entertaining 40 minutes of basketball in tournament history. Cheering head coach Jim Boeheim as he was cutting down the nets was all the excitement they needed. Boeheim has now made <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/blog/eye-on-college-basketball/21978251/boeheim-orange-back-in-final-four\">four Final Four appearances in four different decades</a> and has a change to take Syracuse even further next weekend when he faces the winner of Saturday afternoon's game between No. 4 Michigan and No. 3 Florida.</p><p>Even if this is the end of the road for Wichita State or Syracuse, they have in many respects, already won. As Mike Pesca <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pescami/status/318131772443480065\">put it succinctly</a>: \"Syracuse now in the Final 4 in NCAA B-ball, the only sport where we care more about semi finalists than finalists\". It's a joke, but there's some truth there, making the Final Four isn't just advancing to the next round in the tournament, it's a validation for an entire program. Considering the challenges of advancing in such a crowded field, consisting of either 64 or 68 teams depending on how one classifies the First Four play-in games, being among the last four standing is almost as impressive as winning the championship in another playoff system. </p><p>That \"almost\" qualifier is huge though. Saturday night, Wichita State and Syracuse both cut down their respective nets and celebrated an accomplishment that few had expected from either of them. Sunday, one imagines will be less fun, as they will learn, at the same time as the rest of the college basketball world, which team will be all that's between them and an appearance in a national championship game. Neither of them will be thinking very much about settling for an \"almost\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406480792|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|225eeb9aa3ff4f5aaea1171daed77cb9276a37d2 -->",

While the Sixers are one of the worst road teams in the league, they are 19-17 at home.</p><p>The Sixers led by one at the end of the third quarter, then opened the fourth on a 19-4 run to put away the Pacers. Evan Turner and Thaddeus Young each contributed some lead-stretching buckets in the fourth to put all five starters in double figures.</p><p>Roy Hibbert had 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers.</p><p>The 76ers had enough this time to finish off one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. They had a late lead and the Heat on the ropes until they blew it and lost by four Wednesday night.</p><p>Just like they did against Miami, the Sixers got into an early groove in the quarter to put the upset alert on notice. Dorell Wright hit a 3-pointer and Lavoy Allen came off the bench to score his first two baskets to get a big run going. They forced turnovers on consecutive possessions at one point during the spurt and built a 10-point lead.</p><p>Somehow, Hawes, the much-maligned 7-1 center, outplayed Hibbert. Hawes has settled in nicely as a starter after an erratic first 42 games as a reserve. He had a fantastic one-handed rebound right over Hibbert's head in the third that put the crowd of 18,587 on their feet. Hawes had six blocked shots through the first three quarters and made the Pacers think twice about going inside.</p><p>At San Antonio, Tim Duncan had 30 points and 12 rebounds, Kawhi Leonard added 24 points and 13 boards, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-113.</p><p>Manu Ginobili added 14 points and 10 assists, Nando De Colo had 11 points and Tiago Splitter had 10 for San Antonio, which is 1½ games ahead of Oklahoma City in the Western Conference.</p><p>Wayne Ellington had 21 points and fellow reserve Marreese Speights added 19 for Cleveland. Shaun Livingston had 16 points, and Alonzo Gee and Dion Waiters added 15 apiece.</p><p>Neither offense was slowed by the loss of its starting All-Star point guards. The Spurs' Tony Parker is expected to miss another two weeks with a Grade 2 left ankle sprain and Cleveland will be without Kyrie Irving (shoulder) for another three weeks.</p><p>In Portland, Oregon, LaMarcus Aldridge had 31 points and 12 rebounds, and the Portland Trail Blazers handed the Detroit Pistons their eighth straight loss with a 112-101 victory.</p><p>Rodney Stuckey had a season-high 32 points for the Pistons, who have yet to win a game in March.</p><p>After trailing by as many as 11 points in the first half, the Blazers took a 90-81 lead on Nicolas Batum's 3-pointer with 8:33 remaining in the game. Portland extended the lead to 99-87 on J.J. Hickson's dunk.</p><p>In other games Saturday, Martell Webster scored a career-high 34 points in the Washington Wizards 127-105 win over the Phoenix Suns, Paul Pierce had 14 points, eight assists and six rebounds as the Boston Celtics powered past the Charlotte Bobcats 105-88 and Gordon Hayward scored 17 points in the Utah Jazz's 90-84 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405732009|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a9e5dbd5f17f93b7433e6e5ec50c2f1be8291020 -->",

Tampa Bay has beaten three Carolina goalies Justin Peters, Cam Ward and Dan Ellis in the process.</p><p>Johnson put the Lightning ahead 1-0 when he beat Peters from the low left circle with 9:06 left in the first.</p><p>After Palat scored on a redirection of Sami Salo's shot from the blue line at 6:35 of the second, Thompson made it 3-0 with 7:05 to go in the period with a breakaway goal.</p><p>Purcell scored on a breakaway to put Tampa Bay up 4-0 at 3:54 of the third, but Staal ended Garon's shutout bid during a breakaway at 6:21.</p><p>At Columbus, Ohio, Sergei Bobrovsky made 39 saves in regulation and overtime, then two more in the shootout to finish with his second career shutout both coming in the last week to lift surging Columbus to a 1-0 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes, extending the Blue Jackets' franchise record point streak to 10 games.</p><p>Artem Anisimov and Mark Letestu scored in the shootout, making nice moves then firing shots past Mike Smith, who made 23 saves and also got credit for a shutout, his fourth of the season and 23rd of his career. It was the fourth straight shootout game for the Blue Jackets.</p><p>At Newark, New Jersey, big defenseman Jarred Tinordi, in his NHL debut, set up Tomas Plekanec's tiebreaking goal in the third period, and the Montreal Canadiens extended their winning streak to five games with a 2-1 victory over the New Jersey Devils.</p><p>Plekanec deflected a shot by the 6-foot-6 son of former NHL defenseman Mark Tinordi past Johan Hedberg at 6:49 after the goalie made an ill-advised clearing attempt from behind his net. Tinordi got the puck above the left circle and let it fly.</p><p>Colby Armstrong also scored for Montreal, and Carey Price made 32 saves. The Canadiens moved into a tie with Pittsburgh for the most points in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>Defenseman Peter Harrold scored for New Jersey, which lost for the second time in two nights.</p><p>At Toronto, Zach Bogosian scored in the 10th round of the shootout to lift Winnipeg over Toronto 5-4.</p><p>Bogosian beat James Reimer, who replaced starter Ben Scrivens to start the third period, for Winnipeg's second goal of the shootout after Blake Wheeler scored to open it.</p><p>Tyler Bozak had the lone shootout goal for Toronto, which lost its fifth straight.<br />Wheeler had two goals in regulation, and James Wright and Antti Miettinen also scored for Winnipeg, which earned its fifth win in six games and moved into first place in the Southeast Division.</p><p>Also Saturday, Casey Cizikas broke a third-period tie, and the New York Islanders held on to beat the Florida Panthers 4-3 after blowing a three-goal lead and Jonathan Toews and Marian Hossa each scored twice in leading the Chicago Blackhawks to an 8-1 rout of the Dallas Stars.</p><p>In other games Saturday, the St Louis Blues beat the Anaheim Ducks 2-1, Boston downed Washington 4-1 and Pittsburgh beat the New York Rangers 3-0 for its eighth straight victory.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405733069|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|4f198cf60695925d4457ef8802dc43ca65dfc1d4 -->",

O'Reilly assisted on another goal in a four-goal onslaught in the second period that turned a 1-1 tie into a no-contest.</p><p>The Blackhawks' previous loss in regulation on the road came more than a year ago. Dating back to last year's regular season, their points streak was 30 games, still five short of the all-time record held by the 1979-80 Philadelphia Flyers.</p><p>Anaheim's Daniel Winnik ended an 18-game goal drought on the first shot of the game, setting up the Ducks' 4-0 win over the Calgary Flames.</p><p>Viktor Fasth posted his second career shutout with 29 saves, while Bobby Ryan and defenseman Sheldon Souray scored less than 2½ minutes apart in the second period for Anaheim, who have won 16 straight at home against Calgary.</p><p>Ryan Getzlaf notched his 500th NHL point on the same day he signed an eight-year, $66m contract extension.</p><p>Ottawa's Jakob Silfverberg broke a tie with 4:41 left to give the Senators a 3-2 win over the New York Rangers.</p><p>Zack Smith and Patrick Wiercioch scored in the first period for the Senators, who improved to a surprising 12-1-1 record in their past 14 visits to Madison Square Garden.</p><p>Rick Nash and Brad Richards scored in the opening period, but the Rangers had a season-best, four-game winning streak broken.</p><p>Nashville's Colin Wilson had a career-high two goals and two assists, as the Predators thrashed the Edmonton Oilers 6-0 to snap a three-game skid.</p><p>Winnipeg's Dustin Byfuglien scored with 40.5 seconds left in overtime to give the Jets a 3-2 win over the Florida Panthers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405310713|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|46aec83c320a9bbacec702dde72246f4fdd2d89a -->",
