        "body":"<p>Northern Ireland's health minister has been forced to pass to the UK health secretary the decision to continue with or lift the ban on gay men donating blood in the province.</p><p>Edwin Poots confirmed on Monday that Jeremy Hunt will now have the final say on the current lifetime ban on gay men giving blood.</p><p>Last Friday a judge in Belfast ruled that the Democratic Unionist minister did not have the power to maintain the ban. It was first put in place during the 1980s Aids scare, but was lifted in England, Scotland and Wales in November 2011. However, Northern Ireland's health minister opted to continue with the ban in the province.</p><p>Commenting on the judicial decision, Poots said: \"The judge believes it is a decision for Jeremy Hunt. Jeremy Hunt didn't believe it was, but obviously the judge is contradicting the Department of Health in England and it's a matter for the Department of Health to take whatever action it believes it should.\"</p><p>An anonymous gay man in Northern Ireland has been challenging the ban through the courts, winning a judicial review on it.</p><p>In his judgment, the judge said that the decision to continue the lifetime ban was \"irrational\".</p><p>He said Poots had breached the ministerial code by failing to take the issue before his fellow ministers in the devolved power-sharing Stormont executive.</p><p>Poots' rivals in the Ulster Unionist party have challenged him to reveal what legal advice he received from Northern Ireland's attorney general John Larkin over his stance on the ban.</p><p>The UUP Assembly member for East Antrim, Roy Beggs, said that scientific evidence should be the basis for any decision on blood donation in Northern Ireland.</p><p>Critics of the minister from the political world and gay rights campaigners in Northern Ireland have claimed Poots' maintenance of the ban is due to his born-again Christian beliefs and the DUP's longstanding hostility to gay people and other sexual minorities.</p><p>Beggs said: \"UK scientists and statisticians have deemed that it is safe to accept blood donations from gay men who have abstained for a period of 12 months or more.</p><p>\"There are risks in receiving blood donations from anyone; there are also considerable risks in having a shortage of blood available for donations to those who need it.\"</p><p>The Ulster Unionist health spokesman added: \"I am concerned that a high court judge has deemed that the minister of health has breached the ministerial code. Clearly he has questions to answer on this matter. In the interest of the public I would call on Edwin Poots to release the legal advice he received from the attorney general on this matter.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419936938|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|7daddadaa10b0ba4965d54ead2e388c073fa97cc -->",
