        "body":"<p><br />The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/sep/05/popandrock-indie\">last time</a> we featured the work of Elizabeth Sankey and Jeremy Warmsley, aka Summer Camp, on the blog they were fooling around with one of Odd Future as part of their stop-gap EP, Always. Featuring a much more dance-oriented direction in comparison to the chillwave feel of their debut, Welcome to Clondale, it was a catalyst for their recently released, self-titled, second album. Having convinced themselves and other people they could do more than just sun-dappled, vaguely ironic songs featuring snatches of film dialogue, Summer Camp, the album, feels much broader in scope and scale. None more so than on album highlight Two Chords, which has the delicate yearning of a break-up ballad (\"some days I still find it tough, I think we both do\"), mixed with the pace and feel of a 1970s soft-rock epic. Proving they haven't ditched the kitsch altogether, the excellent video – premiered here – features an embittered news presenter couple reporting on a litany of natural disasters as their own relationship falls apart, not exactly helped by a flirty weather forecaster played by Sankey herself. <br /><br />Two Chords is released via Moshi Moshi on 18 November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420043883|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|9c5acb2abe25647408f41b9f70bef743c873dba3 -->",
