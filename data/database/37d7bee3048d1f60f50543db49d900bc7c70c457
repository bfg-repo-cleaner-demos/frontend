        "headline":"Red Fortress by Catherine Merridale – review",
        "body":"<p>Only a handful of major European cities are dominated by one historic site. The castles of Edinburgh and Prague, the Acropolis and the Kremlin in Moscow are in a class of their own. Yet as a site both sacred and defensive, the Kremlin was from its beginnings a more complex structure than those in the other cities. The walled settlement has not just imposed its own ring form on the city beyond, but withdrawn from it, a symbol of isolation within the urban landscape as well as in the wider world.</p><p>Many ancient Russian cities had kremlins (and the original meaning of <em>gorod</em>, a town or city, was a fortified settlement). In some places – Pskov, Novgorod and Vologda, for example – kremlins survive to this day. But the emergence of Moscow as the leading principality of the late medieval era gave the Kremlin there a consolidated temporal and spiritual power unmatched elsewhere in the Rus. It is this side of the Kremlin – its history as a power base – that has inspired <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/catherine-merridale\" title=\"\">Catherine Merridale</a>'s <em>Red Fortress</em>, a historical psychogeography of this famous landmark from its misty origins as a forest settlement to the modern era.</p><p>There are two \"hearts\" to Merridale's narrative: the astonishing construction campaign in the 16th and 17th centuries, launched by Ivan III (referred to in his&nbsp;lifetime as \"the Terrible\", but the&nbsp;father&nbsp;of the famous tyrant), and the life&nbsp;of the Kremlin in the Soviet period.&nbsp;Merridale is, fortunately, far too sophisticated a writer to suggest any direct continuity between the two. But in evoking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ryszard-kapuscinski\" title=\"\">Ryszard Kapuściński</a>'s concept of the wall as \"a shield and a trap\", she suggests that the fortress mentality has endured: \"The Kremlin stood above the confusion of real life, cut off from its messy hubbub, defended, certainly, but also locked in.&nbsp;It was a metaphor for a good deal of&nbsp;Russia's subsequent history.\"</p><p>Merridale distinguishes clearly between the appeal of the site to later generations of Russian nationalists as&nbsp;a&nbsp;transcendent symbol of cultural, political and spiritual supremacy, and the constant process of reshaping the Kremlin territory that took place over the years. The demolition of major ecclesiastical buildings in the late 1920s, and the trashing of centuries of&nbsp;archaeological evidence to build the&nbsp;Palace of Congresses in 1961 were&nbsp;particularly egregious acts of desecration. Buildings constantly disappeared from the Kremlin, as Merridale shows, and some of the most&nbsp;impressive structures, such as Tsar <a href=\"http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/history-and-mythology/boris-godunov/\" title=\"\">Boris Godunov</a>'s enormous cathedral, a unique effort to house Moscow townspeople in this reserve of&nbsp;elites, never got built at all.</p><p>Both in its modernist sense of \"time in flux\" and in its style, <em>Red Fortress</em> is at the furthest possible remove from Soviet schoolroom sermons about \"the period of feudal atomisation\" and the rise of the centralising state. Though Merridale has drawn on work by recent&nbsp;historians of medieval and early&nbsp;modern Russia, particularly in emphasising the international contacts of Muscovy's rulers, she mostly ignores the canonical topics of those studies. This is a book of detail and imagination, in which the precise size and composition of the bricks used to make <a href=\"http://russiapedia.rt.com/foreigners/aristotele-fioravanti/\" title=\"\">Aristotele Fioravanti</a>'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormition_Cathedral,_Moscow\" title=\"\">Cathedral of the Dormition</a> occupy as important a&nbsp;place as diplomatic history or palace strife (though these are given their due). The result is something one could call a neohistorical account of the Russian past. Where sources do not supply information, Merridale resorts to imaginative excursus, capturing not just the enduring smell of the Kremlin in the pre-Soviet period (incense, candles, and in the period of its decline, mouse urine), but also the discomfiting moment at which two teams of Soviet professionals arrived at the Monastery of the Miracles in 1929, one to survey the place, and the other to pull it down.</p><p>Merridale expresses little sympathy with the Russian historical classics. But one figure with whom she does have something in common is the writer Mikhail Pylaev, whose studies of \"old&nbsp;Petersburg\" and \"old Moscow\", still in print more than 120 years after publication, have a similar focus on the&nbsp;sumptuous and the bizarre. From another point of view, Merridale's book&nbsp;is a brilliant contribution to the \"Xanadu\" strand in English literature: the fascination with the \"otherness\" of splendour and cruelty. This is not to suggest that she espouses every trite orientalising stereotype: it is above all the European setting of Moscow that dominates (a sketch of the period of&nbsp;Tatar dominance aside). But the Kremlin becomes a figure that allows Merridale to explore what she sees as extraordinary about Russian life, with the power of Orthodoxy and the power of demonic revelry placed in the centre of the picture.</p><p>The sheer force of the encapsulation may prove irritating to some, whether historians of a more conventional bent or internet trolls fulminating about insults to the Russian nation. At times, I felt like arguing with Merridale. There is something eccentric about centres: a&nbsp;history of the City of London that purported to be a history of the British empire, or the Catholic church through the prism of the Vatican, would be an appealing <em>jeu d'ésprit</em>, but how much more? Worse, the book can only enhance the tendency of journalists to&nbsp;use the (long anachronistic) term \"the Kremlin\" to describe every type of&nbsp;higher power in the country.</p><p>At times, too, the emphasis on secrecy seems overstated. For many working there, the Kremlin was just the nation's largest feeding trough. The&nbsp;clinics and canteens of the place welcomed humble museum employees as well as the spoilt darlings of the Politburo. Schoolchildren who visited the Lenin mausoleum might suppress giggles inside the place, but afterwards lay bets on what the leader was stuffed with: sand, maybe? In the security-obsessed Kremlin, you can still, if you speak nicely to a guard, walk across St&nbsp;Ivan's Square without a ticket: there is rule-bending as well as protocol. But&nbsp;<em>Red Fortress</em> made me remember the open-mouthed delight I took when, hardly old enough to know where Russia was, I studied the <em>émigré</em> artist Boris Artsybashev's elegant, aetiolated portraits of medieval Russian princes in&nbsp;his version of the&nbsp;folktale <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Simeons-A-Russian-Tale/dp/B000LF2A2K\" title=\"\"><em>Seven Simeons</em></a> (1937). Merridale is scornful of leaden state-sponsored exercises in the style <em>russe</em>, but her own mythologisation has the vigorous delicacy of the modernist Russian revival.</p><p>In the final stages, the post-horses flag slightly. From some points of view, the Kremlin is still a place of major importance. Its museum directorate, run by <a href=\"http://blog.britishcouncil.org/2011/04/11/gagarin_orbit1/\" title=\"\">Elena Gagarina</a>, daughter of the smiling cosmonaut, has recently steered to completion one of the most controversial pastiche projects in modern Moscow, Catherine II's neogothic palace at <a href=\"http://ouroborostravel.com/museum-reserve-tsaritsyno/\" title=\"\">Tsaritsyno</a>, more than two centuries after its chief architect, <a href=\"http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/art/vasily-bazhenov/\" title=\"\">Vasily Bazhenov</a>, was laid in the earth. But these are not subjects to interest Merridale; instead she retells the more familiar story of how the Cathedral of Christ the Redeemer (not in the Kremlin), blown up in 1931, was rebuilt, funded by munificent support from the government as well as private donations, in the late 1990s. Yet the relatively perfunctory handing of the recent past is understandable: Merridale's is the kind of writing that requires distance from its object. If the arrival disappoints a little, it has been an exhilarating journey.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/catriona-kelly\" title=\"\">Catriona Kelly</a> is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780300112269\" title=\"\"><em>Children's World: Growing Up in Russia, 1890-1991</em></a><em>. </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419942453|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|a20258ec86ccd704b40465a18dfea540513eba99 -->",

        "headline":"Eleanor Catton's precocious predecessors",
        "body":"<p><strong>Work: </strong>Dr Faustus (c.1589)<br /><strong>Author: </strong>Christopher Marlowe<br /><strong>Age: </strong>25<br /><strong>Plot: </strong>German don who moonlights as magician sells soul in exchange for boundless knowledge, long-haul travel and night with Helen of Troy<br /><strong>Rewards: </strong>Biography murky, but hit probably paid for more \"tobacco and boys\" and secured playwright/spy juicier overseas missions as Elizabethan 007<br /><strong>Legacy: </strong>Every comparison of a deal to a Faustian pact – between politicians and spin doctors/bankers/generals, say, or rock stars and managers – descends from Marlowe's play, although Goethe's cheeky muscling in on same legend means he often gets credit instead</p><p></p><p><strong>Work: </strong>The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774)<br /><strong>Author: </strong>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe<br /><strong>Age: </strong>25<br /><strong>Plot: </strong>Drippy toff decides suicide only solution as fanciable local women all spoken for<br /><strong>Rewards: </strong>Ample – wins aristocratic patron who ennobles him (hence \"von\") and makes him political protégé<br /><strong>Legacy: </strong>Ultimate template for all stories of neurotic, sensitive youths. Results in copycat suicides and what may be world's first fan fiction (in it, Werther's gun doesn't fire). Adored by Napoleon and kickstarts German romanticism. Werther's Originals not thought to be connected</p><p></p><p><strong>Work: </strong>Frankenstein (1818)<br /><strong>Author: </strong>Mary Shelley<br /><strong>Age: </strong>19<br /><strong>Plot: </strong>Bonkers boffin manufactures monster<br /><strong>Rewards: </strong>Calling card for career (after PB Shelley's death) as prototypical north London lady of letters<br /><strong>Legacy: </strong>The suitably scandalous mother of science fiction and horror, though after her the twin genres were taken over by geeks. Hollywood and British film industry both so indebted they should have named a studio or Oscar category after her, but may have been embarrassed at owing so much to a teenage girl</p><p></p><p><strong>Work: </strong>The Pickwick Papers (1837)<br /><strong>Author: </strong>Charles Dickens, as Boz<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 25<br /><strong>Plot:</strong> Jolly chaps have jolly adventures<br /><strong>Rewards: </strong>Secures bigger and better magazine deal for next book and is able to use own name. <br /><strong>Legacy: </strong>Pickwick Papers itself perhaps led to PG Wodehouse and Three Men in a Boat. Later, darker, non-episodic novels have been more often filmed, however, right up to recent works by Jonathan Franzen, Thomas Pynchon and Donna Tartt.</p><p></p><p><strong>Work: </strong>Woyzeck (1837)<br /><strong>Author: </strong>Georg Büchner<br /><strong>Age: </strong>23<br /><strong>Plot: </strong>Bullied squaddie kills sweetheart<br /><strong>Rewards: </strong>None, as the author died with his masterpiece unfinished. But does lend his name to a major German book prize<br /><strong>Legacy: </strong>Too radical for stuffy 19th century, but later inspires expressionist drama and cinema, and also underpins absurdism. Less happily, Woyzeck becomes byword for grim, expensive dates or family outings thanks to Berg's atonal opera version of Büchner's fractured narrative</p><p></p><p><strong>Work: </strong>Wuthering Heights (1847)<br /><strong>Author: </strong>Emily Brontë, as Ellis Bell<br /><strong>Age: </strong>29<br /><strong>Plot: </strong>Nowt so queer as Yorkshire folk<br /><strong>Rewards:</strong> Just baffled, yawning reviews complaining about \"dreary\" provincial setting and people<br /><strong>Legacy:</strong> Initiates two main strands of romantic fiction (the kind where she dies; the kind where he's sexily untamed or lawless). Responsible for careers of, among others, Stephenie Meyer, EL James and Kate Bush</p><p></p><p><strong>Work: </strong>Une saison en enfer (1873)<br /><strong>Author: </strong>Arthur Rimbaud<br /><strong>Age: </strong>19<br /><strong>Plot: </strong>Psychedelic tale of descent into underworld, possibly based on Camden Town<br /><strong>Rewards: </strong>He wanted none anyway – his affair with Verlaine was already over, and he retired from writing at 20<br /><strong>Legacy: </strong>Hero to surrealists and Beats, and hence to rock stars from Dylan to Doherty. Made all 20th-century druggy lit look tardy</p><p></p><p><strong>Work: </strong>Le Grand Meaulnes (1913)<br /><strong>Author: </strong>Alain-Fournier<br /><strong>Age: </strong>27<br /><strong>Plot: </strong>Schoolboy crashes belle époque rave, falls for aristocratic girl<br /><strong>Rewards: </strong>Shortlisted for Goncourt but lost to a nobody. Judges may have regretted decision when he died a year later in first month of war<br /><strong>Legacy: </strong>Arguably the key influence on The Great Gatsby, and directly or indirectly on any novel or film with a life-changing party at its centre. Nervous breakdowns for translators trying to decide whether or not (and if so how) to translate title</p><p></p><p><strong>Work: </strong>Sons and Lovers (1913)<br /><strong>Author: </strong>DH Lawrence<br /><strong>Age: </strong>28<br /><strong>Plot: </strong>Randy miner's son disappoints controlling mother<br /><strong>Rewards: </strong>Just too early for James Tait Black prize, which he did win later. Had already won Nottingham Guardian short-story competition<br /><strong>Legacy: </strong>Model for all kiss-and-tell autobiographical novels or plays, such as those of 50s Angry Young Men – sex obligatory, family psychodrama optional. Author's look (beard, loose shirt) also imitated by 60s and 70s faux-bohos, helped by Alan Bates in Women in Love film</p><p></p><p><strong>Work: </strong>The Sun Also Rises (1926)<br /><strong>Author:</strong> Ernest Hemingway<br /><strong>Age: </strong>27<br /><strong>Plot: </strong>Five go mad in Pamplona<br /><strong>Rewards: </strong>Letter from his mother saying \"every page fills me with sick loathing\". Later wins Pulitzer and Nobel<br /><strong>Legacy: </strong>Lady Brett, the novel's heroine, said to have shaped flapper fashions and hairstyles. Author's prose style very influential, from hard-boiled crime to 80s Carverian minimalism. His lifestyle, less so – huntin' and shootin' now confined to macho old-school thriller writers and rightwing historians</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420337592|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|d211d23398fd1d94bdad80ef0fe3e6f53ffd0266 -->",

        "headline":"Shooting Straight: Guns, Gays, God and George Clooney by Piers Morgan – review",
        "body":"<p>The big scoop in this, the fourth volume of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/piersmorgan\" title=\"\">Piers Morgan</a>'s diaries, could scarcely be more unexpected: Morgan actually turned down the chance to appear – as himself! – in a Hollywood movie. He was to be interviewing a character played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jimcarrey\" title=\"\">Jim Carrey</a>, whom he'd ask: \"What's going through your mind?\" Carrey was to reply: \"I really have to pee, Piers.\" And then Carrey was to have done just that, all over his host. Piers passed. The whole episode made me slightly melancholy. Is his ambition off the boil? Is he starting to take himself seriously? The Piers Morgan of old, you feel, would have done anything for the honour of having Jim Carrey piss on him.</p><p>That punchable face, that invincible self-confidence, that willingness to soak up and even revel in abuse, that astonishing ability to fail upwards … Morgan is sort of brilliant and he's sort of awful and he seems to embody, in his curiously weightless way, something of the temper of the times. He's a very pure avatar of the celebrity culture – remember him (you probably don't) hugging embarrassed-looking pop stars in the Bizarre column of the Sun back in the day? – and the way its values have penetrated the culture at large.</p><p>Launched into US television by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/simoncowell\" title=\"\">Simon Cowell</a> as a judge on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/simoncowell\" title=\"\"><em>America's Got Talent</em></a>, Morgan moved on from being rude about singing parrots and pole-vaulting dogs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jan/09/piers-morgan-larry-king-ratings-war\" title=\"\">to replace Larry King</a> on the flagship current affairs show on&nbsp;America's most respectable news network. Actually, and this looks a little like a metaphor for his divided soul, he didn't move on. Until NBC released him from his contract with <em>America's Got Talent</em>, he did both at once – shuttling from coast to coast, now anchoring live coverage of a natural disaster, now having his dressing room invaded by a troupe of dancing elves.</p><p>When you find him interviewing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/binyamin-netanyahu\" title=\"\">Binyamin Netanyahu</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mahmoud-ahmadinejad\" title=\"\">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> (\"Like most despots, he's a weird mixture of charm, ruthlessness, outrageous opinions and a very sinister stare\"), whether you find it hilarious or&nbsp;depressing will be a matter of taste. Don't expect geopolitical subtlety. His main observation after an encounter with Henry Kissinger is that \"Kissinger would have been the greatest movie announcer ever\".</p><p>Actually, he interviews Ahmadinejad twice and, oddly, doesn't seem to remember the first time when it comes to his account of the second. The first encounter has the Iranian president cracking fluent and even charming jokes, apparently in English. On the second, \"it's not easy interviewing him because he claims not to speak English, so your questions are translated and his replies are then translated back into your earpiece\". Pff. Who knows?</p><p>The first couple of volumes of Morgan's diaries, let it be said, were extremely lively and enjoyable. Boorish, silly, boastful, self-contradictory and all the rest of it, yes: but they were full of good gossip and – since Morgan was&nbsp;the editor first of the News of the World<em> </em>and then the Daily Mirror – it was gossip that embraced both celebrity and high politics.</p><p>The biggest problem with this book is that there's almost none of that behind-closed-doors material. Most of&nbsp;the interesting stuff that happens to Piers these days happens on television; three times a day to a potential audience of 300 million. So on the one&nbsp;hand, we can be more confident that quotes presented as verbatim will&nbsp;be accurate. But, on the other, for&nbsp;large parts of this he's essentially transcribing a long-since-broadcast, long-since-reported TV show.</p><p>And, because the show is a going concern, any confidences that his A-list guests might have offered in the green room remain in confidence: he can't risk pissing off celebrities and their publicists. Part of the fun of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/05/highereducation.biography\" title=\"\"><em>The Insider</em></a>, his first volume of diaries, was&nbsp;the total disregard for off-the-record courtesies with which he retailed private conversations. He'd already burned his bridges with those people. These people, he still needs.</p><p>So, for instance, he gets drunk with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/georgeclooney\" title=\"\">George Clooney</a> – \"drinking a lot of vodka, discussing everything from phone hacking to the Sudan, and exchanging regular bear-hugs\" – and what the reader takes away by way of insight is: \"He's hilarious.\" Morgan's guests are \"iconic\", \"fascinating\", \"world-famous\" and so forth, and our&nbsp;hero is prone to be \"profoundly moved\" if not \"humbled\".</p><p>The insidery stuff is TV-insidery. We get a good deal about hotels, planes and the ruthlessness of the biz. The entry for Friday 5 June 2011, for instance, is as follows: \"My ratings are getting decimated by a trial involving an alleged baby killer called Casey Anthony. A lot of our younger viewers are migrating to watch Nancy Grace cover this disturbing case on HLN, the news and views network. The big question is what the hell do we&nbsp;do about it? Larry got into ratings trouble overdoing coverage of hot tabloid stories like the&nbsp;deaths of Anna Nicole Smith and Michael Jackson, because it alienated his core&nbsp;CNN audience. Jonathan and I&nbsp;discussed it&nbsp;with CNN president Ken Jautz, and we all agreed that we should pretty much leave the Casey Story to HLN. But it's going to hurt us until the trial ends, no question.\"</p><p>This may not be as interesting to all of us as it is to the author. That said, the needle with Larry King early in the book (more or less defused by puppy-dog shows of deference on Morgan's part) is intriguing, and there's a fairly jaw-dropping passage where he describes having Gordon Brown round&nbsp;to watch the footie.</p><p>He is most serious about his campaign for gun control, which has secured him lots of hate mail and a foreword by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/michaelmoore\" title=\"\">Michael Moore</a>. Good on him, obviously. It seems to have been inspired in part by an HBO drama. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-newsroom\" title=\"\"><em>The Newsroom</em></a>, Will McAvoy's character \"has a reputation for being too lightweight, a reputation he then decimates\" – I know: don't write in – \"by suddenly transforming himself into an&nbsp;enraged, passionate hard-news assassin\". After watching it, Piers thinks: \"I need to find my own voice about something I really care about.\" A&nbsp;month later, after his first on‑air ding dong with a gun nut, a colleague says: \"You know something – I think you found your voice tonight.\" He sticks to a predictably sober defensive line on phone hacking when Leveson gets under way, by the way. So, as I say, gossip-wise it's thin pickings and there's not much in the way of political insight – he at one point suggests that all politicians should have admonitory quotations tattooed on their foreheads \"at birth\", which would be a neat trick.</p><p>And, God knows, you don't read it for the prose. Morgan is a very good TV interviewer (he really is), but he's a lousy writer. Paragraphs as long as three sentences are a rarity, and countless small acts of accidental violence to the English language are perpetrated. In the post-mortem disfigurement of dead metaphors he&nbsp;shows a sort of genius.</p><p>\"If they bury me into a deep pit of bile, I want to have them mutilated limb from limb.\" \"This bandwagon is well and truly up and running.\" Jamie Oliver is \"still ploughing his lonely but&nbsp;incredibly courageous field\". Charlie Sheen's million Twitter followers are \"the fastest accumulation of that milestone in Twitter's history\". \"I&nbsp;can&nbsp;almost taste their blood lust.\" \"This was a city that built him up, then&nbsp;spat him out and left him to fend, almost literally, with the wolves.\"</p><p>Cheap laughs, I know. But in an age when Piers Morgan is one of the most important men in global television news you could say he's got the expensive laughs sewn up.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419935329|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|fec68efe96e757996616377b08017bc66c4f07fb -->",

        "headline":"Ten reasons why we love Donna Tartt's The Secret History",
        "body":"<p><strong>1. It starts with a murder.</strong> The novelist's first trick is also her best: in&nbsp;a&nbsp;prologue, her narrator, Richard Pappin, tells us of the murder of Bunny, a crime &quot;for which I was partly responsible&quot;. He appears to have got away with it – and yet to be haunted by&nbsp;it. &quot;This is the only story I will ever&nbsp;be able to tell.&quot; We will have to&nbsp;read on&nbsp;to find out how he could have&nbsp;done such a thing. Coleridge said&nbsp;that Shakespeare always made apprehension predominate over surprise, and this is what Donna Tartt&nbsp;does. As we read <em>The Secret History</em>, we don't so much wonder what might happen as worry about what will happen.</p><p><strong>2. It is in love with Ancient Greece.</strong> Donna Tartt proves the truth of what literary parents piously tell their children: nothing can beat the Greek myths. The main characters believe so&nbsp;strongly in the power of these myths&nbsp;that they find themselves enacting one&nbsp;of them. But the novel, through its&nbsp;narrator, is also in love with Greek philosophy and history, with Homer and Plato. At the (fictional) university of Hampden it admits us to&nbsp;Julian Morrow's select class of Hellenophiles and allows us to commune with the most alluring civilisation of all.</p><p><strong>3. It has all the best elements of the campus novel. </strong>The college where the novel is set is just the picture: white clapboard and green shutters, a clock tower and ivied brick, the autumn glow&nbsp;of Vermont. Everyone who has ever been to university loves this peculiar subgenre, in which we can relive our earliest years of pretend adulthood. But it appeals to non-graduate readers too. Gilded youth is&nbsp;set free to experiment and be absurd;&nbsp;high pretensions co-exist with&nbsp;human&nbsp;weakness. Usually this mixture&nbsp;is comic, but Tartt is clever enough to see its darker potential.</p><p><strong>4. It has a classic lonely narrator. </strong>Richard Pappin is perfectly prepared to&nbsp;be entranced. Friendless and frustrated, without family support or&nbsp;sympathy, he arrives at university to look for a better life – especially of the spirit. A clever boy from nowheresville, he sets out to &quot;fabricate a new and far more satisfying history&quot;. At Hampden he is intoxicated to find himself in the&nbsp;company of the five eccentric, conceited, clever undergraduates who&nbsp;study Greek together and seal themselves off from the rest of the students. He does not so much befriend them as project his hopes and&nbsp;fantasies upon them. So he narrates with the force of passion.</p><p><strong>5. It is full of quotations.</strong> Within a couple of sentences Richard is quoting from Rimbaud (unattributed and untranslated). The book is liberally scattered with wise sayings in Latin and Greek – genuine fragments of antiquity that are as often mysterious as they are&nbsp;sagacious. You are leaving the sublunary world behind and entering a&nbsp;realm of literary and linguistic riches. Outside the novel's pages people are watching TV and talking in cliches, but within them you&nbsp;are in the company of the best that&nbsp;has been said and thought.</p><p><strong>6. It has a charismatic master of ceremonies.</strong> At this university there is&nbsp;only one teacher of ancient Greek, Julian, who accepts only a small number of intellectually qualified students. Sardonic, brilliant and charismatic, he&nbsp;presides like some academic magus over the aspirations of&nbsp;the characters. &quot;I hope we're all ready to leave the phenomenal world, and enter into the&nbsp;sublime?&quot; he asks rhetorically, at&nbsp;the beginning of one of&nbsp;his highly unconventional classes. Richard and his companions are devotees of a cult,&nbsp;and Julian is the secular priest, endlessly witty, incisive and mocking.</p><p><strong>7. It is obsessed with beauty. </strong>Tartt's narrator seems little interested in sex, but is readily intoxicated by beauty: human, natural, or poetic. The novel notices how important beauty is to us, yet how rarely anyone speaks of it. &quot;Khalepa ta kala. Beauty is harsh.&quot; (In&nbsp;the ancient Greek, the words for &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;harsh&quot; chime with each other.) This is &quot;about the first sentence that I ever learned in Greek&quot; and becomes a dictum for Richard. He comes to relish &quot;beauty that shocks you&quot;, as Alexander Pope put it – beauty&nbsp;jolts us out of our boredom.</p><p><strong>8. It believes in fate. </strong>As he looks back&nbsp;on his life, Richard notices all the&nbsp;apparently chance events that led&nbsp;him into the story that he is now telling. Everything is an accident (he applies to Hampden because an old brochure for it falls out of a jacket pocket), and yet telling the story makes&nbsp;it appear destined. &quot;Psychology&nbsp;is only another word for what the&nbsp;ancients called fate,&quot; declares Julian. The narrative is shaped by this ancient conviction.</p><p><strong>9. It is possessed by Dionysos. </strong>Friedrich Nietzsche knew that Greek tragedy was made out of the clash between the powers of reason-giving Apollo and enrapturing Dionysos. Richard learns from his companions and his teacher that the roots of wisdom are not just in Greek rationality but also pagan ecstasy. DH&nbsp;Lawrence would have appreciated what Tartt has learned from the god of&nbsp;wine and ritual madness. Get out there in the woods and rip your clothes&nbsp;off! Richard and his clever, foolish fellow students are would-be bacchantes who learn all about the dangers of this allegiance.</p><p><strong>10. It lets you in on secrets.</strong> Tartt's title is a cracker, not least because it is true to the appeal of the book. We, like Richard, are being given membership of a select group. One secret is given away at the book's opening, only because we can be assured that others lie in store. Every one of the millions who have read <em>The Secret History</em> has the delicious illusion of being admitted to the most dangerous of confidences. It is as if her every reader is the first and only one to read it.</p><p>• Donna Tartt discusses <em>The Secret History</em> with John Mullan at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/bookclub\" title=\"\">Guardian Book Club</a> on 19 November, 7pm, The Royal Geographical Society, 1&nbsp;Kensington Gore, London SW7.

        "body":"<p>The American magazine Mental Floss warmed the hearts of comics fans on Thursday when it announced that it had succeeded where so many others have failed: <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/53216/mental-floss-exclusive-our-interview-bill-watterson#ixzz2hzMknayX\">securing an interview with Bill Watterson</a>, the reclusive creator of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was only the second known interview with Watterson since he ended his popular strip in 1995. In the years since, Watterson retreated to a private life in north-east Ohio, where has carefully guarded the rights to his creation, refusing to license them or revisit them creatively. His contact with the outside world has been so rare, the magazine's editors told the Poynter Institute, <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/226212/mental-floss-editor-no-idea-why-bill-watterson-agreed-to-interview/\">that they put two fact-checkers on the case </a>to be absolutely sure they were talking to the real Bill Watterson.</p> <p>In the interview, part of a feature on the strip scheduled for their December issue, reporter&nbsp;Jake Rossen&nbsp;asks Watterson to put a few rumors to rest: no, there will never be a Calvin and Hobbes movie; and no, he did not actually burn a pile of Hobbes dolls sent to him by an over-enthusiastic stuffed animal manufacturer. He seems wary of the digital world, and of comics' place in it:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Where do you think the comic strip fits in today’s culture?</strong><br />Personally, I like paper and ink better than glowing pixels, but to each his own. Obviously the role of comics is changing very fast. On the one hand, I don’t think comics have ever been more widely accepted or taken as seriously as they are now. On the other hand, the mass media is disintegrating, and audiences are atomizing. I suspect comics will have less widespread cultural impact and make a lot less money. I’m old enough to find all this unsettling, but the world moves on.</p> </blockquote> <p>Over the years, reporters and fans have tried repeatedly to speak with Watterson. In 2003, a reporter <a href=\"http://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/missing/Content?oid=1484634%20%20\">for the Cleveland Scene</a>&nbsp;wrote about his trip to Chagrin Falls, Ohio, and his encounter with a man he thought might have been Watterson. A few years after that, Washington Post journalist Gene Weingarten&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dailycollegian.com/2010/11/08/gene-weingarten-to-discuss-pulitzer-past-with-umass-tues/\">told a story</a> about his own visit to Chagrin Falls, waiting in a hotel on the off chance the artist would agree to meet with him. The next day, around noon, the phone rang, but it wasn’t Watterson. It was Watterson’s agent. “He told me: ‘Bill won’t talk,'&quot; Weingarten said.</p> <p>It was only on the 15th anniversary of the final Calvin and Hobbes strip that the Cleveland Plain-Dealer <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/living/index.ssf/2010/02/bill_watterson_creator_of_belo.html\">succeeded in getting Watterson to talk</a>. As he did with Mental Floss, Watterson told the paper then he was still at peace with is decision to go out on top:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's always better to leave the party early. If I had rolled along with the strip's popularity and repeated myself for another five, 10 or 20 years, the people now grieving for Calvin and Hobbes would be wishing me dead and cursing newspapers for running tedious, ancient strips like mine instead of acquiring fresher, livelier talent. And I'd be agreeing with them.</p> </blockquote> <p>The makers of the 2013 documentary Dear Mr Watterson, which features artists talking about the debt they owe to him, were likewise unsuccessful in their attempt to get Watterson to talk about his work.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtmV7-f_j7Y\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KtmV7-f_j7Y?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420279965|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|d0944b7fd9f1e13837e94b312c58ef15054723d8 -->",

        "headline":"Eleanor Catton: The land of the long white cloud",
        "body":"<p>There is a playful antagonism between the inhabitants of New&nbsp;Zealand's two islands, North and South. If you're a North Islander: the South might have better views, but the North is superior because it has richer culture. If you're a South Islander: the North might have richer culture, but the South is superior because it has better views. It's a quarrel between substance and form, if you like, a question of emphasis – does a country's nature owe most to its history, or to its land? In both senses New Zealand is curiously compressed. The first Polynesian settlers landed less&nbsp;than 1,000 years ago, the first Europeans less than 300. Geographically, too, the land is compact: a five-hour drive over the spine of the Southern Alps will take you through a dozen entirely different landscapes – beach river valley marshland rainforest gorge foothill highland alps plains peninsula beach –and each with its own weather, its own skies, its own quality of light. (It is a strange thing how swiftly the forecast can change in the Pacific – dress for all weather, the backcountry guides advise you, and expect four seasons in&nbsp;a single day.)</p><p>The South is the more visually stunning, but the North is the more populous and cultivated: this is a contrast that recalls each island's proper name. The North Island is Te&nbsp;Ika A Maui, \"the fish of Maui\" (recounting the mythic tale of New Zealand's creation) where the South is&nbsp;Te Wai Pounamu, \"the waters of greenstone\" (describing the glassy stone, prized by Maori, that is found in the swift rivers and along the savage misted beaches of the lonely south). New Zealand national identity lies somewhere between these emphases, North and South: as a bicultural nation, it must identify both as \"the place of this people\" and as \"the people of this place\". In Maori the country's full name, Aotearoa, is a lovely kind of oxymoron: it translates as \"the land of the long white cloud\", as if clouds were properties of the earth, or served in some strange way to invoke it.</p><p>I grew up on the South Island of New Zealand, in a city chosen and beloved by my parents for its proximity to the mountains – Christchurch is two hours distant from the worn saddle of Arthur's Pass, the mountain village that was and is my father's spiritual touchstone, his chapel and cathedral in the wild. For many years while I was growing up my parents did not own a car. We rode around town on two tandem bicycles and one single (a source of considerable embarrassment to me at the time) and at weekends we would occasionally rent a car in order to drive into the alps, and go hiking.</p><p>My father is an expatriate American; he fell in love with New Zealand in his youth and never went home. As a child I didn't really comprehend my father's affection for the land, nor for the steep-sided alp to which he returns as to an altar: Avalanche Peak, a six-hour ascent above the cloud-filled valley of the pass. My sense of injustice about our family's \"weirdness\" in not owning a car was amplified by the fact that we did not own a television either – my parents were unapologetic about this, and told me very cheerfully that I would thank them for it when I was older, which was quite true. But at the time Dad's refrain \"Nature looks more beautiful in the rain\" was not met with good grace. Nor was his notion that a view was something gained through effort – scenery, for him, was something that ought to be deserved.</p><p>When we reached our summit, or whatever spot was deemed by my father to be of adequately punishing distance from the car to deserve lunch, Dad would invariably find he had forgotten his Swiss army knife (looking back, I begin to doubt he ever had one) and instead would cut cheese into slices with the edge of his credit card.</p><p>It is this kind of detail that I remember – the credit card, waxy and oiled along its edge – from our expeditions into the hills. I can recall the clean-smelling interiors of each rental car, always a different model and&nbsp;a slightly different shape; the empty glove box; the chipped toes of my boots; and how my hands became swollen and too weak to make a fist after a day of walking uphill. I remember, once, the rubber seal around the car door clipped into the shape of a postage stamp by alpine parrots looking for something to steal. But I don't remember the views – not as memories. In fact I am sure that I never experienced, as a child, any kind of encounter with the sublime, that catch in the throat, that tightness of the lungs, that sudden, roaring sense of one's extreme smallness in a huge, awful, beautiful world.</p><p>To experience sublime natural beauty is to confront the total inadequacy of language to describe what you see. Words cannot convey the scale of a view that is so stunning it is felt. In such moments natural beauty becomes a kind of devastation – it is pure encounter, too compressed in time and space to be properly contained. I do not feel the sublime when I look at a city, however impressive it might be in proportion and shadow, for the reason that a city is designed, in its substance it has been formally determined, and it has been named already by the fact of its creation. Words are adequate. I have never been moved to tears by a skyline, or a building, or a painted arch, but the sudden apparition of a peak from behind a sheet of mist is enough, now, to make me cry.</p><p>I think that a child does not feel the sublime because a child need not, perhaps cannot, confront the limitations of&nbsp;his or her language – language, for a child, is already miraculous, supple, generous in&nbsp;its association, tragic, hilarious, disproportionate and huge. Looking at a cloud-filled valley was less interesting to me (or at least, no more interesting to me) than looking at my father drag his thumb along the magnetic stripe of his credit card to wipe it clean.</p><p>When I was 14, my father took me on a tandem bicycle trip across the mountains. He had already taken my sister and then my brother, in his turn, and as the youngest, my trip came last. We were to cross the Lewis Pass, touch the Tasman Sea, and return over Arthur's in a loop. The trip would take&nbsp;four days. I remember with clarity&nbsp;the preparations for the journey&nbsp;– oiling the chain, strapping down our tent, fitting the road map into the laminated pocket on the front of the bike. But I remember, too, how hopeful I was that something out of the ordinary would happen; that we would discover something, or have to&nbsp;endure something, out of which might&nbsp;come a story.</p><p>My brother had described to me an event from his own trip several years prior. He had awoken early in the morning and witnessed firsthand the birth of a calf. He and my father had pitched their tent in the stolen corner of a farmer's lot, and so it was from inside the fence that my brother saw, not 10 feet away from him, the newborn calf slither on to the grass, unfurl its legs, and stand. The story had captivated me and stirred my jealousy to such a degree that I could recall the birth almost as a memory of my own – I wanted to return there, as to a favourite page in a favourite book.</p><p>It is curious to me how often we tend to describe the perfection and drama of the natural world, its sublime qualities, in metaphors of fakery or artificiality: \"like a postcard\", \"like a painting\", or latterly in New Zealand, \"like a scene from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>\". The impulse, I think, comes from a wish to apologise for the limited capacity of the \"real\" world. To grow up is to confront the disappointments of language, in a way, and to suffer the divorce between what we experience and what we imagine to be real. I was preemptively disappointed, setting out on the tandem for the mauve shadow of the hills, to know that I would in all likelihood see no newborn calves, that our adventure would have a different character to the adventure undertaken by my brother and my father. I had settled, I think, into an adult frame of mind.</p><p>I drove through Arthur's Pass recently, and stopped to climb Avalanche Peak for the first time in several years. The ascent is taxing, rising sharply through beech forest to the sudden treeline and bare grassy peaks above. The summit offers a view across the blue ranges and snow-capped summits of the island's keel. The final length of the ridgeline stands as a rocky comb of shale against the sky, dropping down on either side to wide scree slopes and rocky bluffs and nothing. Across the valley to the west is the rumple of a high glacier, a face of snow; to the east, a horseshoe cup of grey and green. And yet it is hard to describe – indescribable, until you're up there, looking down – because the mountain is something other than its substance, something more.</p><p>Travel brochures try to capture the quality of New Zealand's panoramas with adjectives – \"pristine\", \"untouched\", \"majestic\". But the words seem cheap and insubstantial, however accurate they may be, in the face of the real thing. The language of&nbsp;description is always a matter of equivalence (a word equals the thing it&nbsp;describes) and so cannot contend with the sublime. But the language of&nbsp;paradox, oxymoron and subtle contradiction – the language of children – does better. Aotearoa is a&nbsp;land made perfect only by its opposites, the water and the air. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;both north and south at once. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;land that casts its shadow on&nbsp;the&nbsp;clouds.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420271341|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|e98e378db01d675fea2a476441cab0685e3d79d7 -->",

In 1949, four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, meet every week to play mahjong, eat dim sum and gossip about their children.  Through their stories, and those of their four daughters, the novel explores the fault lines between two generations and two cultures. </p><p>The book became an instant New York Times bestseller, was nominated for the National Book Award, and has since been adapted into a successful film, for which Tan co-wrote the screenplay. Her other novels include The Kitchen God's Wife and The Bonesetter's Daughter, and her seventh novel, The Valley of Amazement, will be published this November.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on-book-tickets/spoken-word/amy-tan-guardian-review-book-club\">Book tickets</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420278043|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|2e96145da4a80847bc0afef1c689c7009a07fbd1 -->",

        "body":"<p>Are you prepared to be blown away? Because this is it, the final chapter, and the end has finally come for Maximum Ride and the Flock.</p><p>Max has fought, she has lead, she has loved... but is she ready to finally carry out her destiny? The finale is here- and it's definitely like nothing you've ever read. </p><p>As the Apocalypse grows nearer and nearer, the flock grow closer together. All their lives they have prepared for this, and step by step they have grown stronger. But is this threat too big for even the flock to handle? Will Max choose her perfect other half, Dylan, or her best flock member, Fang? And when the end finally comes, will they truly be able to save the world?</p><p>After seven books building up to this last adventure, this book gives the answers to the deepest secrets of Max's life, and does not disappoint. The puzzle pieces of Max's life finally begin to fit together, and yet more shocks are revealed, which will make you gasp all the way along whilst reading. This book will make you laugh, cry and smile all the way through.</p><p>I really liked this story, and I think that the Maximum Ride book series is another gem that I am surprised it is not very well known. I think this book series is worthy of being as famous as the Twilight saga or The Hunger Games.</p><p>However, I found that at the end this story had not truly satisfied me. I felt the book series, after so many adventures, had not ended quite the way I felt it should - like a hole that wasn't quite filled to the brim. But apart from that, I felt this story had a brilliant story line, truly memorable characters, and a plot that blew me away. Oh Maximum Ride, why did you leave me? How shall I cope...?! </p><p>I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action-packed, funny, and even a little romantic books; readers who have perhaps read stories like The Hunger Games and are looking for more. I found the books very cinematic, as action-packed as any great thriller movie, and I would also recommend it to anyone who perhaps prefers films to books. This book is impossible to put down, and is very addictive. It combines comedy, thriller, romance and fantasy together in a perfect mixture, making it suitable for all types of readers. Without giving too much away, lets just say that if you have been with Maximum Ride the whole journey, you're in for quite a shock when you read this one...</p><p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419614622|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|7fce7f7a90312655c7b68d5014a8cad94f46d7ba -->",

        "headline":"Morrissey's Autobiography is nearly a triumph, but ends up mired in moaning",
        "body":"<p>Thanks to a hyped-up fuss that has done its job in spades, this much we all know: owing to its author's provocative cheek and his publisher's marketing nous, Morrissey's autobiography is a Penguin Classic, which means it shares its imprint with Ovid, Plato and good old Thomas Hobbes. Self-evidently, though, it's also a high-end example of a literary genre that now seems to form at least half of the publishing industry's raison d'etre: the celebrity memoir, 2013's most notable examples of which include the self-authored life stories of Mo Farah, Jennifer Saunders, Harry Redknapp and Katie Price (again).</p><p>Despite career wobble after career wobble, the author has become an unlikely British institution: as the blurb on the back reminds us, \"in 2006, Morrissey was voted the second greatest living British icon by viewers of the BBC, losing out to Sir David Attenborough\". As unthinkable as it still seems, the prime minister will presumably be chillaxing with a copy as soon as he gets the chance.</p><p>What awaits him is, in its own way, as faithful to the celeb genre as all the other books that are piled into branches of WH Smith at this time of year. Though its 457-page splurge of text occasionally suggests a bold stylistic experiment – there are no chapters; nor, for the first 10 pages, any paragraph breaks – as with so many famous-person books, it also betrays a lack of editing. So too do some very un-Morrissey-like American spellings (\"glamor\", \"center\" – this is in the UK edition), his strange habit of jumping between tenses, and the odd passage that simply doesn't make sense. \"I will never be lacking if the clash of sounds collide, with refinement and logic bursting from a cone of manful blast,\" he writes on page 90. You what?</p><p>And yet, and yet. For its first 150 pages, Autobiography comes close to being a triumph. \"Naturally my birth almost kills my mother, for my head is too big,\" he writes, and off we go – into the Irish diaspora in the inner-city Manchester of the 1960s, where packs of boys playfully stone rats to death, and \"no one we know is on the electoral roll\". In some of the writing, you can almost taste his environment: \"Nannie bricks together the traditional Christmas for all to gather and disagree … Rita now works at Seventh Avenue in Piccadilly and buys expensive Planters cashew nuts. Mary works at a Granada showroom, but is ready to leave it all behind.\" And when pop music enters the story, he excels. Before the Smiths, Morrissey fleetingly wrote reviews for the long-lost music weekly Record Mirror under the name Sheridan Whiteside, and his talent for music writing is obvious. By the late 60s, he is marvelling at hit singles by the Love Affair, the Foundations and the Small Faces; in 1972, as with so many thousands, he marvels at David Bowie miming to Starman on an ITV pop show called Lift Off With Ayshea. \"It seemed to me that it was only in British pop music that almost anything could happen,\" he writes, which is spot on.</p><p>School, unsurprisingly, is hell, complete with Catholic guilt, unending brutality, and one grim incident in which a PE teacher molests him. When he leaves St Mary's secondary modern, he falls into a period of torpor and self-doubt. And then Johnny Marr pays him a visit, and his life takes off – while, in keeping with an unwritten rule of celebrity memoir, Autobiography takes a serious turn for the worse.</p><p>There are not many more than 70 pages on the actual experience of being in the Smiths, and around a quarter of those are devoted to complaints about their record label, the supposed commercial underperformance of their singles, and Geoff Travis, who founded Rough Trade records in the mid 1970s, and has clearly not been on Morrissey's Christmas-card list for several years. At first, what Morrissey says about Travis and his colleagues can be waspishly funny: before they signed the Smiths, he reckons, Rough Trade's brand was \"tubercular … hand-crafted on a spinning jenny\". But after pages and pages of moaning, it all starts to pall. Moreover, a pattern is set: any calamity or mishap is always someone else's fault.</p><p>As the story winds on, the clash between this account and the story as told by Marr and others becomes violent: as all other credible accounts have told it, the Smiths broke up because Morrissey would not be handled by a manager, and as their business dealings turned chaotic, Marr was worn down by not just playing the guitar and writing songs, but dealing with lawyers and booking hire-vans. Small wonder that the two of them \"signed virtually anything without looking\", or that their bond came to grief, probably the single biggest event in Morrissey's adult life. In the absence of even the barest recognition of any of this beyond a tortuous passage that claims that all managers \"merely manage <em>their own</em> position in relation to the artist\", Autobiography presents the end of the Smiths as a mystery, sullied by some innuendous stuff about Marr supposedly growing envious of Morrissey's profile, which does not stand up to any serious scrutiny.</p><p>\"Beware, I bear more grudges/Than lonely high court judges,\" went the lyric of Morrissey's 1995 single The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get, and he wasn't lying. As the bitterness overflows, there are still flashes of wit, along with some rather rum views (his opinion of the Kray Twins might strike some as charitable). Circa 1994, he finally finds love and companionship with one Jake Walters, who has \"lived a colourful 29 years as no stranger to fearlessness\" and who has \"BATTTERSEA\" tattooed inside his lower lip. Morrissey evidently melts – but soon after, he reaches his peak of bitterness and unrestrained verbosity: 40 pages on the court case in which Smiths drummer Mike Joyce (\"an adult impersonating a child\", he reckons) successfully made a bid for 25% of the band's posthumous earnings, and a judge named John Weeks apparently became the human being Morrissey hates most of all. Here, all levity evaporates: it's understandable that he feels so aggrieved, but when the verbiage dedicated to this stuff threatens to eclipse what he has to say about every other aspect of his career, something has gone badly wrong.</p><p>Towards the end, things pick up: he enjoys a career renaissance, moves to Rome, and once again finds romance and companionship with a character he calls Gelato. But a sour taste remains, and it's hard not reach for a line from that beautiful Smiths song Half A Person, released a quarter-century ago: \"In the days when you were hopelessly poor, I just liked you more.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420279688|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|e8bcce32769751e2a19d77f98d61022262ed9b44 -->",

        "body":"<p>There is a playful antagonism between the inhabitants of New&nbsp;Zealand's two islands, North and South. If you're a North Islander: the South might have better views, but the North is superior because it has richer culture. If you're a South Islander: the North might have richer culture, but the South is superior because it has better views. It's a quarrel between substance and form, if you like, a question of emphasis – does a country's nature owe most to its history, or to its land? In both senses New Zealand is curiously compressed. The first Polynesian settlers landed less&nbsp;than 1,000 years ago, the first Europeans less than 300. Geographically, too, the land is compact: a five-hour drive over the spine of the Southern Alps will take you through a dozen entirely different landscapes – beach river valley marshland rainforest gorge foothill highland alps plains peninsula beach –and each with its own weather, its own skies, its own quality of light. (It is a strange thing how swiftly the forecast can change in the Pacific – dress for all weather, the backcountry guides advise you, and expect four seasons in&nbsp;a single day.)</p><p>The South is the more visually stunning, but the North is the more populous and cultivated: this is a contrast that recalls each island's proper name. The North Island is Te&nbsp;Ika A Maui, \"the fish of Maui\" (recounting the mythic tale of New Zealand's creation) where the South is&nbsp;Te Wai Pounamu, \"the waters of greenstone\" (describing the glassy stone, prized by Maori, that is found in the swift rivers and along the savage misted beaches of the lonely south). New Zealand national identity lies somewhere between these emphases, North and South: as a bicultural nation, it must identify both as \"the place of this people\" and as \"the people of this place\". In Maori the country's full name, Aotearoa, is a lovely kind of oxymoron: it translates as \"the land of the long white cloud\", as if clouds were properties of the earth, or served in some strange way to invoke it.</p><p>I grew up on the South Island of New Zealand, in a city chosen and beloved by my parents for its proximity to the mountains – Christchurch is two hours distant from the worn saddle of Arthur's Pass, the mountain village that was and is my father's spiritual touchstone, his chapel and cathedral in the wild. For many years while I was growing up my parents did not own a car. We rode around town on two tandem bicycles and one single (a source of considerable embarrassment to me at the time) and at weekends we would occasionally rent a car in order to drive into the alps, and go hiking.</p><p>My father is an expatriate American; he fell in love with New Zealand in his youth and never went home. As a child I didn't really comprehend my father's affection for the land, nor for the steep-sided alp to which he returns as to an altar: Avalanche Peak, a six-hour ascent above the cloud-filled valley of the pass. My sense of injustice about our family's \"weirdness\" in not owning a car was amplified by the fact that we did not own a television either – my parents were unapologetic about this, and told me very cheerfully that I would thank them for it when I was older, which was quite true. But at the time Dad's refrain \"Nature looks more beautiful in the rain\" was not met with good grace. Nor was his notion that a view was something gained through effort – scenery, for him, was something that ought to be deserved.</p><p>When we reached our summit, or whatever spot was deemed by my father to be of adequately punishing distance from the car to deserve lunch, Dad would invariably find he had forgotten his Swiss army knife (looking back, I begin to doubt he ever had one) and instead would cut cheese into slices with the edge of his credit card.</p><p>It is this kind of detail that I remember – the credit card, waxy and oiled along its edge – from our expeditions into the hills. I can recall the clean-smelling interiors of each rental car, always a different model and&nbsp;a slightly different shape; the empty glove box; the chipped toes of my boots; and how my hands became swollen and too weak to make a fist after a day of walking uphill. I remember, once, the rubber seal around the car door clipped into the shape of a postage stamp by alpine parrots looking for something to steal. But I don't remember the views – not as memories. In fact I am sure that I never experienced, as a child, any kind of encounter with the sublime, that catch in the throat, that tightness of the lungs, that sudden, roaring sense of one's extreme smallness in a huge, awful, beautiful world.</p><p>To experience sublime natural beauty is to confront the total inadequacy of language to describe what you see. Words cannot convey the scale of a view that is so stunning it is felt. In such moments natural beauty becomes a kind of devastation – it is pure encounter, too compressed in time and space to be properly contained. I do not feel the sublime when I look at a city, however impressive it might be in proportion and shadow, for the reason that a city is designed, in its substance it has been formally determined, and it has been named already by the fact of its creation. Words are adequate. I have never been moved to tears by a skyline, or a building, or a painted arch, but the sudden apparition of a peak from behind a sheet of mist is enough, now, to make me cry.</p><p>I think that a child does not feel the sublime because a child need not, perhaps cannot, confront the limitations of&nbsp;his or her language – language, for a child, is already miraculous, supple, generous in&nbsp;its association, tragic, hilarious, disproportionate and huge. Looking at a cloud-filled valley was less interesting to me (or at least, no more interesting to me) than looking at my father drag his thumb along the magnetic stripe of his credit card to wipe it clean.</p><p>When I was 14, my father took me on a tandem bicycle trip across the mountains. He had already taken my sister and then my brother, in his turn, and as the youngest, my trip came last. We were to cross the Lewis Pass, touch the Tasman Sea, and return over Arthur's in a loop. The trip would take&nbsp;four days. I remember with clarity&nbsp;the preparations for the journey&nbsp;– oiling the chain, strapping down our tent, fitting the road map into the laminated pocket on the front of the bike. But I remember, too, how hopeful I was that something out of the ordinary would happen; that we would discover something, or have to&nbsp;endure something, out of which might&nbsp;come a story.</p><p>My brother had described to me an event from his own trip several years prior. He had awoken early in the morning and witnessed firsthand the birth of a calf. He and my father had pitched their tent in the stolen corner of a farmer's lot, and so it was from inside the fence that my brother saw, not 10 feet away from him, the newborn calf slither on to the grass, unfurl its legs, and stand. The story had captivated me and stirred my jealousy to such a degree that I could recall the birth almost as a memory of my own – I wanted to return there, as to a favourite page in a favourite book.</p><p>It is curious to me how often we tend to describe the perfection and drama of the natural world, its sublime qualities, in metaphors of fakery or artificiality: \"like a postcard\", \"like a painting\", or latterly in New Zealand, \"like a scene from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>\". The impulse, I think, comes from a wish to apologise for the limited capacity of the \"real\" world. To grow up is to confront the disappointments of language, in a way, and to suffer the divorce between what we experience and what we imagine to be real. I was preemptively disappointed, setting out on the tandem for the mauve shadow of the hills, to know that I would in all likelihood see no newborn calves, that our adventure would have a different character to the adventure undertaken by my brother and my father. I had settled, I think, into an adult frame of mind.</p><p>I drove through Arthur's Pass recently, and stopped to climb Avalanche Peak for the first time in several years. The ascent is taxing, rising sharply through beech forest to the sudden treeline and bare grassy peaks above. The summit offers a view across the blue ranges and snow-capped summits of the island's keel. The final length of the ridgeline stands as a rocky comb of shale against the sky, dropping down on either side to wide scree slopes and rocky bluffs and nothing. Across the valley to the west is the rumple of a high glacier, a face of snow; to the east, a horseshoe cup of grey and green. And yet it is hard to describe – indescribable, until you're up there, looking down – because the mountain is something other than its substance, something more.</p><p>Travel brochures try to capture the quality of New Zealand's panoramas with adjectives – \"pristine\", \"untouched\", \"majestic\". But the words seem cheap and insubstantial, however accurate they may be, in the face of the real thing. The language of&nbsp;description is always a matter of equivalence (a word equals the thing it&nbsp;describes) and so cannot contend with the sublime. But the language of&nbsp;paradox, oxymoron and subtle contradiction – the language of children – does better. Aotearoa is a&nbsp;land made perfect only by its opposites, the water and the air. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;both north and south at once. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;land that casts its shadow on&nbsp;the&nbsp;clouds.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420271341|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|e98e378db01d675fea2a476441cab0685e3d79d7 -->",

        "headline":"The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health and Disease by Daniel Lieberman – review",
        "body":"<p>The effect the modern western diet has had on our health and wellbeing has been a rumbling issue for decades; it has become more controversial recently thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/24/paleofantasy-evolution-sex-diet-review\" title=\"\">the influential evolutionary perspective on the subject</a>. When the organic food movement began, the premise was that traditional farming practices were the norm, from which we&nbsp;have departed by adopting intensive techniques to produce highly processed food. This could be dubbed the Prince Charles Line. But seen in the light of&nbsp;evolution, as Daniel Lieberman considers it, farming itself was the Great Unnatural Practice. At the extreme, the&nbsp;evolutionary perspective has given rise to the Paleo lifestyle, an attempt to return to the way we lived before the invention of farming 10,000 years ago: to live \"as evolution intended\".</p><p>Lieberman is far from endorsing such crass simplifications. Evolution, as he stresses, intends nothing. What&nbsp;actually evolves is due to many competing tendencies, and the result is&nbsp;always a work in progress with no destination. Notable figures including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-attenborough\" title=\"\">David Attenborough</a> and the geneticist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/stevejones\" title=\"\">Steve Jones</a> have remarked that human evolution has now ceased. Lieberman says this cannot be true: human beings continue to show a great degree of heritable variation, and reproductive success is also variable; so evolution of some kind must still be active. He goes further by regretting that for most of his career as a professor of human evolutionary biology he taught the old&nbsp;line that human biology has hardly changed since the Ice Age.</p><p>The question is: if human evolution is ongoing, what factors are influencing it now, as opposed to in the distant past? Genomic studies show that more&nbsp;than 100 genes indicate positive selection since farming began 10,000 years ago. Beyond the best-known example – the lactose tolerance gene, which has gone from almost zero to nearly 100% in northern Europe – most&nbsp;of them have not yet been characterised, but many almost certainly relate to the infectious diseases that accompanied hugely expanded human populations living hugger-mugger with domestic animals.</p><p>Lieberman is good at explaining why simplistic nostrums aren't appropriate for considering creatures such as human beings. We are not designed specifically to do one thing, but to be adaptable to many. Thus dark skin protects against UV radiation in equatorial regions but is gradually lost in northern climates probably because the weaker sunlight found there would generate inadequate levels of vitamin D in heavily pigmented skin. The body is&nbsp;designed to be good enough to do many things, but not to be especially good at any one of them. It doesn't have a large margin of error, unlike engineered structures such as bridges and aeroplanes, designed to withstand several times the stresses they will actually experience. Thus specialised animals out-compete us in speed, strength and visual or aural acuity, which was a problem when humans lived more or less in a state of nature.</p><p>Essentially, Lieberman's message is that modern life has created mismatches between our abilities and adaptations and the stresses we place on the body by often living thousands of miles from our family's origins, sitting down all day long rather than actively gaining a livelihood by physical work, and snatching at quick, high-energy foods.</p><p>The evolutionary approach produces some counterintuitive surprises. Fresh fruit juices are as much junk food as a cola drink – they produce a sugar rush, so it's better to eat fresh fruit with its additional fibre; chewing gum as a child is a healthy pastime, if the gum is sugar-free (teeth and jaws need the exercise that modern diets fail to provide). Without going the whole Paleo wild boar, Lieberman suggests we can learn something from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. He is a celebrated advocate of&nbsp;barefoot running, for example.</p><p>Since his book is all about trade-offs between incompatible attributes, it is only right to point out that, while his message is sound, it could have been made at half the length. In discussing the human plague&nbsp;of obesity he seems unable to resist the textual bloat that is equally a&nbsp;trait of our times. But given the vast outpouring in recent years of crank diets and earnest attempts to correct western lifestyle ills by some kind of Rousseauist regression, <em>The Story of the Human Body</em> is a reliable guide to a&nbsp;problem that is going to get worse before it gets better.</p><p><em>• </em>Peter Forbes is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780300178968\" title=\"\"><em>Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage</em></a><em>.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419929903|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|e17a00d81cda1fab7d61658f074af902067e10f7 -->",

        "headline":"Ten reasons why we love Donna Tartt's The Secret History",
        "body":"<p><strong>1. It starts with a murder.</strong> The novelist's first trick is also her best: in&nbsp;a&nbsp;prologue, her narrator, Richard Pappin, tells us of the murder of Bunny, a crime &quot;for which I was partly responsible&quot;. He appears to have got away with it – and yet to be haunted by&nbsp;it. &quot;This is the only story I will ever&nbsp;be able to tell.&quot; We will have to&nbsp;read on&nbsp;to find out how he could have&nbsp;done such a thing. Coleridge said&nbsp;that Shakespeare always made apprehension predominate over surprise, and this is what Donna Tartt&nbsp;does. As we read <em>The Secret History</em>, we don't so much wonder what might happen as worry about what will happen.</p><p><strong>2. It is in love with Ancient Greece.</strong> Donna Tartt proves the truth of what literary parents piously tell their children: nothing can beat the Greek myths. The main characters believe so&nbsp;strongly in the power of these myths&nbsp;that they find themselves enacting one&nbsp;of them. But the novel, through its&nbsp;narrator, is also in love with Greek philosophy and history, with Homer and Plato. At the (fictional) university of Hampden it admits us to&nbsp;Julian Morrow's select class of Hellenophiles and allows us to commune with the most alluring civilisation of all.</p><p><strong>3. It has all the best elements of the campus novel. </strong>The college where the novel is set is just the picture: white clapboard and green shutters, a clock tower and ivied brick, the autumn glow&nbsp;of Vermont. Everyone who has ever been to university loves this peculiar subgenre, in which we can relive our earliest years of pretend adulthood. But it appeals to non-graduate readers too. Gilded youth is&nbsp;set free to experiment and be absurd;&nbsp;high pretensions co-exist with&nbsp;human&nbsp;weakness. Usually this mixture&nbsp;is comic, but Tartt is clever enough to see its darker potential.</p><p><strong>4. It has a classic lonely narrator. </strong>Richard Pappin is perfectly prepared to&nbsp;be entranced. Friendless and frustrated, without family support or&nbsp;sympathy, he arrives at university to look for a better life – especially of the spirit. A clever boy from nowheresville, he sets out to &quot;fabricate a new and far more satisfying history&quot;. At Hampden he is intoxicated to find himself in the&nbsp;company of the five eccentric, conceited, clever undergraduates who&nbsp;study Greek together and seal themselves off from the rest of the students. He does not so much befriend them as project his hopes and&nbsp;fantasies upon them. So he narrates with the force of passion.</p><p><strong>5. It is full of quotations.</strong> Within a couple of sentences Richard is quoting from Rimbaud (unattributed and untranslated). The book is liberally scattered with wise sayings in Latin and Greek – genuine fragments of antiquity that are as often mysterious as they are&nbsp;sagacious. You are leaving the sublunary world behind and entering a&nbsp;realm of literary and linguistic riches. Outside the novel's pages people are watching TV and talking in cliches, but within them you&nbsp;are in the company of the best that&nbsp;has been said and thought.</p><p><strong>6. It has a charismatic master of ceremonies.</strong> At this university there is&nbsp;only one teacher of ancient Greek, Julian, who accepts only a small number of intellectually qualified students. Sardonic, brilliant and charismatic, he&nbsp;presides like some academic magus over the aspirations of&nbsp;the characters. &quot;I hope we're all ready to leave the phenomenal world, and enter into the&nbsp;sublime?&quot; he asks rhetorically, at&nbsp;the beginning of one of&nbsp;his highly unconventional classes. Richard and his companions are devotees of a cult,&nbsp;and Julian is the secular priest, endlessly witty, incisive and mocking.</p><p><strong>7. It is obsessed with beauty. </strong>Tartt's narrator seems little interested in sex, but is readily intoxicated by beauty: human, natural, or poetic. The novel notices how important beauty is to us, yet how rarely anyone speaks of it. &quot;Khalepa ta kala. Beauty is harsh.&quot; (In&nbsp;the ancient Greek, the words for &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;harsh&quot; chime with each other.) This is &quot;about the first sentence that I ever learned in Greek&quot; and becomes a dictum for Richard. He comes to relish &quot;beauty that shocks you&quot;, as Alexander Pope put it – beauty&nbsp;jolts us out of our boredom.</p><p><strong>8. It believes in fate. </strong>As he looks back&nbsp;on his life, Richard notices all the&nbsp;apparently chance events that led&nbsp;him into the story that he is now telling. Everything is an accident (he applies to Hampden because an old brochure for it falls out of a jacket pocket), and yet telling the story makes&nbsp;it appear destined. &quot;Psychology&nbsp;is only another word for what the&nbsp;ancients called fate,&quot; declares Julian. The narrative is shaped by this ancient conviction.</p><p><strong>9. It is possessed by Dionysos. </strong>Friedrich Nietzsche knew that Greek tragedy was made out of the clash between the powers of reason-giving Apollo and enrapturing Dionysos. Richard learns from his companions and his teacher that the roots of wisdom are not just in Greek rationality but also pagan ecstasy. DH&nbsp;Lawrence would have appreciated what Tartt has learned from the god of&nbsp;wine and ritual madness. Get out there in the woods and rip your clothes&nbsp;off! Richard and his clever, foolish fellow students are would-be bacchantes who learn all about the dangers of this allegiance.</p><p><strong>10. It lets you in on secrets.</strong> Tartt's title is a cracker, not least because it is true to the appeal of the book. We, like Richard, are being given membership of a select group. One secret is given away at the book's opening, only because we can be assured that others lie in store. Every one of the millions who have read <em>The Secret History</em> has the delicious illusion of being admitted to the most dangerous of confidences. It is as if her every reader is the first and only one to read it.</p><p>• Donna Tartt discusses <em>The Secret History</em> with John Mullan at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/bookclub\" title=\"\">Guardian Book Club</a> on 19 November, 7pm, The Royal Geographical Society, 1&nbsp;Kensington Gore, London SW7.

A caricature of masculinity, he loathed the cult of art and beauty that Wilde championed, and under the guise of saving his son from sodomy, he set about bringing down Wilde at the height of his fame.</p><p>The tragedy is that he succeeded. Wilde became the most infamous man in Britain. Queensberry bankrupted him. Even his copyrights and his library were sold. On release in 1897 he&nbsp;was forced to live abroad, separated permanently from his wife and children, who changed their name. Three years later he was dead.</p><p>Wilde loved his sons and had been a&nbsp;devoted father. He loved his wife, Constance Holland, too; in his domestic affairs, and perhaps only there, Wilde was unexpectedly conventional. He liked women, but in common with Victorian men of his class, heterosexual and homosexual alike, his interests and his excitements happened outside of the home – with other men.</p><p>Unlike other men, Wilde was flamboyant, outspoken and provocative. The all-male environments of school, university, the army, gentlemen's clubs and public life operated on a tacit code of concealment – whether of mistresses or misdemeanours. The \"love that dare not speak its name\" was a crime, yet in the eyes of society, Wilde's real crime was being found out. The Victorians didn't invent hypocrisy, but in an era of industrious taxonomy, they were the first to reclassify that sin as a virtue.</p><p>Disgraced and imprisoned, sleeping on a plank bed, his health broken, Wilde wrote a long letter to Alfred Douglas, later published as \"De Profundis\". It is&nbsp;a meditation on faith and fate, suffering and forgiveness, love and art. The strange thing is that in this, his last real piece of work, Wilde takes us back in tone and spirit to his first authentic work – the fairy stories or children's stories he wrote immediately after the birth of his two boys, Cyril and Vyvyan.</p><p>The work Wilde is remembered for was written over a period of less than 10 years. <em>The&nbsp;Happy Prince and Other Tales</em> was published in 1888. That volume marks the beginning of Wilde's true creativity. He had lectured extensively in the US – but that would not have won him any lasting legacy, any more than his journalism or his poems. He had published a great many poems, but Wilde was a bad poet – he rarely found the right words and he was old-fashioned. Read him next to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/emilydickinson\" title=\"\">Emily Dickinson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/walt-whitman\" title=\"\">Walt Whitman</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/wbyeats\" title=\"\">WB&nbsp;Yeats</a>, and you will see for yourself. We don't read his poetry now – it is dated and dead; too much Arcady and Hellenic Hours. The early plays suffer from the same verbal excess. Wilde at his worst wrote in purple. At his best he is dazzling.</p><p>The birth of his children seems to have regenerated Wilde as a writer. The tedious Hellenism vanished. The purple-isms faded. There are still overwritten images – Dawn's grey fingers clutching at the stars – and he never gives up his fondness for a biblical moment, usually appearing as precious stones or pronouns (thee and thy), but his style did change. The writing became freer and sharper, and also more self-reflective, without being self-absorbed.</p><p>Academic criticism of Wilde's work has too often dismissed these fairy stories as a minor bit of sentimentalism scribbled off by an iconoclast during a temporary bout of babymania. But since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jkrowling\" title=\"\">JK Rowling</a>'s Harry Potter and Philip Pullman's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philippullman\" title=\"\">His Dark Materials</a>, children's literature has been repositioned as central, not peripheral, shifting what children read, what we write about what children read, and what we&nbsp;read as adults. At last we seem to understand that imagination is ageless. Wilde's children's stories are splendid. In addition, it seems to me that they should be revisited as a defining part of&nbsp;his creative process.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420245865'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381770207982/the-Happy-Prince-illustra-001.jpg' alt='the Happy Prince illustration' width='460' height='604' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The fate of the Happy Prince echoes Wilde's own reversal of fortune from fame and money to destitution and exile.   Illustration: Grahame Baker-Smith</figcaption></figure><p>\"The Happy Prince\" starts a new note in Wilde's writing: loss. Emotions as poses are a distinctive feature of Wilde's work (\"I can sympathise with everything except suffering\"), and the&nbsp;poems had their fair share of lamentation, but from now on, loss is&nbsp;not a pose; it is real.</p><p>Fairytales always involve reversals of fortune. This works in both directions: beggars become kings, palaces collapse into hovels, the spoilt son eats thistles. Wilde's own reversal of fortune from fame and money to destitution and exile shares the same rapid drama. Fairytales are also and always about transformation of various kinds – frogs into princes, coal into gold – and if they are not excessively moralistic, there is usually a happy ending. Wilde's fairytale transformations turn on loss. Even \"The Star-Child\", in which meanness and vanity are overcome by&nbsp;compassion, ends with a kingdom that lasts only three years.</p><p>Wilde had a streak of prophecy in him. The children's stories can be read as notes from the future about Wilde's fate. It is as though the little child in him was trying to warn him of the dangers his adult self would soon face. \"Every single work of art is the fulfilment of a prophecy\", he writes in \"De Profundis\".</p><p>\"The Happy Prince\" is the story of a gilded and jewelled statue on a pedestal high above the town. One day, a Swallow late-flying to Egypt, after an unsatisfactory dalliance with a reed (\"She has no conversation\"), rests at the feet of the Happy Prince, who tells him of all the suffering he can see. He asks the Swallow to take the ruby from his sword and give it to a poor family. The Swallow does so. The Prince begs him to stay and to strip him bit by bit of all his gold and jewels to distribute to others. The weather is getting colder and the Swallow knows he should fly to the sun. But as he takes the Prince's jewelled eyes, he realises that he must stay, for now the Prince is&nbsp;blind. This is&nbsp;a lovely echo of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/01/king-lear-review\" title=\"\"><em>King Lear</em></a><em>,</em> when the blinded Gloucester is not abandoned by his son Edgar – just as Cordelia never abandons the love-blind Lear.</p><p>Winter comes. The Swallow dies at the feet of the Happy Prince, no longer sparkling with jewels and gold. The Mayor has the statue pulled down – proposing one of himself in its place. As the workmen melt down the Prince they find they cannot melt his heart. They throw it on the rubbish heap next to the body of a swallow.</p><p>I don't think anything could be closer in description than this to the rubbishing of Wilde and his genius by a society obsessed by appearances and indifferent to imagination. The soul is often described as a bird – and if Wilde is the Happy Prince, then the Swallow is his soul, that returns to him and will not leave him. The Reed, shallow-rooted, flirtatious, blown about by every wind, is certainly Douglas.</p><p>Wilde believed in the soul. He played with ideas of the separation of self and soul. This is the pivot of his chilling story <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, but he explored this sinister theme for the first time in his fairy story \"The Fisherman and his Soul\". A young man wants to be rid of his Soul so that he can marry a Mermaid. He gets a magic knife from a witch and cuts away his Soul. But his Soul returns to him once a year seeking reconciliation. The story ends in death, but not in tragedy – at least not in Wilde's worldview, where Love is the supreme value. And it is Love that asks for the supreme sacrifice.</p><p>In \"The Nightingale and the Rose\", a&nbsp;Nightingale colours a white rose red with her own heart's blood so that a&nbsp;poor student will have the most beautiful flower in the world to give to&nbsp;his beloved. His beloved rejects him and his rose, and the rose is thrown in the gutter, where it is broken by a cart-wheel. As Wilde says to Douglas in \"De Profundis\": \"Having got hold of my life you didn't know what to do with it … and so you broke it.\"</p><p>Indifference to gift and sacrifice is a&nbsp;theme of these fairy stories. In \"The Birthday of the Infanta\", the haughty princess humiliates the Dwarf who loves her. In \"The Devoted Friend\", a&nbsp;selfish Miller befriends Little Hans, a&nbsp;simple soul who tends his garden. The Miller likes making speeches about friendship, and never tires of telling Little Hans that the fruit and flowers he&nbsp;takes from the garden every day are only tokens of friendship. \"At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also.\" The Miller never gives anything in return, and when he has taken all there is, and Little Hans is dead of cold, hunger and exhaustion, the Miller thinks how selfish it is of Little Hans to die – not the kind of thing a friend would do at all.</p><p>When Wilde was out of prison and living on £3 a week, Douglas, who had sponged off Wilde for years, inherited £20,000. He refused to settle any money on Wilde. It was the painter Whistler, though, who was the model for the selfish Miller. Whistler was a sarcastic, self-interested friend whom Wilde ridiculed in his story \"The Remarkable Rocket\". In this tale about a batch of fireworks destined for a royal wedding, the Rocket assumes he is the&nbsp;star of the show: \"The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else.\" Whistler was uncomfortable with Wilde's success and gradually became more vicious towards him. As Queensberry closed in, Whistler abandoned Wilde. Later, when Wilde was released and struggling to write, Whistler suggested he try writing \"The&nbsp;Bugger's Opera\". But as Wilde noted, Whistler always spelt Art with a&nbsp;capital I.</p><p>Wilde had a lifelong interest in Catholicism, although he was only baptised on his deathbed. He had a theory that Christ was the perfect example of what an artist should be – a&nbsp;true individual, a political and social radical, someone who enjoyed the company of the poor and the outcast –&nbsp;as Wilde did. Someone who could forgive and in whom love was transfigured as imagination. What is the resurrection if not the triumph of imagination over experience? His most overtly religious story is \"The Selfish Giant\". In a world that&nbsp;is&nbsp;always winter, long before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/dec/10/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe\" title=\"\">CS&nbsp;Lewis</a>&nbsp;created Narnia, Wilde's Giant is both fairytale giant and Victorian industrialist. Wilde hated the hoarding and excesses of his epoch's materialism – not because he was a socialist, but because his whole endeavour, his cult of art and beauty, was a fight against the coarsening of the soul.</p><p>When the Giant builds a wall around what is \"his\" and drives the children away, he drives away the springtime, too. His only friends are hail and snow and bitter wind. Then one day, by a miraculous intervention, unsought and&nbsp;undeserved, the children creep back through a hole in the wall, led by&nbsp;the most mysterious child of all, whom the Giant comes to love. It is this Christ-child who returns for the Giant as he dies, covering his body in white blossom – the living opposite of the snow that had for so long covered the garden. The little child is wounded in the hands and feet when he returns – but in answer to the Giant's cries of outrage and revenge, the child explains that they are \"the wounds of love\".</p><p>In <em>An Ideal Husband</em>, Lord Goring tells the devoted but puritan Lady Chiltern, \"I have sometimes thought that perhaps you are a little hard in some of your views on life … It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.\"</p><p>And so when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a> says in all seriousness, \"so many of the stories I read allowed the possibility of&nbsp;frogs turning into princes; whether that has a sort of insidious effect on rationality, I'm not sure,\" we know he has made a category error.</p><p>Reason and logic are tools for understanding the world. We need a means of understanding ourselves, too. That is what imagination allows. When a child reads of a Nightingale who bleeds her song into a rose for love's sake, or of a Selfish Giant who&nbsp;puts a wall round life, or of a Fisherman who wants to be rid of his Soul, or of a statue who feels the suffering of the world more keenly than the Mathematics Master who scoffs at his pupils for dreaming about Angels, the child knows at once both the mystery and truth of such stories. We have all at some point in our lives been the overlooked idiot who finds a way to kill the dragon, win the treasure, marry the princess.</p><p>As explanations of the world, fairy stories tell us what science and philosophy cannot and need not. There&nbsp;are different ways of knowing. \"Bring me the two most precious things in the city,\" said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.foliosociety.com/book/SGT/selfish-giant\" title=\"\"><em>• The Selfish Giant and Other Stories</em></a><em> by Oscar Wilde is published by the Folio Society for £24.95. </em></p><p>• This article was amended on 17 October 2013.

        "trailText":"<p>From Martin Luther King Jr to black power, these books on the US civil rights struggle show how relevant the issues still are, writes historian <strong>John A Kirk</strong></p>",
        "headline":"Top 10 books for Black History month",
        "body":"<p>The US civil rights movement is a perennially popular topic that has spawned a massive body of literature. </p><p>What interests me about its history is how it engages with questions of race relations that are at the heart of US history: how a nation that became the world's model for democracy was born in the shadow of slavery; how that issue tore apart the nation in a bloody civil war; and how, despite that war, a new system of racial discrimination based on segregation, disenfranchisement and economic exploitation persisted well into the latter half of the 20th century. </p><p>I'm also interested in how the civil rights and black power movements emerged from grassroots activism, transforming some aspects of racial discrimination but leaving many other elements intact. The issues the civil rights movement raised are still relevant today – and not only in the US.</p><h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/biography/king-a-biography,david-levering-lewis-9780252079092\" title=\"\">King: A Critical Biography</a> by David L Lewis</h2><p>Of the many worthy contenders to choose from, I particularly like Lewis's 1970 biography of Martin Luther King, because it was one of the first to take on the task after King's assassination in 1968. While sympathetic to King, the book is not afraid to point to his shortcomings. Revealingly – and perhaps a reflection of King's acceptance into the pantheon of American heroes – subsequent editions have dropped the word &quot;critical&quot; from the title.</p><h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ella-Baker-Black-Freedom-Movement/dp/0807856169\" title=\"\">Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision</a> by Barbara Ransby<br /></h2><p>For many years, women's roles in the civil rights movement were neglected. Ransby's study charts the remarkable life of activist Ella Baker, who played an influential organising and leadership role over many decades and helped establish the foundations for King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Ransby offers a fascinating portrait of one of the movement's forgotten true heroes.</p><h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lost-Prophet-Times-Bayard-Rustin/dp/0226142698\" title=\"\">Lost Prophet: The Life and Times of Bayard Rustin</a> by John D'Emilio </h2><p>Rustin is another previously overlooked figure. Gay, pacifist, communist and Quaker, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/23/bayard-rustin-march-on-washington\" title=\"\">Bayard Rustin</a> was largely kept out of view so as not to attract unwelcome publicity. He was pivotal in organising the 1963 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/28/march-on-washington-50th-anniversary-live\" title=\"\">March on Washington</a> and he was a close advisor to King on nonviolence. D'Emilio's gender studies perspective broaches the touchy subject of sexuality in civil rights studies.</p><h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/In-Struggle-Black-Awakening-1960s/dp/0674447271\" title=\"\">In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s</a> by Clayborne Carson </h2><p>In the 1960s, many organisations contributed to the success of the civil rights movement. Few were as influential as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC, pronounced &quot;snick&quot;). A youth-based movement, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee\" title=\"\">SNCC</a> led daring direct action protests such as <a href=\"http://www.ibiblio.org/sncc/\" title=\"\">sit-ins at segregated lunch counters</a> and <a href=\"http://century.theguardian.com/1960-1969/Story/0,,105534,00.html\" title=\"\">freedom rides</a>. Carson, a former SNCC member and now the director of the <a href=\"http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/kingpapers/index\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King Jr Papers project</a>, skillfully offers scholarly insight combined with first-hand experience.</p><h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Civilities-Civil-Rights-Greensboro-Carolina/dp/0195029194\" title=\"\">Civilities and Civil Rights: Greensboro, North Carolina and the Black Struggle for Freedom</a> by William H Chafe<br /></h2><p>Chafe's book was one of the first to examine the civil rights movement from a &quot;bottom up&quot; grassroots perspective. He places the protests that launched the 1960 sit-in movement in a much broader context and a longer history of black activism. This was the first book I read as a graduate student, and it provided a model and inspiration for my own PhD thesis, which took the Little Rock school integration crisis of 1957 as its point of departure.</p><h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cold-War-Civil-Rights-Democracy/dp/0691152438\" title=\"\">Cold War Civil Rights: Race and the Image of American Democracy</a> by Mary L Dudziak</h2><p>In recent years, historians have begun to examine the civil rights movement within the context of international relations. Dudziak shows that the cold war made the US far more conscious of how it treated people of colour at home as it competed with the Soviet Union to win non-white hearts and minds abroad. Her book charts new territory in exploring international dimensions that shaped the movement – and how the movement shaped international relations.</p><h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Simple-Justice-Education-Americas-Struggle/dp/1400030617\" title=\"\">Simple Justice: The History of Brown v Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality </a>by Richard Kluger</h2><p>The struggle for desegregation in education preceded and outlasted the civil rights movement's heyday of the 1950s and 1960s. Kluger charts the legal struggle by the NAACP, the US's oldest civil rights organisation, which led to the landmark Brown school desegregation decision in 1954. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/usa/brown/0,,1216081,00.html\" title=\"\">history of the Brown decision</a> reminds us that the movement was built on decades of previous black activism. Kluger's talent is to focus on the human story and drama in the midst of describing complex courtroom proceedings.</p><h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Land-Liberty-Forgotten-Struggle/dp/B004JZWZK0\" title=\"\">Sweet Land of Liberty: The Forgotten Struggle for Civil Rights in the North by Thomas J Sugrue</a></h2><p>We often think of the civil rights movement as a distinct episode in the history of the US south. More recent studies like Sugrue's have shown that discrimination against African Americans existed nationwide, as did African American struggles to overcome it. His book not only challenges us to reconsider the chronology of the movement beyond the 1950s and 1960s, but also shifts its geographic coordinates to marshal an enormous wealth of research and an impressively diverse range of events.</p><h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Just-Soul-Responding-Consciousness-Relations/dp/185728139X\" title=\"\">Just My Soul Responding: Rhythm and Blues, Black Consciousness and Race Relations</a> by Brian Ward<br /></h2><p>The civil rights movement changed US politics and society, but its cultural impact was just as important. Ward's provocative study argues that black music did not just absorb influences but that it profoundly shaped the movement – from the artists and the venues they played, to the music industry and the role of African American-oriented radio. The author's exhaustive research turns up some fascinating episodes that reveal just how profound the movement's impact on popular culture was.</p><h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Waiting-Til-Midnight-Hour-Narrative/dp/0805083359\" title=\"\">Waiting 'Til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America</a> by Peniel E Joseph </h2><p>Was the black power movement part of the civil rights movement, or something separate? Joseph, a leading figure in the <a href=\"http://www.penielejoseph.com/legacy.html\" title=\"\">new black power studies</a>, makes the case for its singularity in the most comprehensive overview of the topic published to date. Rather than seeing black power as a series of unconnected iconic episodes and images – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/25/black-panthers-photographs-howard-bingham\" title=\"\">Black Panthers toting guns</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics\" title=\"\">clenched fist salutes at the 1968 Olympics</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis\" title=\"\">Angela Davis</a>'s loud and proud Afro – Joseph presents a picture of a coherent movement with its own distinct politics and sensibilities.</p><p><em>John A Kirk is the author of three books on Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement.

        "body":"<p>It's important for people to tell you what side they are on and why, and whether they might be biased. A declaration of members' interests, of a sort. So, I am going to be talking to you about reading. I'm going to tell you that libraries are important. I'm going to suggest that reading fiction, that reading for pleasure, is one of the most important things one can do. I'm going to make an impassioned plea for people to understand what libraries and librarians are, and to preserve both of these things.</p><p>And I am biased, obviously and enormously: I'm an author, often an author of fiction. I write for children and for adults. For about 30 years I have been earning  my living though my words, mostly by making things up and writing them down. It is obviously in my interest for people to read, for them to read fiction, for libraries and librarians to exist and help foster a love of reading and places in which reading can occur.</p><p>So I'm biased as a writer. But I am much, much more biased as a reader. And I am even more biased as a British citizen.</p><p>And I'm here giving this talk tonight, under the auspices of the Reading Agency: a charity whose mission is to give everyone an equal chance in life by helping people become confident and enthusiastic readers. Which supports literacy programs, and libraries and individuals and nakedly and wantonly encourages the act of reading. Because, they tell us, everything changes when we read.</p><p>And it's that change, and that act of reading that I'm here to talk about tonight. I want to talk about what reading does. What it's good for.</p><p>I was once in New York, and I listened to a talk about the building of private prisons – a huge growth industry in America. The prison industry needs to plan its future growth – how many cells are they going to need? How many prisoners are there going to be, 15 years from now? And they found they could  predict it very easily, using a pretty simple algorithm, based on asking what percentage of 10 and 11-year-olds couldn't read. And certainly couldn't read for pleasure.</p><p>It's not one to one: you can't say that a literate society has no criminality. But there are very real correlations.</p><p>And I think some of those correlations, the simplest, come from something very simple. Literate people read fiction.</p><p>Fiction has two uses. Firstly, it's a gateway drug to reading. The drive to know what happens next, to want to turn the page, the need to keep going, even if it's hard, because someone's in trouble and you have to know how it's all going to end … that's a very real drive. And it forces you to learn new words, to think new thoughts, to keep going. To discover that reading per se is pleasurable. Once you learn that, you're on the road to reading everything. And reading is key. There were noises made briefly, a few years ago, about the idea that we were living in a post-literate world, in which the ability to make sense out of written words was somehow redundant, but those days are gone: words are more important than they ever were: we navigate the world with words, and as the world slips onto the web, we need to follow, to communicate and to comprehend what we are reading. People who cannot understand each other cannot exchange ideas, cannot communicate, and translation programs only go so far.</p><p>The simplest way to make sure that we raise literate children is to teach them to read, and to show them that reading is a pleasurable activity. And that means, at its simplest, finding books that they enjoy, giving them access to those books, and letting them read them.</p><p>I don't think there is such a thing as a bad book for children. Every now and again it becomes fashionable among some adults to point at a subset of children's books, a genre, perhaps, or an author, and to declare them bad books, books that children should be stopped from reading. I've seen it happen over and over; Enid Blyton was declared a bad author, so was RL Stine, so were dozens of others. Comics have been decried as fostering illiteracy.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420122796'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/7/2/1341223882512/Enid-Blytons-Famous-Five--002.jpg' alt='Enid Blyton's Famous Five book Five Get Into a Fix' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>No such thing as a bad writer... Enid Blyton's Famous Five. Photograph: Greg Balfour Evans/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p><br />It's tosh. It's snobbery and it's foolishness. There are no bad authors for children, that children like and want to read and seek out,  because every child is different. They can find the stories they need to, and they bring themselves to stories. A hackneyed, worn-out idea isn't hackneyed and worn out to them. This is the first time the child has encountered it. Do not discourage children from reading because you feel they are reading the wrong thing. Fiction you do not like is a route to other books you may prefer. And not everyone has the same taste as you.</p><p>Well-meaning adults can easily destroy a child's love of reading: stop them reading what they enjoy, or give them worthy-but-dull books that you like, the 21st-century equivalents of Victorian \"improving\" literature. You'll wind up with a generation convinced that reading is uncool and worse, unpleasant.</p><p>We need our children to get onto the reading ladder: anything that they enjoy reading will move them up, rung by rung, into literacy. (Also, do not do what this author did when his 11-year-old daughter was into RL Stine, which is to go and get a copy of Stephen King's Carrie, saying if you liked those you'll love this! Holly read nothing but safe stories of settlers on prairies for the rest of her teenage years, and still glares at me when Stephen King's name is mentioned.)</p><p>And the second thing fiction does is to build empathy. When you watch TV or see a film, you are looking at things happening to other people. Prose fiction is something you build up from 26 letters and a handful of punctuation marks, and you, and you alone, using your imagination, create a world and people it and look out through other eyes. You get to feel things, visit places and worlds you would never otherwise know. You learn that everyone else out there is a me, as well. You're being someone else, and when you return to your own world, you're going to be slightly changed.</p><p>Empathy is a tool for building people into groups, for allowing us to function as more than self-obsessed individuals.</p><p>You're also finding out something as you read vitally important for making your way in the world. And it's this:</p><p>The world doesn't have to be like this. Things can be different.</p><p>I was in China in 2007, at the first party-approved science fiction and fantasy convention in Chinese history. And at one point I took a top official aside and asked him Why? SF had been disapproved of for a long time. What had changed?</p><p>It's simple, he told me. The Chinese were brilliant at making things if other people brought them the plans. But they did not innovate and they did not invent. They did not imagine. So they sent a delegation to the US, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Google, and they asked the people there who were inventing the future about themselves. And they found that all of them had read science fiction when they were boys or girls.</p><p>Fiction can show you a different world. It can take you somewhere you've never been. Once you've visited other worlds, like those who ate fairy fruit, you can never be entirely content with the world that you grew up in. Discontent is a good thing: discontented people can modify and improve their worlds, leave them better, leave them different.</p><p>And while we're on the subject, I'd like to say a few words about escapism. I hear the term bandied about as if it's a bad thing. As if \"escapist\" fiction is a cheap opiate used by the muddled and the foolish and the deluded, and the only fiction that is worthy, for adults or for children, is mimetic fiction, mirroring the worst of the world the reader finds herself in.</p><p>If you were trapped in an impossible situation, in an unpleasant place, with people who meant you ill, and someone offered you a temporary escape, why wouldn't you take it? And escapist fiction is just that: fiction that opens a door, shows the sunlight outside, gives you a place to go where you are in control, are with people you want to be with(and books are real places, make no mistake about that); and more importantly, during your  escape, books can also give you knowledge about the world and your predicament, give you weapons, give you armour: real things you can take back into your prison. Skills and knowledge and tools you can use to escape for real.</p><p>As JRR Tolkien reminded us, the only people who inveigh against escape are jailers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420122797'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348135542541/Tolkiens-illustration-of--002.jpg' alt='Tolkien's illustration of Bilbo Baggins's home' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tolkien's illustration of Bilbo's home, Bag End. Photograph: HarperCollins</figcaption></figure><p>Another way to destroy a child's love of reading, of course, is to make sure there are no books of any kind around. And to give them nowhere to read those books. I was lucky. I had an excellent local library growing up. I had the kind of parents who could be persuaded to drop me off in the library on their way to work in summer holidays, and the kind of librarians who did not mind a small, unaccompanied boy heading back into the children's library every morning and  working his way through the card catalogue, looking for books with ghosts or magic or rockets in them, looking for vampires or detectives or witches or wonders. And when I had finished reading the children's' library I began on the adult books.</p><p>They were good librarians. They liked books and they liked the books being read. They taught me how to order books from other libraries on inter-library loans. They had no snobbery about anything I read. They just seemed to like that there was this wide-eyed little boy who loved to read, and would talk to me about the books I was reading, they would find me other books in a series, they would help. They treated me as another reader – nothing less or more – which meant they treated me with respect. I was not used to being treated with respect as an eight-year-old.</p><p>But libraries are about freedom. Freedom to read, freedom of ideas, freedom of communication. They are about education (which is not a process that finishes the day we leave school or university), about entertainment, about making safe spaces, and about access to information.</p><p>I worry that here in the 21st century people misunderstand what libraries are and the purpose of them. If you perceive a library as a shelf of books, it may seem antiquated or outdated in a world in which most, but not all, books in print exist digitally. But that is to miss the point fundamentally.</p><p>I think it has to do with nature of information. Information has value, and the right information has enormous value. For all of human history, we have lived in a time of information scarcity, and having the needed information was always important, and always worth something: when to plant crops, where to find things, maps and histories and stories – they were always good for a meal and company. Information was a valuable thing, and those who had it or could obtain it could charge for that service.</p><p>In the last few years, we've moved from an information-scarce economy to one driven by an information glut. According to Eric Schmidt of Google, every two days now the human race creates as much information as we did from the dawn of civilisation until 2003. That's about five exobytes of data a day, for those of you keeping score. The challenge becomes, not finding that scarce plant growing in the desert, but finding a specific plant growing in a jungle. We are going to need help navigating that information to find the thing we actually need.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420122798'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348848437515/A-boy-reading-in-his-scho-004.jpg' alt='A boy reading in his school library' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Libraries are places that people go to for information. Books are only the tip of the information iceberg: they are there, and libraries can provide you freely and legally with books. More children are borrowing books from libraries than ever before – books of all kinds: paper and digital and audio. But libraries are also, for example, places that people, who may not have computers, who may not have internet connections, can go online without paying anything: hugely important when the way you find out about jobs,  apply for jobs or apply for benefits is increasingly migrating exclusively online.  Librarians can help these people navigate that world.</p><p>I do not believe that all books will or should migrate onto screens: as Douglas Adams once pointed out to me, more than 20 years before the Kindle turned up, a physical book is like a shark. Sharks are old: there were sharks in the ocean before the dinosaurs. And the reason there are still sharks around is that sharks are better at being sharks than anything else is. Physical books are tough, hard to destroy, bath-resistant, solar-operated,  feel good in your hand: they are good at being books, and there will always be a place for them. They belong in libraries, just as libraries have already become places you can go to get access to ebooks, and audiobooks and DVDs and web content.</p><p>A library is a place that is a repository of information and gives every citizen equal access to it. That includes health information. And mental health information. It's a community space. It's a place of safety, a haven from the world. It's a place with librarians in it. What the libraries of the future will be like is something we should be imagining now.</p><p>Literacy is more important than ever it was, in this world of text and email, a world of written information. We need to read and write, we need global citizens who can read comfortably, comprehend what they are reading, understand nuance, and make themselves understood.</p><p>Libraries really are the gates to the future. So it is unfortunate that, round the world, we observe local authorities seizing the opportunity to close libraries as an easy way to save money, without realising that they are stealing from the future to pay for today. They are closing the gates that should be open.</p><p>According to a recent study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, England is the \"only country where the oldest age group has higher proficiency in both literacy and numeracy than the youngest group, after other factors, such as gender, socio-economic backgrounds and type of occupations are taken into account\".</p><p>Or to put it another way, our children and our grandchildren are less literate and less numerate than we are. They are less able to navigate the world, to understand it to solve problems. They can be more easily lied to and misled, will be less able to change the world in which they find themselves, be less employable. All of these things. And as a country, England will fall behind other developed nations because it will lack a skilled workforce.</p><p>Books are the way that we communicate with the dead. The way that we learn lessons from those who are no longer with us, that humanity has built on itself, progressed, made knowledge incremental rather than something that has to be relearned, over and over. There are tales that are older than most countries, tales that have long outlasted the cultures and the buildings in which they were first told.</p><p>I think we have responsibilities to the future. Responsibilities and obligations to children, to the adults those children will become, to the world they will find themselves inhabiting. All of us – as readers, as writers, as citizens – have obligations. I thought I'd try and spell out some of these obligations here.</p><p>I believe we have an obligation to read for pleasure, in private and in public places. If we read for pleasure, if others see us reading, then we learn, we exercise our imaginations. We show others that reading is a good thing.</p><p>We have an obligation to support libraries. To use libraries, to encourage others to use libraries, to protest the closure of libraries. If you do not value libraries then you do not value information or culture or wisdom. You are silencing the voices of the past and you are damaging the future.</p><p>We have an obligation to read aloud to our children. To read them things they enjoy. To read to them stories we are already tired of. To do the voices, to make it interesting, and not to stop reading to them just because they learn to read to themselves. Use reading-aloud time as bonding time, as time when no phones are being checked, when the distractions of the world are put aside.</p><p>We have an obligation to use the language. To push ourselves: to find out what words mean and how to deploy them, to communicate clearly, to say what we mean.  We must not to attempt to freeze language, or to pretend it is a dead thing that must be revered, but we should use it as a living thing, that flows, that borrows words, that allows meanings and pronunciations to change with time.</p><p>We writers  – and especially writers for children, but all writers –  have an obligation to our readers: it's the obligation to write true things, especially important when we are creating tales of people who do not exist in places that never were – to understand that truth is not in what happens but what it tells us about who we are. Fiction is the lie that tells the truth, after all. We have an obligation not to bore our readers, but to make them need to turn the pages. One of the best cures for a reluctant reader, after all, is a tale they cannot stop themselves from reading. And while we must tell our readers true things and give them weapons and give them armour and pass on whatever wisdom we have gleaned from our short stay on this green world, we have an obligation not to preach, not to lecture, not to force predigested morals and messages down our readers' throats like adult birds feeding their babies pre-masticated maggots; and we have an obligation never, ever, under any circumstances, to write anything for children that we would not want to read ourselves.</p><p>We have an obligation to understand and to acknowledge that as writers for children we are doing important work, because if we mess it up and write dull books that turn children away from reading and from books, we 've lessened our own future and diminished theirs.</p><p>We all – adults and children, writers and readers – have an obligation to daydream. We have an obligation to imagine. It is easy to pretend that nobody can change anything, that we are in a world in which society is huge and the individual is less than nothing: an atom in a wall, a grain of rice in a rice field. But the truth is, individuals change their world over and over, individuals make the future, and they do it by imagining that things can be different.</p><p>Look around you: I mean it. Pause, for a moment and look around the room that you are in. I'm going to point out something so obvious that it tends to be forgotten. It's this: that everything you can see, including the walls, was, at some point, imagined. Someone decided it was easier to sit on a chair than on the ground and imagined the chair. Someone had to imagine a way that I could talk to you in London right now without us all getting rained on.This room and the things in it, and all the other things in this building, this city, exist because, over and over and over, people imagined things.</p><p>We have an obligation to make things beautiful. Not to leave the world uglier than we found it, not to empty the oceans, not to leave our problems for the next generation. We have an obligation to clean up after ourselves, and not leave our children with a world we've shortsightedly messed up, shortchanged, and crippled.</p><p>We have an obligation to tell our politicians what we want, to vote against politicians of whatever party who do not understand the value of reading in creating worthwhile citizens, who do not want to act to preserve and protect knowledge and encourage literacy. This is not a matter of party politics. This is a matter of common humanity.</p><p>Albert Einstein was asked once how we could make our children intelligent. His reply was both simple and wise. \"If you want your children to be intelligent,\" he said, \"read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.\" He understood the value of reading, and of imagining. I hope we can give our children a world in which they will read, and be read to, and imagine, and understand.</p><p>• This is an edited version of Neil Gaiman's lecture for <a href=\"http://readingagency.org.uk\" title=\"\">the Reading Agency</a>, delivered on Monday October 14  at the Barbican in London. The Reading Agency's annual lecture series was initiated in 2012  as a platform for leading writers and thinkers to share original, challenging ideas about reading and libraries.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420020634|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|86da68feed301740565f0f64e91cec30e8e6fd8e -->",

        "body":"<p>Funny old thing, that James Bond. Though <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ian-fleming\" title=\"\">Ian Fleming</a> died in 1964, his hero has had a charmed existence since, newly incarnated in a variety of actors and films, and in further Bond adventures written by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/kingsleyamis\" title=\"\">Kingsley Amis</a>, John Gardner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/sebastianfaulks\" title=\"\">Sebastian Faulks</a>, Jeffery Deaver and, now, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/02/solo-james-bond-william-boyd-review\" title=\"\">William Boyd</a>.</p><p>Of these, Boyd seems the best choice. He has a sophisticated interest in the world of espionage, a fluent prose style, and a crisp eye for a Bondish detail. He was pictured, on publication week, in front of one of seven vintage Jensens, each of which was to deliver a copy of Solo, his new Bond novel, to Heathrow, from where they would be flown to various destinations associated with Bond (or Boyd).</p><p>What will happen to the books in Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Zurich, New Delhi, Los Angeles, Cape Town and Sydney was not announced. Nothing very exciting, I presume. Standing in front of one of the cars, with young women dressed up as glamorous British Airways flight attendants, Boyd looked mildly bemused at this exuberant silliness, but was joining in with characteristic good humour.</p><p>I read all of the Bond books more or less as they came out (in paperback) and was, at the time, a devoted fan. James Bond was, to my American eye and ear, an immensely sophisticated Brit. He could be relied upon to defeat villains, bed any pretty girl, and eat and drink to a standard one could only learn from. Shaken, not stirred: must remember …</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond\" title=\"\">The films</a>, too, imprinted themselves on my memory: Ursula Andress emerging from the sea; Goldfinger, Oddjob and the poor dead, gilded girl; Pussy Galore and her lesbian acrobats. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/seanconnery\" title=\"\">Sean Connery</a> was an exemplary Bond, and while both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/roger-moore\" title=\"\">Roger Moore</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/pierce-brosnan\" title=\"\">Pierce Brosnan</a> made a decent fist of following up, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/danielcraig\" title=\"\">Daniel Craig</a> seems more an automaton than a flesh and blood hero. The films became increasingly reliant on special effects, with ludicrously extended chases of one sort or another, more like video games than movies; an arcade experience, not a cinematic one.</p><p>In the first edition market, the Bond books occupy an interesting and in some respects unparalleled place. In my Catalogue Number 1 (1982), as item 37, I listed an extensive Fleming collection, which consisted of all 14 novels, in nice condition in their original dust wrappers, with 22 further Fleming items. I priced it at £1,385, and remember counselling one of my customers not to buy it at what seemed to me rather a high price. The books, I observed, were only a bit of popular culture, unlikely to last, and very likely to be hyped while the Bond phenomenon was still bubbling away. I remember saying something similar about the early inflation of the prices of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter\" title=\"\">Harry Potter books</a>, which have – like the Bonds – continued to rise steeply. I am not a very good judge of this market.</p><p>The Fleming collection – which I had purchased from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/iain-sinclair\" title=\"\">Iain Sinclair</a> before he became a well-known novelist (he spent a lot of his time then as a book scout) – didn't find a buyer, and I had to break it up, ensuring a considerable Fleming inventory for the next few years.</p><p>If someone had bought it, it would have been a bargain. The prices for the Bond novels have escalated remarkably since then. I recently saw a copy of Casino Royale (the first novel) in beautiful condition offered at £50,000, and myself sold an equally pristine copy of Live and Let Die (the second) for £17,000. I wasn't particularly happy dabbling once again in the Bond market, but I was asked to source some of the books by a collector-friend, and that, after all, is what a rare book dealer is supposed to do.</p><p>My 1982 offering would now be worth at least £75,000, and I would hesitate to dissuade any prospective customer from buying Bond books, which increase in value year upon year. The process has recently been reflected in – and perhaps enhanced by – the issue of a magisterial bibliography of Fleming by the bookseller John Gilbert. It's a lavish, outsized, handsomely comprehensive account of the books, which in itself might be thought of as a collector's item. Originally published at £175, it is a companion worthy of its hero.</p><p>If you look at the price trajectory of the Bond books in tandem with other first editions over the same period, there is hardly any comparison. My 1982 catalogue had a lot of nice things, which would be worth a lot more today. It included a copy of Journey of the Magi coolly inscribed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ts-eliot\" title=\"\">TS Eliot</a> to his first wife – \"VHE from TSE 1927\" (£775, now perhaps £15,000) – as well as the corrected typescript of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/virginiawoolf\" title=\"\">Virginia Woolf</a>'s Freshwater (£4,250 then, perhaps £30,000 now). Both of these items are unique and important, and both need to be described and analysed with care so that their full significance can be understood. They are, in their own modest ways, part of literary history. Whereas my little Fleming collection had nothing special about it: none of the books were signed or inscribed by their author, there were no letters or manuscripts. Just a bunch of books, of the kind that I suspect you could duplicate with an hour's work on <a href=\"http://www.abebooks.com/\" title=\"\">abebooks.com</a> and a very fat wallet.</p><p>I do not know why prices of the Bond books have escalated so substantially over the past 30 years. Partly it is a market phenomenon: a lot more people read the Bond novels than Eliot or Woolf, and if a set percentage of the readership becomes collectors, there will always be more demand for the Bond books than those by highbrow literary writers. But the same is true of Barbara Cartland, and nobody collects her.</p><p>Like Sherlock Holmes, Bond is not merely a hero, but an archetype. Unlike the ultimate reasoning machine, Bond is an embodiment of the man of action, fit for any purpose, the ultimate answer to the manifold faces of evil. That the collecting market should respond to such figures (in children's literature think of Christopher Robin or Bilbo Baggins) is understandable enough. Collectors pursue a wide variety of agendas, but one of them is undoubtedly the (often unconscious) search for a figure with whom to identify, or one who touches some nostalgic chord.</p><p>In the meantime, the new Boyd/Bond is very enjoyable, with a full canvas of gruesome murders, hideous villains, sexy lovers and switched identities. I've read all of the Bond follow-ups, with varying degrees of satisfaction, and Solo is the best of them. It even has a new take on the perfect martini. Bold? Certainly. But Boyd has earned my trust.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420256008|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|9a770b6a51ab6134ff6ea293de7d18b592b7fdf8 -->",

        "headline":"Comic and graphic novel stars take over Kendal for new festival showcase",
        "body":"<p>There's a new kind of comic event coming to our shores, modelled not on the superhero-focused all-American approach, but on a much closer neighbour: the European comic festival. With founder patrons including the Costa prize-winning Mary and Bryan Talbot, the <a href=\"http://www.comicartfestival.com/\" title=\"\">Lakes International comic art festival</a> has an eclectic guest list, from the artist of The Walking Dead, Charlie Adlard, to the graphic journalist Joe Sacco.</p><p>And unlike a fair number of other conventions, which have come under fire in the past few years for only inviting only one or two women guests – if any – this weekend's event taking over the whole of Kendal, Cumbria, aims to include talents old and new from both sides of the gender divide.</p><p>Long-time Guardian favourite and multiple award-winner Posy Simmonds is one such guest, a prolific artist who has been drawing comics since she was a little girl. Her collection last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/19/mrs-webers-omnibus-posy-simmonds\" title=\"\">Mrs Weber's Omnibus</a>, brought together her <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780224096836\" title=\"\">long-running strips for the Guardian</a> about a well-meaning middle-class family.</p><p>\"As a child,\" Simmonds tells me, \"I liked the combination of words and pictures -  in bound copies of Punch magazines and, later, in the piles of comics some American kids used to give me. There was also something subversive about comics that appealed - adults didn't approve of them.\"</p><p>That subversiveness has long been a key component of the medium, and something that has tied comics to women's history throughout the decades. Visiting from the US, the cartoonist <a href=\"http://www.trinarobbins.com/Trina_Robbins/Welcome.html\" title=\"\">Trina Robbins</a> will be discussing her half-century career in comics, from her beginnings as one of the most influential underground comix artists in the 1970s, when she led the feminist charge against the boys' club attitude that prevailed at the time.</p><p>But comics and feminism have been intertwined long before underground comix hit the counterculture scene, as can be seen in the movement covered in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/02/costa-awards-graphic-novel-biography\" title=\"\">Mary Talbot</a>'s second graphic novel, Sally Heathcote: Suffragette (Jonathan Cape, to be published May 2014), illustrated by Edinburgh artist <a href=\"http://arts.theguardian.com/pictures/image/0,8543,-10104994556,00.html\" title=\"\">Kate Charlesworth</a>.</p><p>\"I seem to have arrived at comics accidentally,\" Charlesworth says. \"I've never aspired to art or literature, but  comics are an astonishingly accommodating medium - narrative and visuals creating something bigger than the sum of their parts - like two good collaborators getting together.\"</p><p>The late 19th and early 20th century witnessed the Suffragette struggle on many fronts, and cartoonists did battle in the pages of newspapers. A history of the movement in this very medium is perhaps rather fitting.</p><p>\"Comics can put the drama and humanity back into histories which may have been stripped back to key facts,\" Charlesworth says, \"and also have the space to investigate complex issues, in this case feminism. Both sides in the suffrage debate employed cartoons and comic narratives as powerful propaganda tools.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420258568'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382005675888/mary-and-bryan-talbot-010.jpg' alt='mary and bryan talbot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mary and Brian Talbot, patrons of the Lakes International comic art festival. Photograph: PA</figcaption></figure><p>The ability of comics to  explore issues is something that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/28/anorexia-affects-everyone-family-katie-green\" title=\"\">Katie Green</a> has made the most of in her first graphic novel, Lighter Than My Shadow (Jonathan Cape). The story of her own  struggle with an eating disorder, it's a heavy book, both literally and in subject matter.</p><p>\"Comics is a very accessible medium,\" Green explains. \"You don't need any fancy equipment or a special place to display them, you can start with just a pen and some paper. I'm a very visual person, but I am also a control freak.  When making comics you have ultimate control over every aspect of set and costume design, pacing and storytelling, character and dialogue, while still creating something visual and utterly immersive in a way that the written word isn't.\"</p><p>\"Reading a comic is very intimate,\" she continues, \"and for me that was always a comfort when drawing about such personal stuff: that it would be experienced by one person at a time in the privacy of their own reading. Also the combination of visual language with text gives so many possibilities for expression: there are things words can say that images can't, and likewise things images can say that words can't. But there are also things that can only be said with both words and images working together, a language that is unique to comics.\"</p><p>For others looking to work out their own difficult issues on the page, Green advises: \"If it feels important to tell, tell it. The more we talk about the difficult things, the less difficult they become to talk about.\"</p><p>Relative newcomer Isabel Greenberg has made a big impact in the last couple of years, and the winner of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/observer-graphic-short-story-prize\" title=\"\">Jonathan Cape/Observer/Comica graphic short story prize</a> in 2011 has now released her first graphic novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/14/encyclopedia-early-earth-isabel-greenberg\" title=\"\">The Encyclopedia of Early Earth</a> (Jonathan Cape). Unfortunately she has also experienced one of the major difficulties many comic creators experience in the mainstream press – condescension.  A <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/03/graphic-novelist-isabel-greenberg-dont-put-that-in-it-makes-me-sound-super-nerdy-4132040/\" title=\"\">recent interview</a> described her as a \"petite blonde\", \"princess\", and compared her to Tinkerbell.</p><p>Greenberg hasn't felt sidelined in the UK comics scene itself however, and certainly indie comic fairs have a very even gender split. \"Generations of women have struggled so that I can be so lucky,\" she tells me.</p><p>One such generation of course includes Posy Simmonds and Trina Robbins. Pretty in Ink (Fantagraphics, December), Robbins's most recent \"herstorian\" or feminist history, illustrates the struggles that women artists and cartoonists have faced across the decades. But overall, coverage of comics and women creators has almost certainly improved - not least because the audience is ever expanding, and increasingly diverse.</p><p>\"Graphic novels and comics are getting a bit more attention in the mainstream media,\" says Simmonds. \"Nothing like the attention paid to comics in France and Belgium, say, but a big difference from 20 years ago. I remember telling someone I was writing a graphic serial and they said 'Graphic? Why're you writing filth?'\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicartfestival.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Lakes International Comic Art Festival runs from October 18-20; comicartfestival.com</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420236994|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|2ac708d6ea10d7f3f42f40ce6b1c1e517bc2ee6e -->",

        "headline":"Murders in the Rue Morgue: there'd have been no Sherlock Holmes without detective Dupin",
        "body":"<p>According to the introduction in my copy of the Everyman's edition of Edgar Allan Poe's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007420223\" title=\"\">Tales of Mystery and Imagination</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ts-eliot\" title=\"\">TS Eliot</a> said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/edgarallanpoe\" title=\"\">Poe</a>'s writing was \"slipshod\", while Mark Twain found him \"unreadable\". And the reliably snooty <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/henryjames\" title=\"\">Henry James</a> wrote: \"To take [Poe] with more than a certain degree of seriousness is to lack seriousness one's self. An enthusiasm for Poe is the mark of a decidedly primitive stage of reflection.\"</p><p>After rereading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/05/classics-corner-edgar-allan-poe\">The Murders in the Rue Morgue</a>, I understand  these criticisms. I can especially see why TS Eliot might describe the prose as \"slipshod\". The sentences are frequently tangled and the dialogue, well, it's like this:</p><blockquote><p>\"Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for 15 minutes at least. All at one Dupin broke forth with these words: 'He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for the Théâtre des Variétés.'<br />'There can be no doubt of that,' I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an instant afterwards I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.<br />'Dupin,' said I gravely, 'this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How was it possible you should know I was thinking of ____?'\"</p></blockquote><p>The technical term for such exchanges is \"silly\". The trail of deduction Dupin next outlines is dafter still, and it's one he claims enabled him to work out what his companion was thinking. Does it really seem likely that someone would think of \"stereotomy\" when stepping on a crack on the pavement, and from there go to Epicurus's atoms and then right to the constellation Orion? Does it also seem likely that someone else would understand and follow this train of thought simply by watching the person? And that's before we get to the meat of the story (look away now if you don't want to spoil the extremely surprising ending): a mystery set in motion when an orangutan goes on the rampage, cuts off an old woman's head with a razor and throttles and then stuffs her daughter up a chimney – at which point one can't help but make a joke about Henry James describing Poe's writing as \"primitive\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420132716'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381918999319/Sherlock---Series-2-009.jpg' alt='Sherlock - Series 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The birth of a genre … would we have had a Holmes and Dr Watson without the detective Dupin? Photograph: Colin Hutton</figcaption></figure><p>While it's easy to pick holes in The Murders in the Rue Morgue, it's easier still to enjoy and admire it. Once I'd made it past the opening, and Poe's decidedly wacky theory that draughts provide a better test of \"the higher powers of the reflective intellect\" than chess, I was hooked. Perhaps we've gone slightly off the theme of this Halloween instalment of the Reading Group by tackling one of Poe's detective stories, but the gory details were among the things that most impressed me. How to resist a newspaper report that starts with the information: \"The inhabitants of Quartier St Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks\"? Who wouldn't shudder upon reading: \"On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been pulled up by the roots\"? By the roots! Later, we learn that these roots were \"clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp\". The poor murdered woman, meanwhile, was found with a face that was \"fearfully discoloured, and the eyeballs protruded. The tongue had been partially bitten through ... \"</p><p>This is strong stuff. Especially because, at this stage, we aren't aware that the killings have been carried out not by a singularly brutal man but by a rampaging monkey. That the story hinges on this beast may seem absurd, but it is splendidly presented. I loved how the whole story depends on the ape picking up his master's razor because he wished to emulate him, and have a shave. Such glorious, hideous absurdity. And while I might have doubted Dupin's deductive powers, the way he solves the story's conundrum of the sealed room and works out that the orangutan's master was a sailor from a Maltese vessel is exhilarating and brilliant.</p><p>Of course, the most exciting thing about this story is witnessing a new genre spring fully formed into the world. There may well have been detective stories without Dupin and his continually astounded companion, but there would definitely not have been any Holmes and Watson. The duo are so like Conan Doyle's in their attitude towards each other, in their manner of speaking and in how they solve problems together that reading the word \"Dupin\" in the text becomes a stumbling point. Isn't this Holmes speaking? Why does he utter a French tag instead of retreating to Baker Street? Conan Doyle's debt to Poe is hard to estimate – as is our own. The Murders in the Rue Morgue has changed the face of popular culture, and is essential reading for that reason alone. For inventing such a fully realised detective before the word \"detective\" even existed,  it's tempting to label Poe a genius. Or does that take things too far?

        "headline":"Her Brilliant Career: Ten Extraordinary Women of the Fifties by Rachel Cooke – review",
        "body":"<p>At the end of <em>My Brilliant Career</em>, the 1901 novel by Miles Franklin (who was actually Stella Miles Franklin), the heroine who dreamed of becoming a writer is left thwarted and misunderstood, with little prospect of making the life she imagined. Rachel Cooke invokes that sad inheritance in her title, but does not dwell on it. Hers is an exuberant, glass-chinking book about 10 women a couple of generations later who – with phenomenal energy and determination – built the brilliant careers they wanted.</p><p>This is a splendidly various collection of \"brief lives\" written with both gusto&nbsp;and sensitivity. Most readers will&nbsp;know some of the subjects, but not&nbsp;all. There&nbsp;is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-alison-smithson-1462016.html\" title=\"\">Alison Smithson</a>, the modernist architect. Margery Fish, gardener and&nbsp;plantswoman. The barrister Rose Heilbron, later a high court judge. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/18/guardianobituaries.food\" title=\"\">Patience Gray</a>, the cookery writer who far out-sold Elizabeth David. The archaeologist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/11/rereading-a-land-jacquetta-hawkes\" title=\"\">Jacquetta Hawkes, author of that sensuous geological masterpiece <em>A Land</em></a>.</p><p>One chapter is inhabited by three of&nbsp;Cooke's Tremendous 10 (and yes, there is a touch of the hockey-stick in the tone, but the effect is generally invigorating). They lived in a crowded three-way relationship, so it all makes sense: the journalist Nancy Spain, Joan&nbsp;Werner Laurie, founder of She magazine, and Sheila Van Damm, who trained as a formation flying pilot, found there was no place for women in aviation, wondered what to do, and then became a racing driver. Sisters-in-law <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Box\" title=\"\">Muriel Box</a> and Betty Box share a&nbsp;chapter because they were both making their way in the film industry. This is Betty Box who became Betty Box Office after producing the huge hit <em>Doctor in the House</em>. She had insisted on casting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/10/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Dirk Bogarde</a>; nobody else had thought he was much good.</p><p>Box looks sensational in the photos, taking a coffee break with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/katharinehepburn\" title=\"\">Katharine Hepburn</a>, but it's important that Cooke studies directors and producers rather than the on-screen stars. All her subjects are poised between being exceptional individuals and being trailblazers in paths we might aspire to follow. She purposely decided not to write about Celia Johnson and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/31/biography.stage\" title=\"\">Margot Fonteyn</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath\" title=\"\">Sylvia Plath</a> was never in contention. So, though we're used to reading about the lives of the great artists, writers and thinkers, this book is not about them. On the other hand, though we're increasingly drawn to what Woolf called \"infinitely obscure lives\" that \"remain to be recorded\", this is not a project of recovery. The idea, appealingly, is to think about women who became well-known for being terrifically good at what they did. They were professional pioneers of the 1950s, respected by their peers and remembered admiringly, perhaps not by millions, but certainly by those working in related fields. They&nbsp;were all career women when that&nbsp;was rare, and today's working women are in their debt.</p><p>I am ashamed that, though I have an office next to the law faculty at the University of Liverpool, I did not know the story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/dec/13/guardianobituaries.gender\" title=\"\">Rose Heilbron</a>, who studied here in the early 1930s. She became the second woman in the country to get a first-class law degree, before going on to take silk in her mid-30s. The court reporters loved the twinkle in her eyes and the angle of her wig, though eventually everyone had to concede that there was a bit more to her than that. When she successfully defended striking dockers in 1951, crowds of Liverpool workers lined the platform at&nbsp;Lime Street to salute her&nbsp;return.</p><p>Heilbron and Smithson stand out as the only representatives of women in \"the professions\" – this is not a book of office jobs. The triumphs of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/nov/30/shopping.gardens\" title=\"\">Margery Fish</a> are in her&nbsp;garden at East Lambrook, where she collected thousands of&nbsp;plant varieties. In housecoat and sturdy shoes, she did not look the ultimate career woman. Nor did Patience Gray, learning to cook in the billiard room bedsit of a Gothic house, and later living \"wild\" in Apulia, \"wizened and witchy-looking\", skinning foxes and harvesting weeds.</p><p>But this is part of Cooke's point. Careers are made from inventiveness, willpower and addiction. Her gardeners and food-writers were no dabbling hobbyists; 12-hour days were standard.</p><p>Some of these women knew from the age of about five exactly what they wanted to do. Their rehearsals for life are admirable and touching. The logistics of reading long past bedtime can be challenging enough, but the future Jacquetta Hawkes needed to practice being an archaeologist. She drew bison&nbsp;on the garden wall to set the prehistoric scene. And then she snuck out at night to conduct excavations in the lawn, labouring into the small hours with torch and trowel.</p><p>Success took time. Muriel Box trained as a typist, lived on sausage rolls from the ABC restaurant, and got a job at a corset factory in Welwyn. At least she was independent: it was a start. There is an affecting story about what Heilbron did when her mother was dying, young, of cancer. Rose was still in training and was yet to be called to the bar, but she went out and hired, illicitly, a wig and gown. She allowed her mother to see, just once, the figure her daughter was on course to become.</p><p>Once each woman is launched, personal and professional lives compete for space on the page. The practical questions matter: what time will she get home at night? Who mowed the lawn? How long is the baby&nbsp;in that Moses basket by the desk going to be asleep? There is usually an unsatisfactory marriage to escape, and Cooke tells some astounding stories of wild passions, secret pregnancies and deceived children.</p><p>These sensations are never quite allowed to steal the show, because the real drama here is in the work. It's true that from the outside hard graft can look a little dull. What Heilbron's university contemporaries remember is that \"she was always working in the library. I don't remember seeing her at any dances.\" This can be troublesome when you're trying to tell a pacey tale; textbooks are not spectacular. Cooke leaves the scholar to her own devices in the library, and catches up with her later when she's standing to give some nicely devastating after-dinner speech. Still, the compromise is understandable. Brief lives rely on abbreviation, and Cooke makes an art of it. This is a book in which people get MBEs for things they do in a sub-clause, and yet somehow we come to feel the long-haul nature of their efforts.</p><p>Resilience and stamina are much in&nbsp;evidence. \"They were as tough as boots,\" Cooke says approvingly of the&nbsp;Boxes: \"They ate setbacks for breakfast.\" But no one who's any good takes things so easily. Later we meet Muriel looking altogether less boot-like, coping with the \"low moods, painful joints, exhaustion, various infections and fevers\" that routinely accompanied the process of making a film. When her subjects do eventually make it to the top, Cooke watches carefully what they do with their success. Are they freer, or happier? Are they impossible with their friends? Betty Box ordered up a floor-length mink coat and adored it, though on set in India she preferred to wear a poncho with secret pockets in which she could hide contraband gin for the crew.</p><p>\"The bliss of work! The balm of it, and the satisfaction.\" Cooke is speaking partly on behalf of her 1950s subjects: this is what, at some point, they all felt. She is also speaking openly and passionately for herself. Yes, work is boring or nerve-racking or sleep-depriving, but the pleasure, too, should be acknowledged and fostered. In a brilliant passage, she reads Alison Smithson's designs for the&nbsp;interior of <a href=\"http://postwarbuildings.com/buildings/the-economist-buildings\" title=\"\">the Economist Buildings</a> as a tribute to the professional lives that would be lived there:</p><p>\"This was again Alison's realm, and&nbsp;included a filing system in the form of&nbsp;glorious Japanese-inspired lacquer boxes. Pillar-box red and silk smooth to the touch … A woman who&nbsp;understood more than most the&nbsp;power and comfort of work, she could have paid the Economist's harried secretaries and journalists no greater compliment than to imbue their daily rituals with beauty, and just&nbsp;a hint of the clandestine.\"</p><p>In a painfully slow job market, many&nbsp;graduates of 2013 will find themselves at temporary desks eating sausage rolls for lunch, trying secretly, stubbornly to keep their ambitions in view. They will think it is a rare privilege to know the \"balm\" of doing what you love, though they will surely agree it is worth aiming for. So let's talk&nbsp;about quotas, let's talk about pay, and let's follow Cooke's lead in remembering to talk about joy.</p><p>• Alexandra Harris's <a href=\"http://www.thamesandhudson.com/Virginia_Woolf/9780500290866\" title=\"\"><em>Virginia Woolf</em></a><em> is published by Thames and Hudson.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419928053|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|18f40ba8627bc4abd996522798c315f147d0982a -->",

        "headline":"The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt – review",
        "body":"<p>It is dangerous to write openings as compelling as Donna Tartt's. In <em>The Secret History</em>, the one-page prologue gives us a murder and a narrator who has helped to commit it. <em>The Little Friend</em> starts with the death of a child who, by page 15, is found hanging by a&nbsp;piece of rope from a tree branch, his red hair \"the only thing about him that&nbsp;was the right colour any more\". And now, in <em>The Goldfinch</em>, Tartt has a 50‑page two-part opening. In the first section, the narrator, Theo Decker, is&nbsp;holed up in an Amsterdam hotel, looking at newspapers written in Dutch, which he can't understand; he&nbsp;is searching for his name in articles illustrated with pictures of police cars and crime scene tapes. Before any of this is explained, the story moves back 14&nbsp;years to the day Theo's mother dies, when he is on the cusp of adolescence. Her death takes place in New York's Metropolitan Museum, as a consequence of an exploding bomb – mother and son are in separate rooms when the bomb blast occurs, and the descriptions of Theo regaining consciousness in the wreckage, and trying to find his way out of the ripped-apart museum before returning home, expecting to find his mother there, are&nbsp;written in astonishingly gripping prose. This is, of course, where the danger comes in: if, at the end of the kind of set piece to which the word \"climactic\" should emphatically apply, you still have 700 pages to go, aren't you setting your readers up for disappointment?</p><p>Astonishingly, the answer is no. The novel changes gear and, for a while, is primarily involved with showing us, affectingly, the dislocation of Theo's life – a dislocation both emotional and physical. His mother dead, his father long absent, he finds himself living with the Barbours, the family of a&nbsp;school friend; this is understood by everyone to be a short-term option, and the cold spectre of unknown and unloving grandparents who will eventually become Theo's guardians hovers over the novel for a time until his father reappears, with his girlfriend Xandra, and takes Theo off to live with him in Las Vegas. There will be more twists and turns in this tale of a&nbsp;motherless boy whose life involves dramatic changes and is peopled with a&nbsp;vast cast of characters, many of whose affections and intentions it isn't&nbsp;easy to work out. If there's any one novel this strand of the story calls to mind, it's<em> Great Expectations</em> – there's even a character called Pippa, perhaps a playful melding of Pip and Estella. Pippa, near Theo in age, was also in the&nbsp;museum when the bomb exploded, and is the only person who Theo feels can understand his heart.</p><p>But there is a second strand to the novel, this one with echoes of <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. Young Theo Decker enters a museum with his mother; he&nbsp;leaves with a painting. The painting – one that actually exists in the world – is <a href=\"http://www.wga.hu/html_m/f/fabritiu/carel/goldfinc.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Goldfinch</em> by Carel Fabritius</a>, a&nbsp;student of Rembrandt's, who died at&nbsp;the age of 32 when a gunpowder factory near his studio exploded. Almost all his work was destroyed; <em>The&nbsp;Goldfinch</em> is widely considered the finest of the paintings that survived. \"Anything we manage to save from history is a miracle,\" Theo's mother says to him, minutes before her death – an idea that runs deep in the veins of&nbsp;the novel. Picking up the painting from the debris and walking out of the museum with it isn't exactly theft, not if theft involves the conscious decision to steal. Theo is acting in a state of mental distress, on the instructions of&nbsp;a dying man who tells him to take the painting. This man, it so happens, is guardian to Pippa – at this point, she&nbsp;is&nbsp;nothing more to Theo than an arresting-looking girl, all too briefly glimpsed, though, later, their lives will collide and separate, repeatedly.</p><p>But once Theo reads in the newspaper that the painting is believed to have been destroyed in the explosion, he chooses to keep quiet about his possession of it – and from here on, he&nbsp;is culpable. As the years go on, both Theo's attachment to the painting (a&nbsp;thing of beauty, but also a physical connection to one of the last conversations he had with his mother) and his guilt over his continued possession of such a priceless work of art grows. So, too, does his fear of being imprisoned for stealing the object. It should come as no surprise, in a novel that opens with crime scene tapes and exploding museums, that the story of Theo and the painting is a story of betrayal, suspicion, double-dealing and shoot-outs. Raymond Chandler is no less a&nbsp;presence here than Dickens and Dostoyevsky. To say any more about the events of the novel would be to deprive a reader of the great joy of being swept up by the plot. If anyone has lost their love of storytelling, <em>The&nbsp;Goldfinch</em> should most certainly return it to them.</p><p>The novel isn't, of course, all action and suspense. Some of its most memorable moments occur in stillness. Take Theo's first experience of the desert skies of Las&nbsp;Vegas, after a life spent amid the light pollution of New York. Until now, he has only known the constellations as \"childhood patterns that had twinkled me to sleep from the glow-in‑the-dark planetarium stars on my bedroom ceiling back in New York. Now, transfigured – cold and glorious like deities with their disguises flung off – it was as if they'd flown through the roof and into the sky to assume their true, celestial homes.\" It is a&nbsp;glorious piece of prose, but placed within a novel about a boy who has lost his true home – which is, wherever his mother might be – it becomes heart-piercing, too. Tartt may already have displayed her great gift for plot in her debut, but the emotional register of <em>The Goldfinch</em> is of a different order from either of her previous works.</p><p>It would be wrong, however, to think that all the emotions are centred around loss. At the heart of the novel is&nbsp;an&nbsp;evocation of boyhood friendship – that of Theo and Boris, the&nbsp;Ukrainian outsider he meets on his first day of&nbsp;school in Las Vegas. Boris is an unforgettable creation – a thieving, drinking, drug-taking teenager who lights up each page he is on, even as he&nbsp;leads Theo into a world of excess. Their relationship works so well on the&nbsp;page in part because it has been prefigured by Theo's friendship, in New&nbsp;York, with a boy called Tom Cable – a friendship with a \"wild, manic quality, something unhinged and hectic and a little perilous about it\". Tartt doesn't present Theo as&nbsp;someone who comes unmoored from his own character by the death of his mother, but, more convincingly, as a&nbsp;boy whose&nbsp;flaws become more deeply inscribed in him as a consequence of&nbsp;loss. Then again, it&nbsp;is not entirely right to think of Theo's friendship with Boris&nbsp;as a flaw – the love between the boys is both simple and complicated, in the way of the best friendships. And&nbsp;when Boris re-enters Theo's life in adulthood it is impossible not to hope he is there as a friend, even while fearing the opposite.</p><p>Plot and character and fine prose can&nbsp;take you far – but a novel this good makes you want to go even further. The last few pages of the novel take all&nbsp;the serious, big, complicated ideas beneath the surface and hold them up to the light. Not for Tartt the kind of clever riffs, halfway between standup comedy and op-ed columns, which are too commonly found in contemporary fiction. Instead, when plot comes to an end, she leads us to&nbsp;a&nbsp;place just beyond it – a&nbsp;place of&nbsp;meaning, or, as she refers to it, \"a&nbsp;rainbow edge … where all art exists, and all magic. And … all love.\"</p><p>• Kamila Shamsie's most recent book is Burnt Shadows (Bloomsbury)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419620378|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|3998403d80d64e22844acfbd55ad7b518cf79105 -->",

        "body":"<p>The effect the modern western diet has had on our health and wellbeing has been a rumbling issue for decades; it has become more controversial recently thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/24/paleofantasy-evolution-sex-diet-review\" title=\"\">the influential evolutionary perspective on the subject</a>. When the organic food movement began, the premise was that traditional farming practices were the norm, from which we&nbsp;have departed by adopting intensive techniques to produce highly processed food. This could be dubbed the Prince Charles Line. But seen in the light of&nbsp;evolution, as Daniel Lieberman considers it, farming itself was the Great Unnatural Practice. At the extreme, the&nbsp;evolutionary perspective has given rise to the Paleo lifestyle, an attempt to return to the way we lived before the invention of farming 10,000 years ago: to live \"as evolution intended\".</p><p>Lieberman is far from endorsing such crass simplifications. Evolution, as he stresses, intends nothing. What&nbsp;actually evolves is due to many competing tendencies, and the result is&nbsp;always a work in progress with no destination. Notable figures including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-attenborough\" title=\"\">David Attenborough</a> and the geneticist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/stevejones\" title=\"\">Steve Jones</a> have remarked that human evolution has now ceased. Lieberman says this cannot be true: human beings continue to show a great degree of heritable variation, and reproductive success is also variable; so evolution of some kind must still be active. He goes further by regretting that for most of his career as a professor of human evolutionary biology he taught the old&nbsp;line that human biology has hardly changed since the Ice Age.</p><p>The question is: if human evolution is ongoing, what factors are influencing it now, as opposed to in the distant past? Genomic studies show that more&nbsp;than 100 genes indicate positive selection since farming began 10,000 years ago. Beyond the best-known example – the lactose tolerance gene, which has gone from almost zero to nearly 100% in northern Europe – most&nbsp;of them have not yet been characterised, but many almost certainly relate to the infectious diseases that accompanied hugely expanded human populations living hugger-mugger with domestic animals.</p><p>Lieberman is good at explaining why simplistic nostrums aren't appropriate for considering creatures such as human beings. We are not designed specifically to do one thing, but to be adaptable to many. Thus dark skin protects against UV radiation in equatorial regions but is gradually lost in northern climates probably because the weaker sunlight found there would generate inadequate levels of vitamin D in heavily pigmented skin. The body is&nbsp;designed to be good enough to do many things, but not to be especially good at any one of them. It doesn't have a large margin of error, unlike engineered structures such as bridges and aeroplanes, designed to withstand several times the stresses they will actually experience. Thus specialised animals out-compete us in speed, strength and visual or aural acuity, which was a problem when humans lived more or less in a state of nature.</p><p>Essentially, Lieberman's message is that modern life has created mismatches between our abilities and adaptations and the stresses we place on the body by often living thousands of miles from our family's origins, sitting down all day long rather than actively gaining a livelihood by physical work, and snatching at quick, high-energy foods.</p><p>The evolutionary approach produces some counterintuitive surprises. Fresh fruit juices are as much junk food as a cola drink – they produce a sugar rush, so it's better to eat fresh fruit with its additional fibre; chewing gum as a child is a healthy pastime, if the gum is sugar-free (teeth and jaws need the exercise that modern diets fail to provide). Without going the whole Paleo wild boar, Lieberman suggests we can learn something from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. He is a celebrated advocate of&nbsp;barefoot running, for example.</p><p>Since his book is all about trade-offs between incompatible attributes, it is only right to point out that, while his message is sound, it could have been made at half the length. In discussing the human plague&nbsp;of obesity he seems unable to resist the textual bloat that is equally a&nbsp;trait of our times. But given the vast outpouring in recent years of crank diets and earnest attempts to correct western lifestyle ills by some kind of Rousseauist regression, <em>The Story of the Human Body</em> is a reliable guide to a&nbsp;problem that is going to get worse before it gets better.</p><p><em>• </em>Peter Forbes is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780300178968\" title=\"\"><em>Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage</em></a><em>.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419929903|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|e17a00d81cda1fab7d61658f074af902067e10f7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Nazi Germany loved movies, and their leader was, as in so much else, fanatical about them. In his private cinema at the Reich Chancellery Hitler watched a movie every night, then gave his invited guests the benefit of his opinion on it. He loved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/28/laurel-hardy-slapstick\" title=\"\">Laurel and Hardy</a>, for instance, noting how their comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvxEytUO1pU\" title=\"\"><em>Block-Heads</em></a> contained \"a lot of very nice ideas and clever jokes\". Yet he regarded movies as something more than entertainment; he saw in their power to seduce and bewitch a&nbsp;vital instrument of persuasion. His propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, saw it, too. After watching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/28/it-happened-one-night-film-review\" title=\"\"><em>It Happened One Night</em></a>, he wrote in his diary: \"A funny, lively American film from which we can learn a lot. The Americans are so natural. Far superior to us.\"</p><p>If this eye-opening study of Hollywood and the Nazi elite is to be believed, that superiority was purely a technical one. <em>The Collaboration</em> unfolds a story that rather knocks the shine off the golden age of cinema. Ben Urwand argues that once Hitler ascended to power in 1933 the major Hollywood studios tacitly agreed not to portray Germany in an unfavourable light or to&nbsp;mention its persecution of the Jews. On occasion they went to extraordinary lengths to suppress any mention of the word \"Jew\" at all. Urwand has done some energetic digging in the archives, quoting letters, memos and newspaper reports to uncover a shameful policy of compromise and kowtowing on the part of the studio bosses. And what lends the story its peculiar irony is that those bosses who did their utmost to appease the crazed ideology of Nazism were by and large Jews themselves.</p><p>The story properly begins in December 1930 when the film of Erich Maria Remarque's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/nov/03/1\" title=\"\"><em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em></a> provoked rioting in a Berlin cinema. Remarque's anti-war message and its supposedly unpatriotic picture of German soldiery had outraged the Nazi faithful, who broke up the screening, threw stink bombs and released white mice into the crowd. Six days later the chief censor Ernst Seeger banned the film on&nbsp;the grounds that it harmed the national image. Universal Pictures, which had made the film, agreed to significant cuts in its release elsewhere. Two years later a&nbsp;law was passed regulating worldwide distribution of any film considered anti-German; Hollywood studios saw the writing on the wall – conform, or lose the profits emanating from the German market. Their decision does not seem to have been one they agonised over.</p><p>After 1933 the Nazis' editorial stranglehold was tightened by the appointment of their very own watchdog in Los Angeles. This was a&nbsp;former diplomat, Georg Gyssling. (I&nbsp;winced every time I read that name, tainting by its closeness the innocence of my favourite English novelist.) His job was&nbsp;to vet, and thence to veto, any film coming out of Hollywood that might be detrimental to \"German prestige\". One such was a script written by Herman J Mankiewicz (later to write <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76006/citizen.kane\" title=\"\"><em>Citizen Kane</em></a>) entitled <em>The Mad Dog of Europe</em>, a story explicitly about the destruction of a Jewish family in Hitler's Germany. Since the film was not attached to any studio, Gyssling applied to the Hays Office, whose Production Code seal was vital to a film's US distribution. Hays's LA censor, a sinister figure named Joseph Breen, composed this memo: \"Because of the large number of Jews active in the motion picture industry in this country, the charge is certain to be made that the Jews, as a class, are behind an anti-Hitler picture and using the entertainment screen for their own personal propaganda purposes. The entire industry, because of this, is likely to be&nbsp;indicted for the action of a&nbsp;mere handful.\" This warning, bizarrely argued, was nevertheless heeded: <em>The&nbsp;Mad Dog of Europe</em> was abandoned, and it marked a turning point in the collaboration. Studios henceforth would avoid Jewish subjects lest they provoked an anti-Jewish reaction in the US. A vested interest could now masquerade as a moral principle.</p><p>Urwand sharpens his indictment with remorseless intent, if not with any detectable sense of humour. The subject is a deeply serious one, of course – an entire industry is in the dock, with good reason – but the po-faced absurdity of the Nazis' ideological rationale would at times make a cat laugh. There is, for instance, something wildly comical in a regime that gives a pass to <em>King Kong</em> but bans <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan_the_Ape_Man_%281932_film%29\" title=\"\"><em>Tarzan the Ape Man</em></a> – \"a film … that tends to imply that a jungle man, virtually an ape, is capable of the noblest impulses of the soul and is a worthy marriage partner, certainly runs against the tendencies of National Socialism with regard to population politics\". And the ironies start to multiply when a film such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface_%281932_film%29\" title=\"\"><em>Scarface</em></a> was banned as a threat to civil order – a&nbsp;gangster picture outlawed by a&nbsp;gangster state. Urwand, who is a&nbsp;junior fellow at Harvard, remains rather beetle-browed.</p><p>A mixture of German expediency and American pusillanimity maintained the collaboration between 1933 and 1939. The Nazis, unwilling to have themselves cast as villains in the world's most popular form of entertainment, kept a watchful eye on the Hollywood production line. The studios, protective of their business interests, continued to trim their sails accordingly, aware that Gyssling and Breen were lurking in the shadows, ready to be offended. One of the most infamous episodes related here concerns the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Can%27t_Happen_Here\" title=\"\">Sinclair Lewis novel <em>It Can't Happen Here</em></a>, the tale of an ambitious senator who steals the 1936 presidential nomination to become \"the Chief\" – in other words, America's first dictator. MGM purchased the screen rights and hired a talented screenwriter, Sidney Howard, to adapt it. Breen, having read the script, snapped into action, writing a seven-page letter urging Louis B Mayer not to make the film, which he considered \"dangerous\" and&nbsp;\"inflammatory\". Mayer, enthused by the idea of Hollywood's first major anti-fascist picture, decided to push ahead anyway, and might have got his way had not the chair of the film committee of the Central Conference of American Rabbis got wind of the project. The latter wrote to Will Hays: \"The only wise method to pursue in these days of virulent antisemitism is to have no picture in which the Jewish Problem is ventilated.\" Hays got together with Mayer, and some days later MGM dropped <em>It Can't Happen Here</em>, on the grounds of \"casting difficulties\". A disgusted Sinclair Lewis rightly suspected otherwise: \"I&nbsp;wrote <em>It Can't Happen Here</em>, but I&nbsp;begin to think it certainly can.\"</p><p>Balancing this unsavoury roll call of appeasers and colluders, the story has a late-arriving hero: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hecht\" title=\"\">Ben Hecht</a>, Jewish screenwriter and activist, courageously strove to publicise the plight of Europe's Jews, helped to create the War Refugee Board, and delivered a savage verdict on his government's failure to intervene: \"The Roosevelt-Churchill attitude towards Jews will go down in history as part of [the Nazis'] extermination plan.\" But that's a different issue. This book's verdict on the studios has already caused conniptions among some US commentators. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/09/how-could-harvard-have-published-ben-urwands-the-collaboration.html\" title=\"\">New Yorker film critic David Denby has deplored Urwand's use of the term \"collaboration\"</a> as \"scholarly sensationalism\", and has taken Harvard University Press to task for publishing the book without proper \"fact-checking\". But some basic facts in Urwand's thesis look incontrovertible. The studio bosses could have stood up to the likes of Breen and Gyssling, but they didn't. They could have supported their own film-makers and helped alert movie-goers everywhere to a genocidal crime, but they didn't. They could have been <em>mensches</em>, but they acted like stooges.</p><p>• Anthony Quinn's novels include <em>The Streets</em> and <em>Half of the Human Race</em>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419924838|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|f5662cb397e778b3d306482e8bc5f0da839fe04d -->",

        "body":"<p><em>Subtle Bodies</em> is the third novel by the American author Norman Rush, whose book <em>Mating</em> won the National Book award in 1991. The story concerns the reunion in middle age of a group of male university friends whose leading light, Douglas, has continued to mesmerise them in adulthood to the extent that they have all failed to grow up. Douglas, however, has died, having accidentally driven his ride-on mower over the edge of a&nbsp;ravine on his vast country estate. The&nbsp;men gather from their separate corners of the Earth at the scene, where, with Douglas's widow and teenage son, they attempt to organise a&nbsp;memorial service and to unravel the enigma of their friend, whose Evelyn Waugh-ish demise has left them with numerous mysteries to solve.</p><p>What proceeds might be described as the wrong kind of masterclass, for <em>Subtle Bodies</em> is a&nbsp;novel whose assumptions are so thoroughly back to front that it offers an oddly lucid account of its own shortcomings. What sets out to be a&nbsp;semi-satirical commentary on the nature of male friendships becomes a&nbsp;lost narrative with nothing at its heart, as though the author had pursued the subject only to discover that it was empty. &quot;There is no permanent friendship between men, among men,&quot; one of the characters observes. &quot;Something goes wrong, somebody marries the wrong person, somebody advances too fast, somebody converts, somebody refuses good advice or bad advice, it&nbsp;didn't matter. It went up in a flash.&quot;</p><p>In trying to capture this impermanence, Rush creates a lot of uphill work for reader and writer alike. <em>Subtle Bodies</em> is like a&nbsp;house that has been built in the&nbsp;wrong place: he has situated his narrative so that it stands counter to the elements, where things are made unnecessarily difficult and nothing he&nbsp;needs is to hand. None of his characters is in their customary physical or emotional environment; the person whose habitat they occupy is no longer there; the source of group connection is out of date and irrelevant; and the relentless approach of the memorial service is both stressful and lacking in any dividend for the reader, who never met Douglas, nor ever will, and has to be reminded at frequent intervals of his importance.</p><p>The narrative allies itself with Ned, a&nbsp;charity worker and&nbsp;political activist, and the member of the&nbsp;group least certain of Douglas's friendship and esteem; and also, increasingly, with Ned's wife Nina, who has pursued Ned&nbsp;all the way to Douglas's estate so that they can make love at the time most propitious to conception. This is&nbsp;an unpromising beginning for any female character, but it is also too obviously an excuse to import someone into the&nbsp;novel who can redress its structural problems.</p><p>As well as exemplifying the nurturing female qualities the boys' club lacks, Nina has to fill in the missing acres of backstory; explain the novel's land<sup></sup>scape, themes and characters; represent a general scepticism in the matter of Douglas and his domination of his friends; and, increasingly, to act as a yardstick of normality while remaining witty, beautiful, clever and&nbsp;kind. The result is&nbsp;that the novel becomes helplessly dependent on her: &quot;There was something she understood,&quot; she ruminates, watching Ned sleep, &quot;which was why Ned had felt so&nbsp;urgently the need to fly east. It had to do with power. It had to do with the old days … his escape to NYU and meeting Douglas and being included in the power group of friends. That had been his great escape, as he saw it … it was like a fable where some grail or amulet has been mislaid and needed to be gotten back by a hero going into a&nbsp;labyrinth or dark gorge the hero had already passed through once … She had a better idea of&nbsp;what he was doing than he did.&quot;</p><p>Rush is so frank in his signalling of his own themes that for a while the novel's lack of emotional maturity and authority – and indeed its dependency – seem to have been designed to echo the stuntedness of its actors, ageing men in the grip of college-era preoccupations. Yet the same frankness makes him incapable of disguising the fact that the novel's game is up: he&nbsp;goes on with it doggedly, dispensing with the more detailed writing of the first half to get the job done. What Rush is committed to here is the idea that men are nothing without women, that their social vision is deluded, their morality without substance, their credulity infinite: it is woman who makes life, order, continuity. Whatever the value of this idea, the novel fails to consummate it: had he dispensed with the commentating, order-making female perspective, and abandoned himself and us entirely to the brusqueness and inadequacy of the male relationships, the result might have been a harsher novel, but a better one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419575817|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|bd69279ea440ee1c1ac6dc13ae1a62676d079fe4 -->",

        "body":"<p>Years ago I asked a section editor on the paper for which I then worked whether he was going to employ a&nbsp;particular journalist. \"No, I won't,\"&nbsp;he&nbsp;replied, \"because he is an incompetent, lazy, stupid, arrogant plagiariser, who can't even write. And&nbsp;I&nbsp;speak as a friend of his.\"</p><p>Which is rather the way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/aitken\" title=\"\">Jonathan Aitken</a> speaks of his friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>. Here is just a selection of the words he uses to describe her – either deploying his own judgment or&nbsp;that of&nbsp;people he quotes: phoney, bullying, obnoxious, hypocritical, deplorable, unpleasant, alienating, opportunistic, confrontational, monomaniacal, disloyal, dysfunctional, snarky, pedestrian, hesitant, insufferably rude, foolish, arrogant, grudge-bearing and an&nbsp;anachronistic bigot.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prior,_Baron_Prior\" title=\"\">Jim Prior</a> found her \"vindictive and nasty\"; others spoke of \"her tendency to fly off the handle too early, her capacity to get the wrong end of the stick and her reluctance to apologise\". She was \"the least collegiate politician I have ever met … this is because she has&nbsp;no friends\". Others accuse her of&nbsp;\"governessy hatred\", of being a \"stubborn Salome\" who \"liked to hog the limelight\". Tim Bell, her favourite adman, called her \"the old bat\", and <a href=\"http://commentisfree.theguardian.com/bernard_ingham/profile.html\" title=\"\">Bernard Ingham</a>, her loyal press secretary, said she was \"the most tactless woman I have ever met in my life\".</p><p>And Aitken speaks as a friend of hers. They got off to a bad start. He ended a three-year affair with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2013/apr/13/carol-thatcher-tribute-mother-video\" title=\"\">Carol Thatcher</a>, and her mother said bitterly: \"He made Carol cry.\" At a dinner party, shortly after she became Tory leader, he was asked about her Middle East policies, and said: \"She knows so little … she probably thinks Sinai is the plural of sinus.\" This reached <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/09/private-eye-adam-macqueen-review\" title=\"\">Private Eye</a>, and her factotum Airey Neave demanded Aitken make an apology in&nbsp;person, in the&nbsp;division lobby: \"She'll&nbsp;be wearing a&nbsp;green dress.\"</p><p>But he is, overall, a huge admirer. He&nbsp;believes she was sound and brave&nbsp;on most foreign affairs: the Falklands,&nbsp;the ending of the cold war, the liberation of Kuwait, and the euro (though he suggests that she rewrote history when declaring she was always against our membership of the ERM).</p><p>Her judgment was less reliable in domestic affairs. Aitken points out that she could not distinguish between the striking miners and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/arthur-scargill\" title=\"\">Arthur Scargill</a>, regarding them all as members of the enemy within. That contempt for the working-class people of the north and the Midlands brought a cost that the Conservative party is still paying. The&nbsp;poll tax: surely the product of a&nbsp;disordered mind? She began to treat the people closest to her with evident contempt, most of all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/geoffrey-howe\" title=\"\">Geoffrey Howe</a> who received a bollocking in cabinet that no schoolteacher would be allowed to administer today. When the&nbsp;\"stalking donkey\", <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jan/08/guardianobituaries.conservatives\" title=\"\">Anthony Meyer</a>, stood against her in 1989, she had a&nbsp;good campaign team in place, but the&nbsp;whips warned her that on top of the handful of votes Meyer got, there were all the abstentions, spoiled ballots and dozens of MPs who had to&nbsp;be arm-twisted into supporting her. The situation was therefore far more dangerous than it appeared. She brushed their fears aside as the hobgoblins of lesser minds, and a year later insouciantly cleared off to Paris for a ceremonial summit, which she could easily have skipped. But she loved mingling with world leaders, and&nbsp;telling them where they were wrong. Meanwhile, she left behind as her campaign manager Peter&nbsp;Morrison, a lazy alcoholic, who believed all the fake pledges of support and spent much of the campaign asleep, drunk or both.</p><p>By the time of her defenestration, she had become the world's most powerful bag lady, of the type who harangue you at bus stops, and who are&nbsp;best ignored, except that you can't ignore the prime minister. You could call her, as a female King Lear, \"a very foolish fond old woman\", except there was little fond about her – apart from some engaging nonsenses. Just before the Falklands war ended in her greatest victory – which she won by ignoring or assailing almost all her own cabinet and a&nbsp;very substantial chunk of the Tory party in parliament, plus the president of the United States and his&nbsp;most senior officials – she could be&nbsp;found cooking the food at a children's party for the families of&nbsp;Downing Street staff. Admirable in&nbsp;some ways;&nbsp;barking in others.</p><p>By the end, however, she had slipped her moorings. Even one of her most devoted supporters, the right-wing MP <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Budgen\" title=\"\">Nick Budgen</a> declared that she was \"off her rocker\". She retired (Aitken says her notorious \"I shall be a very good backseat driver\" remark was directed at George Bush rather than John Major) but devoted much of her life, like Ted Heath, to trashing her successor behind his back. We all need a hobby, and that was hers. (There's another good account of this in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/26/highereducation.politicalbooks3\" title=\"\">John Sergeant's book <em>Maggie</em></a>.)</p><p>The Fall of Thatcher could be staged, not least because hers was a very modern hubris. Having started out lacking in real confidence – her first cabinet was stuffed with grandees who opposed all that she stood for – she was brought down in the end by believing her own publicity. She adopted with wild enthusiasm the \"iron lady\" sobriquet coined by the USSR army newspaper, forgetting that everything in those Soviet rags was lies and propaganda. I recall a grandiloquent speech, after the fall, to American travel agents in Glasgow, who must have been puzzled to learn she had ended the cold war herself, with Ronald Reagan as Robin to her Batman. She could give solipsism a bad name.</p><p>The pleasure of Aitken's readable, even beguiling, book is in the anecdotes. He suspects that her breathtakingly arrogant attempt to&nbsp;stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/may/08/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Bernard Weatherill</a> from becoming&nbsp;Speaker – something she had absolutely no right to do – helped bring her down. He arranged that Howe's killer speech in 1990 would be heard when the chamber was full, and in complete silence, giving it maximum effect. She realised then that the end was near, but couldn't grasp even then her&nbsp;own contribution to the coming catastrophe, and chose to blame the cabinet instead – \"treachery with a&nbsp;smile on its face\".</p><p>Then there was the time she went to&nbsp;holiday on Islay: the host family's noisy offspring meant she was unable to sleep, so she went for a walk in a hooded coat. Mistaken by a security officer for a sinister intruder, she was pinned to the wet moorland by a slavering police dog. For some anti-Thatcherites, that story alone will be worth the price of the book.</p><p>One day we might reach a reasonable assessment of Thatcher, somewhere between the adulation and the loathing: she achieved a reasonable amount economically at home (while pitching us into the tooth-and-claw capitalism we suffer today), had some influence on the world stage, and in the last few years in power lost the plot. This book, by an alarmingly candid friend, will go a long way towards helping find&nbsp;that balance.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420022360|2013-10-18T10:23:07Z|17e466574fe28b09d0c71b47b1f9915614490369 -->",
