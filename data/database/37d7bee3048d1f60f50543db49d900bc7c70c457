        "headline":"What's the best way to kill a novelist's passion for writing? Success",
        "body":"<p>To an answering chorus of jealous tweets, Lionel Shriver has been writing about the <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115016/publishing-back-so-long-successful-authors-give-writing\" title=\"\">perils of becoming a successful novelist</a>.  As well as rehearsing the familiar plaint that you can't make any money from it these days, she lines up some fresh troubles that await the author whose books win acclaim and sales.</p><p>Once you've finished your festival appearances, she says, then you need to settle down to writing any number of unpaid features to keep your name in the limelight, as well as doing interviews with anybody who's mildly interested. Then there are the panels, the blurbs for other writers, those important questions about your \"lifestyle\" for feature fillers on the model of Private Eye's <a href=\"http://www.private-eye.co.uk/eyeplayer.php?media=34\" title=\"\">Me and My Spoon</a>. And don't forget to keep scattering crumbs of inspiration into your Twitter feed and reminding your Facebook fans that you love them.</p><p>All of which gets in the way of doing what you've dreamed of for so long: writing another novel. Shriver says she's \"grown perversely nostalgic for my previous commercial failure – when my focus was pure, and the books were still fun to write, even if nobody read them\".</p><p>And as that last quote hints, media and marketing distractions are not the only things to fear about becoming successful. First of all comes the enormous pressure that weighs upon your next book once the first one is bathed in golden limelight, and critics are describing you as bursting with \"promise\". No wonder Ralph Ellison, having written Invisible Man, which was almost immediately recognised as one of the great books of the 20th century, was <a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2013/03/ralph_ellison_reads_from_his_novel-in-progress_juneteenth.html\" title=\"\">effectively paralysed</a> for the rest of his career.</p><p>To his many curious and admiring readers, he explained that he was working on a second book that would improve on the first. For the remaining 40 years of his life he scratched away at a second novel following the career of a light-skinned child raised by a black preacher, who later \"passes\" as white and becomes a racist senator. Ellison wrote thousands of pages towards what was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/23/daily/052599ellison-book-review.html\" title=\"\">published, after his death and uncompleted, as Juneteenth</a>.</p><p>Another model of gilded failure is F Scott Fitzgerald. He had something of a thirst on him already, but the combination of enormous fame and pots of cash sprung by the success of This Side of Paradise when he was just 24 must have helped tip him into the alcoholism that eventually killed him.</p><p>Some writers get drunk on praise. It's always tempting to have a go at Martin Amis, but the chorus of acclaim that attended his early books, rising to a crescendo with the publication of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/may/15/martin-amis-money-tv-series\" title=\"\">Money</a>, seems to have led him to take himself a bit too seriously. He took on the fate of the planet, then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jan/20/times-arrow-martin-amis\" title=\"\">the Holocaust</a> – perhaps a bit much for a gifted comic novelist with a good turn of phrase. Similar folie de grandeur expanded Norman Mailer's books and inflated his ego, but didn't do much for his achievements in the wake of The Naked and the Dead.</p><p>A few writers are unlucky enough to be ruined by success even before they've published: Harold Brodkey, for instance, was widely touted as the next great American novelist well before he'd published a book. Not only did this mire him in anxiety and give him writers' block, but the long-gestated work was a disappointment that eclipsed the early excitement.</p><p>By way of sad but happy contrast, there are those writers whose work quietly marinated and matured in neglect. Could Kafka have developed such original vision in public sight? Could Bruno Schulz? Furthermore, a good number of the greats – Henry James, Herman Melville – got steadily better as their reputations and sales declined.</p><p>All of which provides some consolation for the many writers who haven't yet been published. Think of Samuel Beckett, who declared that his whole subject was failure, but he managed to reinvent both modernism and theatre while tucked away in obscurity. Not for nothing did his wife greet news of his <a href=\"http://www.samuel-beckett.com/nobel-prize-samuel-beckett-1969.php\" title=\"\">Nobel prize</a> as \"a catastrophe\".</p><p>\"Try Again. Fail Again. Fail Better\" is one of his great phrases, but could also be seen as an inspiring motto for the writing life. If you can fail from success, you can also be a very successful failure.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421639542|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|397706992554ef51a718496705467876abd073f4 -->",

Her original experimentation with form transcends the conventions of biography.</p><p>\"And they will be transfixed by her vivid portrayal of D'Annunzio – how this repellent egotist quickly gained literary celebrity and how, thereafter, his incendiary oratory and foolhardy bravery influenced Italy's involvement in World War I and the subsequent rise of Mussolini.</p><p>\"The book shows how fascism rose partly as a perversion of nationalism – a trend still sadly relevant in today's world.\"</p><p>Rees praised all six books on the shortlist this year. They were \"enlightening, absorbing and accessible\", he said and testified \"to the strength and variety of current non-fiction writing\".</p><p></p><p>The bookmakers' favourite for the UK's most prestigious non-fiction prize had been William Dalrymple's Return of a King: The Battle for Afghanistan, an account of the first Afghan war, which began in 1839 and ranks as one of the most catastrophic and incompetently led of any British military campaign.</p><p>The other books missing out were Under Another Sky, a journey around Roman Britain by Charlotte Higgins, the Guardian's chief arts writer; the first volume of Charles Moore's authorised biography of Margaret Thatcher; A Sting in the Tale, a study of bumble bees by Dave Goulson; and Empires of the Dead by David Crane, which tells the forgotten story behind the building of first world war cemeteries.</p><p></p><p>Hughes-Hallett was presented with her prize at a ceremony in London on Monday. She follows winners such as Antony Beevor's Stalingrad, which took the inaugural Samuel Johnson prize in 1999; and more recently Frank Dikotter's Mao's Great Famine in 2011 and last year Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory and the conquest of Everest by Wade Davis.</p><p>The prize was decided by a panel that also consisted of the classicist Mary Beard; the director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti; the historian Peter Hennessy and the non-fiction reviewer James McConnachie.</p><p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles bookshops, said of Hughes-Hallet's win: \"As well as being a much needed modern analysis of a dangerously charismatic figure, the book stands as an eloquent riposte to all those who talk of the death of serious biography: Hughes-Hallett ignores no aspect of his fulcral role in the rise of Italian fascism.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647948|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|602346ef50ae94ee10f45960a4b048f2f0aced6a -->",

I have to say as infuriatingly tricky as this book can be, it's almost always funny - it also helps that I have the audio book on hand for when I get confused and feel the need to read along.</p> <p><strong>The Sun Also Rises:</strong> Finished this, this week, very much enjoyed it. Not as much as A Farewell To Arms but still very intriguing. Although I don't much care for Bull Fighting.</p> <p><strong>The Magus:</strong> Recommended by a fellow Guardian commentator. It's excellent. Kindle informs me I'm only 25% of the way through.</p> <p><strong>Lolita:</strong> Again just really excellent, insidiously creepy and hilariously off hand.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28383833\">Chris James</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After she won the Nobel a couple of weeks ago, I'm reading Alice Munro's Dear Life. This is totally outside my normal reading genres but, oh, my, these stories are so involving. I wouldn't recommend it if you need cheering up, but I can say I didn't expect short stories could be made so incredibly memorable.

Bought it from a free bookshop (not a library, before you ask) in which books found on landfill sites are given new homes. However, I suppose there's a reason for them being on landfill sites in the first place.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28386698\">goodyorkshirelass</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Other calls on my time just now, but a selection of library, charity shop and \"bugger, can't resist, out comes the credit card\" novels are doing their best to draw me in.</p> <p>Salley Vickers, Penelope Lively, Rose Tremain, and Jane Gardam are currently jockeying for position.</p> <p>In view of my Alice Munro obsession, confession time, a selection of my first ever Chekhov stories lies in wait too.</p> <p>However, I've a feeling that Maggie O'Farrell's \"Instructions for a Heatwave\" might take the finishing line.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28427628\">IanCann</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like the Mycaneans finally toppling Troy's towers, this week I finally finished Umbrerlla by Will Self, a great long book, I love what he's done with the writing style, though it can be unnverving when the narrative switches in time and characters seemingly in mid sentence.</p> <p>Thus freed from the task, I've been reading Yellow Birds by Kevin Powers, which manages to pack a powerful affecting punch into its pages, deftly capturing the narrator's experiences both in war and back home.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you would like to share a photo of the book you are reading, rather than talking about it in the thread below, please do.

        "body":"<p>Finding the appropriate person to read an audiobook is clearly a tricky art. Given the excitement surrounding its paper publication, it was never going to be long before the audiobook version of Morrissey's Autobiography arrived. Fans will of course have been hoping for the unmistakeable astringent camp of the singer's own Mancunian tones – familiar from decades of indie hits and acid public comments on his rivals – to deliver his memoir himself.   Instead, the Liverpudlian actor David Morrissey, known for playing stern and leathery politicians and tough guys, will be reading an unabridged version. Is he the right man for the job?</p><p>He does share a surname with Morrissey, but not very obviously much else. (I presume this won't be prompting  a search for other namesake narrators? David \"Peep Show\" Mitchell reading David \"Cloud Atlas\" Mitchell? Dawn French tackling the grisly thrillers of Nicci French?…  I'm not convinced.)</p><p>Some pairings in the audiobook world have become modern classics – think of Stephen Fry melliflously voicing forth Harry Potter, so definitively one feels the books could not possibly have been read by anybody else. Timothy Dalton's melodic reading of the crime series by John Banville's alter ego Benjamin Black makes for a similarly fitting combination of voice and style. However, letting plummy-voiced Kate Winslet loose on Andy Stanton's raucous stories for children about that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/audio/2012/sep/07/listen-bad-man-mr-gum-kate-winslet\" title=\"\">absolute grimster Mr Gum</a> seems like a less fortuitous idea.</p><p>There are so many wonderful pairings.

Colin Firth has recorded a fine, atmospheric reading of Graham Greene's The End of the Affair, while Samuel L Jackson has great fun with Chester Himes's <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/audible/a-rage-in-harlem\" title=\"\">A Rage in Harlem</a>  (as well as with the pastiche children's bedtime story <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780857862655/go-the-fuck-to-sleep\" title=\"\">Go the Fuck to Sleep</a>).</p><p>Moving into the realm of the possible, I'd rather like to hear Patsy Kensit reading Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, and what about Danny Dyer to read Revenge, the latest by Martina Cole?</p><p>Who would you choose to read which book and why?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421633545|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|198d7aa05b50189677bfdb2b391b46054347553d -->",

        "body":"<p>Ninety-eight UK publishers went out of business during the past year, 42% more than the year before, figures which reflect an ongoing squeeze on publishers' profit margins driven by deep retail discounts and new digital business models.</p><p></p><p>They include Enid Blyton's publisher from the 1930s to the 1960s, <a href=\"http://www.enidblytonsociety.co.uk/book-groups.php?pick=publisher&amp;value=Evans+Brothers\" title=\"\">Evans Brothers</a>, and Panos London, a publisher of international health titles, which closed in April after 26 years.</p><p></p><p>The majority of the publisher insolvencies related to book businesses, but the figure, compiled by accountancy firm <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3a635258-4321-11e3-9d3c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2jgOCGwbo\" title=\"\">Wilkins Kennedy</a> from Companies House reports for the 12 months ending August 31 2013, also comprises publishers of newspapers, journals, periodicals and directories.</p><p></p><p>Wilkins Kennedy partner Anthony Cork pointed to a clutch of reasons why publishers' traditional business models were so fragile: discounting, the growth of the ebook market, digital piracy, the growth of the secondhand book market, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jun/17/net-book-agreement-publishing\" title=\"\">scrapping of the Net Book Agreement</a> in 1997.</p><p></p><p>\"The growth of the internet has accelerated a dynamic that started with the end of the Net Book Agreement,\" he said. \"The rise of Amazon and other discount sellers with massive buying power means the pressure on publishers' margins is now immense. While publishers might be able to sustain relatively small margins on a bestseller, it is much harder for niche publishers.\"</p><p></p><p>Niche academic and educational publishers are particularly vulnerable, because their model is being undermined by digital piracy and online secondhand book sales on sites such as Amazon Marketplace. Cork said: \"The arrival of Amazon has transformed the secondhand book trade from a fairly minor nuisance to a serious threat. Where once you had to trawl the secondhand bookshops if you wanted to get hold of a cheap hardback or academic book, you can now be fairly certain of getting hold of what you want at the click of a button, and the publisher will not make a penny.\"</p><p></p><p>Growth in sales of ebooks, whose average price is £3 or less, compared with £5.50 for a paperback, has also undermined publishers' margins. UK consumer ebook sales rose by 134% to £216m in 2012, while print sales fell by 1% to £2.9bn, meaning that consumer ebook sales now represent 7.4% of book publishers' total sales, according to the UK Publishers Association. <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/amazon-has-79-e-book-market-uk.html\" title=\"\">Amazon has 79% of the ebook market in the UK</a>, according to Ofcom.</p><p></p><p>In September, bestselling novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/13/amazon-yakkers-braggers-jonathan-franzen\" title=\"\">Jonathan Franzen issued a broadside</a> against  Amazon, criticising aggressive business tactics and what he sees as an attack on literary culture.</p><p></p><p>\"In my own little corner of the world, which is to say American fiction, Jeff Bezos of Amazon may not be the antichrist, but he surely looks like one of the four horsemen. Amazon wants a world in which books are either self-published or published by Amazon itself, with readers dependent on Amazon reviews in choosing books, and with authors responsible for their own promotion,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/13/jonathan-franzen-wrong-modern-world\" title=\"\">he wrote in Guardian Review</a>.</p><p></p><p>Among the UK publishers that have suffered cashflow problems during the past year was Reel Art Press, a publisher of glossy, pop culture photography books, including <a href=\"http://www.reelartpress.com/catalog/edition/52/audrey-hepburn-in-hats\" title=\"\">Audrey Hepburn in Hats</a>. However, it was able to sound a note of optimism. Publisher Alison Elan said that the company's financial woes were more to do with the vicissitudes of being a new small publisher than the vagaries of the publishing market in general. \"We launched in 2010 and have had ups and downs with cashflow, but we found a private equity buyer who liked what we were doing and thought that we could make an impact in the market. So we managed to get through the difficult times. We survived,\" she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421624668|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|4276da9d9f4eceec3443d4d18ccbe54b64386959 -->",

        "body":"<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339344772\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1900433074_gdn-nat-081105-ag-obama-speech-full-01-VFa-4x3.flv\"></source>\n      </video><p>This year sees a deluge of anniversaries of major American speeches. In August, the world marked the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech to the 1963 March on Washington. This month is the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's Gettysburg address, and the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination has provoked memories of his great speeches, including the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/22/greatspeeches\" title=\"\">1961 inaugural</a>. It's 80 years since President Roosevelt's first inaugural (\"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\") and 25 since Jesse Jackson's \"keep hope alive\" speech to the 1988 Democratic convention. And on 4 November it is five years since Barack Obama acknowledged his victory in the 2008 election with the mantra <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\" title=\"\">\"yes we can\"</a>.</p><p>These speeches were delivered at different lengths, on different occasions and under different circumstances. The Gettysburg address (all 272 words of it) followed a two-hour eulogy by Edward Everett, the president of Harvard, celebrating a key civil war victory. The King speech was delivered at a rally in support of civil rights. Roosevelt's inaugural was given in the depths of the depression, Kennedy's at the height of the cold war. Jackson had lost the democratic nomination, Obama had won the election.</p><p>There is, I want to argue, a crucial difference between the content and therefore the rhetorical method of Obama's speeches and the rest. Nonetheless, they share much more than divides them: in style, reference, technique, subject and inspiration. In his definitive <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/wills-lincoln.html\" title=\"\">study of Lincoln at Gettysburg</a>, the American scholar <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/wills-garry/\" title=\"\">Garry Wills</a> points out that the address not only followed Everett's sprawling oration, but supplanted it with a new, plain style of delivery that was to dominate American public speaking from then till now. \"All modern political prose,\" Wills argues, \"descends from the Gettysburg address.\"</p><p>No wonder, then, how many of these speeches start with reference to anniversaries and go on to refer to each other. The opening of Gettysburg harks back to American independence (\"four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation\"), the \"I have a dream\" speech to Lincoln's emancipation proclamation. Both Kennedy and Obama quoted Lincoln; accepting his party's nomination in 2008, Obama quoted and cited King. Unsurprisingly, there are myriad references to and quotations from the Bible. Although there is an important difference between how and why they use them, all of these speechmakers draw on the same repertoire of rhetorical devices.</p><p>As Wills argues, Lincoln uses repetition of words as \"a kind of hook-and-eye method for joining the parts of his address\": there's hardly a sentence that doesn't repeat a word in the preceding one, from \"nation\" and \"conceived\" to \"consecrated\" and \"dead\". Lincoln hands on one particular form of repetition, the anaphora (a word or phrase repeated in the same place in successive phrases or sentences), from Kennedy's \"let both sides …\" to Obama's \"it's the answer … \". All of them use contrasts, from Lincoln's \"the world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here,\" to King's \"we cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote\". In Kennedy's case, contrast takes the particular form of the chiasmus, in which one phrase is echoed in the opposite direction (\"Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate\"); a figure taken up by Jackson (\"I was born in the slum, but the slum was not born in me\"). Most follow the rule of three, from Lincoln's \"in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate – we cannot consecrate – we cannot hallow this ground\" to Obama's \"America, we can come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do.\"</p><p>Of course, these devices are by no means exclusively American. As Max Atkinson makes clear in his analysis of speechmaking, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/healthmindandbody/9780091894795/lend-me-your-ears-all-you-need-to-know-about-making-speeches-and-presentations\" title=\"\"><em>Lend Me Your Ears</em></a>, contrast and tripling appear in speech after speech, time after time. In his wartime broadcasts, Churchill used anaphora (\"we will fight them\" on the beaches, landing-grounds, fields, streets and hills), contrast (so much \"owed by so many to so few\") and chiasmus (not \"the beginning of the end\" but perhaps \"the end of the beginning\"). But it's the sheer quantity of these devices that gives American rhetoric its peculiar rhythmic power, its musicality, and – often – its meaning.</p><p>So Lincoln's repetitions are not just a baton passed from sentence to sentence, but a drumbeat (the word \"dedicate\" appears in every sentence but one). Kennedy uses chiasmus like a hammer (\"ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country\"). Obama's 2012 victory speech had four anaphora (as did Jesse Jackson's speech in 1988), and King's no less than seven (apart from \"I have a dream\" itself, \"one hundred years later …\", \"we refuse to believe …\", \"now is the time …\", \"we can never be satisfied …\", \"with this faith …\" and \"let freedom ring\").</p><p>But if all of these orators cram their rhetorical devices together to an unprecedented degree, they are differently distributed. Atkinson calculates that, in his inaugural, Kennedy employs contrast every 39 seconds, but uses hardly any triples. King's written text contains 18 contrasts, from \"a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity\" to \"transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood\". Obama, on the other hand, favours triples (there were 13 in the speech that launched him to national prominence at the 2004 Democratic convention, and 20 in the \"yes we can\" speech).</p><p>The difference between King and Obama's favoured figure is much more than a matter of taste, technique or style. Contrasts and triples express different views of the world. Contrasts reveal binaries and present choices, multiples accrete evidence for a single case. Which you choose betrays not just your subject but your attitude.</p><p>So Kennedy's contrast-laden speech was (predominantly) about what he saw as the conflict between freedom and tyranny. The first section of Roosevelt's inaugural is about how the rich let down the American masses, and most of the paragraphs consist of two contrasting sentences. At the end, Roosevelt offers a prospect of national unity, and the paragraphs expand to a lilting three. And while Lincoln, King, Jackson and Obama all address the division between free states and slave states, north and south, blue and red America, King sees that contest in terms of unresolved binaries, Obama as a barrier that can be overcome.</p><p>Obama is a master of the personal anecdote and the telling example (neither of which feature in Lincoln, Kennedy or King's speeches at all). In this he follows Jackson, whose 1988 speech includes an evocative list of the sort of Americans who lost out in the 80s: redundant workers, farmers losing land to bad loans, students who can't afford college. Obama picks this device up again and again. In his 2004 critique of Bush's America, he cites children who can't read, seniors who can't pay for prescriptions, Arab-Americans rounded up without due process. In 2012 he accentuates the positive: an immigrant's daughter pledging allegiance to the flag, a Chicago youth seeing a life \"beyond the nearest street corner\", the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or an engineer. When Obama challenges the division between red states and blue states, he lists examples of attitudes and phenomena – religious belief, hostility to censorship, gay communities – that are supposedly restricted to one or other but are actually present in both.</p><p>The fact that Martin Luther King is held to have taken a similarly conciliatory view is due to the most famous section of his 1963 speech, which King decided to substitute for the written ending as he spoke. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/sep/27/gary-younge-on-martin-luther-king-exclusive-book-extract-from-the-speech\" title=\"\">Gary Younge relates in his book <em>The Speech</em></a>, King's aides advised him against repeating the \"I have a dream\" mantra (which he'd delivered at least twice before) on the grounds that it was cliched and trite. Certainly, as black militancy deepened in the years that followed, the last section of the speech was seen as weak and sentimental. If it's true that contrasts are about conflict and multiples tend to the conciliatory, King's ending would be a wonderful example: following his seven dreams, King calls for freedom to ring from five northern and western states and three in the south.</p><p>Taken on their own, as a couple of soundbites, these tropes support the argument that King's speech was merely a call for peace, love and harmony. But in the context of the speech as a whole, with its insistent repetition of contrasts between the world as it should be and the world as it was, the end seems less a flight of fancy about the future than a critique of now. In the context of the failure of America to deliver on the emancipation proclamation, the extent of discrimination, violence and poverty, and the urgent need for what King called a \"whirlwind of revolt\", King's dream for his children to be judged \"not by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character\" is all about students and voters in the south being judged entirely by the colour of their skin. And when King demands that freedom ring from \"the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire\" and \"the curvaceous slopes of California\", he does so not to celebrate these admirable places but to contrast them with Stone Mountain of Georgia, Lookout Mountain of Tennessee and \"every hill and molehill of Mississippi\". The soaring multiples are organised by the binary contrast between one kind of country and another, the same binary which Lincoln posited 100 years earlier at Gettysburg.</p><p>As Younge argues, both King's speech and Obama's victory have been celebrated for asserting that, now, African-Americans are indeed judged by the content of their character, and can succeed on their own. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/07/barack-obama-speech-full-text\" title=\"\">On election night last year</a>, Obama asserted that \"whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight\", you can \"make it here in America if you're willing to try\". But after citing a comparable list – \"black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics\" – King looked forward to something different: a day when \"all of God's children\" would be able to sing \"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty, we're free at last\", not as individuals but as a people.</p><p>In finishing with a triple repeat and an extended last phrase, King anticipated Jackson (\"Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive. On tomorrow night and beyond, keep hope alive\") and echoed Lincoln (\"that government of the people, by the people and for the people, shall not perish from the earth\"). Fifty years on, would he feel that any of those ambitions has been fully achieved?</p><p>• Gary Younge's <em>The Speech</em> is published by Guardian Books</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421611337|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|a3b1a2efd96443ff5b20cdba3b11bc57f287527a -->",

        "headline":"Poem of the week: Cartography for Beginners by Emily Hasler",
        "body":"<p>I discovered this week's poem – and poet – in issue  76 of Michael Mackmin's influential Norwich-based poetry journal, <a href=\"http://www.therialto.co.uk/pages/\" title=\"\">The Rialto</a> . It was the tone of <a href=\"http://saltmodernvoices.wordpress.com/who-are-the-salt-modern-voices/emily-hasler-natural-histories/\" title=\"\">Emily Hasler</a>'s  \"Cartography for Beginners\" that particularly attracted me: colloquial, playful, assured. The playfulness and assurance extend to the way the poem remodels and subverts what a cartographer might call its \"ground-truth\" – a lesson on how to draw a map.</p><p></p><p>That the speaker is only pretending to issue a set of useful instructions, meanwhile creating her own myth of map-making, quickly becomes clear in the ordering of priorities, beginning with that emphasis on \"the correct blue\".  When, in lines two and three, the speaker advises that the shade of blue should not be \"too watery\" because \"people do not like wet feet\", the map and the place mapped are suddenly fused, and we might even suspect the tutee is in on the joke. A mock-didactic poem needs two people to play the game.</p><p></p><p>Blue could be associated with feelings too, of course, and perhaps an openness to feeling. Beyond its aesthetic potential, water constantly draws the speaker's attention. It becomes so significant that, even if there's no actual water to be indicated, she insists that the choice of blue still has to be made. Later, she will go farther and say that, if the area has no water, \"I have to question why you are bothering\". The most powerful image or symbol in the poem, water connects, through baptism, to the church (listed in the places of worship) and, of course, to the pub. Finally, the poem considers the possibility of a completely submerged East Anglia.  Its resemblance to \"a sodden Constable\" suggests that the place is not so much a place as a picture of a place – the converse idea of a map which causes wet feet.</p><p></p><p>Elements from both art and science, the disciplines <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography\" title=\"\">the making of maps traditionally employs</a>  are allowed to unsettle one another. That unsettling is inherent in many kinds of mapping, of course. Perhaps the key reference is to \"the twin and warring gods of Precision/ and Wild Abandon\". In mentioning <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox\" title=\"\">the coastline paradox</a>  the poem reveals an awareness of the difficulty of exactly conveying complex spatial information on paper.</p><p></p><p>Precision, symbolised by Mandelbrot's investigation, is burdensome, but cannot be jettisoned (\"get a stepladder\"). \"Wild Abandon\" is hinted in \"licence\" (line 13) and, more resolutely projected at the end, when the speaker seems to be persuading the addressee towards a real, physical encounter and an implied sexual landscape. Tensions exist in the antipathy of wet and dry,  public and private. The map is interpreted as an act of communication with \"people\", an intimate space between friends or lovers, and a delightful playground for the solitary imagination.</p><p></p><p>Formally, there's a resistance to end-stopping. The many enjambed lines create their own variable coastline – the line-endings – and flow gracefully over the edge. There is a civility in the poem that recalls Elizabeth Bishop's finely controlled, often ruefully humorous, navigating potentially dangerous emotional waves.</p><p></p><p>\"People do not like/ to be lost\", the speaker remarks in lines 10/11, but, of course, some discoveries can be made only when one is lost. This poem disorientates us, but in a gentle and fruitful way. While we're not allowed to find out, metaphorically, exactly where we are, some East Anglian locations towards the end are reassuring. And they allow an affectionate poem of place to emerge from an intimate address to a particular individual.</p><p></p><p>Originally from <a href=\"http://www.felixstowe.gov.uk/Core/FelixstoweTC/Pages/Town_History_1.aspx\" title=\"\">Felixstowe</a> in Suffolk, Hasler has published work in various magazines and anthologies, and her first pamphlet natural histories appeared from Salt in their \"modern voices\" series, <a href=\"http://www.saltpublishing.com/shop/proddetail.php?prod=9781844718672\" title=\"\">and is still available</a>. \"Cartography for Beginners\" is from an unpublished sequence of four poems, \"The Map Lover\". I look forward to seeing this, and more of Hasler's work, in a first full-length collection.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cartography for Beginners</strong><br /><em>for CL</em></p><p>First of all, you will need to choose the correct blue<br />to indicate water. This should not be too watery.<br />You must remember: people do not like wet feet.<br />If there is no water to indicate, no matter,<br />you must still elect a blue. Let me recommend<br />eggshell, at a push, azure. Choose a symbol<br />for church/temple/mosque/synagogue. Choose<br />a symbol for pub. Dedicate your life<br />to the twin and warring gods of Precision<br />and Wild Abandon. People do not like<br />to be lost. Buy Mandelbrot's 1967 paper<br />on the coastline paradox, put it on the highest shelf –<br />but get a stepladder. Take a little licence with rivers, <br />especially their curves and estuaries. Add<br />an oxbow lake if at all possible. If the area you<br />are mapping has no seas/lakes/rivers/streams,<br />I have to question why you are bothering. You<br />won't get to use that lovely blue you spent so long<br />deciding upon. Do the Norfolk fens instead. Better<br />yet, East Anglia in its future state, quite utterly<br />submerged like a sodden Constable. Come on,<br />get your coat, I'll show you. You won't need your shoes.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421604636|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|f8906537efcca0aacefbb103928b94c5138edb4e -->",

        "headline":"American Smoke: Journeys to&nbsp;the End of the Light by Iain Sinclair – review",
        "body":"<p>These days, every writer gets tagged. Their agonistically incubated works are synopsised, shrivelled. Reduced to keywords, indexical units, journalistic shorthand. Ever since the success of his essay collection <em>Lights Out for the Territory</em> (1997), that's what's been happening to Iain Sinclair. Walking, psychogeography, east London: it's easy enough to short-change the voluminous output of this ex-labourer, park gardener and publisher of unhinged experimental poetry by invoking these handles.</p><p>It's easy, too, to peg him as a postcode miniaturist, an obsessive localist deep-diving into the remotest substrata of Hackney history, the raving naysayer – one step removed from a Speakers' Corner demagogue or a sandwich-board-sporting apocalypse monger – forever raining down curses on those responsible for the Dome, the Olympics, all modern London's grandiose projects.</p><p>Such characterisations, even when they're meant as praise– for many readers, Sinclair is the key of England's hidden reverse, King of the Gypsies, pathfinder to all the heretics, outsiders and fringe-dwellers locked out of Albion's literary establishment – mask as much as they reveal. Just like that of Derek Jarman, another writer/film-maker/landscape artist latterly celebrated as a grand old Anglo dissenter but who as a young man had been transformed by his encounters with the work of American avant-gardists such as Stan Brakhage and Kenneth Anger, Sinclair's imaginative pantheon has always been mostly transatlantic: the mythographers and megalith poets of Black Mountain College; the speed merchants of the Beat movement.</p><p><em>American Smoke</em> documents his temporary exile from the English capital. Early on he announces: \"I needed a new mythology to shield against the sense of loss and hanging dread inherent in the invasion and dissolution of my familiar London ground.\" But where his previous mad travellings were symbolic exorcisms of creeping urban homogenisation – walking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/25/featuresreviews.guardianreview27\" title=\"\">anticlockwise around the M25</a>, pedalling a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/18/swandown-iain-sinclair-andrew-kotting\" title=\"\">plastic swan from Hastings to the Lower Lea Valley</a> in the company of film-maker Andrew Kötting – this time round he's created a collage journey to and through the sources of his sorcery. It's an odyssey, he claims, \"to places where I would be a stranger, without language or back story\". That's not entirely true: these are the landscapes of his imagination; opportunities to reacquaint himself with old times, the bookish passions he developed as a 20-year-old student in Dublin.</p><p>Here he is in Gloucester, Massachusetts, marinating in the topographies and residual echoes of Charles Olson (1910-70), the poet who treated modernism as a state of being rather than an academic subject; who declared: \"I take SPACE to be the central fact to man born in America\"; who showed Sinclair that writing with and out of passion needn't involve aligning himself with the Angry Young Men, a literary identity that, he believes, was \"nothing more than a media-friendly staging post on the way to peevish rural retirement, bottles on the porch, second wives in red fur nursing black eyes\".</p><p>Here he is in recalling a meeting in New York with Gregory Corso, imprisoned and sent to a mental hospital while still a teenager, on-off heroin addict, \"the Joe Pesci of the Beat generation\". Corso first saw his friend Allen Ginsberg in a room across a West Village street – having sex with the woman over whose memory he masturbated when he was behind bars. Years later, Corso would throw writer Kathy Acker out of a car and into a Black Panther-controlled part of working-class Oakland when she refused to take part in a threesome.</p><p>Other figures recalled or reckoned with: Malcolm Lowry, Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, Gary Snyder, Roberto Bolaño. And Pavel Coen, a BBC radio producer maniacal about American refuseniks, who mysteriously disappears only to resurface (possibly) much later in a department store in Croydon. These characters, and the amanuenses, editors and book dealers around them, are evoked in the language of volcanology, seismology, geothermal science. Sinclair's is a prolix poetics, an amassing of noun-hives whose compacted wit would make the most lexically dexterous rapper envious: he describes a gathering of renowned poets performing together at Queen Elizabeth Hall as \"world-class bedwetters, private patients in sabbatical asylums, tolerated gropers from midwestern campuses, debonair dudes from Mexican embassies\".</p><p>Olson's poetry, according to Jeremy Prynne, was \"immeasurably dense and confused and packed with a kind of fertile obscurity\". That's also true of Sinclair: his writing can be an imagistic seance-stream full of startling riffs, memory sifts, domino-effect associationism. This can be mystifying, but it's important to ride the rapids and to go with the torrential flow; it's precisely his excesses and his refusal to prostrate himself before \"the average reader\" that prevent his books from being assimilated into the gated and unlovable compound of \"literary fiction\". By the end of <em>American Smoke</em>, cartography has become clouded. Disparate locations (from Hastings in England to Seattle) meld. The bibliographic and the geological conjoin. Rabbit hole, ghost continent, lucid delirium: the US wafts away, as grippingly haunted as Sinclair's prose.</p><p><em>To buy American Smoke for £14.99 with free UK p&amp;p call 0330 333 6847 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421225330|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|dd275397fae4cdc0f6596d4d8f1560f6a4152a28 -->",

        "body":"<p>Maggot Moon – just another lone-teen-challenges-dystopian-regime book, right? That's what I expected when I first picked up Sally Gardner's award-winning novel, and I have never been more wrong. Maggot Moon is an extraordinarily beautiful, original and heart-rending story that breaks all the conventions of children's fiction.</p><p>The story is told by the teenage Standish who, like Gardner herself, is dyslexic. In the repressive Motherland, a surreal blend of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, this is regarded as an impurity and it is only thanks to his friend Hector that Standish escapes the vicious bullying of his teachers and classmates. </p><p>Standish has no illusions about the horrors of the world he lives in, and instead creates a world in his head, where he and Hector ride around in a sky-blue Cadillac and drink 'croca-colas'. His account is perceptive, cynical, and incredibly moving, and the contrast between the light and colour of his imagination and the sickening reality of life in the Motherland is heart-breaking.</p><p>What really distinguishes Maggot Moon though, is Gardner's beautifully inventive language. The whole story is distilled to its very essence, with not a word wasted. Thought-provoking, emotional and exquisitely written - what more could you ask for?</p><p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421193440|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|1835628d4c317f2cf9835006d5f6745a4f0557c4 -->",

        "body":"<p>A biography of a \"repellent egotist\", the Italian poet turned fascist politician Gabriele D'Annunzio,late Monday won the £20,000 Samuel Johnson prize for non-fiction.</p><p>The Pike, by Lucy Hughes-Hallett, is an account of how the charismatic D'Annunzio transformed himself into a national hero and helped lay the foundations for the rise of Mussolini.</p><p>Judges praised her biography but acknowledged what an odious subject D'Annunzio was.</p><p>The chair of judges, the Astronomer Royal Martin Rees, said: \"Readers of The Pike will surely admire Lucy Hughes-Hallett's writing and her intricate crafting of the narrative. Her original experimentation with form transcends the conventions of biography.</p><p>\"And they will be transfixed by her vivid portrayal of D'Annunzio – how this repellent egotist quickly gained literary celebrity and how, thereafter, his incendiary oratory and foolhardy bravery influenced Italy's involvement in World War I and the subsequent rise of Mussolini.</p><p>\"The book shows how fascism rose partly as a perversion of nationalism – a trend still sadly relevant in today's world.\"</p><p>Rees praised all six books on the shortlist this year. They were \"enlightening, absorbing and accessible\", he said and testified \"to the strength and variety of current non-fiction writing\".</p><p></p><p>The bookmakers' favourite for the UK's most prestigious non-fiction prize had been William Dalrymple's Return of a King: The Battle for Afghanistan, an account of the first Afghan war, which began in 1839 and ranks as one of the most catastrophic and incompetently led of any British military campaign.</p><p>The other books missing out were Under Another Sky, a journey around Roman Britain by Charlotte Higgins, the Guardian's chief arts writer; the first volume of Charles Moore's authorised biography of Margaret Thatcher; A Sting in the Tale, a study of bumble bees by Dave Goulson; and Empires of the Dead by David Crane, which tells the forgotten story behind the building of first world war cemeteries.</p><p></p><p>Hughes-Hallett was presented with her prize at a ceremony in London on Monday. She follows winners such as Antony Beevor's Stalingrad, which took the inaugural Samuel Johnson prize in 1999; and more recently Frank Dikotter's Mao's Great Famine in 2011 and last year Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory and the conquest of Everest by Wade Davis.</p><p>The prize was decided by a panel that also consisted of the classicist Mary Beard; the director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti; the historian Peter Hennessy and the non-fiction reviewer James McConnachie.</p><p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles bookshops, said of Hughes-Hallet's win: \"As well as being a much needed modern analysis of a dangerously charismatic figure, the book stands as an eloquent riposte to all those who talk of the death of serious biography: Hughes-Hallett ignores no aspect of his fulcral role in the rise of Italian fascism.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647948|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|602346ef50ae94ee10f45960a4b048f2f0aced6a -->",

        "headline":"What's the best way to kill a novelist's passion for writing? Success",
        "body":"<p>To an answering chorus of jealous tweets, Lionel Shriver has been writing about the <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115016/publishing-back-so-long-successful-authors-give-writing\" title=\"\">perils of becoming a successful novelist</a>.  As well as rehearsing the familiar plaint that you can't make any money from it these days, she lines up some fresh troubles that await the author whose books win acclaim and sales.</p><p>Once you've finished your festival appearances, she says, then you need to settle down to writing any number of unpaid features to keep your name in the limelight, as well as doing interviews with anybody who's mildly interested. Then there are the panels, the blurbs for other writers, those important questions about your \"lifestyle\" for feature fillers on the model of Private Eye's <a href=\"http://www.private-eye.co.uk/eyeplayer.php?media=34\" title=\"\">Me and My Spoon</a>. And don't forget to keep scattering crumbs of inspiration into your Twitter feed and reminding your Facebook fans that you love them.</p><p>All of which gets in the way of doing what you've dreamed of for so long: writing another novel. Shriver says she's \"grown perversely nostalgic for my previous commercial failure – when my focus was pure, and the books were still fun to write, even if nobody read them\".</p><p>And as that last quote hints, media and marketing distractions are not the only things to fear about becoming successful. First of all comes the enormous pressure that weighs upon your next book once the first one is bathed in golden limelight, and critics are describing you as bursting with \"promise\". No wonder Ralph Ellison, having written Invisible Man, which was almost immediately recognised as one of the great books of the 20th century, was <a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2013/03/ralph_ellison_reads_from_his_novel-in-progress_juneteenth.html\" title=\"\">effectively paralysed</a> for the rest of his career.</p><p>To his many curious and admiring readers, he explained that he was working on a second book that would improve on the first. For the remaining 40 years of his life he scratched away at a second novel following the career of a light-skinned child raised by a black preacher, who later \"passes\" as white and becomes a racist senator. Ellison wrote thousands of pages towards what was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/23/daily/052599ellison-book-review.html\" title=\"\">published, after his death and uncompleted, as Juneteenth</a>.</p><p>Another model of gilded failure is F Scott Fitzgerald. He had something of a thirst on him already, but the combination of enormous fame and pots of cash sprung by the success of This Side of Paradise when he was just 24 must have helped tip him into the alcoholism that eventually killed him.</p><p>Some writers get drunk on praise. It's always tempting to have a go at Martin Amis, but the chorus of acclaim that attended his early books, rising to a crescendo with the publication of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/may/15/martin-amis-money-tv-series\" title=\"\">Money</a>, seems to have led him to take himself a bit too seriously. He took on the fate of the planet, then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jan/20/times-arrow-martin-amis\" title=\"\">the Holocaust</a> – perhaps a bit much for a gifted comic novelist with a good turn of phrase. Similar folie de grandeur expanded Norman Mailer's books and inflated his ego, but didn't do much for his achievements in the wake of The Naked and the Dead.</p><p>A few writers are unlucky enough to be ruined by success even before they've published: Harold Brodkey, for instance, was widely touted as the next great American novelist well before he'd published a book. Not only did this mire him in anxiety and give him writers' block, but the long-gestated work was a disappointment that eclipsed the early excitement.</p><p>By way of sad but happy contrast, there are those writers whose work quietly marinated and matured in neglect. Could Kafka have developed such original vision in public sight? Could Bruno Schulz? Furthermore, a good number of the greats – Henry James, Herman Melville – got steadily better as their reputations and sales declined.</p><p>All of which provides some consolation for the many writers who haven't yet been published. Think of Samuel Beckett, who declared that his whole subject was failure, but he managed to reinvent both modernism and theatre while tucked away in obscurity. Not for nothing did his wife greet news of his <a href=\"http://www.samuel-beckett.com/nobel-prize-samuel-beckett-1969.php\" title=\"\">Nobel prize</a> as \"a catastrophe\".</p><p>\"Try Again. Fail Again. Fail Better\" is one of his great phrases, but could also be seen as an inspiring motto for the writing life. If you can fail from success, you can also be a very successful failure.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421639542|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|397706992554ef51a718496705467876abd073f4 -->",

In August, the world marked the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech to the 1963 March on Washington. This month is the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's Gettysburg address, and the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination has provoked memories of his great speeches, including the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/22/greatspeeches\" title=\"\">1961 inaugural</a>. It's 80 years since President Roosevelt's first inaugural (\"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\") and 25 since Jesse Jackson's \"keep hope alive\" speech to the 1988 Democratic convention. And on 4 November it is five years since Barack Obama acknowledged his victory in the 2008 election with the mantra <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\" title=\"\">\"yes we can\"</a>.</p><p>These speeches were delivered at different lengths, on different occasions and under different circumstances. The Gettysburg address (all 272 words of it) followed a two-hour eulogy by Edward Everett, the president of Harvard, celebrating a key civil war victory. The King speech was delivered at a rally in support of civil rights. Roosevelt's inaugural was given in the depths of the depression, Kennedy's at the height of the cold war. Jackson had lost the democratic nomination, Obama had won the election.</p><p>There is, I want to argue, a crucial difference between the content and therefore the rhetorical method of Obama's speeches and the rest. Nonetheless, they share much more than divides them: in style, reference, technique, subject and inspiration. In his definitive <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/wills-lincoln.html\" title=\"\">study of Lincoln at Gettysburg</a>, the American scholar <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/wills-garry/\" title=\"\">Garry Wills</a> points out that the address not only followed Everett's sprawling oration, but supplanted it with a new, plain style of delivery that was to dominate American public speaking from then till now. \"All modern political prose,\" Wills argues, \"descends from the Gettysburg address.\"</p><p>No wonder, then, how many of these speeches start with reference to anniversaries and go on to refer to each other. The opening of Gettysburg harks back to American independence (\"four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation\"), the \"I have a dream\" speech to Lincoln's emancipation proclamation. Both Kennedy and Obama quoted Lincoln; accepting his party's nomination in 2008, Obama quoted and cited King. Unsurprisingly, there are myriad references to and quotations from the Bible. Although there is an important difference between how and why they use them, all of these speechmakers draw on the same repertoire of rhetorical devices.</p><p>As Wills argues, Lincoln uses repetition of words as \"a kind of hook-and-eye method for joining the parts of his address\": there's hardly a sentence that doesn't repeat a word in the preceding one, from \"nation\" and \"conceived\" to \"consecrated\" and \"dead\". Lincoln hands on one particular form of repetition, the anaphora (a word or phrase repeated in the same place in successive phrases or sentences), from Kennedy's \"let both sides …\" to Obama's \"it's the answer … \". All of them use contrasts, from Lincoln's \"the world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here,\" to King's \"we cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote\". In Kennedy's case, contrast takes the particular form of the chiasmus, in which one phrase is echoed in the opposite direction (\"Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate\"); a figure taken up by Jackson (\"I was born in the slum, but the slum was not born in me\"). Most follow the rule of three, from Lincoln's \"in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate – we cannot consecrate – we cannot hallow this ground\" to Obama's \"America, we can come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do.\"</p><p>Of course, these devices are by no means exclusively American. As Max Atkinson makes clear in his analysis of speechmaking, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/healthmindandbody/9780091894795/lend-me-your-ears-all-you-need-to-know-about-making-speeches-and-presentations\" title=\"\"><em>Lend Me Your Ears</em></a>, contrast and tripling appear in speech after speech, time after time. In his wartime broadcasts, Churchill used anaphora (\"we will fight them\" on the beaches, landing-grounds, fields, streets and hills), contrast (so much \"owed by so many to so few\") and chiasmus (not \"the beginning of the end\" but perhaps \"the end of the beginning\"). But it's the sheer quantity of these devices that gives American rhetoric its peculiar rhythmic power, its musicality, and – often – its meaning.</p><p>So Lincoln's repetitions are not just a baton passed from sentence to sentence, but a drumbeat (the word \"dedicate\" appears in every sentence but one). Kennedy uses chiasmus like a hammer (\"ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country\"). Obama's 2012 victory speech had four anaphora (as did Jesse Jackson's speech in 1988), and King's no less than seven (apart from \"I have a dream\" itself, \"one hundred years later …\", \"we refuse to believe …\", \"now is the time …\", \"we can never be satisfied …\", \"with this faith …\" and \"let freedom ring\").</p><p>But if all of these orators cram their rhetorical devices together to an unprecedented degree, they are differently distributed. Atkinson calculates that, in his inaugural, Kennedy employs contrast every 39 seconds, but uses hardly any triples. King's written text contains 18 contrasts, from \"a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity\" to \"transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood\". Obama, on the other hand, favours triples (there were 13 in the speech that launched him to national prominence at the 2004 Democratic convention, and 20 in the \"yes we can\" speech).</p><p>The difference between King and Obama's favoured figure is much more than a matter of taste, technique or style. Contrasts and triples express different views of the world. Contrasts reveal binaries and present choices, multiples accrete evidence for a single case. Which you choose betrays not just your subject but your attitude.</p><p>So Kennedy's contrast-laden speech was (predominantly) about what he saw as the conflict between freedom and tyranny. The first section of Roosevelt's inaugural is about how the rich let down the American masses, and most of the paragraphs consist of two contrasting sentences. At the end, Roosevelt offers a prospect of national unity, and the paragraphs expand to a lilting three. And while Lincoln, King, Jackson and Obama all address the division between free states and slave states, north and south, blue and red America, King sees that contest in terms of unresolved binaries, Obama as a barrier that can be overcome.</p><p>Obama is a master of the personal anecdote and the telling example (neither of which feature in Lincoln, Kennedy or King's speeches at all). In this he follows Jackson, whose 1988 speech includes an evocative list of the sort of Americans who lost out in the 80s: redundant workers, farmers losing land to bad loans, students who can't afford college. Obama picks this device up again and again. In his 2004 critique of Bush's America, he cites children who can't read, seniors who can't pay for prescriptions, Arab-Americans rounded up without due process. In 2012 he accentuates the positive: an immigrant's daughter pledging allegiance to the flag, a Chicago youth seeing a life \"beyond the nearest street corner\", the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or an engineer. When Obama challenges the division between red states and blue states, he lists examples of attitudes and phenomena – religious belief, hostility to censorship, gay communities – that are supposedly restricted to one or other but are actually present in both.</p><p>The fact that Martin Luther King is held to have taken a similarly conciliatory view is due to the most famous section of his 1963 speech, which King decided to substitute for the written ending as he spoke. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/sep/27/gary-younge-on-martin-luther-king-exclusive-book-extract-from-the-speech\" title=\"\">Gary Younge relates in his book <em>The Speech</em></a>, King's aides advised him against repeating the \"I have a dream\" mantra (which he'd delivered at least twice before) on the grounds that it was cliched and trite. Certainly, as black militancy deepened in the years that followed, the last section of the speech was seen as weak and sentimental. If it's true that contrasts are about conflict and multiples tend to the conciliatory, King's ending would be a wonderful example: following his seven dreams, King calls for freedom to ring from five northern and western states and three in the south.</p><p>Taken on their own, as a couple of soundbites, these tropes support the argument that King's speech was merely a call for peace, love and harmony. But in the context of the speech as a whole, with its insistent repetition of contrasts between the world as it should be and the world as it was, the end seems less a flight of fancy about the future than a critique of now. In the context of the failure of America to deliver on the emancipation proclamation, the extent of discrimination, violence and poverty, and the urgent need for what King called a \"whirlwind of revolt\", King's dream for his children to be judged \"not by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character\" is all about students and voters in the south being judged entirely by the colour of their skin. And when King demands that freedom ring from \"the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire\" and \"the curvaceous slopes of California\", he does so not to celebrate these admirable places but to contrast them with Stone Mountain of Georgia, Lookout Mountain of Tennessee and \"every hill and molehill of Mississippi\". The soaring multiples are organised by the binary contrast between one kind of country and another, the same binary which Lincoln posited 100 years earlier at Gettysburg.</p><p>As Younge argues, both King's speech and Obama's victory have been celebrated for asserting that, now, African-Americans are indeed judged by the content of their character, and can succeed on their own. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/07/barack-obama-speech-full-text\" title=\"\">On election night last year</a>, Obama asserted that \"whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, abled, disabled, gay or straight\", you can \"make it here in America if you're willing to try\". But after citing a comparable list – \"black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics\" – King looked forward to something different: a day when \"all of God's children\" would be able to sing \"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty, we're free at last\", not as individuals but as a people.</p><p>In finishing with a triple repeat and an extended last phrase, King anticipated Jackson (\"Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive. On tomorrow night and beyond, keep hope alive\") and echoed Lincoln (\"that government of the people, by the people and for the people, shall not perish from the earth\"). Fifty years on, would he feel that any of those ambitions has been fully achieved?</p><p>• Gary Younge's <em>The Speech</em> is published by Guardian Books</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421611337|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|a3b1a2efd96443ff5b20cdba3b11bc57f287527a -->",

        "body":"<p>Ninety-eight UK publishers went out of business during the past year, 42% more than the year before, figures which reflect an ongoing squeeze on publishers' profit margins driven by deep retail discounts and new digital business models.</p><p></p><p>They include Enid Blyton's publisher from the 1930s to the 1960s, <a href=\"http://www.enidblytonsociety.co.uk/book-groups.php?pick=publisher&amp;value=Evans+Brothers\" title=\"\">Evans Brothers</a>, and Panos London, a publisher of international health titles, which closed in April after 26 years.</p><p></p><p>The majority of the publisher insolvencies related to book businesses, but the figure, compiled by accountancy firm <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3a635258-4321-11e3-9d3c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2jgOCGwbo\" title=\"\">Wilkins Kennedy</a> from Companies House reports for the 12 months ending August 31 2013, also comprises publishers of newspapers, journals, periodicals and directories.</p><p></p><p>Wilkins Kennedy partner Anthony Cork pointed to a clutch of reasons why publishers' traditional business models were so fragile: discounting, the growth of the ebook market, digital piracy, the growth of the secondhand book market, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jun/17/net-book-agreement-publishing\" title=\"\">scrapping of the Net Book Agreement</a> in 1997.</p><p></p><p>\"The growth of the internet has accelerated a dynamic that started with the end of the Net Book Agreement,\" he said. \"The rise of Amazon and other discount sellers with massive buying power means the pressure on publishers' margins is now immense. While publishers might be able to sustain relatively small margins on a bestseller, it is much harder for niche publishers.\"</p><p></p><p>Niche academic and educational publishers are particularly vulnerable, because their model is being undermined by digital piracy and online secondhand book sales on sites such as Amazon Marketplace. Cork said: \"The arrival of Amazon has transformed the secondhand book trade from a fairly minor nuisance to a serious threat. Where once you had to trawl the secondhand bookshops if you wanted to get hold of a cheap hardback or academic book, you can now be fairly certain of getting hold of what you want at the click of a button, and the publisher will not make a penny.\"</p><p></p><p>Growth in sales of ebooks, whose average price is £3 or less, compared with £5.50 for a paperback, has also undermined publishers' margins. UK consumer ebook sales rose by 134% to £216m in 2012, while print sales fell by 1% to £2.9bn, meaning that consumer ebook sales now represent 7.4% of book publishers' total sales, according to the UK Publishers Association. <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/amazon-has-79-e-book-market-uk.html\" title=\"\">Amazon has 79% of the ebook market in the UK</a>, according to Ofcom.</p><p></p><p>In September, bestselling novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/13/amazon-yakkers-braggers-jonathan-franzen\" title=\"\">Jonathan Franzen issued a broadside</a> against  Amazon, criticising aggressive business tactics and what he sees as an attack on literary culture.</p><p></p><p>\"In my own little corner of the world, which is to say American fiction, Jeff Bezos of Amazon may not be the antichrist, but he surely looks like one of the four horsemen. Amazon wants a world in which books are either self-published or published by Amazon itself, with readers dependent on Amazon reviews in choosing books, and with authors responsible for their own promotion,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/13/jonathan-franzen-wrong-modern-world\" title=\"\">he wrote in Guardian Review</a>.</p><p></p><p>Among the UK publishers that have suffered cashflow problems during the past year was Reel Art Press, a publisher of glossy, pop culture photography books, including <a href=\"http://www.reelartpress.com/catalog/edition/52/audrey-hepburn-in-hats\" title=\"\">Audrey Hepburn in Hats</a>. However, it was able to sound a note of optimism. Publisher Alison Elan said that the company's financial woes were more to do with the vicissitudes of being a new small publisher than the vagaries of the publishing market in general. \"We launched in 2010 and have had ups and downs with cashflow, but we found a private equity buyer who liked what we were doing and thought that we could make an impact in the market. So we managed to get through the difficult times. We survived,\" she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421624668|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|4276da9d9f4eceec3443d4d18ccbe54b64386959 -->",

        "body":"<p>Finding the appropriate person to read an audiobook is clearly a tricky art. Given the excitement surrounding its paper publication, it was never going to be long before the audiobook version of Morrissey's Autobiography arrived. Fans will of course have been hoping for the unmistakeable astringent camp of the singer's own Mancunian tones – familiar from decades of indie hits and acid public comments on his rivals – to deliver his memoir himself.   Instead, the Liverpudlian actor David Morrissey, known for playing stern and leathery politicians and tough guys, will be reading an unabridged version. Is he the right man for the job?</p><p>He does share a surname with Morrissey, but not very obviously much else. (I presume this won't be prompting  a search for other namesake narrators? David \"Peep Show\" Mitchell reading David \"Cloud Atlas\" Mitchell? Dawn French tackling the grisly thrillers of Nicci French?…  I'm not convinced.)</p><p>Some pairings in the audiobook world have become modern classics – think of Stephen Fry melliflously voicing forth Harry Potter, so definitively one feels the books could not possibly have been read by anybody else. Timothy Dalton's melodic reading of the crime series by John Banville's alter ego Benjamin Black makes for a similarly fitting combination of voice and style. However, letting plummy-voiced Kate Winslet loose on Andy Stanton's raucous stories for children about that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/audio/2012/sep/07/listen-bad-man-mr-gum-kate-winslet\" title=\"\">absolute grimster Mr Gum</a> seems like a less fortuitous idea.</p><p>There are so many wonderful pairings.

        "headline":"The 100 best novels: No 7 – Emma by Jane Austen (1816)",
        "body":"<p>How on earth to choose just one Jane Austen novel? Austen, for some, is simply the supreme English novelist, on any list. Some will say: she is the greatest. Nominate all six, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/26/pride-prejudice-200th-anniversary\" title=\"\"><em>Pride and Prejudice</em></a> on. But the rules of our selection only allow one title per author: there has to be a choice. So, to represent her fiction here, I've chosen <em>Emma</em> for three particular reasons.</p><p>First, it's my personal favourite, a mature and brilliant comedy of manners (and much more besides) completed towards the end of her life. Second, published by John Murray, <em>Emma</em> takes us into a new literary landscape, the beginnings of a book world that lingers unto the 21st century. And third, most importantly of all, Austen's last novel has the sparkle of early books such as <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, mixed with a sharper and deeper sensibility. There's no accounting for taste: I simply prefer it to the others.</p><p><em>Emma</em> was written in a white heat – according to the scholars – between 21 January 1814 and 29 March 1815 (the year of Waterloo), and it comes as the climax to a remarkable period of intense creativity. <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (whose first draft, \"First Impressions\", was written in 1796-7) had been published in 1813, <em>Mansfield Park</em> in 1814. Austen's work was becoming something of a cult, and she was aware of her audience. Indeed, the Prince Regent was a fan (<em>Emma</em> is dedicated to him). Austen must have been conscious that she was no longer writing just for herself. She was at the peak of her powers, yet had less than two years to live. All this, I think, gives <em>Emma</em> an added depth as the final flowering of a great artist and her work.</p><p>The novelist herself is highly conscious of her art. Emma, she wrote to a friend, is \"a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\". Perhaps. However, compared with her other heroines – Elizabeth Bennet, Fanny Price, Anne Elliot, and Catherine Morland – Emma is the most complex, subtle and complete. Yes, she is \"handsome, clever and rich\". But she's only 21 and will be sent on the familiar Austen cycle of wrong-headedness, remorse, repentance and ultimate self-realisation (with Mr Knightley) in a far deeper way than her predecessors.</p><p><em>Emma</em> represents mature Austen in another way, too. She has perfected the art of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_indirect_speech\" title=\"\">free indirect speech</a> to convey the inner life of her heroine while retaining her control of the narrative as the omniscient author. Light and shade are expertly and satisfyingly in harmony, and the novel's deceptively simple plot is spun into so much teasing variety, through games, letters and riddles – the book is exceedingly playful – that the reader is never less than fully engaged, even charmed. Then there's Austen's mature delight in her milieu. She herself famously wrote that \"three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on\", and <em>Emma</em>'s Highbury exemplifies this credo. Here, fully in command of her genre, Austen revels in her characters and their foibles. Mr Woodhouse, Mr and Mrs Elton, poor Miss Bates, Jane Fairfax and her fiance, deceitful Frank Churchill and, of course, noble Mr Knightley – these are among the most vivid and universal characters in English fiction, as real to us as Pickwick or Jeeves.</p><p>Emma herself is endlessly fascinating, a woman to whom the reader returns again and again for the seductive intimacy of her thoughts, a secret communion that's braided with the lesson that self-knowledge is a mystery, vanity the source of the worst pain, and the subconscious a treacherous and imperfect instrument in the management of the psyche. You can object that Emma is a lady and a snob, but she also makes a timeless appeal to the reader's better nature.</p><p>Austen seems to have known that she was working on something special. <em>Mansfield Park</em> had been published by Thomas Egerton. This time, however, she wanted better terms and more literary prestige. There was only one address for that: 50 Albemarle Street, Mayfair. She approached John Murray, Byron's publisher, offering her new manuscript. Murray accepted at once and his edition appeared in December 1815, after a trouble-free editorial process in which her new publisher made a point of treating her with the greatest respect, though author and publisher never actually met.</p><p><em>Emma</em> occupies a special place in this list because it is supremely English – in character, landscape, sensibility and wit. It's provincial, opaque, sparkling and wonderfully optimistic while being at the same time tinged with intimations of sorrow and mortality. In the end, it answers Jane Austen's own high-spirited prescription for the novel, expressed in <em>Northanger Abbey</em>: \"in short, only some work in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language\".</p><p><strong>A Note on the Text:</strong></p><p>There was just one text prepared in Austen's lifetime, the John Murray edition, dated 1816, though it was actually published in three volumes in December 1815. No manuscript survives. Subsequent editions, notably by RW Chapman, have made silent corrections to typographical errors, but no substantial emendations. <em>Emma</em> has been continuously in print since its first publication: that's one definition of a classic.</p><p><strong>Other Austen Titles:</strong></p><p><em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (1811); <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (1813); <em>Mansfield Park</em> (1814); <em>Northanger Abbey</em> and <em>Persuasion</em>, published posthumously in 1817.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421127092|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|c783539c6a372e47500bc89bdfbcd8449b906f1c -->",

        "body":"<p>The grassy knoll. The book depository. Any further description of the location is superfluous. We know where we are, and when. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/12/jfk-dallas-kennedy-assassination-oswald\" title=\"\">Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas on 22 November 1963</a>: the scene of the assassination of President <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/john-f-kennedy\" title=\"\">John F Kennedy</a>. History assumes mythic proportions when its very familiarity requires no further explanation or scene-setting; when it&nbsp;provides instead a well-signposted point of departure for artistic creativity. The matter of Dallas has been as resonant in the fiction and film of the&nbsp;past half century as the story of the &nbsp;<a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/greekmyths/trojanwar/0,,2239287,00.html\" title=\"\">Trojan war</a> was in the literature of&nbsp;classical antiquity. Only Hitler and the Nazis rival its influence on the modern imagination.</p><p>Yet the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination will not be marked by consensus. Two contrasting versions of these mythic events remain in circulation, as hotly disputed on the web today as they were in radical magazines during the 1960s. Are we commemorating the meaningless assassination of Kennedy by a lone dysfunctional misfit, <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/lee-harvey-oswald-9430309\" title=\"\">Lee Harvey Oswald</a>, who fired on the presidential motorcade from behind, from a window on the sixth floor of the Texas School  Book Depository? Or are we marking a&nbsp;much more sinister incident, the shooting of Kennedy by more than one&nbsp;gunman, including, perhaps, a sniper on the grassy knoll firing at the president from the front? If the latter, was this a conspiracy so successful that&nbsp;the authorities still, for whatever reason, don't – or won't, or can't – acknowledge it?</p><p>For most of us, the two myths are blurred and conjoined. Whether or not we accept the official interpretation of the assassination, set out in the report of the Warren commission, established by Kennedy's successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/11/biography.highereducation\" title=\"\">Lyndon B Johnson</a>, its central finding, that Oswald acted as a lone assassin, is weakened by various suspicious features of the case. Oswald shouted out to pressmen after his arrest that he&nbsp;was merely a \"patsy\", set up, presumably, to distract attention from&nbsp;the real killer.</p><p>Oswald, to be sure, had led a rum life, including a mysterious spell in the Soviet Union, to which he had been able to emigrate mid-cold war, before returning – seemingly just as easily – to&nbsp;the United States, with his Russian wife, <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKoswaldM.htm\" title=\"\">Marina</a>. Within two days of the assassination, moreover, Oswald was himself murdered in the custody of the&nbsp;Dallas police live on television by Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner. Ruby's motive, or so he claimed, was that he wished to spare the president's widow, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/jackie-onassis\" title=\"\">Jacqueline Kennedy</a>, the agony of a trial.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421403224'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2013/10/31/1383243186605/John-F-Kennedy-with-Wife--009.jpg' alt='John F Kennedy with Wife Jackie Kennedy' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>John F Kennedy and wife Jacqueline in 1961. Photograph: Herb Scharfman/Bettmann/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>More controversial still was the so-called \"magic bullet\". The commission was able to make sense of the ballistic evidence only by positing a trajectory for one of Oswald's three shots that went through Kennedy's neck and then through the ribs, wrist and thigh of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2462106/John-Connallys-bloody-shirt-Kennedy-assassination-display.html\" title=\"\">Governor John Connally of Texas</a>, who was sitting alongside the president in the limousine.</p><p>The fog of anomaly and doubt provided dank, but fertile, conditions in which a Kennedy assassination genre would eventually flourish. The emblematic character of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/dondelillo\" title=\"\">Don DeLillo</a>'s 1988 novel <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141188225\" title=\"\"><em>Libra</em></a> is the CIA archivist Nicholas Branch, encumbered with the&nbsp;task of cataloguing and chronicling the mountains of disparate evidence surfacing about Kennedy's assassination. Novels and screenplays depended not only on audience familiarity with the happenings of November 1963 and the Warren commission, but also on nagging concerns that the whole story had not been told, that there was something vital missing from the standard account of the assassination.</p><p>Spookily, such anxieties had been&nbsp;anticipated the day before the assassination, 21 November 1963, when the distinguished American historian Richard Hofstadter delivered the Herbert Spencer lecture at Oxford University on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paranoid_Style_in_American_Politics\" title=\"\">\"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\"</a>. The lecture, which was later published, examined the dark, distended underbelly of conspiracy theory and scapegoating in&nbsp;American political culture.</p><p>More eerily, fiction had, it transpired, anticipated fact. In his 1959 novel <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781409147800\" title=\"\"><em>The&nbsp;Manchurian Candidate</em></a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Condon\" title=\"\">Richard Condon</a> told the story of a brainwashed prisoner from the Korean war who was&nbsp;programmed to assassinate the president. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36239/manchurian-candidate\" title=\"\">Hollywood filmed <em>The Manchurian Candidate</em></a> in 1962. Its star, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-sinatra\" title=\"\">Frank Sinatra</a>, coincidentally, was not only a crony of President Kennedy, but had also starred in a 1954 film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZd3L1JD3tc\" title=\"\"><em>Suddenly</em></a>, which dealt with a presidential assassination&nbsp;attempt.</p><p>In the aftermath of the real assassination, Condon tried to puncture any attempt to conflate the murder of Kennedy with his fictional account, but performed this public service in a magazine article unhelpfully headlined \"Manchurian candidate in Dallas\". A decade later, he&nbsp;was more deliberate in his mischief. His 1974 novel <em>Winter Kills</em>, which became <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080139/\" title=\"\">a Hollywood film in 1979</a>, mocked speculative theories about Dallas. It also presented a bizarre scenario in which a president committed to a campaign against organised crime was assassinated on&nbsp;the reluctant orders of his mobster father – a scarcely veiled allusion to Joseph Kennedy, the patriarch of the Kennedy clan.</p><p>The reverberating hum of small ironies provides the mood music of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/02/112263-stephen-king-review\" title=\"\"><em>11.22.63</em></a> by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/stephenking\" title=\"\">Stephen King</a>, published in 2011. King's compelling assassination novel – begun in the 1970s, but put down until he had the time for the exhaustive research it required – explores the counterfactual possibility of preventing Kennedy's murder. A teacher from present-day Maine slips through a portal in time which takes him back to the late 1950s. If he stays around long enough in the past, can he&nbsp;take out Oswald and prevent the murder of Kennedy? What if all those conspiracy nuts were right, and there was another gunman on hand to finish off the job? The overlapping legends of 22 November 1963 permit the teasing interplay of myth and counter-myth.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421403225'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2013/10/31/1383242637816/Lee-Harvey-Oswald-009.jpg' alt='Lee Harvey Oswald' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The moment when Lee Harvey Oswald is shot by Jack Ruby in 1963. Photograph: Bob Jackson/AP</figcaption></figure><p>From the outset, Kennedy's assassination invited interplay with other bodies of mythic material: Arthurian, Homeric and Shakespearean. Only a week after the assassination, the president's widow, Jacqueline, arranged for the <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/642081/Theodore-H-White\" title=\"\">journalist Theodore White</a> to interview her at the Kennedy compound in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jul/19/kennedy.usa10\" title=\"\">Hyannis Port</a>. She told him that the late president liked to relax in the evenings by listening on his record player to <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alan-jay-lerner-mn0000131135/biography\" title=\"\">Alan Jay Lerner</a>'s lines from his recent musical <em>Camelot</em>: \"Don't let it be forgot,/That once there was a spot,/For one brief shining moment,/That was known as Camelot\". Notwithstanding some editorial qualms about the excessive focus on the Camelot theme in White's article, Life magazine chivalrously complied with the wishes of an insistent widow, but at the long-run cost of distorting the significance of the assassination.</p><p>A year later, the mock-heroic review of the Warren report in Esquire by <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v16/n12/christopher-hitchens/every-latest-spasm\" title=\"\">Dwight Macdonald</a>, one of America's leading public intellectuals, described it as \"an anti-<em>Iliad</em>\", and compared Kennedy to an Achilles incompetently protected by the sluggish <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmidons\" title=\"\">Myrmidons</a> of his secret service. Macdonald's conclusion, that \"the Warren commission did not undertake its enormous labours … to provide material for novelists or detective-story addicts\", was unfortunate. The Warren report became a vast quarry for imaginative writers of all kinds, from those knowingly composing fictions to those operating in a less certain genre.</p><p>Among the transparently polemical fictions was Barbara Garson's 1966 play <em>MacBird!</em>, which presented the Kennedy assassination by way of a series of interlinked parodies of scenes and speeches from Shakespeare's <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Hamlet </em>and <em>Richard III</em>. President Johnson, whose wife was Lady Bird Johnson, was the MacBird of its title; Kennedy became the usurped king, John Ken O'Dunc; and the chief justice of the US supreme court, who chaired the Warren commission and whose name, conveniently for Garson's purposes, was Earl Warren, was neatly transformed into the Earl of Warren. Garson's anti-Johnson animus derived from her experiences in the Berkeley anti-Vietnam war movement. The play's cynical wit proved popular in countercultural circles and, in 1967, <em>MacBird!</em> found its way into paperback and on to the New York stage.</p><p>Yet, notwithstanding the creaking joints of the Warren report, the first years after the assassination marked a period of quiet consensus. Although niche leftwing magazines such as Minority of One and Ramparts ran anti‑Warren pieces, the leading men of&nbsp;letters on the American left such as Macdonald and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/12/american-radical-if-stone-guttenplan-review\" title=\"\">IF Stone</a> were staunch in their support of the commission's version of events. Suspicious as they were of the establishment, they were conscious, too, of the \"paranoid style\" identified by Hofstadter that they associated with the extreme right. Stone proclaimed his allegiance to \"a&nbsp;sane politics, against conspiracy theories of history\".</p><p>The first sign of a major fissure within the left began with the publication in <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/319138.Rush_to_Judgment\" title=\"\">1966 of <em>Rush to Judgment</em>, an attack on the Warren commission by Mark Lane</a>, a radical Democrat. The left began to fragment. The trajectory of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Oglesby\" title=\"\">Carl Oglesby</a>, who moved from presidency of <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/collections/exhibits/arch/Whoswho/SDS.html\" title=\"\">Students for&nbsp;a Democratic Society</a> to prolific JFK&nbsp;conspiracy buff, epitomised the flowering of a \"paranoid\" style on the new left. In 1972, Oglesby founded the Assassination Information Bureau \"to politicise the question of John F Kennedy's assassination\".</p><p>However, for the broader public, 1968 was a more significant turning&nbsp;point. The killing of the late president's brother, Senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/robert-kennedy\" title=\"\">Robert Kennedy</a> of New York, by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/03/sirhan-sirhan-denied-parole-robert-kennedy-shooting\" title=\"\">Sirhan Sirhan</a>, a Jordanian Christian, a couple of months after <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/james-earl-ray-20903161\" title=\"\">James Earl Ray</a>'s assassination of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/martin-luther-king\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King</a>, raised doubts – and in the most complacent quarters – about links between the assassinations. Were these&nbsp;various assassinations connected, possibly part of a larger plot? President Johnson set up a National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence in June 1968.</p><p>The 1972 presidential election campaign, which was marred by another attempted assassination and by a burglary at the Democratic HQ in&nbsp;the Watergate building, seemed to&nbsp;confirm rather than quell public anxiety. In 1973, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/may/07/guardianobituaries.obituaries1\" title=\"\">Richard Popkin</a>, an eminent philosopher and leading critic of the Warren commission, publicised the plausibly outrageous complaint that the three previous US presidential elections had been influenced by the assassin's bullet. Without the events of Dallas, John F Kennedy, not Johnson, would have headed the Democratic ticket in 1964. The killing of Robert Kennedy in 1968 came moments after his victory in the California primary, at&nbsp;a point where he appeared a strong&nbsp;contender for the Democratic nomination. In May 1972, <a href=\"http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/arthur-bremer-who-shot-wallace-is-freed/?_r=0\" title=\"\">Arthur Bremer's shooting of Governor George Wallace of Alabama</a> when he was campaigning at a shopping centre in Maryland left the governor paralysed from the waist down and effectively finished his campaign for the Democratic nomination. In 1968, Wallace had run in the presidential election as a third-party independent, taking five states and 46 electoral votes, and in 1972 had already won the&nbsp;Florida primary.</p><p>The unfolding Watergate scandal merely reinforced suspicions about the integrity of the electoral process. What, after all, was the central offence of the Watergate affair but the series of dirty tricks that allowed Richard Nixon to play a sinister and unhelpful part in choosing his Democratic opponent in 1972, the unelectable liberal senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/21/george-mcgovern\" title=\"\">George McGovern</a>? But in the aftermath of the Watergate revelations Nixon – having already lost his original vice-president <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9318/Spiro-T-Agnew\" title=\"\">Spiro Agnew</a> to a scandal – was forced to resign. As the&nbsp;bizarre outcome of this chain of circumstance, the United States had by&nbsp;the autumn of 1974 an unelected president: Gerald Ford, who a decade earlier – coincidentally? – had been one of the seven members of the Warren commission. Could a novelist or director plausibly explain the real mechanics of the American political system without reference to the invisible coup d'etat? For Oglesby, Dallas and Watergate were \"intrinsically linked conspiracies in a&nbsp;drama of coup and counter-coup\".</p><p>The anxieties of this era are captured in the films that comprise <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_J._Pakula\" title=\"\">Alan J Pakula</a>'s \"paranoia trilogy\". <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute\" title=\"\"><em>Klute</em></a> (1971) deals with eavesdropping, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_President%27s_Men_%28film%29\" title=\"\"><em>All the President's Men</em></a> (1976) with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's exposure of the Watergate affair. However, between these films was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Parallax_View\" title=\"\"><em>The Parallax View</em></a> (1974), which is framed by two assassinations. In the opening scene Senator Charles Carroll is shot – apparently by one lone gunman, or could there be two assassins? At the conclusion, on the Seattle Space Needle, another politician, George Hammond, is shot at a political convention. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/warren-beatty\" title=\"\">Warren Beatty</a> plays a&nbsp;radical journalist who witnessed the&nbsp;first assassination, without quite knowing what he saw, but becomes alarmed when he realises how many of&nbsp;his fellow witnesses on the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;docid=CMj7Tesln2uGyM&amp;tbnid=ywAMYBEIZRiycM:&amp;ved=0CAUQjRw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3AY_Space-Needle-at-Night.jpg&amp;ei=y-lvUrKuC6KM0AXbyIHQCQ&amp;bvm=bv.55123115,d.d2k&amp;psig=AFQjCNEq8zsKWwM9oZMwkBOVIfz4A07RfQ&amp;ust=1383152456468867\" title=\"\">Space Needle</a> that day have met violent, if seemingly accidental, deaths since then. The vivid evocation of estrangement in <em>The Parallax View</em> owed much not only to the vision of Pakula – who exploited to the full in his film-making the brutalising emptiness of modern commercial architecture and its unsettling aesthetic possibilities – but also to the cinematography of Gordon Willis, who helped to realise Pakula's dark vision. Long-distance shots of scenes in giant hangar-like spaces that become only gradually meaningful to the viewer create an ambience of alienation, abstraction and obfuscation. Peering into an atmosphere heavy with portent, the viewer knows something significant is going to happen, but doesn't know where in Pakula's vast, yet often virtually empty canvases.</p><p>In 1975, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq1PbgeBoQ4\" title=\"\">Zapruder film</a> – taken on a cine-camera by <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKzapruder.htm\" title=\"\">Abraham Zapruder, a Dallas clothing manufacturer</a>, a bystander at Kennedy's assassination – was shown for the first time on network TV. The film had been bought by Life for $150,000 the day after the assassination, and many of its still frames had been published in the magazine, but these did not have the same impact as the moving image. It&nbsp;appears from the movement of the president's head in the Zapruder film that he must have been shot from the front – from the grassy knoll – rather than from the book depository. There were immediate calls for further investigation, and the House of Representatives' select committee on assassinations was set up. Informed, or misinformed by acoustic evidence from a Dallas police dictabelt, it concluded that there had been four, rather than three shots, in Dealey Plaza, and that more than one gunman was involved.</p><p>The Zapruder footage inspired a clever, self-referential film about film-making by the pasticheur <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/18/brian-de-palma-passion-interview\" title=\"\">Brian De Palma</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/09/blow-out-classic-dvd-review\" title=\"\"><em>Blow Out</em></a> (1981) tells the story of a B-movie sound recordist (played by John Travolta) who, in the course of a night-time scouting expedition in the suburbs of Philadelphia for sound effects – such as an owl hooting – to be used in a forthcoming slasher movie entitled \"Co-ed Frenzy\", accidentally records the assassination of Governor George McRyan, a presidential contender. The film also alludes to the <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/incident-on-chappaquiddick-island\" title=\"\">Chappaquiddick incident of 1969</a> involving the surviving Kennedy brother, Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. During the shooting, McRyan's car veers into a river with a young female escort on board.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421403226'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2013/10/31/1383242561054/J.F.K.-JFK-009.jpg' alt='J.F.K.: JFK' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison in Oliver Stone’s JFK from 1991. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Warner</figcaption></figure><p>A distinct phase of controversy began in 1991 with the appearance of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/28/jfk-oliver-stone-john-f-kennedy\" title=\"\">Oliver Stone's film <em>JFK</em></a>. This told the story of the only prosecution thus far for Kennedy's assassination, the unsuccessful case brought in 1967 by the New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) against a local businessman, Clay Shaw. Stone also made the grandiose claim that Kennedy was assassinated at the behest of the \"military-industrial complex\" in order to prolong the war in Vietnam. The significance of the film lies in its political impact. The Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1992 was passed to reassure a sceptical public that the government was not withholding material evidence. Tensions on the left reached bursting point. The philosopher and polemicist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/noam-chomsky\" title=\"\">Noam Chomsky</a> published <em>Rethinking Camelot</em> in 1993 to counter Stone's misleading, but influential, myth of how an innocent Kennedy would promptly have exited the war in&nbsp;Vietnam.</p><p>The very familiarity of myth and counter-myth has made it possible for writers and film-makers to experiment with surprising permutations on the assassination theme. While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesellroy\" title=\"\">James Ellroy</a>'s <em>American Tabloid</em> (1995) explores the murky tangle of interconnections between the mob and the security state, it seems all too straightforward by comparison with <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780715636244\" title=\"\">Charles McCarry's 1974 novel <em>The Tears of Autumn</em></a><em>.</em> In the most complex resolution of the Kennedy whodunnit, McCarry presents an ironic case that the South Vietnamese – the assassination of whose leader, Ngo Dinh Diem, in the autumn of 1963 Kennedy could perhaps have prevented – were responsible, with Ruby's killing of Oswald explained by a further delicious twist. Warren Beatty's satirical film <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulworth\" title=\"\"><em>Bulworth</em></a> (1998) relates the picaresque voyaging around Los Angeles of a corrupt and world-weary Democrat. Contemplating suicide, but wishing to make provision for his daughter, Senator Bulworth arranges for his own assassination and cooks up a deal with the life insurance industry to pay out. However, liberated from short-term political calculation, Bulworth changes his mind about his death wish, and tries to cancel his assassination.</p><p>Widespread awareness of the mythic storyline also permits writers and directors to approach the assassination from oblique angles. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Line_of_Fire\" title=\"\"><em>In the Line of Fire</em></a> (1993), which stars Clint Eastwood as an ageing secret service agent who had been on duty nearest to the president in Dallas, sees the assassination through the eyes of Kennedy's bodyguards, and their sense of having failed in their primary role. Eastwood's character, Frank Horrigan, is faced with the taunts of a new assassin who threatens to leave Horrigan with the responsibility for a second presidential corpse. In a similar vein of perversity, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/sondheim\" title=\"\">Stephen Sondheim</a>'s 1990 musical <em>Assassins</em> looks at the sorry lives of American presidential assassins, from Oswald and Lincoln's killer John Wilkes Booth, to less canonical figures such as Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme and John Hinckley, who made assassination attempts, respectively, on presidents Ford and Reagan. More conventionally, the new movie <em>Parkland</em>,<em> </em>released this month, explores the day of the assassination from the perspective of the staff of Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas where the president and Governor Connally were treated. <em>Parkland</em> is a deliberate attempt to distance the assassination from the looking-glass mythologies of conspiracy buffs; instead, the drama of the casualty room revisits the tragedy on a human scale.</p><p>Bizarrely, perhaps, the branch of the performing arts whose exponents became most besotted with the matter of Dallas was stand-up comedy. The patent absurdities of the Warren commission tantalised comedians. Two of America's leading stand-up comedians in the 1960s – <a href=\"http://www.mortsahlofficial.com/biography.html\" title=\"\">Mort Sahl</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Gregory\" title=\"\">Dick Gregory</a> – participated in the district attorney Jim Garrison's investigations. Gregory ran for the Freedom and Peace Party, with the outspoken Warren commission critic Mark Lane as his running-mate, in the presidential election of 1968. In the 1970s, Gregory supported the researches of Richard Popkin, and co-presented the first screening of the Zapruder film on network television. Whereas political activism did nothing to dent the popularity of the versatile Gregory, a fixation with the Kennedy assassination helped almost to finish off the high-flying career of the Jewish comedian Sahl.</p><p>Sahl's keen political satire had been a bracing sensation in the 1950s. Indeed, he was hired to write jokes for Kennedy's campaign in 1960, but maintained his independence after the election with anti-Kennedy quips, much to the irritation of Kennedy's father and backer, Joseph, who allegedly put pressure on venues to drop Sahl. By a further irony, Sahl's later preoccupation with the Warren report, chunks of which he read out as part of his act, led to a perhaps understandable fall in his bookings.</p><p>Faint echoes of Sahl's predicament can be detected in the obsession of Alvy Singer, the left-liberal New York Jewish comedian, played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/woodyallen\" title=\"\">Woody Allen</a> in his 1971 film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36314/annie.hall\" title=\"\"><em>Annie Hall</em></a>. The assassination comes gradually into focus when Singer reflects on the failure of his first marriage, to another Jewish leftist, Allison Porchnik. In a memorable bedroom scene, Allison tries to tempt a distracted Alvy into having sex. The moment we hear Singer, as he gets up from the bed, mention \"the book depository\", we know the precise nature of his distraction. Allison tries to make sense of Singer's alternative to the official version: \"Then everybody's in on the conspiracy? … The FBI, and the CIA, and J Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's room attendant at the White House?\" Although Singer thinks she's gone too far – \"I would leave out the men's room attendant\" – Allison has his measure: \"You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.\"</p><p>The emergence of alternative comedy pushed back the boundaries of decorum. The radical comic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/may/16/sam-leith-bill-hicks\" title=\"\">Bill Hicks</a> (1961-94), who described himself as Chomsky with dirty jokes, happily slayed all manner of pieties, religious as well as political, relishing the way conspiracy theories made awkward, gaping tears in the fabric of conventional wisdom. Hicks included in one of his most famous routines an account of&nbsp;his visit as a tourist to the supposed sniper's nest on the sixth floor of the book depository: \"Anyway, they have the window set up to look exactly like it did on the day. And it's really accurate you know … because Oswald's not in it.\"</p><p>The most accurate barometer of taste – and its obverse – in the post-assassination arts was Jacqueline Kennedy. After the death of her second husband, the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, Jackie Kennedy Onassis returned to New York and began working for Viking, the publisher. However, she moved to Doubleday when Viking published a novel about an assassination attempt on a putative president Edward Kennedy. The 1977-78 novel was <em>Shall We Tell the President?</em> – its author one <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/books+uk/archer\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Archer</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421227832|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|e5c723d092a4de76df004f682b3392e079985cbe -->",

        "body":"<p>Ninety-eight UK publishers went out of business during the past year, 42% more than the year before, figures which reflect an ongoing squeeze on publishers' profit margins driven by deep retail discounts and new digital business models.</p><p></p><p>They include Enid Blyton's publisher from the 1930s to the 1960s, <a href=\"http://www.enidblytonsociety.co.uk/book-groups.php?pick=publisher&amp;value=Evans+Brothers\" title=\"\">Evans Brothers</a>, and Panos London, a publisher of international health titles, which closed in April after 26 years.</p><p></p><p>The majority of the publisher insolvencies related to book businesses, but the figure, compiled by accountancy firm <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3a635258-4321-11e3-9d3c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2jgOCGwbo\" title=\"\">Wilkins Kennedy</a> from Companies House reports for the 12 months ending August 31 2013, also comprises publishers of newspapers, journals, periodicals and directories.</p><p></p><p>Wilkins Kennedy partner Anthony Cork pointed to a clutch of reasons why publishers' traditional business models were so fragile: discounting, the growth of the ebook market, digital piracy, the growth of the secondhand book market, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jun/17/net-book-agreement-publishing\" title=\"\">scrapping of the Net Book Agreement</a> in 1997.</p><p></p><p>\"The growth of the internet has accelerated a dynamic that started with the end of the Net Book Agreement,\" he said. \"The rise of Amazon and other discount sellers with massive buying power means the pressure on publishers' margins is now immense. While publishers might be able to sustain relatively small margins on a bestseller, it is much harder for niche publishers.\"</p><p></p><p>Niche academic and educational publishers are particularly vulnerable, because their model is being undermined by digital piracy and online secondhand book sales on sites such as Amazon Marketplace. Cork said: \"The arrival of Amazon has transformed the secondhand book trade from a fairly minor nuisance to a serious threat. Where once you had to trawl the secondhand bookshops if you wanted to get hold of a cheap hardback or academic book, you can now be fairly certain of getting hold of what you want at the click of a button, and the publisher will not make a penny.\"</p><p></p><p>Growth in sales of ebooks, whose average price is £3 or less, compared with £5.50 for a paperback, has also undermined publishers' margins. UK consumer ebook sales rose by 134% to £216m in 2012, while print sales fell by 1% to £2.9bn, meaning that consumer ebook sales now represent 7.4% of book publishers' total sales, according to the UK Publishers Association. <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/amazon-has-79-e-book-market-uk.html\" title=\"\">Amazon has 79% of the ebook market in the UK</a>, according to Ofcom.</p><p></p><p>In September, bestselling novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/13/amazon-yakkers-braggers-jonathan-franzen\" title=\"\">Jonathan Franzen issued a broadside</a> against  Amazon, criticising aggressive business tactics and what he sees as an attack on literary culture.</p><p></p><p>\"In my own little corner of the world, which is to say American fiction, Jeff Bezos of Amazon may not be the antichrist, but he surely looks like one of the four horsemen. Amazon wants a world in which books are either self-published or published by Amazon itself, with readers dependent on Amazon reviews in choosing books, and with authors responsible for their own promotion,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/13/jonathan-franzen-wrong-modern-world\" title=\"\">he wrote in Guardian Review</a>.</p><p></p><p>Among the UK publishers that have suffered cashflow problems during the past year was Reel Art Press, a publisher of glossy, pop culture photography books, including <a href=\"http://www.reelartpress.com/catalog/edition/52/audrey-hepburn-in-hats\" title=\"\">Audrey Hepburn in Hats</a>. However, it was able to sound a note of optimism. Publisher Alison Elan said that the company's financial woes were more to do with the vicissitudes of being a new small publisher than the vagaries of the publishing market in general. \"We launched in 2010 and have had ups and downs with cashflow, but we found a private equity buyer who liked what we were doing and thought that we could make an impact in the market. So we managed to get through the difficult times. We survived,\" she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421624668|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|4276da9d9f4eceec3443d4d18ccbe54b64386959 -->",

Norland Park had been their home ever since a distant relative had taken pity on them as distressed gentlefolk, and now that their father had died unexpectedly, they were being forced to leave. How contemptible their father's first wife, or to be more accurate, only wife, Fanny had been to throw them out once she had inherited Norland.</p><p>The Dashwood girls might have considered whether in the 21st century the fact that their parents were unmarried would have denied them inheritance rights, but regrettably they chose to moan and watch Made in Chelsea. All apart from Elinor, who was going for a drive with Fanny's brother, Ed.</p><p>\"I'm not at all like Fanny,\" said Ed. \"I may have lots of money, but I want to be a social worker. The trouble is, everyone thinks I'm a bit thick.\"</p><p>\"I think you are marvellously good at doing things,\" Elinor replied. \"Like standing up and sitting down.\"</p><p>\"Gosh. May I kiss you?\"</p><p>\"Perhaps in a month or two.\"</p><p>\"Goody.\"</p><p>A few weeks later, Ed telephoned to&nbsp;say he had found the family a grace and favour home in Devon.</p><p>\"Where's Devon?\" shrieked Margaret.</p><p>\"Near Scotland,\" Marianne exclaimed.</p><p>\"No matter,\" said Elinor. \"I shall have to give up my architecture degree to come and look after you all, as we have no money.\"</p><p>\"Why don't you just get a student loan like anyone else and let the rest of them get a job?\" nobody asked.</p><p>\"What's a job?\" the Dashwood girls enquired.\"Welcome to Barton,\" said Sir John Middleton, whose name suggested he might one day marry into royalty, but who in reality was Johnny Boden. \"Do wear some of my mail-order clothes.\"</p><p>Marianne went for a meaningful walk of nearly 20 yards, before collapsing with an asthma attack. \"Please let me die,\" she wailed. \"Joanna Trollope has achieved the near impossible of making every Jane Austen character appear shallow and unlikable and I want out of here.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, an impossibly handsome young man picked up her inhaler. \"I'm Wills,\" he said. \"not to be confused with prince Wills. Let me whisk you off&nbsp;to my estate and shag you something rotten.\"</p><p>\"I always suspected Wills was a bounder,\" said Ellie, as Marianne lay around for six months doing even less than normal, after Wills had mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>\"Quite right,\" said Bill Brandon, a kind old soldier who ran a rehab clinic and was hoping to acquire a Dashwood airhead for himself.</p><p>A flighty young girl, Lucy Steele, appeared to announce how excited she was to be marrying Ed. Elinor smiled nobly. Although she had been given by&nbsp;Ed to believe he wanted to marry her, she understood he was basically a&nbsp;very good, if damaged, man and so she quite reasonably forgave him in an&nbsp;instant.</p><p>The London party of Spencer and Proudlock was the grandest affair of the season. From the corner of her eye, Marianne spied Wills with a Greek shipping heiress and fell into a deep coma. For days she hovered between life and death, before her recovery was&nbsp;assured.</p><p>\"Wills wanted you to know that he had always loved you but was forced to&nbsp;marry the Greek for the cash,\" said&nbsp;Elinor.</p><p>\"I knew he was a nice man,\" sobbed Marianne. \"Oh look! Lucy has tweeted that she's got married.\"</p><p>Elinor inwardly sobbed.</p><p>\"But not to me,\" exclaimed Ed. \"She has married my camp party-planner of a brother who is not a bit like ...\"</p><p>Everyone but Elinor groaned. \"Oh, goody! I shall be wed after all.\"</p><p>\"And do you think Marianne might marry me, one day,\" asked reliable Bill.</p><p>\"I'd have thought so.

        "headline":"Poem of the week: Cartography for Beginners by Emily Hasler",
        "body":"<p>I discovered this week's poem – and poet – in issue  76 of Michael Mackmin's influential Norwich-based poetry journal, <a href=\"http://www.therialto.co.uk/pages/\" title=\"\">The Rialto</a> . It was the tone of <a href=\"http://saltmodernvoices.wordpress.com/who-are-the-salt-modern-voices/emily-hasler-natural-histories/\" title=\"\">Emily Hasler</a>'s  \"Cartography for Beginners\" that particularly attracted me: colloquial, playful, assured. The playfulness and assurance extend to the way the poem remodels and subverts what a cartographer might call its \"ground-truth\" – a lesson on how to draw a map.</p><p></p><p>That the speaker is only pretending to issue a set of useful instructions, meanwhile creating her own myth of map-making, quickly becomes clear in the ordering of priorities, beginning with that emphasis on \"the correct blue\".  When, in lines two and three, the speaker advises that the shade of blue should not be \"too watery\" because \"people do not like wet feet\", the map and the place mapped are suddenly fused, and we might even suspect the tutee is in on the joke. A mock-didactic poem needs two people to play the game.</p><p></p><p>Blue could be associated with feelings too, of course, and perhaps an openness to feeling. Beyond its aesthetic potential, water constantly draws the speaker's attention. It becomes so significant that, even if there's no actual water to be indicated, she insists that the choice of blue still has to be made. Later, she will go farther and say that, if the area has no water, \"I have to question why you are bothering\". The most powerful image or symbol in the poem, water connects, through baptism, to the church (listed in the places of worship) and, of course, to the pub. Finally, the poem considers the possibility of a completely submerged East Anglia.  Its resemblance to \"a sodden Constable\" suggests that the place is not so much a place as a picture of a place – the converse idea of a map which causes wet feet.</p><p></p><p>Elements from both art and science, the disciplines <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography\" title=\"\">the making of maps traditionally employs</a>  are allowed to unsettle one another. That unsettling is inherent in many kinds of mapping, of course. Perhaps the key reference is to \"the twin and warring gods of Precision/ and Wild Abandon\". In mentioning <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox\" title=\"\">the coastline paradox</a>  the poem reveals an awareness of the difficulty of exactly conveying complex spatial information on paper.</p><p></p><p>Precision, symbolised by Mandelbrot's investigation, is burdensome, but cannot be jettisoned (\"get a stepladder\"). \"Wild Abandon\" is hinted in \"licence\" (line 13) and, more resolutely projected at the end, when the speaker seems to be persuading the addressee towards a real, physical encounter and an implied sexual landscape. Tensions exist in the antipathy of wet and dry,  public and private. The map is interpreted as an act of communication with \"people\", an intimate space between friends or lovers, and a delightful playground for the solitary imagination.</p><p></p><p>Formally, there's a resistance to end-stopping. The many enjambed lines create their own variable coastline – the line-endings – and flow gracefully over the edge. There is a civility in the poem that recalls Elizabeth Bishop's finely controlled, often ruefully humorous, navigating potentially dangerous emotional waves.</p><p></p><p>\"People do not like/ to be lost\", the speaker remarks in lines 10/11, but, of course, some discoveries can be made only when one is lost. This poem disorientates us, but in a gentle and fruitful way. While we're not allowed to find out, metaphorically, exactly where we are, some East Anglian locations towards the end are reassuring. And they allow an affectionate poem of place to emerge from an intimate address to a particular individual.</p><p></p><p>Originally from <a href=\"http://www.felixstowe.gov.uk/Core/FelixstoweTC/Pages/Town_History_1.aspx\" title=\"\">Felixstowe</a> in Suffolk, Hasler has published work in various magazines and anthologies, and her first pamphlet natural histories appeared from Salt in their \"modern voices\" series, <a href=\"http://www.saltpublishing.com/shop/proddetail.php?prod=9781844718672\" title=\"\">and is still available</a>. \"Cartography for Beginners\" is from an unpublished sequence of four poems, \"The Map Lover\". I look forward to seeing this, and more of Hasler's work, in a first full-length collection.</p><p></p><p><strong>Cartography for Beginners</strong><br /><em>for CL</em></p><p>First of all, you will need to choose the correct blue<br />to indicate water. This should not be too watery.<br />You must remember: people do not like wet feet.<br />If there is no water to indicate, no matter,<br />you must still elect a blue. Let me recommend<br />eggshell, at a push, azure. Choose a symbol<br />for church/temple/mosque/synagogue. Choose<br />a symbol for pub. Dedicate your life<br />to the twin and warring gods of Precision<br />and Wild Abandon. People do not like<br />to be lost. Buy Mandelbrot's 1967 paper<br />on the coastline paradox, put it on the highest shelf –<br />but get a stepladder. Take a little licence with rivers, <br />especially their curves and estuaries. Add<br />an oxbow lake if at all possible. If the area you<br />are mapping has no seas/lakes/rivers/streams,<br />I have to question why you are bothering. You<br />won't get to use that lovely blue you spent so long<br />deciding upon. Do the Norfolk fens instead. Better<br />yet, East Anglia in its future state, quite utterly<br />submerged like a sodden Constable. Come on,<br />get your coat, I'll show you. You won't need your shoes.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421604636|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|f8906537efcca0aacefbb103928b94c5138edb4e -->",

Yes he is, I'm afraid.</p><p>The first thing we do with new journalists nowadays is explain carefully that it's spelt G-U-A-R-D-I-A-N, not \"Grauniad\", so I feel we are making progress.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474623\">metalvendetta asked</a>:</h2><p>Is the less/fewer distinction still enforced?</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474788\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>In these parts, yes it is. I go round the office slapping people with a ruler if they get it wrong.</p><p>There was a successful campaign a few years ago to persuade Tesco to say \"five items or fewer\" rather than \"less\", which gives me hope that my own campaign to persuade the biggest supermarket in the UK to put an apostrophe in \"Mens\" and \"Womens\" may yet prove effective.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474379\">sirenabergman asked</a>:</h2><p>Not strictly a grammar question but I hope you'll accept some semantics. How do you feel about the new definition of 'literally' being effectively (with an e) synonymous with 'figuratively'?</p><p>And where to go with the erosion of the last refuge of the modest and chaste-souled when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded?</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474662\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>Many grammarians have no problem with this as they see it as just another example of language change.</p><p>To me it seems perverse to use a word to mean something like its opposite. The literal meaning of literally can be quite useful – \"I've literally not eaten all day\" means you are likely to be ravenous, not that you feel a bit peckish.</p><p>Figurative use of the word may also distract the reader by sounding comical, as in \"United literally came back from the dead\" or \"he literally exploded into action\".</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28454500\">chrisiswonderful asked</a>:</h2><p>Dear Dave</p><p>I would love to know the correct usage of affect and effect. As they're both verbs and nouns and just one vowel between the two I'm left affecting that my grammatical effects have the correct affect on the reader. Did it effect them? Are they affected? Is the event the effect and the affect the effect of affects?</p><p>I'm in the dark</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474238\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>Dear Chris,</p><p>To quote from the book that you are generously allowing me to plug:</p><p>affect (verb): have an impact on; effect (noun): impact.</p><p>Overwork was affecting his health but had little effect on his bank balance.</p><p>To make it interesting, effect is also a verb, meaning make something happen:</p><p>I hope my book will effect a change in standards of reading and writing.</p><p>You can also \"affect\", say, a posh accent, which may lead to people describing you as \"affected\".</p><p>Yours, Dave</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28465154\">Lindsey Clark asked</a>:</h2><p>Could you tell me why we say...</p><p>'He walked until he had reached the garden.'</p><p>instead of (or as well as)</p><p>'He walked until he reached the garden.'</p><p>I know it's something to do with the time conjunction 'until', as the same thing can happen after 'when'. Grammar books 'explain' this use of the past perfect after time conjunctions as 'something that happens sometimes', which is hardly satisfactory. I'm an English teacher and it's very confusing for students as we tell them that the past perfect is the 'past of the past', but in this case reaching the garden clearly happens AFTER walking, not before.</p><p>Could you shed some light on it? Thanks!</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475012\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>Lindsey, I've been wrestling with this one since you posted it yesterday. Which shows what an exciting life I lead.</p><p>Anyway, I have come to the conclusion that, while we could have an interesting discussion about the tiny difference in meaning between the two versions, life is too short to worry about it. Most native English speakers would make no distinction between the two.</p><p>See my remarks elsewhere about Tesco's use of the apostrophe. There are more important things to worry your students about than arcane stuff about tenses. I can see the value of reported speech, and fight a constant (usually losing) battle to persuade Guardian journalists to use it properly, but I reckon that if even an English teacher doesn't understand the difference in your examples, and I don't either, your students are highly unlikely to grasp it.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474688\">saynotoidiocy asked</a>:</h2><p>Is it subeditor, or sub-editor?</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475133\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>We spell it subeditor (cf subcontinent, subcommittee). I have to say, however, that hardly anyone has copied us since I dropped the comma at least a dozen years ago. The same applies to thinktank. Perhaps the Guardian is just too far ahead of its time. Or wrong.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474819\">Shakaroo asked</a>:</h2><p>Is HMRC plural? Whenever I write \"HMRC is looking into it\" someone changes it to \"HMRC are looking into it\".</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475244\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>Colloquially, most normal people would probably use the plural: the government say we are all in it together, HMRC are cracking down on tax avoidance, Tesco are going to take my advice over using the apostrophe, etc.</p><p>Formally, most newspapers treat such organisations as singular: HMRC is, the government is, Tesco is, etc. Although sports teams are plural: Wednesday are certain to get relegated this season, etc.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28474722\">Opimian asked</a>:</h2><p>Could you put something in the Guardian Style Guide about the correct use of 'former' and 'latter'?<br />So many Guardian writers say \"the latter\" after a list of more than two. If there are two nouns in the preceding sentence you can say 'former' and 'latter'; more than two and it becomes 'first' and 'last'.</p><p>(I sneaked a semi-colon in there. I love semi-colons.)</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475611\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>Thank you, Opimian, for reminding me that I meant to do this, but forgot.</p><p>It is, however, in the book:</p><p>Saying an item is \"the latter\" of more than two things is not only annoying but wrong. In such cases, it should be \"last\". It's best to treat latter as I have done in this chapter, and use it only in contrast with former.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476101\">Cormaic asked</a>:</h2><p>Following on from the not quite literal use of \"literally\", is there any chance of the word \"quite\" getting one standard definition rather than two opposite ones?</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476263\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>I quite agree that it's quite tricky. From the book:</p><p>\"I'm quite tired\" means \"I'm fairly tired.\"<br />\"Have you quite finished?\" means \"have you completely finished?\" and comes with a built-in note of irritation.<br />\"Quite!\" means \"I agree!\"<br />This is a word that you can use in all innocence in an email only to discover later that you have offended the recipient, so it might be better to say completely, fairly or something else less prone to ambiguity.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475557\">alicepleasanceliddel asked</a>:</h2><p>Any thoughts on the use of 'he was sat at the table' over 'he was sitting at the table'?</p><p>\"was sat' seems to be everywhere, I've even heard teachers using it. Many writers use it now. Is this a change we should just put up with?</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476088\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>Why, friend, there is a section on this very verb in For Who the Bell Tolls. So why haven't you bought a copy? Anyway, this is what it says:</p><p>You add the infinitive, sit, the present participle, sitting, or the past participle, sat, to an auxiliary verb to get the right tense.</p><p>I may have sat at the table in the past, but now I am sitting there.</p><p>Participles are tricky, which explains why Ernie Wise got so many laughs from the phrase \"the book what I wrote\".</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475871\">ID473520 asked</a>:</h2><p>Hi David,</p><p>Any thoughts on Russell Brand's recent outpourings in which he used the word \"normalcy\". Or in his interview when he used \"alternate\" to mean \"alternative\"? Are these acceptable?</p><p>Finally, what do you think of the current trend of asking questions by adding the question word to the end of a phrase? E.g. \"Are these acceptable, why?\"</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476670\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>You just have to accept that that's how he talks, listen to his message and decide what you think about it. He's probably on the way to becoming a \"national treasure\". As with John Prescott, the idiosyncratic way he expresses himself is what you get, loathe it or loathe it [sic].</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475887\">brokenbra asked</a>:</h2><p>Do you ever see the day when the misspelling of your to mean you're becomes so prolific that it is accepted as correct?</p><p>Is this an example of language evolving?</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28477259\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>Apostrophes are the difference between feeling you're nuts and feeling your nuts, and that's why we need them, and will continue to do so.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28475985\">Chutzpah asked</a>:</h2><p>Is it just me that hates the use of \"multiple\" to mean \"many\"?</p><p>\"Many\" means lots of things whereas \"multiple\" used to mean something that is manifold or in more than one state. Now multiple seems to mean many - so what does many mean? And what do we use when we actually mean multiple?</p><p>Thanks - indulge me with your take on this one.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476208\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>No, I hate it too. I suggest the reason is that people think, wrongly, that the longer word sounds more impressive than the shorter one. Politicians and business people are perhaps the worst offenders. Funny how they are the very two groups that are always banging on about falling standards of English among school leavers and students.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28476765\">PommieBarsteward asked</a>:</h2><p>Sir Timothy Berners-Lee not only invented the World Wide Web but he also gave it to the world on a royalty-free basis. If it wasn't for him the questions being asked and answered above would only be thoughts in peoples' heads.</p><p>That so, why does the style guide insist on a lower case w in Web when Sir Tim specifically mentions that people should use a capital W? It just seems a bit lame to ignore his wishes.</p><h2><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28477516\">David Marsh replied</a>:</h2><p>I take your point but calling it the \"Web\", as some American newspapers still do, looks old-fashioned and quaint. We used to have \"Television\" and \"Wire-less\" and for all I know the people who invented them used a capital T and W.</p><p>When it comes to a house style, you can't just follow people's own preferences because you would end up with a total mishmash, which would defeat the point of the whole exercise. (And I'd be out of a job.)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421273162|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|788097998bdd25583b56e9f291142a79e5bd1f4a -->",

        "headline":"Penelope Fitzgerald: A Life by Hermione Lee – review",
        "body":"<p>What does a novelist's career look like? A male novelist might have a short struggle, like Dickens or Waugh or James, then a big success and a series of novels of varying success and accomplishment; the great masterpiece comes 20 years in, when they are in their 40s or 50s. (Think of Mann or Naipaul.) They might have some kind of family connection to the world of letters, or acquire one and know how to&nbsp;exploit it. Women novelists often have a more complex path, perhaps interrupted by children and a more difficult relationship with literary fame; even without children, they are more likely to creep up on fame in a series of books.</p><p>Nowadays, of course, writing is often seen as a profession like any other. To take this year's Man Booker winner, Eleanor Catton, as an example of what might be seen as a novelist's ideal career in 2013: one does a degree in English literature, and immediately afterwards a master's degree in creative writing. Your first published novel is your MA thesis. Afterwards, you are given a post teaching creative writing in a university, and your second novel wins&nbsp;a major prize.</p><p>Not to criticise the excellent Ms Catton, but this model of a novelist's career is going to produce novelists with a narrow grasp of human experience, whose novels are increasingly going to have to come from historical research and meta-fictional game-playing and, ultimately, novels about creative writing degrees. For a different, though ultimately not tempting vision of a novelist's career, we might turn to Hermione Lee's excellent biography of Penelope Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald was, by general consensus, among the handful of great novelists in English after 1980. She had the misfortune of being not only over 45, but in her 70s and 80s when her great masterpieces first appeared. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;unusual turn of events, her daughter Tina published a novel 18 years before she first did. Tina was 10&nbsp;years old. Fitzgerald would be 61. Surely, it was Tina who got the business of a novelist's career the right way round. What went wrong? More to the point – in the light of <em>The Blue Flower</em>, <em>At Freddie's </em>and <em>The&nbsp;Gate of Angels</em> – what went abundantly right?</p><p>It is easier to answer the first question than the second. Fitzgerald was born Penelope Knox in 1916 into a famous and brilliant family – her nobly eccentric account of her four uncles, <em>The Knox Brothers</em>, hardly overstates the case. One uncle was the saintly and&nbsp;ingenious Ronnie Knox, Evelyn Waugh's friend, Macmillan's tutor and the establisher of&nbsp;the rules of detective fiction, among other distinctions. Her&nbsp;father, EV(\"Evoe\") Knox was the editor of Punch during its golden age of&nbsp;the 1930s and 1940s. Fitzgerald grew up in Hampstead, the granddaughter of a bishop with intensely literary interests: Harold Monro's Poetry Bookshop is so&nbsp;powerfully evoked in Fitzgerald's non‑fiction that one regrets the absence of the novel on the subject that might have followed her biography of Charlotte Mew. Up to a point, what followed was what might have been expected: a brilliant Oxford first, some work for the BBC, the creation and&nbsp;editing of an interesting literary magazine, a sparkling circle of friends. A novel from this superb mind would surely follow.</p><p>Instead, there was the abandonment of the&nbsp;Hampstead ménage with husband and three&nbsp;small children. There was a period in Southwold, Suffolk, working in a bookshop. They couldn't pay the grocery bills, and the household possessions were sold on the pavement outside their house. A period living on&nbsp;a decrepit barge in London, Fitzgerald having to teach in a crammer, ended when the decrepit barge sank. She had to live, with her daughters, in a hostel for the homeless before being rehoused in a&nbsp;council flat,&nbsp;going on with&nbsp;the immense grind of&nbsp;teaching and cramming. Only in the 1970s did she begin to publish books, first&nbsp;a pair of biographies and then novels, to quite rapid acclaim. She lived with her grown-up married children, in spare rooms, on sofabeds, in annexes. By then her husband Desmond had died.</p><p>Hermione Lee has unearthed the full story of the&nbsp;catastrophe that overtook the family from a mound of rumour and literary gossip – strikingly, the collected letters, edited by a member of her family, omitted any explanation of why the family was living on a barge and then in accommodation for the homeless. The name of&nbsp;the catastrophe was Desmond. Though plausible and,&nbsp;by many accounts, personally charming, Desmond was a feckless alcoholic who could not sustain much of a career as a&nbsp;barrister. Work must have dried up towards the end&nbsp;of the Hampstead period, and Desmond's income could not help them during the Southwold humiliation. Worse was to come. While they were living on the boat, he was discovered stealing and forging cheques from his&nbsp;chambers. He was disbarred and ordered to pay back £373&nbsp;– money the family didn't have. London gossip always had it that he had been sent to&nbsp;prison, which was not, it turns out from Lee's investigations, accurate – his sentence was suspended. He was lucky to find a job working as a clerk for Lunn Poly, the travel agents.</p><p>\"It sometimes strikes me that men and women aren't quite the right people for each other,\" Fitzgerald writes in <em>The&nbsp;Bookshop</em>, benevolently turning her experience in Southwold into the experience of a childless widow. What is striking about Fitzgerald's story is that her professional experience was seamless and well-considered before she met Desmond; it starts to move again very efficiently in the very last years of his life, and, once he died, her&nbsp;career took off. She published her first five novels between 1977 and 1982. Did she just need solitude? After Desmond's death, though she was only 60, there is not a&nbsp;whisper of any desire for another partner in life. There would have been no shortage of gentlemen happy to take on an acclaimed, brilliant novelist&nbsp;of impeccable manners and&nbsp;fascinating conversation. Yet she had learned her lesson, and now it was time for the books.</p><p>Whatever it was like to live through, one can't as a reader regret the immense delay and traumatic contributions of&nbsp;Fitzgerald's life. After the first, amusing fantasy, <em>The Golden Child</em>, her&nbsp;first novels mine her experiences with great concision and depth of psychological analysis born, surely, of&nbsp;long afternoons of boredom supervising in the crammers and in a&nbsp;Suffolk bookshop. The days on the&nbsp;barge, so hungry that she could sometimes be found eating blackboard chalk (\"I felt I needed it\"), bore some positive fruit. <em>The Bookshop</em> drew on Southwold; <em>Offshore</em> the period on the barge Grace; <em>Human Voices</em> the wartime BBC years; <em>At Freddie's</em> – in some ways the deepest and most wonderful of her books – the experience of the crammers, transformed into a stage school with an&nbsp;extravagant menagerie of posing prodigies. They are not simple statements, and far from romans à&nbsp;clef.&nbsp;They use the long-observed situation to penetrate into the mysteries of human manners.</p><p>There is no doubt, really, that Fitzgerald made an awful hash of her career, for the most part. It happened to her despite her very best efforts. Her&nbsp;novels were initially published by Duckworth, controlled by the beady-braying-claret-and-malice pair of Colin and Anna Haycraft. It is difficult to imagine Fitzgerald at home here, and&nbsp;her novels are not much like the brilliantly poisonous satires of Alice Thomas Ellis (AKA Anna Haycraft) or the music-hall raucousness of Beryl Bainbridge – Colin Haycraft's star novelist and mistress – other than in their concision. When Fitzgerald won&nbsp;the Booker prize for <em>Offshore</em>, she seems to have taken it for granted that Haycraft didn't really think her books were much good, and wrote to him thanking him for his effort, and saying that he would be relieved that she was&nbsp;now going to another publisher. Haycraft was, understandably, astounded by Fitzgerald's attitude, and&nbsp;put it down to cunning self-advancement, quite wrongly. She genuinely thought he had&nbsp;lost interest in publishing her. No&nbsp;doubt Haycraft had been going round sharing his disbelief at <em>Offshore</em>'s success with most of London, but it was definitely a&nbsp;strange moment for the novelist to be&nbsp;convinced of her lack&nbsp;of success in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>Or was it a good, propitious moment? What followed, given admirable prominence in Lee's biography, was the devotion, verging on veneration, of a sequence of publishers. At the very end of Fitzgerald's life, I shared an editor with&nbsp;her, and well remember the immense respect and love of her publishers at Flamingo. In Richard Ollard, Stuart Proffitt and Philip Gwyn&nbsp;Jones, Fitzgerald had editors who would have&nbsp;done anything for her,&nbsp;and did. It was just as well, since her grasp of the business was so vague that she never employed a literary agent, despite being hopeless with money. (She \"began to keep a regular (if idiosyncratic) account of her earnings in a notebook labelled 'My&nbsp;Takings'\" only in 1992, we are told;&nbsp;\"every so often these sums are annotated: 'I've no idea what this is for,' or 'Oh dear where is the Observer [cheque]? I'VE LOST IT.'\") There is a comedy about her publishers trying to work out, with no input or, apparently, interest at all from Fitzgerald, what they should pay her as an advance.</p><p>What they were working on was a creative volte-face as noteworthy as Lucian Freud's shift from sable to hogshair brushes in the late 1950s. Fitzgerald's first five novels were stories of English life in her lifetime, drawing on her experience. Her last four are remote, dazzlingly complete and quizzical reconstructions of historical, or geographically remote reality: 1950s Italy (<em>Innocence</em>), just before the outbreak of the great war in Cambridge and Moscow (<em>The Beginning of Spring)</em>, and finally, in her greatest novel, <em>The Blue Flower</em>, the German Romantic poet Novalis. They came at a&nbsp;point when a&nbsp;number of English novelists were discovering possibilities in the long-disdained historical novel, but they are&nbsp;peerless. They come not just from research – interestingly, in the light of&nbsp;their dense specificity, one of her editors says that she \"didn't have an&nbsp;eye for detail\" – but&nbsp;also from experience. We hear exactly how much&nbsp;it cost in the 1790s to cross the bridge at Weissenfels, and how much to take the train from Moscow to London before the revolution. What does not come from <em>Bradshaw's Railway Guide</em>, or from the archives, is&nbsp;the knowledge of what a clever boy feels his life is like in a dull small town, or what the&nbsp;stroke of love is like when a&nbsp;figure turns in a dusty room. The long&nbsp;years of frustration, of doing nothing, of serving the general good in&nbsp;unhistoric acts, as George Eliot put it, justified themselves.</p><p>In the difficult years, Fitzgerald could easily have taken to reviewing books and writing short fiction. She did a little – readers should prepare to allow their jaws to drop&nbsp;when they&nbsp;get to Lee's reproduction of \"Jassy of Juniper Farm\", a serial Fitzgerald wrote for&nbsp;a&nbsp;comic for younger children, Swift, in the&nbsp;1950s. But a little dedication would have led to some&nbsp;comfort in&nbsp;an age when VS&nbsp;Pritchett could live&nbsp;in some style on short stories and book reviews. Why did she not? Could she perhaps not afford, at&nbsp;the family's worst, a&nbsp;typewriter? She&nbsp;would always have been a&nbsp;writer: she would have been a&nbsp;different one, and the&nbsp;distilled experience of those last books not quite the same.</p><p>There is a definite comedy about Fitzgerald's rueful eye falling on her success, when it is all rather too late to be thoroughly enjoyed. She carried on doing her duty by&nbsp;the literary world, and there is an amusing story here told by a novelist who was set on accompanying her when returning from a&nbsp;conference. She, on the other hand, was clearly determined, by travelling in second class, refusing a lift in a taxi, and heading down to the underground, to give him the slip. (\"I do seem to have involved you in some low forms of transport.\") I met her twice: she was very civil about a book of mine; I found her, personally, very daunting, without quite being able to account for the impression. Other people seem to have&nbsp;had the same experience.</p><p>Lee was a perfect choice as Fitzgerald's biographer. She has done a&nbsp;superb job, capturing an elusive personality and a complex, sometimes rather harrowing story. She managed to get a good deal out of Fitzgerald's three children, who one sometimes thinks were the people who saw the&nbsp;whole experience most clearly – certainly Fitzgerald's bad behaviour over her son&nbsp;Valpy's early but very happy marriage is given full coverage. (You feel that she might have understood why he wanted to find security in family life as soon as possible.) There is&nbsp;a surface of restraint and orderly decency in the life as it is told here; beneath it, the wildness and&nbsp;fury of the&nbsp;books, where girls' legs&nbsp;are hacked off at the knees to make&nbsp;them suitable companions for aristocratic dwarfs; where a Cambridge intellect falls in love helplessly with quite an ordinary nurse; where poetry happens, from who knows where. At the end of <em>At Freddie's</em>, we glimpse the violence and&nbsp;terror that a mind in love with the possibility of perfection can wreak, as the child actor Jonathan tries to perfect the stage leap in a Covent Garden back yard. \"In the morning there would be someone to come and watch, and tell him whether he was right or not. Meanwhile he went on climbing and jumping, again and again&nbsp;and again into the darkness.\" Someone indeed came in the morning, for Fitzgerald and her writing&nbsp;career. By&nbsp;then she, like Jonathan, had been jumping into&nbsp;the darkness, trying to&nbsp;create perfection, for a good long&nbsp;night.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421132852|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|6eeabc8b884c7a88a981053c16a2044577ce90c5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Those who love short-form fiction have had reason to cheer recently: the success of high profile competitions such as the BBC Short Story award, Sunday Times EFG Short Story award and the new Costa Short Story award; and now Alice Munro <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/10/alice-munro-wins-nobel-prize-in-literature\" title=\"\">winning the Nobel</a> after several decades of producing quietly brilliant volumes. A literary form declared dead on the slab a few years ago has proved to have a soft but resolutely pumping pulse.</p><p>At first glance, Zadie Smith's new volume might seem part of that resurgence. Numbering 69 small pages with a lot of white space, it's an extended story that first appeared in the <em>New Yorker</em> earlier this year and is now being published simultaneously as an ebook, audio book read by Smith herself and handy, pocket-sized hardback. <em>The Embassy of Cambodia </em>isn't a short story, though. It's a novel in miniature, divided into 21 tiny \"chapters\", each of which is a brief scene that encapsulates what many writers would take several thousand words to say. Reading it is a bit like having a starter in a restaurant that is so good you wish you had ordered a big portion as a main course, only to realise, as you finish it, that it was exactly the right amount.</p><p>It begins in a somewhat disconcerting manner – in the narrative form of the fourth person, or first person plural: \"we\". \"Who would expect the Embassy of Cambodia?  Nobody. Nobody could have expected it, or be expecting it. It's a surprise to us, that's all… we, the people of Willesden.\" At this stage, the reader might suspect Smith of having an in-joke at the expense of those who have stereotyped her as a poster girl for tales of cheery multiculturalism in a particular corner of north-west London.</p><p>Later this \"we\" turns out to be an elderly lady standing on a balcony of an old people's home, \"barely covered\" in her dressing gown: the kind of distressed yet omniscient figure who appears to command and control many an inner-city street. The main character of the novel is not this one-woman Greek chorus but Fatou, a domestic worker in a residential house who walks by the Embassy of Cambodia as she sneaks away from her servitude on Monday mornings to use a local swimming pool, gaining access with guest passes she has stolen from her employer.</p><p>Fatou is a character who really does deserve a full-length novel (or perhaps a film adaptation of this version), a proud and competent young woman in a position of great hardship who lacks any trace of self-pity or even anxiety, quietly performing her job, grateful for the small moments of selfhood she is allowed: her weekly stolen swim, her Sunday morning church visit followed by coffee and cake in a Tunisian cafe with a student, Andrew, whom she has met on a park bench thanks to his attempt to convert her to Catholicism.</p><p>When she is put in a disastrous position, it is Andrew who will be her saviour. Her feelings for him are ambiguous but just as she is much more than the classic victimised refugee, Andrew has a depth and a realism deftly sketched by Smith in the few brush strokes of this tiny, poised work: a perfect stocking-filler of a book that shows that short-form fiction can be as vibrant and as healthy as any densely realised full-length novel.</p><p><em>Louise Doughty's most recent novel is </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571297887\" title=\"\"><em>Apple Tree Yard </em></a><em>(Faber &amp; Faber). </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420973924|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|72126322718ca576984772d0f7ef51e4ef13d2fa -->",

        "headline":"Love, Nina: Despatches from Family Life by Nina Stibbe – review",
        "body":"<p><em>Love, Nina</em> is that old-fashioned thing, a collection of letters. They were written in the 1980s – the last gasp of&nbsp;the post box? – by the young Nina Stibbe while she was nanny to the sons of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/24/marykay-wilmers-interview-nicholas-wroe\">Mary-Kay Wilmers</a>, editor of the London Review of Books. Addressed to her sister Victoria, they fill 300 pages and are unedited except for some \"fine tuning\" of grammar, and removal of a few names \"for obvious reasons\".</p><p>Or so Stibbe tells us in the introduction. It seems, at first, a little hard to believe: not just because Stibbe grew up to be an editor, with fingers surely itching for the delete button; or because the correspondence is one-sided, with Nina's story barely dented by Victoria's; but because the young Nina doesn't write as naive 20-year-olds mostly do, all pomposities and abstractions, but as we would like them to – artlessly, amusingly, transparently, with carelessly perfect dialogue and a fresh eye for detail. Here she is in her very first letter, observing her employer and her children: \"Her and Sam and Will all have the same basin haircut. Apart from that, she's quite fashionable. She swears a lot (f and c if necessary) … The other night (Wilmers's friend) laughed at my ponytail (very short and a bit sticky-out). I told Mary-Kay later 'I saw (that woman) pointing at my ponytail and smirking'. MK said, 'Oh, she's just an idiot and you're more of one for caring'. That's what she's like.\"</p><p>Nina's preoccupations aren't typically adolescent, either: apart from that ponytail and an obsession with shoes, she seems scarcely interested in&nbsp;her appearance; she spends very few sentences on the parents or childhood she presumably shared with \"Vic\", or&nbsp;even on her relationship with her boyfriend. Early on she even seems to hint that the whole thing is a construct: Nina shows \"a semi-autobiographical novel\" to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanbennett\">Alan Bennett</a> (who is Wilmers's friend).</p><blockquote><p>\"AB: I'm not sure what it's about. A&nbsp;bunch of literary types doing laundry and making salad – or something.<br />ME: I think I've given you a letter to my sister by mistake.\"</p></blockquote><p>The \"literary types\" – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/12/in-two-minds-jonathan-miller-review\">Jonathan Miller</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/claire-tomalin\">Claire Tomalin</a>, John Lahr, <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/karl-miller\">Karl Miller</a> and, once, Russell Harty – are the real subject of the letters, trooping over to No 55 to do laundry, lend saws, and fry themselves eggs. The salads, too, recur, with Nina progressing from making a naff Florida one with tinned mandarins – \"Yoghurt or mayonnaise would be better than salad cream,\" says AB, firmly but kindly – to becoming a dab hand with burnt peppers and \"a drop of balsamic\". And&nbsp;yes, \"of course\" as Nina tells her sister, AB \"is the real Alan Bennett\". The portrait of him is particularly endearing: he is generally round in the&nbsp;evening after ringing his special ring, bringing gooseberry pies and \"uninvited milky things\" to dinner parties, and joining the conversations of Nina's young charges with un-self-conscious charm. \"Will: All my friends say she's cross-eyed but I've never noticed. AB: you must be a mouth-looker. We are all either a mouth looker or an eye-looker.\"</p><p>As I read on, though, I became convinced that these really were letters, and Stibbe simply a native genius in the form. The book isn't shapely enough to have been heavily edited – people and plot lines appear abruptly and disappear without explanation, much as they do in life – nor is it sufficiently character-driven. She is concerned with how people appear in the moment, not with creating tension: she feels no need to show AB other than at dinner, giving advice on joints of meat and bicycles; Wilmers's two sons out-smart each other swearily for the entire five years; and \"MK\" moves in the writer's estimation only from \"funny\" to \"100% sane\" to \"marvellous\" (a very Nina word) – though she does sport a few dubious outfits along the way.</p><p>More importantly, Stibbe's character is clearly of a piece with the writing. The qualities that make her such a good writer – the forgetting of the self, the absorption in the present, the intuition and understatement, and that ear for linguistic manners – also allow her to be the perfect nanny to a family where getting the joke seems to count for more than anything else. Nina acquires their brusque ways brilliantly, learning first of all never to say \"Did you have a nice weekend\" (platitudinous) then not bother with \"goodbye\" on the phone to her boyfriend (it's implied), and finally, as she works through an English degree, to deliver her own outrageous literary opinions with aplomb and \"f and c where necessary\". Chaucer: \"Fuck. A whole other language and meant to be hilarious.\" Larkin: \"The mardy opinions of an oddball.\"</p><p>Effortlessly, too, Nina picks up the taboos of a privileged class. Against mentioning money: Nina says \"near the zoo\" for her address and, despite living in central London through the crazed inflationary 80s, not once records the price of anything, or even her own wage. Against class/gender resentments: Nina won't study Women's Literature because she \"can't stand hearing the students rambling on about how unfair everything is/was\". And against hurt feelings: when Nina visits her boyfriend towards the end of the book, she describes having a \"wee in a basin\", and the difficulties of rinsing it, but no details of what seems to be a serious breach. There is, of course, no taboo against the obscene.</p><p>Nina, though, has nerve. In Primrose Hill, she walks round barefoot, literally taking the rough with the smooth: at No 55, in the rapid fire of wit, she makes herself at home. Her letters, and&nbsp;her book, with its direct, almost forceful, intimacy, invite the reader to do the same. Whether you do feel at home, however, may depend on how far you share Nina's robust temperament and capacity for acceptance. If you're the sort of person to worry, for example, that yours might be the kind of lace curtains that everyone laughs at; or that your salad dressings are lower-class; or that your kids can't carry off basin haircuts; or if you are simply tempted to ask how much everything cost, the houses and the \"helpers\", and where does it come from, that sort of money, then you might find it hard to settle in any of the very nice chairs at No 55, even the one with a foot-rest. You might even start to&nbsp;fear that, like Lucas the cat whom everyone hates, or the nanny who briefly replaces Nina while she is at college, \"you are right and wrong in all&nbsp;the wrong places\", and belong, not&nbsp;with the family and their famous guests in the charming basement kitchen, but with the passersby who can be seen on winter evenings, peering curiously in from the dark.</p><p>• Kate Clanchy's novels include <em>Meeting the English</em> (Picador).</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421140846|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|155cd6d77073d47d8dc4964b87677d3696af1278 -->",

        "headline":"The Pure Gold Baby by Margaret Drabble – review",
        "body":"<p>Anna Speight's story is complicated from the start; that's what makes it interesting to the narrator of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/margaret-drabble\" title=\"\">Margaret Drabble</a>'s 17th novel, a deliberately obscured figure about whom we know little for much of the time. Eleanor is not concerned with telling her own tale; the snippets of information she lets fall push us gently towards the assumption of a fairly settled and uneventful life in which even major developments, such as widowhood, unfold relatively naturally and calmly. We know that it can't be quite like this; but we have no option other than to focus our gaze according to the direction of Eleanor's story.</p><p>This is significant in a narrative that consistently prods at the idea of how we know what it is that we are seeing; how we determine the combined effects of historical context and personal circumstance, and how we can weigh out the minute adjustments we need to make as time flows on, subtly altering both us and the objects of our scrutiny.</p><p>Eleanor's account of several decades in the life of her neighbour, Jess, and Jess's daughter Anna are inevitably inflected with her own subjectivity; and yet, borrowing from Jess's anthropological background, Eleanor presents her findings with a measured and studied neutrality. But the urge to fix&nbsp;a&nbsp;life in time and place, to map its contours and diagnose its deficiencies, is not that simple to resist.</p><p>Perhaps that's why, as the book opens, its prose has an almost folkloric quality, as Eleanor describes Jess's early adulthood and the intensity and rapture of her time as a student at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/school-of-oriental-and-african-studies\" title=\"\">School of Oriental and African Studies</a> in London, whether reading late into the night in a Bloomsbury bedsitter or&nbsp;in central Africa, when she sees children with <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922631/\" title=\"\">ectrodactyly</a>, which causes a fusing of fingers and toes and&nbsp;has also been called lobster-claw syndrome. She feels for them a \"proleptic tenderness\", an \"inexplicable joy\" that it later seems to her might in some way have prefigured the birth of her daughter.</p><p>Anna is the result of a secret liaison between Jess and a married Scandinavian professor who quits the scene in haste, but with&nbsp;the decency to leave a little cash behind; enough for Jess to set up home in a slightly shabby part of north London and to be able to muddle along with scraps of freelance work. (In a sub-theme, Drabble demonstrates her abiding interest in the wider external realities that govern and shape people's daily lives; in the decades that Jess, Eleanor and their friends live in the small area between Highbury Barn and Finsbury Park, it undergoes a transformation; by&nbsp;sitting quietly, Eleanor notes, they have all become millionaires.)</p><p>Jess's situation has similarities to&nbsp;that of Rosamund Stacey, the protagonist of&nbsp;Drabble's celebrated 1965 novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/19/book-club-margaret-drabble-millstone\" title=\"\"><em>The&nbsp;Millstone</em></a>; they are both studious, seriously scholarly types who find themselves briefly enthralled by a man and then left holding the baby. In spite of the threat to their academic lives, neither minds; both are also fiercely committed to their daughters. But where Rosamund's Octavia in <em>The Millstone </em>had a congenital heart defect that was addressed by surgery, Anna's condition has far more wide-ranging and long-lasting implications. We discover that she has a developmental problem of no obvious genesis or cause; it fits nothing previously described. It is only sketched in fairly general terms; we gather merely that Anna will always be dependent on her mother or another adult and that there are limitations on what she is able to understand of the world around her and what she can achieve independently. We are told that she has a happy temperament and&nbsp;a great capacity for enjoyment and&nbsp;pleasure, but little about her life or character is likely to change a great deal. This is particularly challenging to the construction and reception of a fictional character; we take for granted our expectations of fiction to present people in flux, and character as unstable and therefore malleable. Because of her timelessness and her lack of agency, Anna exists in the novel as an absent figure, or one largely resistant to our interpretation; somehow permanently beyond us.</p><p>Around her, other characters, plotlines and themes swirl and proliferate. We hear capsule tales of explorers and anthropologists, the most famous of whom is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland-blog/2013/mar/19/scotland-malawi-davidlivingstone\" title=\"\">Livingstone</a>. Back in London, Jess befriends an unhappy poet, who eventually attempts suicide and finds himself, all too briefly, in a residential treatment centre. Visiting him there, Jess meets other broken-down people, including a former nun who suffers terrifying hallucinations and, many years later, haunts the centre's decommissioned and decaying premises. Vogues for the treatment of&nbsp;the mentally ill come under the spotlight; so too do the radical changes&nbsp;in our understanding of genetic inheritance.</p><p>The narrative is unobtrusively anchored in time by mentions of cultural and historical events; we know that Eleanor's circle of mothers (fathers are little mentioned) is most heavily engaged in child-rearing in the 1960s because she notes that none of them had taken <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/thalidomide\" title=\"\">thalidomide</a>, though they knew mothers who had. By the time she closes her narrative – Jess and Anna's story told, with all the digression, happenstance and indeterminacy that characterises real lives – their children have grown, and either begun to make their way or gone spectacularly off the rails. Except for the pure gold baby herself – whose life has remained, in its most fundamental aspects, much the same as it began. But what propulsive instinct, what drive towards the endless reshaping of our lives and our stories, what Livingstone-like, possibly doomed obsession with new horizons, convinces us that this is a bad thing?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421207022|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|ed257aea04122892c3bfb23bb3bcf913cdc6e4e3 -->",

        "headline":"The First Bohemians: Life and Art in London's Golden Age by Vic Gatrell – review",
        "body":"<p>For most of its history, England was something of a cultural backwater. Before 1700, it had to recruit most of its&nbsp;leading artists from abroad, and the market for paintings was limited. By 1800, however, London was one of the centres of the global art world. In particular, the area around Covent Garden had become associated with painters, engravers and printsellers, as&nbsp;much as with writers, actors, rakes, criminals and whores.</p><p>It made for a rambunctious, creative mix. Vic Gatrell would have us believe that the artists of 18th-century Covent Garden formed the world's first \"bohemian\" community; even that this&nbsp;was the most bohemian place the world has ever seen. (Eat your heart out 17th-century Edo, 19th-century Paris, or 20th-century New York.) Luckily, he doesn't worry about substantiating those claims, nor should we: the subject is rich enough as it is.</p><p>Gatrell's book does it justice in all the right ways. It is beautifully produced – from the sumptuous, almost three-dimensional dust jacket to the more than 200 illustrations sprinkled liberally throughout the text. A particular revelation are the delicate drawings and watercolours that Gatrell shows alongside the better-known paintings and mass-produced prints of the period. And the great joy of the book is how effortlessly and continuously his narrative and pictures illuminate one another. On page after page, the images vivify Gatrell's descriptions of people and places, while his commentary invariably deepens our appreciation of&nbsp;the works of art. It is a tour de force of social and pictorial history that few living historians could match.</p><p>He revels in the physical and sensory textures of Covent Garden life. Every revolting sight or smell is held up with relish, a challenge to our effete modern sensibilities. So filthy was the artist <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp06857/george-dawe\" title=\"\">George Dawe</a>, Gatrell lovingly recounts, that friends called him \"the Grub\"; grown men were sent reeling backwards by the force of his body odour.</p><p>Gatrell's argument is that we can only properly appreciate the realism of 18th-century art if we don't flinch from the grottiness in which so many of its creators and subjects lived. But he also rather enjoys the shock value of piss and shit. Barely a few pages into the book, we are forced into an irrelevant and gratuitously lengthy acquaintance with the anal piles of a Jacobean nobleman. Soon after, the author comes enthusiastically to grips with the enormous quantities of horse and&nbsp;human manure deposited in and around London's streets every day. As&nbsp;a pedestrian, you'd be bound frequently to \"splash through sewage and be sickened by stink\". No wonder he admires <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hogarth\" title=\"\">William Hogarth</a>'s \"deft scatology\", or that the <em>The First Bohemians</em> ends with the image of a&nbsp;horde of noxious cats shitting all over&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jmw-turner\" title=\"\">JMW Turner</a>'s pictures. It seems only fitting that the book is bound in brown and yellow covers.</p><p>Though Gatrell may exaggerate the filth, odour and bodily functions for effect, it chimes with a certain kind of robust 18th-century sensibility. As his previous book on sex and satire in Georgian London, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/28/history.art\" title=\"\"><em>City of Laughter</em></a>, showed, historical empathy is part of what makes him such an insightful commentator on the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/may/14/james-gillray-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">James Gillray</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=rowlandson+cartoon&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=fHe&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t_RoUrOON8eX1AXF_4H4Bg&amp;ved=0CC4QsAQ&amp;biw=1489&amp;bih=1027\" title=\"\">Thomas Rowlandson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/05/worship-bacchus-cruikshank-rude-britannia\" title=\"\">George Cruickshank</a>. After all, you can't be bashful if you're going to explain a satirical print that shows the prime minister shafting the English people by shoving a giant enema up their enormous naked bottom.</p><p>The greats get their due here, too.&nbsp;Hogarth is, predictably, a central presence. A wonderful chapter on Rowlandson celebrates his humour and artistic genius. Another portrays Turner, in life if not in art, as the last great Covent Garden artist, and sneers at John Ruskin's \"constipated\" Victorian discomfort over his hero's vulgarity. They are joined by a tribe of lesser-known artists who are brought out of the shadows and juxtaposed with their more famous contemporaries: men such as Louis Philippe Boitard, George Bickham, the Sandby brothers, George Morland and John Raphael Smith. In the footsteps of recent scholars, Gatrell provides a new kind of deeply social and more democratic history of&nbsp;artistic production: a collective biography in which the subjects start out equal (even&nbsp;if some of them turn out to be more equal than others).</p><p>Female artists, alas, are dismissed in a few pages. In other respects, this is a consciously partial account. One would never guess from <em>The First Bohemians</em> that the kinds of humorous and topographical work it concentrates on comprised only a fraction of the output of Covent Garden's artists and printsellers. A swath of pictorial work – landscapes, book illustrations, portraits, advertisements and other commercial and decorative prints –  produced in the&nbsp;capital gets almost no attention. And although Covent Garden was equally a&nbsp;centre of music, drama, fiction and poetry, these other arts are accorded only the occasional glance.</p><p>Instead, the book focuses on celebrating the visual artists of \"real life\", as Gatrell describes them. That is not only an artistic distinction, but also a social and even a political one. He wants to claim that \"they represented what might be called a people's art that stood apart from the sanitised art of the high people\". The fact that many of&nbsp;these supposedly demotic works could only be afforded, or were equally&nbsp;enjoyed, by \"high people\" is conveniently ignored. \"Realism\" here is implacably opposed to classicism, to pretension and to posh people.</p><p>But then, Gatrell never pretends to impartiality. He loves the low, and always prefers it to the high. \"Louche\" for him is a term of approbation; any judgment of \"taste\" or \"vulgarity\" must be a sign of insufferable pretension. In his view civility equals hypocrisy, wealth invariably corrupts and enervates, but poverty breeds energy. As Covent Garden's fortunes declined, we are told, its \"thickening sleaze was more invigorating than its earlier gentility\". Likewise, the world of \"workaday\" painters was obviously \"much more vigorous\" than that of \"society\" painters. Hogarth is honest and energetic, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/aug/16/biography.history\" title=\"\">Joshua Reynolds</a> is merely a toady to the rich – and so on.</p><p>Sometimes such partisanship spills over into the present. Discussing the aristocratic hooligans of the 18th century, Gatrell can't resist a dig at the&nbsp;\"Bullingdon Club's mobsters of recent fame\", and earlier art historians are habitually decried as \"well-bred\" (not good) and short-sighted.</p><p>There's something rather disarming about such feistiness coming from a retired Cambridge professor, but occasionally it lapses into inverted snobbery. By the end of the book, one begins to yearn for some acknowledgment that not all aristocrats of the time were selfish shits, or that beauty and truth might be equally found in all sorts of genres of 18th-century art, including neoclassicist portraiture. Surely one can appreciate Rowlandson without having to denigrate Reynolds?</p><p>Indeed, Gatrell's underlying view of 18th-century society as rigidly divided between the high and the low, polite and impolite, repressed and free is rather overdrawn. As in the case of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/06/ep-thompson-unconventional-historian\" title=\"\">EP Thompson</a>'s work, it is a model that can&nbsp;produce critical insights and brilliant polemic. But nowadays most historians would put more emphasis on the overlaps and interconnections between different ranks and sorts of people in this era.</p><p>Ultimately, though it rests on serious scholarship. <em>The First Bohemians</em> is not meant primarily as a work of argument or analysis. Gatrell isn't much interested in explaining what caused the extraordinary efflorescence of creativity he surveys, nor even in considering the precise relationship between artistic \"realism\" and reality. Though he provides some brief, sharp remarks on&nbsp;such deeper questions, the book is&nbsp;mainly a celebration: a relaxed, confident and triumphantly successful re-creation of a fascinating world of male companionship, drunkenness, poverty, sex and art.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/faramerz-dabhoiwala\" title=\"\">Faramerz Dabhoiwala</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780241955963\" title=\"\"><em>The Origins of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution</em></a> is out in Penguin paperback.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421140406|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|7c965c0c99a6feb168faf6e2d7e342c405d3bb61 -->",

        "headline":"The Mistress Contract by She and He – review",
        "body":"<p>My overarching worry about <em>The Mistress Contract</em> is that the publishers might be prosecuted under some arcane mis-selling legislation. \"Love, like everything else, doesn't come for free. But what price would you pay?\" is the urgent question posed by the cover.</p><p>We are then given the premise – a man (\"He\") and a woman (\"She\") first met \"in graduate school in the 1950s, when they were part of the same group of friends\". They went their separate ways, both got married and had families, before embarking on an affair&nbsp;in the 1970s. \"In 1981, following a phone conversation that had made her unhappy about all of this, she had a bold&nbsp;idea. She sat at her typewriter and&nbsp;created a document she labeled 'CONTRACT'\". It proposed a unique set&nbsp;of terms for their relationship. He would provide her with a home and an&nbsp;income, while she would provide \"mistress services\": \"All sexual acts as&nbsp;requested, with suspension of historical, emotional, psychological disclaimers.\" He was \"delighted to accept her extraordinary terms\".</p><p>Subsequently, they recorded the conversations they had in bed, over dinner, on balconies – and this book is the result. (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/abimorgan\" title=\"\">Abi Morgan</a> has turned it into a play, <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/the-mistress-contract\" title=\"\">which opens</a> at the Royal Court, London, in January.) If it were at all titillating, one would instantly smell a&nbsp;rat; in fact, it is quite meandering and&nbsp;inconclusive enough to be the plausible result of a conversation between two real people.</p><p>One is led to expect a stalls-view on a frank, explicit, mainly sexual, partly financial transaction. I foresaw an unflinching look at what passes between a man and a woman when all&nbsp;the obscuring layers of romance, tact, families, progeny, society, jealousy, projection and emotional investment had been stripped away.</p><p>In fact, the discussion is mainly political, and isn't even terribly personal. The conversations about sex are few and they are not frank; She tells Him, very precisely, why she won't tell him what she likes. \"I've known men who, as soon as they find out that something works, grind away at it the&nbsp;next night, thus arousing in me an almost motherly concern for the pathos of the act.\" But of course, this means she won't tell him what she actually bloody likes, giving the conversation the nebulous, unenlightening atmosphere of one conducted entirely through euphemism, which is what the whole thing was supposed not to be about. He, meanwhile, likes blow jobs, which she doesn't, and this gives rise to the least sexy argument about sex that two human beings could possibly conceive. \"She: I told you last night of one particular occurrence of force used, which floods back on me, and it's hard for me to turn off any of those thoughts. He: You seem to equate the zombie-like response of the stranger in Camus with existentialism, as though that is what existentialism is all about –&nbsp;to be a zombie … You have taken the&nbsp;negation of existentialism as the message, whereas the message is that&nbsp;you have the choice … You have simply fallen into a philosophical misapprehension which comes from lack of intellectual discipline.\"</p><p>(I am going to play fourth wall, here, and translate: \"you can make this pompous rubbish stop if you will please just suck my cock, for the love of God\".) There are things about the dialogue that are endearing; she has a playful bathos: \"I'm curious what happens if you throw into the game an observation which is candid. You get an amazing amount of ripple.\" Ripple is a slang word with almost endless meanings, from the straightforward \"nipple\" and&nbsp;\"cripple\" to more abstruse sexual practices (you'll have to look it up); the most likely meaning here, though, is \"women\". He has an intense, rule-based curiosity: \"You would indicate displeasure when something occurred that you didn't like, and sometimes you&nbsp;would indicate pleasure when something occurred that you did like, but because of the basic perversity of your nature, one could never learn from that.\" I began to find his frustration at life's lack of a formula rather winning.</p><p>The novel casting a shadow over this enterprise is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philiproth\" title=\"\">Philip Roth</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/11/specials/roth-deception.html\" title=\"\"><em>Deception </em>(1990)</a>, in which a fictional man and&nbsp;his&nbsp;fictional mistress have exactly these conversations (the shadow cast is for the reader – there is no suggestion that the project mimicked Roth's). \"'Which do you prefer?' 'For fondling, the uncircumcised. It's interesting to move the sheath over the head.' 'And for fucking?' 'You can't ask this of a nicely brought-up English female.' 'For fucking.' 'The circumcised.' 'Why?' 'I like having it naked.' 'The naked penis.' 'I guess.'\" The real life counterparts lack this brevity and openness, but also the elliptical poetry. A conversation between two people who can keep up with each other is beautiful in itself; it is like watching running deer.</p><p>That other part of the equation, the money, is mentioned only in the most tasteful, fleeting ways, which I also felt&nbsp;a little short-changed by, since this taboo – it is payment for sex, whichever way you cut it – is as great as any about sensuality. She is intensely political, has read the major works of the day, and has originality. \"There is a sense in which all of feminism is a fury at being asked to measure up to, conform to, male sexuality. It comes up again and again in what they write. When I believe they're talking about politics or rights, back they hop to this prior resentment.\" But her ideas seem to exist in a bell jar, away from the rest of her life. She describes how, before she married, she gave no thought to how she wanted to support herself – she just wanted not to be supported by her father, to carry on studying. It is a sort of precocious but ultimately infantile comportment, in which the crucial feeling about patriarchal control is not to overturn it&nbsp;but to resent it. He, meanwhile, says he'd like to see feminism \"be at least as good as Freudianism, which I think has been pretty bad. Primarily, it has caused trouble with you. It's confused you and caused you to be strident and behave in ways that you don't really want to behave.\" It is hard to really invest in these sections of the dialogue, when one person is so much more advanced into the territory than the other.</p><p>What I found most interesting, most inky, was an almost throwaway remark he makes about her depression: \"you were a better screw when you were depressed than any other time because you were so absolutely open, yielding, accepting. You were earth-body.\" She&nbsp;doesn't pick it up, preferring to interpret it as each offering support to the other's suffering. But he keeps on. \"I don't think it speaks well for either of&nbsp;our characters. It's the vulture part of our natures.\" More like that, I thought. Less abstraction, less obfuscation, more detail, more unpalatable honesty.</p><p>They are still together, living in separate houses in a west-coast American city. She is 88 and he is 93. So obviously, from their point of view, these levels of abstraction and detail are working just fine.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421375182|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|67dc1fb5f35fb359221df32890a5a9a15b9496f0 -->",
