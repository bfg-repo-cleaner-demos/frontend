        "body":"<h2>Grand Canyon national park</h2><p>Other canyons on earth are longer and wider (Australia's Capertee Valley is both) and deeper (Kali Gandaki Gorge&nbsp;in&nbsp;Nepal), but none is as famous as the Grand Canyon, with its intricate layering, maze-like side canyons, vivid colours and epic visual scale. It's 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide and over a mile deep, cutting&nbsp;down through more than two billion years of geologic time, exposing some of the oldest rocks on earth.</p><p>To visit the Grand Canyon, in north-west Arizona, choose between the more developed South Rim, which is open year-round, and has drive-up overlooks, museums and mule rides, or the more secluded North Rim, which is higher in elevation and closed to vehicles from mid-October until mid-May because of the snow (skiers and snowshoers are welcome). The average distance across the canyon is only 10 miles, but there are no bridges for cars and the 215-mile drive from one rim to the other takes five hours. Both rims offer lodging and camping options, as well as a selection of trails descending into the canyon. Or you see it from a rafting expedition down the Colorado river.</p><p><strong>Top tips</strong> Standing on the edge of either rim is awe-inspiring, but nothing beats actually getting down in the canyon. Do not attempt to hike from the rim to the Colorado river and back in one day! To spend the night in the canyon, you need backcountry hiking and camping permits. Or book a mule ride to <a href=\"http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/phantom-ranch-704.html\" title=\"\">Phantom Ranch</a>, one of the most remote lodges in the national park system. Summer temperatures can be sweltering in the canyon. Winter is often the best season for hiking, though backpackers should be prepared for snow and ice. <br /><strong>Useful links</strong> <a href=\"https://www.grandcanyon.org/\" title=\"\"><em>The Grand Canyon Association</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\"><em>accommodation</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/backcountry.htm\" title=\"\"><em>hiking</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/mule_trips.htm\" title=\"\"><em>mule trips</em></a></p><h2>Vermilion Cliffs national monument</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255919'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382009906895/The-Wave-at-Vermilion-Cli-008.jpg' alt='The Wave at Vermilion Cliffs, Arizona ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Wave at Vermilion Cliffs, Arizona  Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>If you're visiting the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, make time for a detour to these little-known but spectacular cliffs on the Utah border, near the town of Page The 1,000m cliffs plunge down from the Paria plateau, one of the grandest wildernesses in the country.</p><p>There are few trails and no roads in this remote, rugged landscape, but it's not inaccessible: the area has been inhabited for more than 12,000 years, as evidenced by the ruins and petroglyphs found throughout the plateau. To experience this incredible area on foot, you'll need some luck in the backcountry permit lottery and some serious wilderness knowhow.</p><p>Less wilderness-savvy visitors can settle for crossing the stunning Navajo Bridge, which links the North and South Rims of the Grand Canyon, east of Grand Canyon national park. The drive along Alt 89, a paved scenic road, from Navajo Bridge to the North Rim Village, skirts the base of the Vermilion Cliffs.</p><p><strong>Top tip</strong> The Wave, in the Coyote Buttes North region of the Paria Canyon-Vermillion Wilderness, could be the single most psychedelically spectacular rock formation in the country. Only 20 permits a day are given out for access to The Wave. Half are available through an online lottery and half from the visitor centre at Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument in Kanab, Utah, just over the state line from Fredonia. <br /><strong>Useful links</strong><a href=\"http://www.vermilioncliffs.com/\" title=\"\"> <em>Vemilion Cliffs website</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/az/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/natmon/vermilion.html\" title=\"\"><em>wilderness permits</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/az/st/en/arolrsmain/paria/coyote_buttes/permits.html\" title=\"\"><em>Wave permits</em></a><em> </em></p><h2>Wupatki and Sunset Crater national monuments</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255920'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010306601/Wupatki-ancien-ruins-in-A-016.jpg' alt='Wupatki ancien ruins in Arizona ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Wupatki ancien ruins in Arizona  Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Southern Arizona is the more populous part of the state today, but historically more people lived in the north-central plateau. Home to the ancient Pueblo people (formerly known as the Anasazi) Wupatki national monument, north of Flagstaff, has the ruins of five pueblos, built from slabs of the region's brick-red Moenkopi sandstone.</p><p>Most of the large pueblos at Wupatki were constructed after the violent eruption of the nearby Sunset Crater volcano, in around 1085. Ash was spread over 800 square miles of land, forcing the temporary evacuation of the region. But the ash also  improved the soil for farming and Wupatki's pueblos flourished by 1100. Today, Sunset Crater national monument protects the massive cinder cone volcano and the surrounding lavascapes.</p><p>The five largest pueblos at Wupatki can be visited in a day and make for a nice trip from Flagstaff or a scenic detour on the way to the Grand Canyon. Camping is available at Sunset Crater national monument. The Wupatki visitor centre provides trail guides.</p><p><strong>Top tip </strong>The Wukoki pueblo is a little further off the main road than the other pueblos, but its castle-like stance atop a large rock outcrop makes it the most dramatic. <br /><strong>Useful links</strong> <a href=\" http://www.nps.gov/wupa/index.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Wupatki national monument</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\" http://www.nps.gov/sucr/index.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Sunset Crater National Monument</em></a></p><h2>Montezuma's Castle national monument</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255921'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010527812/Montezumas-Castle-Arizona-032.jpg' alt='Montezuma's Castle, Arizona' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Montezuma's Castle, Arizona Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Montezuma's Castle has nothing to do with Montezuma, the Aztec emperor who reigned in Mexico long after these cliffside ruins were abandoned. The misnomer was coined by white explorers who rediscovered the ruins in 1860 and reasoned that the spectacular place must have been built for a king.</p><p>This cliffside complex, one of the largest and best-preserved cliff dwellings in North America, was actually built around AD700 by the Sinagua people and abandoned in 1485, probably after a long period of drought. The 20-room dwelling, which was more of an apartment complex reached by ladders than a fortress, probably housed about 50 people.</p><p>An easy paved trail leads out to the ruins. Accessing the ruins via ladders has been banned since 1951, and there are no camping or lodging facilities within the park, but accommodation ranging from primitive campsites to upscale luxury hotels can be found in the surrounding Coconino national forest and nearby Sedona and Flagstaff.</p><p><strong>Top tip </strong>Skip Interstate 17 in favour of the scenic route Alt-89 to Montezuma's Castle through Sedona's spectacular red-rock country. <br /><strong>Useful links</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/moca/index.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Montezuma's Castle website</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.visitsedona.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Sedona lodging</em></a></p><h2>Walnut Canyon national  monument<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255922'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010809090/Cliff-dwellings-at-Walnut-008.jpg' alt='Cliff dwellings at Walnut Canyon, Arizona' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Cliff dwellings at Walnut Canyon, Arizona Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>With its deep, sinuous curves through striking white Kaibab limestone, Walnut Canyon would be an attraction in itself, even without its numerous cliff dwellings. More than 80 single-family homes are found tucked into natural limestone overhangs in this canyon, just 10 miles east of Flagstaff.</p><p>The small rooms, just big enough to cook and sleep in, were built between 1125 and 1250 by the Sinagua people, who also constructed the distinctly different Montezuma's Castle, about 30 miles south. The site was abandoned possibly due to drought or tribal warfare.</p><p>Many of the structures in Walnut Canyon can be visited along a paved one-mile loop trail that descends 55m from the visitor centre on the rim.</p><p>There are no camping or lodging facilities within the park, but camping is available in the surrounding Kaibab and Coconino national forests and hotels abound in nearby Flagstaff.</p><p><strong>Top tip</strong> The<a href=\"http://www.grandcanyonhostel.com/GCindex.htm\" title=\"\"> Grand Canyon International Hostel</a> in Flagstaff provides cheap bunks and private rooms to travellers of all ages, as well as shuttle services to the Grand Canyon, Walnut Canyon and other nearby attractions. <br /><strong>Useful link</strong> <a href=\"http://www.americansouthwest.net/arizona/walnut_canyon/national_monument.html\" title=\"\"><em>americansouthwest.net/arizona/walnut_canyon/national_monument.html</em></a></p><h2>Meteor Crater national natural landmark </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255923'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010470338/Meteor-Crater-near-Winslo-008.jpg' alt='Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Around 50,000 years ago, when woolly mammoths and giant ground sloths roamed eastern Arizona, an iron-nickel meteor the size of three school buses streaked across the sky and slammed into the earth with a force greater than 10 megatonnes of TNT. The impact left a massive circular hole in the earth's crust, just off the interstate near Winslow. It's a mile across, 2.4 miles in circumference and about 170m deep – and now known as one of the world's best-preserved examples of a meteor crater.</p><p>Meteor Crater is actually privately owned, but it's open to the public and recognised as a national natural landmark. A well-appointed visitor centre displays copious information about how the crater was formed and its long road to recognition as a meteor crater, as opposed to a volcanic feature. RV and tent camping is also available on site, or down the road at<a href=\"http://azstateparks.com/Parks/HORU/\" title=\"\"> Homolovi state park</a>.</p><p><strong>Top tip </strong>Visitors are no longer allowed to hike down into the crater, but you can join one of the guided tours that explores its rim. <br /><strong>• Useful link</strong> <a href=\"http://www.meteorcrater.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Meteor Crater website</em></a>/</p><h2>Canyon De Chelly national monument</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255924'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010537131/Canyon-de-Chelly-Arizona--008.jpg' alt='Canyon de Chelly, Arizona ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Canyon de Chelly Arizona, the Spider Rock overlook Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Canyon De Chelly is a sacred place. Carved into the sandstone bedrock of north-eastern Arizona, near Chinle, the three spectacular canyons,&nbsp;De Chelly, Del Muerto, and Monument, lie at the centre of the Navajo Nation and at the heart of many native legends.</p><p>These canyons have been occupied for thousands of years, more continuously than anywhere else in North America; the Ancestral Puebloans, Anasazi, Hopi and Navajo have all called this place home. Today, Canyon De Chelly is operated as a national monument on Navajo Tribal Trust Land, the only national monument not owned by the federal government.</p><p>Because the Navajo people still call Canyon De Chelly (pronounced de-shay) home, visitors are restricted from exploring without a native guide. Unaccompanied visitors can follow the scenic North and South Rim drives, with overlooks along the lengths of the canyons, including at Spider Rock, an iconic sandstone spire that towers 230m above the canyon floor.</p><p>To see more, you'll need to hire a native guide to escort you on either foot, 4x4 or horseback. Book your tour ahead of time or stop by the visitor centre for recommendations. Tent and RV camping is available at the Cottonwood campsite.</p><p><strong>Top tip </strong>You don't need a guide to hike down to the White House Ruins, a three-mile circular trek that drops 150m down into the canyon. The trail begins six miles east of the visitor centre along the South Rim drive. Remember, as with all canyons, hiking down is optional; getting back up is mandatory! <br /><strong>Useful links</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cach/index.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Canyon De Chelly website</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cach/planyourvisit/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageID=632254\" title=\"\"><em>tour information</em></a><br /><em> </em><strong>NPS-approved tour companies:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.footpathjourneys.com/\" title=\"\"><em>footpathjourneys.com</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://canyondechellytours.com\" title=\"\"><em>canyondechellytours.com</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://canyondechellytours.com\" title=\"\"><em>canyondechelly.net</em></a></p><h2>Monument Valley Navajo tribal park </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255925'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010783628/Monument-Valley-Navajo-Tr-008.jpg' alt='Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, Arizona/Utah ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, Arizona/Utah, USA Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Monument Valley has long been used as a dramatic backdrop for Hollywood westerns, but the even biggest movie screens don't do justice to this incredible landscape in north-east Arizona. Monument Valley is named for the dozens of free-standing sandstone buttes and monoliths that tower above the sweeping sagebrush landscape. Bridging the state line between Arizona and Utah, the formations serve as a fitting gateway to south-east Utah's famous red-rock country.</p><p>The land is held by the Navajo people, and visitors must pay an access fee to drive through the tribal park on a 17-mile dirt loop, which is suitable for all cars when dry but impassable after a storm ( usually in late summer). Tours to other areas, such as Mystery Valley and Hunts Mesa, can be arranged at the visitor centre, off Highway 163. There is no camping within the park itself, but many opportunities can be found to the north and south. <br /><strong>Top tip </strong>Be sure to get out of the car and experience some this wide-open landscape on foot via the 3.2-mile Wildcat trail, around the West Mitten butte. It's self-guided and open to the public. Other access to tribal land requires permits and/or guides. <br /><strong>Useful link </strong><a href=\" http://navajonationparks.org/htm/monumentvalley.htm\" title=\"\"><strong> </strong>navajonationparks.org </a></p><h2>Petrified Forest national park</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255926'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010598210/Petrified-Forest-National-008.jpg' alt='Petrified Forest National Park, Badlands, Arizona' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Petrified Forest National Park, Badlands, Arizona Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Back when dinosaurs ruled the earth, what is now eastern Arizona was a humid, subtropical rainforest. Evidence of the arid desert's greener past is preserved in an astonishing collection of petrified trees within this national park.</p><p>During the Late Triassic period, fallen trees were buried by sediment with a high content of volcanic ash. Over the years, quartz crystals gradually replaced the organic wood matter, petrifying the trees. The high quartz content makes the petrified wood very hard: it can only be cut by a diamond-tipped saw.</p><p>The national park is also known for its fossils (plants dating back 225m years, reptiles and dinosaurs) and a colourful landscape known as the Painted Desert. The park is bisected by interstate 40, making for a convenient rest stop 50 miles west of the New Mexican border. There are no developed camping or lodging facilities within the park.</p><p><strong>Top tip</strong> Visit the Rainbow Forest Museum and pick up a trail guide for the ½-mile Giant Logs trail, which features some of the largest and best-preserved petrified trees in the park. Remember: removal of petrified wood or other material is strictly prohibited by federal law!<br /><strong>Useful links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/pefo/planyourvisit/trails.htm\" title=\"\"><em>hiking trails</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.arizonaguide.com/places-to-visit/arizona-parks-monuments/petrified-forest-national-park\" title=\"\"><em>nearby lodging and attractions </em></a></p><h2>Saguaro national park</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255927'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010656322/Saguaro-National-Park-Ari-008.jpg' alt='Saguaro National Park, Arizona, USA' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Saguaro National Park, Arizona, USA Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Few symbols of the south-west are as distinctive as the towering silhouette of a saguaro cactus. But despite their ubiquity on license plates and T-shirts, saguaros are only found within a small slice of southern Arizona. Hundreds of these sentinels, up to 15m tall, are protected within the bounds of Saguaro national park, on the outskirts of Tucson.</p><p>Saguaros need all the protection they can get. The giant cactuses can live over 250 years  and weigh several tonnes, but their single trunk and relatively soft flesh make them vulnerable to vandalism. In Arizona, harming a saguaro in any way is illegal, with serious consequences such as hefty fines and even jail.</p><p>Saguaro national park is split into two districts, west and east of Tucson. More than 150 miles of well-maintained and marked trails wind through the park. Summer temperatures can be deadly, so aim for mornings and evenings in autumn, winter and spring. There are no developed campsites in the park, but walk-in backcountry camping is allowed and a wide range of accommodation can be found in Tucson and surrounding areas.</p><p><strong>Top tip</strong> Plan to visit in late May or early June, when the Saguaros are blooming with huge white waxy flowers. The nectar  attracts all manner of wildlife, including many species of bat and bird. <br /><strong>Useful links</strong><em> </em><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/sagu/planyourvisit/saguaro_hiking.htm,\" title=\"\"><em>hiking</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/sagu/camping-in-saguaro-wilderness-area.htm\" title=\"\"><em>backcountry camping</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.saguaro.national-park.com/camping.htm\" title=\"\"><em>more camping options</em></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theblondecoyote.com.\" title=\"\"><strong>Mary Caperton Morton</strong></a><strong> is a freelance writer and photographer who makes her home on the back roads of North America, living and working out of a tiny solar-powered Teardrop camper</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420249018|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|fcfc277f97ff6e71f21f8b45fdaebc7e2445a748 -->",

        "body":"<p>Do you have a favourite hotel booking site? Or do you end up flipping between various operators? Many of the big players seem to blur into one after a while.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.Top10.com\">Top10.com</a> is the latest comparison site, and aims to save you trawling the net by aggregating all the best deals into one place. It searches through Booking.com, Lastminute.com, LateRooms.com and Expedia, among others, to bring users a customised top 10 of suitable accommodation, according to  your requirements (pool, pet friendly, Wi-Fi, central location etc).</p><p>Having trialled in beta mode since the beginning of the year, it launched officially last week and, given that it comes from the same stable as broadband and mobile price comparison site USwitch.com, it has the potential to make more of splash than many of its rivals. A TV campaign has already launched – something very few start-ups can emulate – and it has funding from some high-flying technology investors, including Accel Partners, early investors in Facebook.</p><p>Though not ground-breaking in its approach, it stands out for its clarity. And there are no adverts or other distractions, as its revenue model is entirely commission-based. The site is UK-based, but lists hotels worldwide.</p><h2>Other hotel-booking sites worth bookmarking</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.hoteltonight.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>HotelTonight</strong></a><strong>: </strong>This is an app, not a website, but it's well worth downloading – especially if you are a last-minute, disorganised or spontaneous traveller. As the name suggests, it helps you find same-day hotels, after rates have been slashed to prevent them sitting empty, and you can book up until 2am in your chosen location. A sample deal in New York is hip boutique hotel 60 Thompson, from $255 down to $189. <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/\">Tripadvisor</a> has also just launched a price comparison and booking tool, <a href=\"http://skift.com/2013/10/16/tripadvisors-new-program-launch-will-bring-in-small-hotels-like-never-before/\">TripConnect</a>, which is expected to bring in more small independent hotels and B&amp;Bs, and Hong Kong-based <a href=\"http://www.hotelquickly.com/\" title=\"\">HotelQuickly </a> – which is better on south-east Asia and Australasia – is also trying to muscle in on this market, but it will be a tough fight as HotelTonight has just raised another $45m in funding.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.between9and5.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Between9and5.com</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you find yourself stuck between time zones or on an awkward stopover for several hours, you might want to catch up on some sleep with a hotel day room. Plenty of airport hotels around the world are covered and you typically have to check out by 7pm. It's another great site for last-minute merchants as you can cancel without incurring fees, and payment is processed at the hotel, so you don't have to input all your details on the site.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420159693|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|fd329e4ce62709508fa9806da5b5ac101d2e5bbe -->",

        "body":"<h2>Contemporâneo Hostel, Botafogo</h2><p>This small boutique hostel, which opened in December 2012, has been aptly named: it is done out with Brazilian designer furniture, including Latoog hanging chairs (which you won't want to get out of), and artwork from the local art school adorns the walls. High-ceilinged dorms sleep four to nine guests and there are private doubles, the largest on the third floor, and on the ground floor a small double is adapted for wheelchair access. For a hostel it attracts older, thirtysomething travellers. Breakfast is served in the patio area, where a large metal shipping container has been adapted into a trendy bar. Guests have access to the kitchen, free Wi-Fi, lockers and a library.<br /><em>• Rua Bambini 158, +55 21 3495 1027, </em><a href=\"http://contemporaneohostel.com.br/site/english/\" title=\"\"><em>contemporaneohostel.com.br</em></a><em>.

The long breakfast bar doubles as a cocktail bar in the evening, serving drinks and snacks to cool sounds. Situated on a busy road, the building is set back from the entrance, which helps reduce the road traffic noise. There are dorms for six to 14 people, plus six suites, each uniquely designed. The staff at can arrange tours to the Dona Marta favela, football games, samba schools and Brazilian funk nights in Rocinha. Oztel is close to bars and restaurants,  but you'll need to hop on a bus to get to the beach – in 15 to 20 minutes you'll be in Ipanema or Copacabana or, in the other direction, the city centre. <br /><em>• Rua Pinheiro Guimarães 91,+55 21 3042 1853, </em><a href=\"http://www.oztel.com.br/site.php?idPagina=2\" title=\"\"><em>oztel.com.br</em></a><em>.

Walking into the reception you're met with a wall of ideas about what to do in the city, from hang-gliding to a football match and a favela party with pick-up at 11pm. The place feels young, with a a trendy  bar and lounge area doubling up as the breakfast room. Accommodation ranges from four small suites, with double beds and private bathroom, to colourful dormitory rooms for up to nine people with capsule-style bunk beds (dorms are either female-only or mixed, all have air con). Breakfast, Wi-Fi and private lockers are included in the daily rate. The hostel makes you feel part of the local way of life, providing skateboards, beach umbrellas, and bats and balls to take to the beach. <br />• <em>Rua General San Martin 1212, +55 21 3593 2386, </em><a href=\"http://z.brahostel.com/z/Pages/Site/\" title=\"\"><em>z.brahostel.com</em></a><em>.

The hostel is a 15-minutes walk to the beach, 15 minutes to the Lagoa (or lake) at the foot of the Christ statue, and the same again to neighbouring Ipanema. The hostel has an air of calm and the decor is contemporary, with a mix of natural colours, parquet floors and simple wooden furniture. A relaxing lounge and breakfast area with comfy sofas opens on to a small patio. The accommodation is simple and clean; five suites with double beds and private bathrooms. Dorms house between four and 12 people, with wooden bunks and private lockers. Wi-Fi is free, and guests have access to the laundry room and fully equipped kitchen. <br /><em>• Rua Dias Ferreira 636, + 55 21 2137 0090, </em><a href=\"http://www.leblonspot.com/home_en\" title=\"\"><em>leblonspot.com</em></a><em>.

Situated high up in the hills of the residential Gavea neighbourhood, La Maison is a quiet and relaxing retreat, away from the tourist areas. The first-floor lounge is decorated in plush deep pink, with a mix of contemporary and neoclassical decor, and an antique dining table and chandelier. A large second-floor lounge, in cool colours and with classic Panton designer chairs, opens on to the deck area with sun loungers and a swimming pool. It feels like you are staying in a friend's designer home. You'll need to taxi in and out at night time, but by swapping a touristy location for Gavea's hills, you'll get a lot more hotel for your money, and a cool place to relax, especially at the height of the Brazilian summer.  <br />• <em>Rua Sergio Porto 58, +55 21 3205 3585, l</em><a href=\"http://www.lamaisonario.com/en-house1.html\" title=\"\"><em>amaisonario.com</em></a><em>.

It is also the city's arty, bohemian quarter and one of the best ways to appreciate this is to stay in the house of a local artist. Cama é Cafe (a literal translation of bed and breakfast) is run by young entrepreneurs who put you in touch with homeowners, many of them local artists, renting out their spare rooms. There are over 40 homes on the books, including many colonial houses. The standard varies from modest to lavish – choose carefully and you could be staying in an antique-filled room with your host's paintings on the walls, and breakfasting on the veranda of a tropical garden. The company also offers tours of the area and a discount scheme in local establishments. There are some cracking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/feb/10/best-bars-rio-de-janeiro\" title=\"\">neighbourhood bars in the area</a>, too. If you go out in town always get a taxi back up the hill at night. Don't try to book with C&amp;C for the World Cup though, a German operator block-booked all the network's houses for the duration of the tournament back in 2010!<br />• <a href=\"http://www.camaecafe.com.br\" title=\"\"><em>camaecafe.com.br</em></a><em>.

The blend of modern interior design and an old colonial building makes for a strikingly impressive hotel. There are eight suites, some with a four-poster beds or a private veranda overlooking the garden-and-city view. Designer decor and quality linens make for a comfortable stay at a reasonable price. Relax in the garden or enjoy a caipirinha by the pool. Friendly staff and the healthy tropical breakfast are a plus. Neighbouring restaurant Espirito Santa serves typical Amazonian fare, including piranha fish. Also close by is Aprazivel, a popular upmarket Brazilian restaurant set in an impressively romantic setting , where you can dine surrounded by banana plants, wooden huts and a tree house. Always get a taxi back up the hill to the hotel at night.<br /><em>• Rua Almirante Alexandrino 256, Santa Teresa, +55 21 3253 1021, </em><a href=\"http://www.quintaazul.com/\" title=\"\"><em>quintaazul.com.</em></a> <em>Doubles from £90 to £130 B&amp;B</em></p><h2>Casa Mosquito, Ipanema</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420131703'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/16/1381916045566/Casa-Mosquito-008.jpg' alt='Casa Mosquito' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>This late 1940s colonial house nestled high up the mountain between Ipanema and Copacabana offers a relaxing and stylish retreat away from the tourist hubbub. A mix of 50s antique furniture and contemporary decor complements the neoclassic lounge, which is filled with fresh tropical flowers. Enjoy sunset with a caipirinha on the terrace, looking out towards the bays of Ipanema and Copacabana and across to the neighbouring favela Cantagalo-Pavão-Pavãozinho. Expect a soundtrack of music in the evening, the obligatory dog barking and church song. Four individually decorated suites named after famous Brazilians are embellished with stylish Brazilian paintings. Sit back on your private veranda and take in either Sugar Loaf mountain, from Tom Jobim and Madame Sata suites, or the forest from Pixinguinha and Heitor Villa-Lobos suites. From March 2014, six additional suites, a roof top pool and panoramic bar will be inaugurated. <br /><em>• Rua Saint Roman 222, Ipanema, +55 21 3586 5042, <a href=\"http://www.casamosquito.com\">casamosquito.com</a>.

The Man in Rio concierge services offers a wide portfolio of private accommodation, ranging from beach houses and out-of-city country farms to penthouses and studio apartments in Copacabana and Ipanema. It's an ideal option for single travellers, family or friends looking for a cost-effective alternative to Rio's often overpriced hotels. <a href=\"http://maninrio.com/product/boutique-1-studio-apartment-for-rent-rio-ipanema\" title=\"\">A stylish studio apartment in Ipanema</a>, designed by local Brazilian architect and just two blocks from the beach, costs  from £85 per night.

Bonita is an upgrade on the many hostels nearby. Situated in the heart of Ipanema, just three blocks from the beach and one from the metro station, this colourful pousada/hostel is lively, with a large patio area, bar and TV lounge that are perfect stomping grounds for travellers to hook up with new and old friends. But perhaps it's not the best choice if you are looking to kick back and relax with a book. Bonita offers reasonable prices for one of Rio's most expensive tourist areas. Rooms are simply decorated with no extra trimmings or designer fittings. There are dorms with six beds, single, double or quadruple rooms with or without private bath.  You can book trips here to favelas, sky-diving, the Maracana stadium and Buzios.<br /><em>• Rua Barão da Torre 107, Ipanema, +55 21 2227 1703, </em><a href=\"http://www.bonitaipanema.com/\" title=\"\"><em>bonitaipanema.com</em></a><em>.

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.elizabethdanielsphotography.com\"></a><a href=\"http://www.elizabethdanielsphotography.com\"></a></p><h2>Magic Restroom Cafe, Los Angeles</h2><p>The idea of sitting on a toilet in public is the stuff of nightmares but that hasn't stopped the Magic Restroom making loos the focus of its new themed restaurant in LA. In fact toilet-themed restaurants are nothing new – <a href=\"http://www.moderntoilet.com.tw/en/about.asp\">Taiwans' Modern Toilet </a>where chocolate ice-cream is served in toilet-shaped dishes is well-documented. Inspired by its success Magic Restroom owner YoYo Li has introduced toilets as seats and a mix of Asian and western food – like zha jiang mian, named \"constipation\" on the menu, braised pork over rice, (\"smells-like-poop\"), and sundaes (choose from chocolate \"black poop\" or the vanilla-strawberry sundae \"bloody number two\") served, of course, in miniature toilet bowls. Revolting and distrubing in equal measure. Freud would have a field day.  <br /><strong>Isabel Choat </strong></p><h2>Twin Stars Diner, Moscow</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115432'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381915251383/Twin-Stars-restaurant-Mos-001.jpg' alt='Twin Stars restaurant, Moscow' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Reuters TV / Reuters/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to stand out in a city that loves extreme dining, whether it involves vines and amphorae, (<a href=\"http://tiflis.ru/\" title=\"\">Tiflis</a>, the Russian word for the Georgian capital, Tbilisi), moving trams (<a href=\"http://tramvay-annushka.ru/\" title=\"\">Annushka</a>), live goats (<a href=\"http://www.shinok.ru/\" title=\"\">Shinok</a>), or waterfalls (<a href=\"http://www.blueelephant.com/moscow/\" title=\"\">Blue Elephant</a>) – but Alexei Khodorkovsky has managed to find a new niche, with the opening of his twin-themed restaurant. At the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBelvwDgtxw\">Twin Stars diner in Moscow</a>, all the staff – from waiters to bartenders and even the chefs – are identically-dressed twins. The creepy concept is inspired by a 1964 Soviet film in which a girl winds up in an alternate reality and confronts her twin. Khodorkovsky says it's been hard to find suitably qualifed twins but the concept is paying off - the 24-hour restaurant is a hit with locals who don't seem bothered about the issue of whether or not to tip twice. </p><p>If Twin Stars represents the new Russia with its modern, funky design, the Expedicia is more traditional Russia - appealing, one imagines, to chest-beating Putin types with a love of the outdoors.  In the pricey, survival-themed Expeditsia (\"expedition\") restaurant you eat between an orange helicopter parked in the pine trees and a stuffed polar bear scratching itself by a stream.</p><p>Guests can sprawl on the roof garden lawn or be beaten with birch twigs in the Siberian banya. Ingredients such as wild duck, fresh berries and mountain honey are flown in from the far north and east of Russia, and delicacies include elk in aspic, smoked venison, sea urchin and sturgeon, served with vodka, sea buckthorn juice or Baikal mineral water. Expect to pay around 1,500 roubles (£30) for a main course; a shot of vodka will set you back around £5 and a fresh juice £9. <br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://expedicia.ru/en/home/gastronomy.html\" title=\"\"><em>expedicia.ru</em></a><br /><strong>Phoebe Taplin and Isabel Choat</strong></p><h2>Carton King, Taichung City, Taiwan</h2><p>Taiwan has a penchant for themed absurdity when it comes to eating out. Whether for Japanese assassins lurking in the rafters at <a href=\"http://www.ninja-tw.com/cetacean/front/bin/home.phtml\" title=\"\">Ninja</a> or the drinks served in specimen bottles to wash down one's turd-shaped bread at the aforementioned Modern Toilet, the food is rarely the primary draw. And so it is with Carton King, a restaurant whose owner was so depressed by the preponderance of plastic in modern life he built an eatery which, instead, promotes the virtues of corrugated cardboard. From the chairs to the plates and even the walls – the whole place is bedecked in the brown stuff. The food, although not fine dining, was more than edible and all that remained of our stewed pork ribs and herb-roasted chicken was the odd greasy smear on our cardboard table. Definitely worth a visit … just remember to leave your lighter at home.<br /><strong>Mark Pygott</strong></p><h2>Barbie restaurant, Taipei, Taiwan</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115433'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381915386470/Barbie-restaurant-Taipei-001.jpg' alt='Barbie restaurant, Taipei' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: David Chang/DAVID CHANG/epa/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>The Far East's love of all things cute and fluffy is well known; whether it's actual, real-life cuteness in the shape of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/video/2012/feb/03/tokyo-cat-cafe-video\" title=\"\">Tokyo's cat cafes</a>, where pet-less Tokyoites go to stroke and play with cats and kittens, or the <a href=\"http://www.hellokitty.com/\" title=\"\">Hello Kitty</a> phenomenon in Seoul. So the only surprise about Taipei's Barbie restaurant is that it took so long for someone to come up with the idea. It is staffed by waitresses in bright pink tops, tutus and tiaras, while the chairs are dressed in tutus and there's enough pink food to sink a Barbie cruise ship. <br /><strong>IC</strong></p><h2>Le Refuge des Fondues, Paris</h2><p>Why, when in Paris, a city full of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-paris-restaurants-dining\">great restaurants</a>, you would choose to go for a fondue is anyone's guess but tucking into the Swiss dish is not the oddest thing about Le Refuge des Fondues in Monmatre. The real weirdness begins when you order your wine – and it's brought to you in a baby's bottle, apparently a ruse to avoid French tax on wine served in proper glasses. Gooey cheese and drinking out of a teat – it's not somewhere you'd want to go on a first date, but it's been pulling in the tourist crowds for decades. <br /> <em>• 17 Rue des 3 Frères </em><br /><strong>IC</strong></p><h2>The Royal Dragon, Bangkok, Thailand</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115434'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/15/1381827324445/The-Royal-Dragon-Bangkok--001.jpg' alt='The Royal Dragon, Bangkok, Thailand' width='460' height='336' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>If you think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/30/britains-biggest-restaurant-opens\" title=\"\">Britain's biggest restaurant</a>, serving 2,000 diners a day, is massive, think again. Bangkok's Royal Dragon is monumental. The colossal seafood place sprawls across 8.35 acres, has 1,000 staff, and requires 540 costumed waiters on roller skates to serve some 5,000 customers. And while it boasts the largest collection of live seafood tanks and 1,000 pan-Asian dishes, diners don't come for the food. It's all about the spectacle: traditional Thai and Chinese music, dance and martial arts shows, and waiters walking on water and \"flying\" through the air on zip-wires. Watch what you order if you choose live seafood (it is priced by weight and can be expensive), so there are no surprises – other than the waiters falling from the sky, that is. The dim sum buffet and set menus are the best value. Service can be slow despite the wheels and wires, making the experience best done with a group of (well-lubricated) friends.<br /><a href=\"http://www.royal-dragon.com/\" title=\"\"><em>royal-dragon.com</em></a><br /><strong>Lara Dunston</strong></p><h2>The Heart Attack Grill, Las Vegas, US</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115435'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/15/1381828387518/Heart-Attack-Grill-Las-Ve-008.jpg' alt='Heart Attack Grill, Las Vegas' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>We all know Americans love big portions. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/video/2011/nov/17/las-vegas-dining-heart-attack-grill\" title=\"\">Heart Attack Grill</a> in Vegas (where else?) celebrates the fact with gusto by serving obscenely huge burgers with sides of fries deep-fried in lard. Diners are given hospital style gowns before tucking into the likes of a quadruple bypass burger, a towering heart attack on a plate made with four beef patties and 20 slices of bacon, served by waitresses dressed as nurses who will help you out of the restaurant in a wheel chair if necessary. If you are prepared to gamble with your health, the Heart Attack Grill is certainly a meal to remember. <br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.heartattackgrill.com/\" title=\"\"><em>heartattackgrill.com</em></a><em> </em><br /><strong>IC</strong></p><h2>Draculas and Witches in Britches, Melbourne, Australia</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115436'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381915195753/Witches-In-Britches-Theat-008.jpg' alt='Witches In Britches Theatre Restaurant, Melbourne' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Witches in Britches, Melbourne</figcaption></figure><p>Two longstanding Melbourne schlock horror-themed theatre restaurants owe their recent resurgence in popularity to the Twilight phenomenon, the current obsession with vampires, witches and werewolves, and the burlesque craze. Claiming to have served three million people in 30 years, Draculas offers a camp, vaudevillian-style cabaret during a three-course dinner that begins with drinks in the Graveyard cocktail lounge and a ghost-train ride.&nbsp;</p><p>Located in the Wicked Castle, the 40-year old Witches in Britches offers a kitschy interactive show rooted in contemporary pop culture (it helps to have some knowledge of Aussie television) and a five-course meal that starts with pumpkin soup with \"herbs picked from the old hag's garden\", ladled from a cauldron. <br /><em>• </em><a href=\"https://www.draculas.com.au/melbourne\" title=\"\"><em>draculas.com.au</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.witchesinbritches.com.au/\" title=\"\"><em>witchesinbritches.com.au </em></a><em> </em><br /><strong>LD</strong></p><h2>Onkel Taa, Italian Tyrol<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115437'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/15/1381827213918/Onkel-Taa-Italian-Tyrol-001.jpg' alt='Onkel Taa, Italian Tyrol' width='460' height='296' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Karl Platino, owner-chef of Onkel Taa</figcaption></figure><p>Hidden away in a tiny village of the Italian Tyrol, Onkel Taa is a gourmet restaurant serving traditional <em>Mitteleuropa</em> cuisine, but it is also the fantasy world of the owner-chef, Karl Platino. He is known in Italy as \"Il Re delle Lumache\", the Snail King, because not only does he serve a dozen dishes featuring snails, he also breeds these molluscs in the jungle-like gardens surrounding the restaurant. And this is only one of Onkel Taa's passions: the decor of the cosy wood-panelled osteria is filled with his weird and wonderful collections – everything from corkscrews to snail shaped fossils; and a whole museum is dedicated to the Habsurg Empire and Emperor Franz Josef in particular, whom, coincidentally, the chef closely resembles. And if you want to see something really special, ask to go upstairs from the dining room, where Signor Platino has over a thousand incredible antique wooden doors stashed away.<br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.bad-egart.com/deutsch/restaurant-onkel-taa-willkommen.html\" title=\"\"><em>bad-egart.com</em></a><br /><strong>John Brunton</strong></p><h2>Soldatenkaffee, Bandung, Indoneisa</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115438'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381915488667/Soldaten-Kaffee-Indonesia-001.jpg' alt='Soldaten Kaffee, Indonesia' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>And the award for most tastless restaurant goes to ... the Soldatenkaffee in Bandung, Indonesia. Celebrating \"Hitler as pop culture\" it is staffed by waiters in Nazi uniform. On the menu are \"German\" nachos, curry wurst and \"Bird Ness\", whatever that is; and on the walls are photos of Hitler, stormtroopers and swastikas. Owner Henry Mulyana seemed genuinely surprised at the outrage the restaurant caused, insisting that he doesn't idolise Hitler, he \"simply adores the soldier's paraphernalia\", a message he emphasises on his website: \"This WEB is not pro NAZI. It is matter of fact, with the intention of exploring Hitler &amp; the NAZIS as pop culture. The authors of the WEB are not NAZIS or neo-NAZIS, we are Indonesian with no political affiliations\". The furore caused by Soldatenkaffee didn't put off another owner opening the equally offensive Hitler Fried Chicken in Bangkok, a bizarre take on KFC, with an image of Hitler replacing that of Colonel Sanders.</p><p>The runner-up prize for most tasteless restaurant goes to Bunga Bunga in Battersea, London. It's hard to fathom anyone wanting to eat in a restaurant themed around a slimy, criminal fraudster famed for his liaisons with underaged prostitutes, but here it is, the shameless Bunga Bunga, which draws crowds of young Chelsea types with its all-you-can-drink prosecco and bellini parties. In fact, it's exactly the sort of place you wouldn't be surprised to find a toff dressed in a Nazi uniform \"for fun\". <br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.bungabunga-london.com/\" title=\"\"><em>bungabunga-london.com</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.soldatenkaffee.com/\" title=\"\"><em>oldatenkaffee.com</em></a><br /><strong>IC</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419984497|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|efff2e4556fe14a5ac655eb62f4cbc9b2ad514ac -->",

Set in a traditional wooden house on a small pier, rooms are bright with large balconies and sumptuous sea views. Beaches are on nearby islands a short boat ride away or a 15-minute bike journey. They have large villas for families or suites for couples. <br /><em>• +66 86 948 6836, </em><a href=\"http://www.mangohouses.com/\" title=\"\"><em>mangohouses.com</em></a><em>, rooms from £40</em></p><h2>Secret Garden, Koh Samui<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419925578'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/9/1381328331774/Secret-Garden--001.jpg' alt='Secret Garden ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>This is a small, family run resort with great-value bungalows spread out in well-tended gardens beside Buddha Beach in the north of Samui.

A collection of gorgeous, raised wooden villas set around a lotus-festooned pond, this friendly resort, the only one on this stretch of beach, has a supremely relaxing vibe. It's tricky to reach so you're likely to need your own transport or arrange for ThaiLife to collect you from Phuket airport (£36).<br /><em>• +66 81 812 0388, </em><a href=\"http://www.thailifehomestay.com/\" title=\"\"><em>thailifehomestay.com</em></a><em>, basic cottages start at £16</em></p><h2>Dolphin Bungalows, Koh Phangan<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419925580'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/9/1381340695367/Dolphin-Bungalows-Koh-Pha-001.jpg' alt='Dolphin Bungalows, Koh Phangan' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>Dolphin enjoys an almost legendary status among guests who return year after year.

Baan Talay, with clean, nicely decorated, beach-facing rooms, is one of the best places to stay here. This is a beautiful and restful spot but at various times of the year the beach can be plagued by sand flies.<br /><em>• +66 81 476 2180, </em><a href=\"http://www.baantalay-thungwualaen.com/About-eng.html\" title=\"\"><em>baantalay-thungwualaen.com</em></a><em>, rooms from £16</em></p><h2>Cape Nidhra, Hua Hin<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419925581'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/9/1381340289915/Cape-Nidhra-Hua-Hin-001.jpg' alt='Cape Nidhra, Hua Hin' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Cape Nidhra, Hua Hin</figcaption></figure><p>Every room in this resort complex is a lavish, large designer suite complete with private pool.

Rooms are basic and clean but bungalows inland adjacent to the main property are the better buy.

Since then it has developed into a resort island of some renown. One of the nicest spots to stay on the island is Jack's which has 15 bungalows near a stunning beach. Each building is crafted with renewable, natural materials, has an outside bathroom and all are set amid a verdant jungle environment.

There are no shops here, no restaurants, no bars, no mobile phone coverage and only the scratchiest of internet connections in the hotel. This leaves you free to enjoy the stunning scenery, incredible diving, exploring (by boat) the many uninhabited islands with their rare wild orchids and the local villages where the people still make a living fishing (sustainably) from dug-out canoes and farming pearls.  Not a cheap trip, but an incredible experience.<br /><a href=\"http://rajaampatlodges.com/\" title=\"\">http://<em>rajaampatlodges.com</em></a><br /><strong>Adam Howarth</strong></p><p><strong>Climbing Gunung Rinjani, Lombok</strong>,<strong> </strong><br />My boyfriend and I climbed Gunung Rinjani at the end of travelling around Indonesia for two months. It's a three-day trek, up through the rainforest, and at the summit you can see mountain tops on neighbouring islands floating in the sky. When you go down into the crater there is a beautiful lake with a volcano in the middle and hot springs, each one a different level of heat for your achy muscles.

Nonetheless we got up – to dry weather – and climbed into the taxi arranged by ViaVia, a fantastic restaurant and an eco-responsible tour agent. Getting to the ancient temple in time for sunrise was well worth it: we explored the grounds in almost entire solitude.<br /><a href=\"http://www.viaviajogja.com/\" title=\"\"><em>viaviajogja.com</em></a><em>, from £14pp </em><br /><strong>absy83</strong></p><h2>Thailand<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419732050'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/10/10/1381425509672/Chao-Phraya-Express-boat-008.jpg' alt='Chao Phraya Express boat' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Chao Phraya Express boat.

I highly recommend doing this as soon as you arrive as it saves all that staring at amazing food and wondering if it's safe to eat it  – or what– it is! I admit to rather smugly watching other tourists peer into the street restaurants and then move on. If only you knew, I thought, as I tucked into my dish of wood-ear mushrooms and pork stuffed spring rolls, confident of bowel safety!

        "body":"<h2>Grand Canyon national park</h2><p>Other canyons on earth are longer and wider (Australia's Capertee Valley is both) and deeper (Kali Gandaki Gorge&nbsp;in&nbsp;Nepal), but none is as famous as the Grand Canyon, with its intricate layering, maze-like side canyons, vivid colours and epic visual scale. It's 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide and over a mile deep, cutting&nbsp;down through more than two billion years of geologic time, exposing some of the oldest rocks on earth.</p><p>To visit the Grand Canyon, in north-west Arizona, choose between the more developed South Rim, which is open year-round, and has drive-up overlooks, museums and mule rides, or the more secluded North Rim, which is higher in elevation and closed to vehicles from mid-October until mid-May because of the snow (skiers and snowshoers are welcome). The average distance across the canyon is only 10 miles, but there are no bridges for cars and the 215-mile drive from one rim to the other takes five hours. Both rims offer lodging and camping options, as well as a selection of trails descending into the canyon. Or you see it from a rafting expedition down the Colorado river.</p><p><strong>Top tips</strong> Standing on the edge of either rim is awe-inspiring, but nothing beats actually getting down in the canyon. Do not attempt to hike from the rim to the Colorado river and back in one day! To spend the night in the canyon, you need backcountry hiking and camping permits. Or book a mule ride to <a href=\"http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/phantom-ranch-704.html\" title=\"\">Phantom Ranch</a>, one of the most remote lodges in the national park system. Summer temperatures can be sweltering in the canyon.

To experience this incredible area on foot, you'll need some luck in the backcountry permit lottery and some serious wilderness knowhow.</p><p>Less wilderness-savvy visitors can settle for crossing the stunning Navajo Bridge, which links the North and South Rims of the Grand Canyon, east of Grand Canyon national park. The drive along Alt 89, a paved scenic road, from Navajo Bridge to the North Rim Village, skirts the base of the Vermilion Cliffs.</p><p><strong>Top tip</strong> The Wave, in the Coyote Buttes North region of the Paria Canyon-Vermillion Wilderness, could be the single most psychedelically spectacular rock formation in the country. Only 20 permits a day are given out for access to The Wave. Half are available through an online lottery and half from the visitor centre at Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument in Kanab, Utah, just over the state line from Fredonia. <br /><strong>Useful links</strong><a href=\"http://www.vermilioncliffs.com/\" title=\"\"> <em>Vemilion Cliffs website</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/az/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/natmon/vermilion.html\" title=\"\"><em>wilderness permits</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/az/st/en/arolrsmain/paria/coyote_buttes/permits.html\" title=\"\"><em>Wave permits</em></a><em> </em></p><h2>Wupatki and Sunset Crater national monuments</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255920'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010306601/Wupatki-ancien-ruins-in-A-016.jpg' alt='Wupatki ancien ruins in Arizona ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Wupatki ancien ruins in Arizona  Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Southern Arizona is the more populous part of the state today, but historically more people lived in the north-central plateau. Home to the ancient Pueblo people (formerly known as the Anasazi) Wupatki national monument, north of Flagstaff, has the ruins of five pueblos, built from slabs of the region's brick-red Moenkopi sandstone.</p><p>Most of the large pueblos at Wupatki were constructed after the violent eruption of the nearby Sunset Crater volcano, in around 1085. Ash was spread over 800 square miles of land, forcing the temporary evacuation of the region. But the ash also  improved the soil for farming and Wupatki's pueblos flourished by 1100. Today, Sunset Crater national monument protects the massive cinder cone volcano and the surrounding lavascapes.</p><p>The five largest pueblos at Wupatki can be visited in a day and make for a nice trip from Flagstaff or a scenic detour on the way to the Grand Canyon. Camping is available at Sunset Crater national monument. The Wupatki visitor centre provides trail guides.</p><p><strong>Top tip </strong>The Wukoki pueblo is a little further off the main road than the other pueblos, but its castle-like stance atop a large rock outcrop makes it the most dramatic. <br /><strong>Useful links</strong> <a href=\" http://www.nps.gov/wupa/index.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Wupatki national monument</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\" http://www.nps.gov/sucr/index.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Sunset Crater National Monument</em></a></p><h2>Montezuma's Castle national monument</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255921'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010527812/Montezumas-Castle-Arizona-032.jpg' alt='Montezuma's Castle, Arizona' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Montezuma's Castle, Arizona Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Montezuma's Castle has nothing to do with Montezuma, the Aztec emperor who reigned in Mexico long after these cliffside ruins were abandoned. The misnomer was coined by white explorers who rediscovered the ruins in 1860 and reasoned that the spectacular place must have been built for a king.</p><p>This cliffside complex, one of the largest and best-preserved cliff dwellings in North America, was actually built around AD700 by the Sinagua people and abandoned in 1485, probably after a long period of drought. The 20-room dwelling, which was more of an apartment complex reached by ladders than a fortress, probably housed about 50 people.</p><p>An easy paved trail leads out to the ruins. Accessing the ruins via ladders has been banned since 1951, and there are no camping or lodging facilities within the park, but accommodation ranging from primitive campsites to upscale luxury hotels can be found in the surrounding Coconino national forest and nearby Sedona and Flagstaff.</p><p><strong>Top tip </strong>Skip Interstate 17 in favour of the scenic route Alt-89 to Montezuma's Castle through Sedona's spectacular red-rock country. <br /><strong>Useful links</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/moca/index.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Montezuma's Castle website</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.visitsedona.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Sedona lodging</em></a></p><h2>Walnut Canyon national  monument<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255922'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010809090/Cliff-dwellings-at-Walnut-008.jpg' alt='Cliff dwellings at Walnut Canyon, Arizona' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Cliff dwellings at Walnut Canyon, Arizona Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>With its deep, sinuous curves through striking white Kaibab limestone, Walnut Canyon would be an attraction in itself, even without its numerous cliff dwellings. More than 80 single-family homes are found tucked into natural limestone overhangs in this canyon, just 10 miles east of Flagstaff.</p><p>The small rooms, just big enough to cook and sleep in, were built between 1125 and 1250 by the Sinagua people, who also constructed the distinctly different Montezuma's Castle, about 30 miles south. The site was abandoned possibly due to drought or tribal warfare.</p><p>Many of the structures in Walnut Canyon can be visited along a paved one-mile loop trail that descends 55m from the visitor centre on the rim.</p><p>There are no camping or lodging facilities within the park, but camping is available in the surrounding Kaibab and Coconino national forests and hotels abound in nearby Flagstaff.</p><p><strong>Top tip</strong> The<a href=\"http://www.grandcanyonhostel.com/GCindex.htm\" title=\"\"> Grand Canyon International Hostel</a> in Flagstaff provides cheap bunks and private rooms to travellers of all ages, as well as shuttle services to the Grand Canyon, Walnut Canyon and other nearby attractions. <br /><strong>Useful link</strong> <a href=\"http://www.americansouthwest.net/arizona/walnut_canyon/national_monument.html\" title=\"\"><em>americansouthwest.net/arizona/walnut_canyon/national_monument.html</em></a></p><h2>Meteor Crater national natural landmark </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255923'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010470338/Meteor-Crater-near-Winslo-008.jpg' alt='Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Around 50,000 years ago, when woolly mammoths and giant ground sloths roamed eastern Arizona, an iron-nickel meteor the size of three school buses streaked across the sky and slammed into the earth with a force greater than 10 megatonnes of TNT. The impact left a massive circular hole in the earth's crust, just off the interstate near Winslow. It's a mile across, 2.4 miles in circumference and about 170m deep – and now known as one of the world's best-preserved examples of a meteor crater.</p><p>Meteor Crater is actually privately owned, but it's open to the public and recognised as a national natural landmark. A well-appointed visitor centre displays copious information about how the crater was formed and its long road to recognition as a meteor crater, as opposed to a volcanic feature. RV and tent camping is also available on site, or down the road at<a href=\"http://azstateparks.com/Parks/HORU/\" title=\"\"> Homolovi state park</a>.</p><p><strong>Top tip </strong>Visitors are no longer allowed to hike down into the crater, but you can join one of the guided tours that explores its rim. <br /><strong>• Useful link</strong> <a href=\"http://www.meteorcrater.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Meteor Crater website</em></a>/</p><h2>Canyon De Chelly national monument</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255924'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010537131/Canyon-de-Chelly-Arizona--008.jpg' alt='Canyon de Chelly, Arizona ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Canyon de Chelly Arizona, the Spider Rock overlook Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Canyon De Chelly is a sacred place. Carved into the sandstone bedrock of north-eastern Arizona, near Chinle, the three spectacular canyons,&nbsp;De Chelly, Del Muerto, and Monument, lie at the centre of the Navajo Nation and at the heart of many native legends.</p><p>These canyons have been occupied for thousands of years, more continuously than anywhere else in North America; the Ancestral Puebloans, Anasazi, Hopi and Navajo have all called this place home. Today, Canyon De Chelly is operated as a national monument on Navajo Tribal Trust Land, the only national monument not owned by the federal government.</p><p>Because the Navajo people still call Canyon De Chelly (pronounced de-shay) home, visitors are restricted from exploring without a native guide. Unaccompanied visitors can follow the scenic North and South Rim drives, with overlooks along the lengths of the canyons, including at Spider Rock, an iconic sandstone spire that towers 230m above the canyon floor.</p><p>To see more, you'll need to hire a native guide to escort you on either foot, 4x4 or horseback. Book your tour ahead of time or stop by the visitor centre for recommendations. Tent and RV camping is available at the Cottonwood campsite.</p><p><strong>Top tip </strong>You don't need a guide to hike down to the White House Ruins, a three-mile circular trek that drops 150m down into the canyon. The trail begins six miles east of the visitor centre along the South Rim drive. Remember, as with all canyons, hiking down is optional; getting back up is mandatory! <br /><strong>Useful links</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cach/index.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Canyon De Chelly website</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cach/planyourvisit/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageID=632254\" title=\"\"><em>tour information</em></a><br /><em> </em><strong>NPS-approved tour companies:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.footpathjourneys.com/\" title=\"\"><em>footpathjourneys.com</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://canyondechellytours.com\" title=\"\"><em>canyondechellytours.com</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://canyondechellytours.com\" title=\"\"><em>canyondechelly.net</em></a></p><h2>Monument Valley Navajo tribal park </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255925'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010783628/Monument-Valley-Navajo-Tr-008.jpg' alt='Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, Arizona/Utah ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, Arizona/Utah, USA Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Monument Valley has long been used as a dramatic backdrop for Hollywood westerns, but the even biggest movie screens don't do justice to this incredible landscape in north-east Arizona. Monument Valley is named for the dozens of free-standing sandstone buttes and monoliths that tower above the sweeping sagebrush landscape. Bridging the state line between Arizona and Utah, the formations serve as a fitting gateway to south-east Utah's famous red-rock country.</p><p>The land is held by the Navajo people, and visitors must pay an access fee to drive through the tribal park on a 17-mile dirt loop, which is suitable for all cars when dry but impassable after a storm ( usually in late summer). Tours to other areas, such as Mystery Valley and Hunts Mesa, can be arranged at the visitor centre, off Highway 163. There is no camping within the park itself, but many opportunities can be found to the north and south. <br /><strong>Top tip </strong>Be sure to get out of the car and experience some this wide-open landscape on foot via the 3.2-mile Wildcat trail, around the West Mitten butte. It's self-guided and open to the public. Other access to tribal land requires permits and/or guides. <br /><strong>Useful link </strong><a href=\" http://navajonationparks.org/htm/monumentvalley.htm\" title=\"\"><strong> </strong>navajonationparks.org </a></p><h2>Petrified Forest national park</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255926'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010598210/Petrified-Forest-National-008.jpg' alt='Petrified Forest National Park, Badlands, Arizona' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Petrified Forest National Park, Badlands, Arizona Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Back when dinosaurs ruled the earth, what is now eastern Arizona was a humid, subtropical rainforest. Evidence of the arid desert's greener past is preserved in an astonishing collection of petrified trees within this national park.</p><p>During the Late Triassic period, fallen trees were buried by sediment with a high content of volcanic ash. Over the years, quartz crystals gradually replaced the organic wood matter, petrifying the trees. The high quartz content makes the petrified wood very hard: it can only be cut by a diamond-tipped saw.</p><p>The national park is also known for its fossils (plants dating back 225m years, reptiles and dinosaurs) and a colourful landscape known as the Painted Desert. The park is bisected by interstate 40, making for a convenient rest stop 50 miles west of the New Mexican border. There are no developed camping or lodging facilities within the park.</p><p><strong>Top tip</strong> Visit the Rainbow Forest Museum and pick up a trail guide for the ½-mile Giant Logs trail, which features some of the largest and best-preserved petrified trees in the park. Remember: removal of petrified wood or other material is strictly prohibited by federal law!<br /><strong>Useful links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/pefo/planyourvisit/trails.htm\" title=\"\"><em>hiking trails</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.arizonaguide.com/places-to-visit/arizona-parks-monuments/petrified-forest-national-park\" title=\"\"><em>nearby lodging and attractions </em></a></p><h2>Saguaro national park</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420255927'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382010656322/Saguaro-National-Park-Ari-008.jpg' alt='Saguaro National Park, Arizona, USA' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Saguaro National Park, Arizona, USA Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Few symbols of the south-west are as distinctive as the towering silhouette of a saguaro cactus. But despite their ubiquity on license plates and T-shirts, saguaros are only found within a small slice of southern Arizona. Hundreds of these sentinels, up to 15m tall, are protected within the bounds of Saguaro national park, on the outskirts of Tucson.</p><p>Saguaros need all the protection they can get. The giant cactuses can live over 250 years  and weigh several tonnes, but their single trunk and relatively soft flesh make them vulnerable to vandalism. In Arizona, harming a saguaro in any way is illegal, with serious consequences such as hefty fines and even jail.</p><p>Saguaro national park is split into two districts, west and east of Tucson. More than 150 miles of well-maintained and marked trails wind through the park. Summer temperatures can be deadly, so aim for mornings and evenings in autumn, winter and spring. There are no developed campsites in the park, but walk-in backcountry camping is allowed and a wide range of accommodation can be found in Tucson and surrounding areas.</p><p><strong>Top tip</strong> Plan to visit in late May or early June, when the Saguaros are blooming with huge white waxy flowers. The nectar  attracts all manner of wildlife, including many species of bat and bird. <br /><strong>Useful links</strong><em> </em><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/sagu/planyourvisit/saguaro_hiking.htm,\" title=\"\"><em>hiking</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/sagu/camping-in-saguaro-wilderness-area.htm\" title=\"\"><em>backcountry camping</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.saguaro.national-park.com/camping.htm\" title=\"\"><em>more camping options</em></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theblondecoyote.com.\" title=\"\"><strong>Mary Caperton Morton</strong></a><strong> is a freelance writer and photographer who makes her home on the back roads of North America, living and working out of a tiny solar-powered Teardrop camper</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420249018|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|fcfc277f97ff6e71f21f8b45fdaebc7e2445a748 -->",

Many of the big players seem to blur into one after a while.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.Top10.com\">Top10.com</a> is the latest comparison site, and aims to save you trawling the net by aggregating all the best deals into one place. It searches through Booking.com, Lastminute.com, LateRooms.com and Expedia, among others, to bring users a customised top 10 of suitable accommodation, according to  your requirements (pool, pet friendly, Wi-Fi, central location etc).</p><p>Having trialled in beta mode since the beginning of the year, it launched officially last week and, given that it comes from the same stable as broadband and mobile price comparison site USwitch.com, it has the potential to make more of splash than many of its rivals. A TV campaign has already launched – something very few start-ups can emulate – and it has funding from some high-flying technology investors, including Accel Partners, early investors in Facebook.</p><p>Though not ground-breaking in its approach, it stands out for its clarity. And there are no adverts or other distractions, as its revenue model is entirely commission-based. The site is UK-based, but lists hotels worldwide.</p><h2>Other hotel-booking sites worth bookmarking</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.hoteltonight.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>HotelTonight</strong></a><strong>: </strong>This is an app, not a website, but it's well worth downloading – especially if you are a last-minute, disorganised or spontaneous traveller. As the name suggests, it helps you find same-day hotels, after rates have been slashed to prevent them sitting empty, and you can book up until 2am in your chosen location. A sample deal in New York is hip boutique hotel 60 Thompson, from $255 down to $189. <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/\">Tripadvisor</a> has also just launched a price comparison and booking tool, <a href=\"http://skift.com/2013/10/16/tripadvisors-new-program-launch-will-bring-in-small-hotels-like-never-before/\">TripConnect</a>, which is expected to bring in more small independent hotels and B&amp;Bs, and Hong Kong-based <a href=\"http://www.hotelquickly.com/\" title=\"\">HotelQuickly </a> – which is better on south-east Asia and Australasia – is also trying to muscle in on this market, but it will be a tough fight as HotelTonight has just raised another $45m in funding.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.between9and5.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Between9and5.com</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you find yourself stuck between time zones or on an awkward stopover for several hours, you might want to catch up on some sleep with a hotel day room. Plenty of airport hotels around the world are covered and you typically have to check out by 7pm. It's another great site for last-minute merchants as you can cancel without incurring fees, and payment is processed at the hotel, so you don't have to input all your details on the site.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420159693|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|fd329e4ce62709508fa9806da5b5ac101d2e5bbe -->",

        "body":"<h2>Contemporâneo Hostel, Botafogo</h2><p>This small boutique hostel, which opened in December 2012, has been aptly named: it is done out with Brazilian designer furniture, including Latoog hanging chairs (which you won't want to get out of), and artwork from the local art school adorns the walls. High-ceilinged dorms sleep four to nine guests and there are private doubles, the largest on the third floor, and on the ground floor a small double is adapted for wheelchair access. For a hostel it attracts older, thirtysomething travellers. Breakfast is served in the patio area, where a large metal shipping container has been adapted into a trendy bar. Guests have access to the kitchen, free Wi-Fi, lockers and a library.<br /><em>• Rua Bambini 158, +55 21 3495 1027, </em><a href=\"http://contemporaneohostel.com.br/site/english/\" title=\"\"><em>contemporaneohostel.com.br</em></a><em>.

The long breakfast bar doubles as a cocktail bar in the evening, serving drinks and snacks to cool sounds. Situated on a busy road, the building is set back from the entrance, which helps reduce the road traffic noise. There are dorms for six to 14 people, plus six suites, each uniquely designed. The staff at can arrange tours to the Dona Marta favela, football games, samba schools and Brazilian funk nights in Rocinha. Oztel is close to bars and restaurants,  but you'll need to hop on a bus to get to the beach – in 15 to 20 minutes you'll be in Ipanema or Copacabana or, in the other direction, the city centre. <br /><em>• Rua Pinheiro Guimarães 91,+55 21 3042 1853, </em><a href=\"http://www.oztel.com.br/site.php?idPagina=2\" title=\"\"><em>oztel.com.br</em></a><em>.

Walking into the reception you're met with a wall of ideas about what to do in the city, from hang-gliding to a football match and a favela party with pick-up at 11pm. The place feels young, with a a trendy  bar and lounge area doubling up as the breakfast room. Accommodation ranges from four small suites, with double beds and private bathroom, to colourful dormitory rooms for up to nine people with capsule-style bunk beds (dorms are either female-only or mixed, all have air con). Breakfast, Wi-Fi and private lockers are included in the daily rate. The hostel makes you feel part of the local way of life, providing skateboards, beach umbrellas, and bats and balls to take to the beach. <br />• <em>Rua General San Martin 1212, +55 21 3593 2386, </em><a href=\"http://z.brahostel.com/z/Pages/Site/\" title=\"\"><em>z.brahostel.com</em></a><em>.

The hostel is a 15-minutes walk to the beach, 15 minutes to the Lagoa (or lake) at the foot of the Christ statue, and the same again to neighbouring Ipanema. The hostel has an air of calm and the decor is contemporary, with a mix of natural colours, parquet floors and simple wooden furniture. A relaxing lounge and breakfast area with comfy sofas opens on to a small patio. The accommodation is simple and clean; five suites with double beds and private bathrooms. Dorms house between four and 12 people, with wooden bunks and private lockers. Wi-Fi is free, and guests have access to the laundry room and fully equipped kitchen. <br /><em>• Rua Dias Ferreira 636, + 55 21 2137 0090, </em><a href=\"http://www.leblonspot.com/home_en\" title=\"\"><em>leblonspot.com</em></a><em>.

Situated high up in the hills of the residential Gavea neighbourhood, La Maison is a quiet and relaxing retreat, away from the tourist areas. The first-floor lounge is decorated in plush deep pink, with a mix of contemporary and neoclassical decor, and an antique dining table and chandelier. A large second-floor lounge, in cool colours and with classic Panton designer chairs, opens on to the deck area with sun loungers and a swimming pool. It feels like you are staying in a friend's designer home. You'll need to taxi in and out at night time, but by swapping a touristy location for Gavea's hills, you'll get a lot more hotel for your money, and a cool place to relax, especially at the height of the Brazilian summer.  <br />• <em>Rua Sergio Porto 58, +55 21 3205 3585, l</em><a href=\"http://www.lamaisonario.com/en-house1.html\" title=\"\"><em>amaisonario.com</em></a><em>.

It is also the city's arty, bohemian quarter and one of the best ways to appreciate this is to stay in the house of a local artist. Cama é Cafe (a literal translation of bed and breakfast) is run by young entrepreneurs who put you in touch with homeowners, many of them local artists, renting out their spare rooms. There are over 40 homes on the books, including many colonial houses. The standard varies from modest to lavish – choose carefully and you could be staying in an antique-filled room with your host's paintings on the walls, and breakfasting on the veranda of a tropical garden. The company also offers tours of the area and a discount scheme in local establishments. There are some cracking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/feb/10/best-bars-rio-de-janeiro\" title=\"\">neighbourhood bars in the area</a>, too. If you go out in town always get a taxi back up the hill at night.

The blend of modern interior design and an old colonial building makes for a strikingly impressive hotel. There are eight suites, some with a four-poster beds or a private veranda overlooking the garden-and-city view. Designer decor and quality linens make for a comfortable stay at a reasonable price. Relax in the garden or enjoy a caipirinha by the pool. Friendly staff and the healthy tropical breakfast are a plus. Neighbouring restaurant Espirito Santa serves typical Amazonian fare, including piranha fish. Also close by is Aprazivel, a popular upmarket Brazilian restaurant set in an impressively romantic setting , where you can dine surrounded by banana plants, wooden huts and a tree house. Always get a taxi back up the hill to the hotel at night.<br /><em>• Rua Almirante Alexandrino 256, Santa Teresa, +55 21 3253 1021, </em><a href=\"http://www.quintaazul.com/\" title=\"\"><em>quintaazul.com.</em></a> <em>Doubles from £90 to £130 B&amp;B</em></p><h2>Casa Mosquito, Ipanema</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420131703'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/16/1381916045566/Casa-Mosquito-008.jpg' alt='Casa Mosquito' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>This late 1940s colonial house nestled high up the mountain between Ipanema and Copacabana offers a relaxing and stylish retreat away from the tourist hubbub. A mix of 50s antique furniture and contemporary decor complements the neoclassic lounge, which is filled with fresh tropical flowers. Enjoy sunset with a caipirinha on the terrace, looking out towards the bays of Ipanema and Copacabana and across to the neighbouring favela Cantagalo-Pavão-Pavãozinho. Expect a soundtrack of music in the evening, the obligatory dog barking and church song. Four individually decorated suites named after famous Brazilians are embellished with stylish Brazilian paintings. Sit back on your private veranda and take in either Sugar Loaf mountain, from Tom Jobim and Madame Sata suites, or the forest from Pixinguinha and Heitor Villa-Lobos suites. From March 2014, six additional suites, a roof top pool and panoramic bar will be inaugurated. <br /><em>• Rua Saint Roman 222, Ipanema, +55 21 3586 5042, <a href=\"http://www.casamosquito.com\">casamosquito.com</a>.

The Man in Rio concierge services offers a wide portfolio of private accommodation, ranging from beach houses and out-of-city country farms to penthouses and studio apartments in Copacabana and Ipanema. It's an ideal option for single travellers, family or friends looking for a cost-effective alternative to Rio's often overpriced hotels. <a href=\"http://maninrio.com/product/boutique-1-studio-apartment-for-rent-rio-ipanema\" title=\"\">A stylish studio apartment in Ipanema</a>, designed by local Brazilian architect and just two blocks from the beach, costs  from £85 per night.

Bonita is an upgrade on the many hostels nearby. Situated in the heart of Ipanema, just three blocks from the beach and one from the metro station, this colourful pousada/hostel is lively, with a large patio area, bar and TV lounge that are perfect stomping grounds for travellers to hook up with new and old friends. But perhaps it's not the best choice if you are looking to kick back and relax with a book. Bonita offers reasonable prices for one of Rio's most expensive tourist areas. Rooms are simply decorated with no extra trimmings or designer fittings. There are dorms with six beds, single, double or quadruple rooms with or without private bath.  You can book trips here to favelas, sky-diving, the Maracana stadium and Buzios.<br /><em>• Rua Barão da Torre 107, Ipanema, +55 21 2227 1703, </em><a href=\"http://www.bonitaipanema.com/\" title=\"\"><em>bonitaipanema.com</em></a><em>.

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.elizabethdanielsphotography.com\"></a><a href=\"http://www.elizabethdanielsphotography.com\"></a></p><h2>Magic Restroom Cafe, Los Angeles</h2><p>The idea of sitting on a toilet in public is the stuff of nightmares but that hasn't stopped the Magic Restroom making loos the focus of its new themed restaurant in LA. In fact toilet-themed restaurants are nothing new – <a href=\"http://www.moderntoilet.com.tw/en/about.asp\">Taiwans' Modern Toilet </a>where chocolate ice-cream is served in toilet-shaped dishes is well-documented. Inspired by its success Magic Restroom owner YoYo Li has introduced toilets as seats and a mix of Asian and western food – like zha jiang mian, named \"constipation\" on the menu, braised pork over rice, (\"smells-like-poop\"), and sundaes (choose from chocolate \"black poop\" or the vanilla-strawberry sundae \"bloody number two\") served, of course, in miniature toilet bowls. Revolting and distrubing in equal measure. Freud would have a field day.  <br /><strong>Isabel Choat </strong></p><h2>Twin Stars Diner, Moscow</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115432'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381915251383/Twin-Stars-restaurant-Mos-001.jpg' alt='Twin Stars restaurant, Moscow' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Reuters TV / Reuters/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to stand out in a city that loves extreme dining, whether it involves vines and amphorae, (<a href=\"http://tiflis.ru/\" title=\"\">Tiflis</a>, the Russian word for the Georgian capital, Tbilisi), moving trams (<a href=\"http://tramvay-annushka.ru/\" title=\"\">Annushka</a>), live goats (<a href=\"http://www.shinok.ru/\" title=\"\">Shinok</a>), or waterfalls (<a href=\"http://www.blueelephant.com/moscow/\" title=\"\">Blue Elephant</a>) – but Alexei Khodorkovsky has managed to find a new niche, with the opening of his twin-themed restaurant. At the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBelvwDgtxw\">Twin Stars diner in Moscow</a>, all the staff – from waiters to bartenders and even the chefs – are identically-dressed twins. The creepy concept is inspired by a 1964 Soviet film in which a girl winds up in an alternate reality and confronts her twin. Khodorkovsky says it's been hard to find suitably qualifed twins but the concept is paying off - the 24-hour restaurant is a hit with locals who don't seem bothered about the issue of whether or not to tip twice. </p><p>If Twin Stars represents the new Russia with its modern, funky design, the Expedicia is more traditional Russia - appealing, one imagines, to chest-beating Putin types with a love of the outdoors.  In the pricey, survival-themed Expeditsia (\"expedition\") restaurant you eat between an orange helicopter parked in the pine trees and a stuffed polar bear scratching itself by a stream.</p><p>Guests can sprawl on the roof garden lawn or be beaten with birch twigs in the Siberian banya. Ingredients such as wild duck, fresh berries and mountain honey are flown in from the far north and east of Russia, and delicacies include elk in aspic, smoked venison, sea urchin and sturgeon, served with vodka, sea buckthorn juice or Baikal mineral water. Expect to pay around 1,500 roubles (£30) for a main course; a shot of vodka will set you back around £5 and a fresh juice £9. <br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://expedicia.ru/en/home/gastronomy.html\" title=\"\"><em>expedicia.ru</em></a><br /><strong>Phoebe Taplin and Isabel Choat</strong></p><h2>Carton King, Taichung City, Taiwan</h2><p>Taiwan has a penchant for themed absurdity when it comes to eating out. Whether for Japanese assassins lurking in the rafters at <a href=\"http://www.ninja-tw.com/cetacean/front/bin/home.phtml\" title=\"\">Ninja</a> or the drinks served in specimen bottles to wash down one's turd-shaped bread at the aforementioned Modern Toilet, the food is rarely the primary draw. And so it is with Carton King, a restaurant whose owner was so depressed by the preponderance of plastic in modern life he built an eatery which, instead, promotes the virtues of corrugated cardboard. From the chairs to the plates and even the walls – the whole place is bedecked in the brown stuff. The food, although not fine dining, was more than edible and all that remained of our stewed pork ribs and herb-roasted chicken was the odd greasy smear on our cardboard table. Definitely worth a visit … just remember to leave your lighter at home.<br /><strong>Mark Pygott</strong></p><h2>Barbie restaurant, Taipei, Taiwan</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115433'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381915386470/Barbie-restaurant-Taipei-001.jpg' alt='Barbie restaurant, Taipei' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: David Chang/DAVID CHANG/epa/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>The Far East's love of all things cute and fluffy is well known; whether it's actual, real-life cuteness in the shape of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/video/2012/feb/03/tokyo-cat-cafe-video\" title=\"\">Tokyo's cat cafes</a>, where pet-less Tokyoites go to stroke and play with cats and kittens, or the <a href=\"http://www.hellokitty.com/\" title=\"\">Hello Kitty</a> phenomenon in Seoul. So the only surprise about Taipei's Barbie restaurant is that it took so long for someone to come up with the idea. It is staffed by waitresses in bright pink tops, tutus and tiaras, while the chairs are dressed in tutus and there's enough pink food to sink a Barbie cruise ship. <br /><strong>IC</strong></p><h2>Le Refuge des Fondues, Paris</h2><p>Why, when in Paris, a city full of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/may/06/top-10-paris-restaurants-dining\">great restaurants</a>, you would choose to go for a fondue is anyone's guess but tucking into the Swiss dish is not the oddest thing about Le Refuge des Fondues in Monmatre. The real weirdness begins when you order your wine – and it's brought to you in a baby's bottle, apparently a ruse to avoid French tax on wine served in proper glasses. Gooey cheese and drinking out of a teat – it's not somewhere you'd want to go on a first date, but it's been pulling in the tourist crowds for decades. <br /> <em>• 17 Rue des 3 Frères </em><br /><strong>IC</strong></p><h2>The Royal Dragon, Bangkok, Thailand</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115434'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/15/1381827324445/The-Royal-Dragon-Bangkok--001.jpg' alt='The Royal Dragon, Bangkok, Thailand' width='460' height='336' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>If you think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/30/britains-biggest-restaurant-opens\" title=\"\">Britain's biggest restaurant</a>, serving 2,000 diners a day, is massive, think again. Bangkok's Royal Dragon is monumental. The colossal seafood place sprawls across 8.35 acres, has 1,000 staff, and requires 540 costumed waiters on roller skates to serve some 5,000 customers. And while it boasts the largest collection of live seafood tanks and 1,000 pan-Asian dishes, diners don't come for the food. It's all about the spectacle: traditional Thai and Chinese music, dance and martial arts shows, and waiters walking on water and \"flying\" through the air on zip-wires. Watch what you order if you choose live seafood (it is priced by weight and can be expensive), so there are no surprises – other than the waiters falling from the sky, that is. The dim sum buffet and set menus are the best value. Service can be slow despite the wheels and wires, making the experience best done with a group of (well-lubricated) friends.<br /><a href=\"http://www.royal-dragon.com/\" title=\"\"><em>royal-dragon.com</em></a><br /><strong>Lara Dunston</strong></p><h2>The Heart Attack Grill, Las Vegas, US</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115435'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/15/1381828387518/Heart-Attack-Grill-Las-Ve-008.jpg' alt='Heart Attack Grill, Las Vegas' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>We all know Americans love big portions. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/video/2011/nov/17/las-vegas-dining-heart-attack-grill\" title=\"\">Heart Attack Grill</a> in Vegas (where else?) celebrates the fact with gusto by serving obscenely huge burgers with sides of fries deep-fried in lard. Diners are given hospital style gowns before tucking into the likes of a quadruple bypass burger, a towering heart attack on a plate made with four beef patties and 20 slices of bacon, served by waitresses dressed as nurses who will help you out of the restaurant in a wheel chair if necessary. If you are prepared to gamble with your health, the Heart Attack Grill is certainly a meal to remember. <br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.heartattackgrill.com/\" title=\"\"><em>heartattackgrill.com</em></a><em> </em><br /><strong>IC</strong></p><h2>Draculas and Witches in Britches, Melbourne, Australia</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115436'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381915195753/Witches-In-Britches-Theat-008.jpg' alt='Witches In Britches Theatre Restaurant, Melbourne' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Witches in Britches, Melbourne</figcaption></figure><p>Two longstanding Melbourne schlock horror-themed theatre restaurants owe their recent resurgence in popularity to the Twilight phenomenon, the current obsession with vampires, witches and werewolves, and the burlesque craze. Claiming to have served three million people in 30 years, Draculas offers a camp, vaudevillian-style cabaret during a three-course dinner that begins with drinks in the Graveyard cocktail lounge and a ghost-train ride.&nbsp;</p><p>Located in the Wicked Castle, the 40-year old Witches in Britches offers a kitschy interactive show rooted in contemporary pop culture (it helps to have some knowledge of Aussie television) and a five-course meal that starts with pumpkin soup with \"herbs picked from the old hag's garden\", ladled from a cauldron. <br /><em>• </em><a href=\"https://www.draculas.com.au/melbourne\" title=\"\"><em>draculas.com.au</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.witchesinbritches.com.au/\" title=\"\"><em>witchesinbritches.com.au </em></a><em> </em><br /><strong>LD</strong></p><h2>Onkel Taa, Italian Tyrol<br /></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115437'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2013/10/15/1381827213918/Onkel-Taa-Italian-Tyrol-001.jpg' alt='Onkel Taa, Italian Tyrol' width='460' height='296' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Karl Platino, owner-chef of Onkel Taa</figcaption></figure><p>Hidden away in a tiny village of the Italian Tyrol, Onkel Taa is a gourmet restaurant serving traditional <em>Mitteleuropa</em> cuisine, but it is also the fantasy world of the owner-chef, Karl Platino. He is known in Italy as \"Il Re delle Lumache\", the Snail King, because not only does he serve a dozen dishes featuring snails, he also breeds these molluscs in the jungle-like gardens surrounding the restaurant. And this is only one of Onkel Taa's passions: the decor of the cosy wood-panelled osteria is filled with his weird and wonderful collections – everything from corkscrews to snail shaped fossils; and a whole museum is dedicated to the Habsurg Empire and Emperor Franz Josef in particular, whom, coincidentally, the chef closely resembles. And if you want to see something really special, ask to go upstairs from the dining room, where Signor Platino has over a thousand incredible antique wooden doors stashed away.<br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.bad-egart.com/deutsch/restaurant-onkel-taa-willkommen.html\" title=\"\"><em>bad-egart.com</em></a><br /><strong>John Brunton</strong></p><h2>Soldatenkaffee, Bandung, Indoneisa</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420115438'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381915488667/Soldaten-Kaffee-Indonesia-001.jpg' alt='Soldaten Kaffee, Indonesia' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>And the award for most tastless restaurant goes to ... the Soldatenkaffee in Bandung, Indonesia. Celebrating \"Hitler as pop culture\" it is staffed by waiters in Nazi uniform. On the menu are \"German\" nachos, curry wurst and \"Bird Ness\", whatever that is; and on the walls are photos of Hitler, stormtroopers and swastikas. Owner Henry Mulyana seemed genuinely surprised at the outrage the restaurant caused, insisting that he doesn't idolise Hitler, he \"simply adores the soldier's paraphernalia\", a message he emphasises on his website: \"This WEB is not pro NAZI. It is matter of fact, with the intention of exploring Hitler &amp; the NAZIS as pop culture. The authors of the WEB are not NAZIS or neo-NAZIS, we are Indonesian with no political affiliations\". The furore caused by Soldatenkaffee didn't put off another owner opening the equally offensive Hitler Fried Chicken in Bangkok, a bizarre take on KFC, with an image of Hitler replacing that of Colonel Sanders.</p><p>The runner-up prize for most tasteless restaurant goes to Bunga Bunga in Battersea, London. It's hard to fathom anyone wanting to eat in a restaurant themed around a slimy, criminal fraudster famed for his liaisons with underaged prostitutes, but here it is, the shameless Bunga Bunga, which draws crowds of young Chelsea types with its all-you-can-drink prosecco and bellini parties. In fact, it's exactly the sort of place you wouldn't be surprised to find a toff dressed in a Nazi uniform \"for fun\". <br /><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.bungabunga-london.com/\" title=\"\"><em>bungabunga-london.com</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.soldatenkaffee.com/\" title=\"\"><em>oldatenkaffee.com</em></a><br /><strong>IC</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419984497|2013-10-17T14:14:17Z|efff2e4556fe14a5ac655eb62f4cbc9b2ad514ac -->",

        "headline":"Top 10 bars in St Kitts",
        "body":"<h2>Shipwreck Beach Bar &amp; Grill, Friars Bay</h2><p>There are few better places to watch the sun go down than this spot on Friars Bay, just over the hill from Frigate Bay on the south east peninsula. Shipwreck Bar &amp; Grill is known for a casual vibe - its laidback mood is evoked by the gentle waves of the Caribbean Sea. Yet should you feel active, the bar rents out snorkel gear and paddleboards. The rum-heavy 'Pirate's Punch' and 'Kittitian Snafu' are the hot ticket items. There's live music on Sunday afternoons. <br />• <em>Open daily 10am to 6.30pm </em></p><h2>Green Valley Pub, Cayon</h2><p>Located on Island Main Road in the scenic village of Cayon, Green Valley Pub is a good bet for nature lovers. Lush greenery and splashy paintings surround the outdoor bar, which holds a two-level seating area that perfectly positions you to watch the antics on a stage below. You can enjoy the island breeze while sampling the straightforward drinks menu of mostly rums and beers. The pub hosts regular gigs and dances featuring local bands. <br />• <em>Open Mon-Sat 10am-midnight</em></p><h2>Rum Barrel, Basseterre</h2><p>From rum to cruise ships, you'll take in key elements of St Kitts here. Stroll through Port Zante, St Kitts' port and shopping area, and you can't miss this open-air venue - complete with brightly coloured awning and wraparound bar. Hop on to a wooden stool, order a (rum) drink and observe the dozens of tourists from the big cruise ships nearby typically milling around. Well known for its regular bartending competitions, Rum Barrel features a diverse selection of rums, including Brinley Gold Rum which is made on the island. <br />• <em>Open every day except Sunday 8am to 11pm</em></p><h2>Reggae Beach Bar &amp; Grill, Cockleshell Beach</h2><p>If you want a little more action alongside your bar-hopping, check out Reggae Beach Bar &amp; Grill on postcard-pretty Cockleshell Beach on the south east peninsula. The bar offers watersports such as kayaking and jet skiing – in addition to plenty of sun loungers. You'll get some of the best mixed drinks on the island here, especially the 'Reggae Colada' (made with passion fruit) and 'Reggae Punch' (Appleton rum and lime juice). There is also a lively lobster cookout every Friday evening.<br />• <em>Open daily from 10am-6pm, <a href=\"http://www.reggaebeachbar.com\">reggaebeachbar.com</a></em></p><h2>Twist Bar, Basseterre</h2><p>Head here to join local sports fans. Twist Bar not only boasts several flat-screen TVs (always tuned to sporting events), but also pool and football tables for those who fancy a game. This second-floor bar is one of the most happening places in the Port Zante complex, and has a diverse menu that includes a selection of Mexican, Chinese, Thai, Italian and Indian dishes. Twist Bar is also renowned for its variety of flavoured rums, and has a large stock of Caribbean-made products (including Cruzan from St Croix and Dorado from Jamaica). Its signature drinks are the Twist Rum Punch and the 'Twist Shot', which contains Sambuca and absinthe. <br />• <em>Open daily 10.30am to 9pm</em></p><h2>Patsy's Beach Bar, The Strip</h2><p>Since its opening about a year ago, this bar has gained a reputation for producing the best food on The Strip. Its menu offers a range of meat and seafood dishes, all grilled to perfection by Patsy herself. With a live band on Sundays and karaoke on Wednesdays, Patsy's attracts a more mature and relaxed crowd. This is a place for those happy to sit back, sip their wine and listen to old-school tunes. <br />• <em>Open daily from 11am</em></p><h2>Karma Beach Bar, Frigate Bay</h2><p>Facilities at this large bar adjacent to the Marriott Resort are impressive. There's a roomy lounge with a bank of wide-screen TVs and a great music vibe. Or, if you're looking for a tad more seclusion, take a seat on the outdoor deck opposite the turquoise beauty of the Atlantic Ocean. Beer connoisseurs will appreciate this spot, which boasts a selection of brews from more than 40 different countries. The global outlook continues with music and food: Karma Beach Bar features an international DJ once a month, while its menu includes Indian, Chinese and Thai dishes.<br />• <em>Open daily from 5pm to 1am</em></p><h2>Illusions Bar, Frigate Bay</h2><p>Upscale and elegant, Illusions Bar is in the Sugars Complex in Frigate Bay. Open since May, this spot has quickly become a standout. It's particularly lively and crowded on theme nights - such as Latino Wednesdays and open mic Tuesdays. The namesake drink, &quot;It's an illusion&quot;, is a hot menu item made with spiced rum. <br />• <em>Open daily except Sundays, noon to 11pm </em></p><h2>Vibes Beach Bar, South Frigate Bay</h2><p>The beach at South Frigate Bay is more than just a band of sand – it encapsulates the party spirit of St Kitts. Known as The Strip, it's lined with little restaurants and laid-back beach bars. Nowhere on The Strip embodies the festive feel more than Vibes Beach Bar. Don't be fooled by its simple wooden exterior, this place is where ardent partiers go for a memorable 'lime'. Its signature drinks are the Vibes Passion Fruit Margarita (made with golden tequila) and the Cranberry Punch (made with rum and ginger). Try the 'Vibes Platter', a treat of local seafood. <br />• <em>Open daily, 4pm-2am</em></p><h2>Chinchillas Mexican Restaurant &amp; Bar, The Strip</h2><p>This hangout in a prime position on The Strip is great not only for lovers of Mexican culture, but also for romantics in general, thanks to its beautifully lit trellis and soft lighting. Chinchillas is renowned for its margaritas, especially its signature 'Coronita' – an upside-down Corona Beer inside a giant frozen margarita. The food offerings range from traditional Mexican dishes to American Tex-Mex food. <br />• <em>Open Monday to Saturday 11am to 4 pm and 5 to 10 pm</em></p><p><strong>Melissa Bryant is a native of St. Kitts.
