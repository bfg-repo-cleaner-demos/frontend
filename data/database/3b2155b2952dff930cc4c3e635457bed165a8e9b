        "trailText":"<p><strong>Melbourne Festival: </strong>This powerful retelling of King Lear uses Indigenous languages and creoles to transport us to remote communities</p>",
        "headline":"The Shadow King – review",
        "body":"<p>To take one of Shakespeare's most tormented tragedies and indigenise it is an ambitious project: King Lear has, during various historical periods, been thought so dark as to be considered unperformable; a tale of greed, corruption, deception, violence and death. Could it be transposed to an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory and remain both watchable and true in its telling?<br /> <br />For the most part, the answer is yes. For their reworking of this tale, co-creators Tom E. Lewis and Michael Kantor have worked with the cast to rewrite the script in a mixture of Indigenous languages and creoles which transport us to the remote communities. Coupled with the use of song, the poetry of the Shakespearean text is retained, yet effectively transformed. <br /> <br />The audience is also transported through video imagery and design. The costumes are heavily influenced by the remote communities – on seeing Lear (played by Lewis) in his cowboy shirt and \"deadly\" white suit, and the colourful tropical prints of his daughters Goneril, Regan and Cordelia I was reminded of many characters I know in the NT. At a particularly brutal moment of the story, characters enter wearing army camouflage – a possible reference to the beginnings of the NT Intervention, which left many remote community members feeling violated when Army rolled in to take control.<br /> <br />The centrepiece of the set, an imposing mining truck, serves wonderfully as an additional character in the play. Not only does it create a barrier between Lear and his two eldest daughters once they have his wealth – not unlike the family divisions caused by mining and land ownership in so many communities – but its bright lights, when fixed on the audience, are blinding; creating moments  of viewer discomfort to great dramatic effect. That a piece of machinery designed for generating wealth and manipulating land is the focal point for human destruction echoes the show's overall message. To quote Kantor in the programme: \"We cannot own the land; the land owns us\".<br /> <br />This idea is explored in a beautifully choreographed scene. After descending into madness and being cast adrift in the wilderness, Lear is reminded by Cordelia that he belongs to the land. As the red dust swirls and Lear dances and sings, the audience journey with him as he becomes healthy and whole again. Juxtaposed with destructive wealth generation and evil plotting, and Lear's other daughters and Edmund, this scene has great resonance.<br /> <br />The cast is full of seasoned Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander performers. To a dark script they bring humour, depth and irony. Frances Djulibing as a female Gloucester adds warmth and soul to her character that nicely counteracts Lewis' reactive and flighty Lear. Jimi Bani's Edmund switches from comic relief to megalomaniacal manipulator in mere seconds. The stand-out is Kamahi Djordon King, whose delightful portrayal of the Fool – at times the absolute wisest person on stage – is cheeky, vexing and wonderfully camp. It is therefore fitting that the Fool gets the final say; sending the audience off with much to ponder.<br /> <br />There are a few issues. The textual decision to use pregnancy as the focus for death for one of the characters jarred. Perhaps because it is earlier implied that the character was previously sexually violated, the decision seems to add to that earlier moment unnecessarily and disturbingly.<br /> <br />The Shadow King is a challenging piece of work. It takes the audience on a journey to remote parts of this country, exploring some key issues facing Indigenous communities at centre stage. The use of a Shakespearean classic to tell an Indigenous tale of family destruction, greed, corruption and deception works strikingly well and makes the tale more accessible to a broader audience.<br /> <br />If viewers are not familiar with King Lear, this production still offers much in its story, its construction and its characterisation for people to walk away satisfied and reflective. But more than anything, this is a production that tells us how greed corrupts and healing is achievable by remembering where you're from. <br /><a href=\"http://www.melbournefestival.com.au/program/genre/theatre/the-shadow-king.html\"><br />• The Shadow King plays at Malthouse, Melbourne until October 27.</a> It will then tour to Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420205347|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|c358b3cbb112037eeff30e151228cc4b4816c868 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>When did you discover you were funny?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>Still waiting.</p><p></p><p><strong>What was your big breakthrough?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>My first paid gig, 26 years ago, at the Royal Oak in Islington, London. I got £25 and was delighted.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you suffer for your art?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>Yes. Before a gig there's nervousness, tension, dread. Comedians generally don't live that long: there's a lot of travel, a lot of Ginsters sandwiches. It's a bit like being a long-distance lorry driver, but with more stress at the end of the journey.</p><p></p><p><strong>You're an \"alternative\" comedian. What does this actually mean?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>I believe the phrase was invented by the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzFRr8IVqJw\" title=\"\">comedian Tony Allen</a> and has vanished a bit now. It came out of the new-wave punk-rock scene, and the fact that there were clubs being set up in pub back rooms. The difference lay in the ownership of jokes: alternative comedians wrote their own, and fights would break out if another comic tried to steal one; while mainstream comedians shared material.</p><p><strong>What's the biggest threat to comedy today?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>Itself: it might just pop like a bubble. And TV, maybe. A promoter told me recently that people used to go out to their local comedy club without caring who was on, but now they might only go to see someone they've seen on TV. But I think people will always love being in an audience: there's something magical about being in a room with a group of people, all laughing at the same thing.</p><p></p><p><strong>What's the biggest myth about being a comedian?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>That you're a repository for jokes. All taxi drivers say: \"Oh, you're a comedian, are you? Here's one for you.\" It's a bit like saying to someone: \"Oh, you're a boxer, are you? Let me punch you.\" Off-duty, I try to be as unfunny as I can.</p><p></p><p><strong>What work of art would you most like to own?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>I really wouldn't want to own a work of art, or anything else of beauty or value. I have three children under 10. Nothing in our house is safe from crayons.</p><p><strong>Do you do comedy for the money or the love?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>I'm not sure any more. I drifted into it because I loved it and I still do, but after a while – say 10 years – it's how you earn a living. The wind changes and you're stuck like that. It's still more for the love than the money, but I need the money – I've got crayons to buy.</p><p></p><p><strong>What's the worst thing anyone ever said about you?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>A reviewer once said my \"rudimentary guitar-playing does not redeem shoddy lyrics\". I was flattered by the bit about the guitar – I only started playing since I lost the use of my left hand due to nerve damage, and I can't really play a chord. But I disagreed with \"shoddy lyrics\". I was so angry I wrote a reply, but never bothered sending it.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is there anything about your career you regret?</strong><br /><strong> </strong>I wish it had gone better.</p><p></p><h2>CV</h2><p><strong>Born: </strong>Middlesex, 1967</p><p><strong>Career: </strong>Has performed regularly as a stand-up and on TV and radio since joining Footlights at Cambridge University. Best known for creating such comic characters as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrf-PRYPxr8\" title=\"\">Alan Parker: Urban Warrior</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vvE5zwmuOU\" title=\"\">The League Against Tedium</a>. His latest show <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY3pJSecitg\" title=\"\">Fylm</a> is at the Phoenix, Exeter, tomorrow, then touring (<a href=\"http://simonmunnery.com\" title=\"\">simonmunnery.com</a>).</p><p><strong>Low point:</strong> \"A gig at a college in Preston. The only laugh I got was when I fell off the stage, hit my shin on a table, and lay on the floor bleeding.\"</p><p><strong>High point:</strong> \"That same gig – I realised there was no need for jokes.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420033487|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|17d331f31ceb6b890df17232cabc52b2ce414f33 -->",

        "body":"<p>What happens when control of war falls into &ldquo;private hands&rdquo;? Two Iraqi women, Marou Awanis and Geneva Jalal, were shot dead in their car on Tuesday 9 October 2007 as they were travelling through the streets of Baghdad on their way home from church. Awanis was driving; in the back were two young passengers who, from what we can tell, were students. The people who shot Awanis and Jalal were contractors for Unity Resources Group, an Australian company working in Iraq.</p> <p>The two contractors say they signalled to the car to stop, from a distance. Awanis did not stop &ndash; perhaps she did not understand what was happening. Forty bullets hit the car, 19 of which entered her body. Both women were killed but the passengers in the back survived.</p> <p>The women&rsquo;s deaths were reported in Australia, presumably because the shooters were Australian, but this is the sort of thing that happens in Iraq on a regular basis. An <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/ar/library/asset/MDE14/001/2008/ar/3f78611b-f1e9-11dc-adcd-cdafd0ab0dfe/mde140012008eng.pdf\">Amnesty International report</a> that mentions the shooting also discusses the issue of privatisation in official war zones. It might give you a sense of why we at version 1.0 &ndash; the company with which I am a performer &ndash; thought this was a really important story to tell.</p> <p>The story of Awanis and Jalal is the point of departure for The Vehicle Failed to Stop, our new work. We strive to make theatre that is as political as it is personal &ndash; we want people to be active participants in the democratic process. We are very true to our source material and, as verbatim theatre makers, we see our responsibility as being to preserve and protect the facts of a story through our text, in an involving and imaginative way.</p> <p>Our sources have included transcripts of congressional hearings, articles by reputable investigative journalists, documentaries, images, statistics, public documents, personal stories and facts that we have uncovered ourselves. This kind of factual material provides the textual basis of our work: we aim to shine the light in dark corners and ask difficult questions in a public arena.</p> <p>It seems incredible that a provision put into place in the early days of the US-led occupation of Iraq means that private &ldquo;security contractors&rdquo; have almost complete immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law. The deaths of Awanis and Jalal were investigated by the Iraqi interior ministry but punitive action was not taken, because the company &ldquo;admitted to and apologised&rdquo; for what had taken place.</p> <p>Our key responsibility is to develop a process and a product that asks the hard questions &ndash; most significantly whether democracy has become a commodity for export; if privatisation has now transgressed into the public policy arena; and what that means.</p> <p>We want to examine the issue of modern-day mercenaries. The concept of some people profiting from the misfortune of others, with immunity and impunity. And the profound lack of accountability that has been seen in the Iraq war and its aftermath.</p> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.carriageworks.com.au/?page=Event&amp;event=The-Vehicle-Failed-to-Stop\">The Vehicle Failed to Stop is at Carriageworks, Sydney, until 26 October.

        "body":"<p>There’s a bit of back story to the <a href=\"http://www.annaschwartzgallery.com/works/exhibitions?artist=135&amp;year=&amp;exhibition=419&amp;current=1&amp;c=s\">exhibition You Promised Me, and You Said a Lie to Me</a> at Anna Schwartz Gallery, Sydney. It’s curated by <a href=\"http://curatorsintl.org/collaborators/alexie_glass_kantor\">Alexie Glass-Kantor</a>, one of Australia’s most well regarded curators, newly appointed as executive director of Sydney’s <a href=\"http://www.artspace.org.au/\">Artspace</a> after a successful seven-year tenure at the helm of Melbourne’s Gertrude Contemporary.</p> <p>Glass-Kantor has an impressive CV and a long list of curatorial projects to her credit, the latest of which was her co-directorship with the Art Gallery of NSW’s Natasha Bullock of <a href=\"http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/2012/visual_arts/adelaide_biennial_parallel_collisions?event=2012-parallel-collisions\">Parallel Collisions</a>, the 2012 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, and <a href=\"http://www.gertrude.org.au/exhibitions/gallery-11/past-14/city-within-the-city.phps\">City Within the City</a>, a show of Korean contemporary art as her swansong at Gertrude. It’s unlikely Glass-Kantor would have known that her return to Sydney would be heralded by a show with Schwartz, a commercial space with a penchant for high-concept exhibitions, but perhaps as a mission statement You Promised Me … is an indication of things to come.</p> <p>Featuring six international artists and one Australian, <a href=\"http://www.annaschwartzgallery.com/works/exhibitions?artist=135&amp;year=&amp;work=13754&amp;exhibition=419&amp;page=1&amp;text=1&amp;future=1&amp;c=s\">the idea of You Promised Me …</a> is to put into dialogue work by artists whose practices “address instances of agency, resistance and vulnerability in the face of interpersonal and political authority”. This translates into as work that is, on first glance, decidedly ambiguous. Walking around the space it’s striking how much the individual pieces conform to the familiar styles and riffs of contemporary art but come together in a cohesive way – unlike, say <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2013/sep/26/primavera-2013-review-mca\">the recent Primavera show</a> that was similarly staged in a single room but looked like a hodgepodge of random stuff.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-45c52a28-1535-4995-b04e-06e3592e3012\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381834065822/You-Promised-Me-You-Said--008.jpg\" alt=\"You Promised Me, You Said A Lie\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Heman Chong: Cover (Versions). Photograph: the artist and Anna Schwartz Gallery</figcaption> </figure> <p>Quite how that happens is a little difficult to unpick at first. The room is dominated by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.skny.com/artists/laurent-grasso/images/\">Laurent Gasso’s</a>&nbsp;huge sculpture that bears in neon the words “visibility is a trap”. It’s the first and last work you see in the show – you literally have to walk around it – and it simply means that what you see isn’t necessarily what is meant. Ming Wong’s video&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzcx2Vi-V3A\">Persona Performa (Actress’ Entrance)</a>&nbsp;sits next to it, a ghostly video collage of model’s bodies and faces moving toward the camera, which in turn sits next to Jane and Louise Wilson’s long line of images False Positives and False Negatives (2012), photographs of the artists’ faces painted with a kind of camouflage that confuses surveillance cameras.</p> <p>The images are overlaid with frames from security footage of the Mossad assassination of a Hamas leader in Dubai in 2010. Sitting in front of these images, on a concrete pillar, is a bronze replica of a camera that belonged to Vladimir Shevchenko, a Soviet filmmaker&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbCcutzXzYg\">who recorded images of Chernobyl</a>. His camera became so irradiated it had to be buried – the Wilson’s bronze version is a tribute to the denial of seeing.</p> <p>In Heman Chong’s Cover (Versions) the artist uses the rectangular format of the paperback, creating a series of paintings that look like a vast array of book covers, complete with title and author’s name overlaid on an abstract, patterned background. They bring to mind the stylish reissue book covers commonly used by publishers, and Chong’s facsimiles are convincing.</p> <p>But there’s a bigger project behind this work and the random textless paintings inserted into the sequence are the clue: this is more about an idea of abstraction and what it means for painting as an object. We may well regard a book as being something substantial – the weighty tomes of philosophy and literature found within – but could we say the same for a purely abstract painting devoid of text? In this case, you can’t really tell a book by its cover because it's a painting.</p> <p>Haegue Yang’s large installation Strange Fruit – a forest of silver stands adorned with lights and plastic plants – remains utterly unapproachable, even with a portentous explanation of its meaning in the catalogue. The siting of Susan Jacob’s delicate Ded Reckoning next to Yang’s work does neither any favours, while Jesse Jones’s video Predicament of Man (2010), similarly makes little rational sense, even with an explanation of its process. It does however have a undeniable presence – a long pan over the Australian desert with images flashing in the edit like a throwback to Eduardo Paolozzi collages, and a soundtrack with an eerie fragment of music repeating over a three-minute loop.</p> <p>Although Grasso’s Visibility is a Trap towers over the exhibition, it is Jones’s work that I find most compelling – which is perhaps an insight into Glass-Kantor’s success as a curator. As much as we might want contemporary art to “mean” something, and do so deliberately, it’s also an aesthetic experience that connects to an irrational, emotional state; that goes beyond language to the experience of seeing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420008741|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|17b5a685acb02b63141fa9df9bcce47ead4f158a -->",

        "headline":"Super Fun Night: Rebel Wilson, but not as you know her",
        "body":"<p>Overseas reaction to Rebel Wilson&rsquo;s new sitcom Super Fun Night was mild to say the least. When the premiere episode aired on the US network ABC, critics met it with such <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/articles/super-fun-night,103488/\">bold proclamations</a> as: &ldquo;[It] isn&rsquo;t a particularly terrific episode of television, but it more or less tells a coherent story,&rdquo; which is basically what a big shrug looks like in syntax.</p> <p>Unfortunately, based on last night&rsquo;s local debut, the response seems accurate. The show, which follows the misadventures of Wilson&rsquo;s loserly lawyer Kimmie Boubier (obviously pronounced &ldquo;boobie-yay&rdquo;) and her equally awkward friends, Helen-Alice and Marika, is American network comedy at its most predictable: goofy flashbacks, lazy sight gags, and a grating wacky tone that&rsquo;s all YouTube viral video &ndash; or one of those annoying beer ads that&rsquo;s based on a YouTube viral video.</p> <p>The episode&rsquo;s blandness was perhaps even more disappointing for Australian viewers so familiar with Wilson&rsquo;s eccentric potential. Super Fun Night shows barely little sign of the unique (and often awesomely inappropriate) sensibility that made Wilson such a likeable TV star at home through bit parts on the sketch show <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Mq4J4OpaA\">The Wedge</a>, those hilariously bumbling Telstra ads that ran during Australian, and, perhaps most memorably, the oddball SBS musical Bogan Pride, where she played <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc7r4HFhzb4\">young schoolgirl Jennie Cragg</a>, who enters a dance comp to win prize money for her mum&rsquo;s stomach-stapling operation.</p> <p>Obviously, the world of big money US network TV is very different from SBS&rsquo;s general schedule of A-League highlights, samurai films and Euro erotica, and it&rsquo;s no doubt most to blame for the show&rsquo;s muted personality. In <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/09/can-rebel-wilson-create-a-sitcom-outcast.html\">her recent New York Magazine cover story</a>, Wilson herself bemoaned the &ldquo;notes thing&rdquo; prevalent in American TV, with jokes and creative decisions being regularly overruled by network suits, even despite having bigtime producer and cult late night host Conan O&rsquo;Brien in her corner.</p> <p>&ldquo;I like to be edgy, and ABC says, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t do this or that on network TV, and I say, &lsquo;Why?&rsquo;&rdquo; Wilson revealed in the feature. &ldquo;Everyone gives me notes: Conan gives notes. Warner Bros gives notes. In Australia, nobody gives notes.&rdquo;</p> <p>Note that, America: We are noteless! Still, despite the overseers&rsquo; constrictive gaze, there were promising glimpses of Wilson&rsquo;s little creative wins throughout the episode, most notably in delightfully blue throwaway gags like when she oddly mentioned the weight of her boobs (&ldquo;23 pounds&rdquo;... you guys work out the metric conversion), and her deadpan response when friend Marika asked her what she meant by &ldquo;that&rdquo; when singing Meatloaf&rsquo;s I Would Do Anything For Love, But I Won&rsquo;t Do That (&ldquo;Butt stuff.&rdquo;)</p> <p>Similarly, despite the potential tedium of another TV show set in a law firm &ndash; this might actually be an anecdotal touch from Wilson, who completed a law degree at the University of NSW while tentatively pursuing an acting career &ndash; the setting provides what&rsquo;s probably the show&rsquo;s biggest comedy catalyst: Kimmie&rsquo;s ongoing feud with office nemesis, Kendall Quinn (played by fellow Aussie, Kate Jenkinson). Jenkinson offers an appropriately hammy take on the unapologetically bitchy Kendall, and her warbly, R&amp;B-lite recital of True Colors was probably the episode&rsquo;s giggly highlight.</p> <p>More importantly, though, Kendall&rsquo;s presence instantly sets up Kimmie as a classic comedic underdog without the constant need for laboured flashbacks to childhood humiliation. With more of their rabid repartee, Wilson should be able to craft Kimmie into the kinda feisty lovable loser that viewers can get behind, like a less-dignified Liz Lemon or a Spanx-clad George Costanza. Let&rsquo;s just hope those network notes stop, so she can get some more arse jokes in there, too. The arse jokes are important.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420078618|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|87687b941c1acde451c75489e9655b83b49c226f -->",

        "body":"<p>Paul McCartney, musical icon and so-called “embarrassing uncle” of the UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/13/paul-mccartney-new-liverpool-nancy\">is out with a new album today</a>, <del>lifelessly</del>&nbsp;aptly&nbsp;titled New. Though the hackneyed title might be a sign of Macca’s age, after 45 albums and 35 No 1 hits, we’ll give him a pass for being out of ideas. McCartney's musical career spans more than 50 years, and in honor of his latest release, we're looking back at some of his most memorable moments.</p> <h2>1969: Paul is dead</h2> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6ah2qJKT31r6wv19o1_500.gif\" data-alt=\"Paul McCartney gif\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6ah2qJKT31r6wv19o1_500.gif&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;276&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> <p>In 1969, just a year before the Beatles split, American college students published articles claiming that clues to McCartney's death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles' recordings. In just a few weeks, clue-hunting Beatles fans created an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_is_dead\">international phenomenon</a>&nbsp;around Paul’s supposed death. One frequently cited clue is that John Lennon says &quot;I buried Paul&quot; at the end of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeZcI4u0ZQg\">Strawberry Fields</a>. In a disappointing climax to the whole charade, McCartney revealed the words were actually &quot;cranberry sauce&quot;. Blame the LSD.</p> <h2>The 1970s: simply Paul</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-272d80cc-99b9-4746-909a-90ed4b5be713\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381856173981/847be518-469a-42f4-9c58-d3a8cfcd4787-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul mcCartney\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>A young McCartney, mullet and everything. Photograph: /Getty images</figcaption> </figure> <p>After 1970, Paul wasted no time. He released a solo album, put out an LP with his wife, and formed a new band, Wings. Much of his music from his post-Beatles life received rave reviews. And&nbsp;though that trend didn’t last forever (we won’t even discuss <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9BZDpni56Y\">Wonderful Christmas Time</a>) ,some of these hits belong right up there with his Beatles work. Here are a few of our favorites:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/S7D65IomNYY\">Band on the Run</a>, Wings,&nbsp;Band on the Run (1973)</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8V1nFCP058&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Jet</a>, Wings, Band on the Run (1973)</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_kkp9S9a3w&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Silly Love Songs</a>, Wings, Wings at the Speed of Sound (1976)</li> <li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/cm2YyVZBL8U\">Maybe I’m Amazed</a>, Paul McCartney,&nbsp;McCartney (1970)</li> <li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/e7aGAIWe3uE\">Live and Let Die</a>, Wings, 1973</li> </ul> <h2>The 1980s: a meeting of two kings</h2> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLEhh_XpJ-0\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aLEhh_XpJ-0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>In 1983, the two kings of pop recorded this jam, featured on McCartney's fifth solo album,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipes_of_Peace\">Pipes of Peace</a>.&nbsp;To no one's surprise, the song quickly became worldwide No 1 hit. To everyone's surprise however, they made this weird video to accompany it.&nbsp;</p> <p>The duo play &quot;Mac and Jack&quot;, a pair of traveling con-men who sell a &quot;miracle potion&quot;. A&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe\">Boston Globe</a>&nbsp;critic stated the ridiculousness of a potion which could aid Jackson in beating somebody at arm wrestling, adding &quot;it's even harder to believe that the two of them didn't get the pulp beaten out of them in that bar for dressing like a pair of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_King\">Chess King</a>&nbsp;employees”. If you've never seen it, put on headphones and be amazed.&nbsp;</p> <p>As if this whole thing wasn't awkward enough already, in 1984 Michael Jackson out-bid Paul for the Northern Song Catalogue, aka the rights to all the Beatles songs.&nbsp;</p> <h2>The 1990s: going veg</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cf655cdb-a64c-499e-8c9e-93254985ccea\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381860289866/2357e477-e7d6-47d1-be58-aacc085e2c01-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Linda and paul \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Paul and Linda on their wedding day in 1969. Photograph: Rex Features</figcaption> </figure> <p>Throughout their 30-year marriage, Paul and Linda McCartney produced some stellar work (their daughter Stella, for example) and some not-so-stellar work (Off the Ground).</p> <p>But their legacy as a couple is probably their work on animal rights. Together, they were outspoken vegetarians and animal rights campaigners. Linda even started her own vegetarian food company, <a href=\"http://www.lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/\">Linda McCartney Foods</a>.</p> <p>The now infamous quote “if slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be vegetarian” has been attributed to both of them. Paul has also narrated Glass Walls, a <a href=\"http://www.peta.org/tv/videos/celebrities-vegetarianism/86975251001.aspx\">documentary</a> about the meat industry.</p> <h2>The 2000s: being 64</h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fc839e23-a364-4f9e-b77b-023722b79850\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381858293159/c59db225-616c-40d1-ae47-62d3f8d4de6e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul McCartney trying to stay young with girlfriend\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Paul McCartney: young, relevant. Photograph: /Splashnewsonline</figcaption> </figure> <p>The early part of the 21st century wasn't great for Paul. Linda died in 1998. He finally turned 64, married, re-married and started to do typical old-rocker-dude things like producing mediocre&nbsp;albums and touring a whole lot.&nbsp;</p> <h2>2013: New</h2> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mccartney new\"> <iframe width=\"368\" height=\"276\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/pE_1V0phMW8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>It’s too early to tell how New will do on the charts, but Rolling Stone has given it&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/new-20131015\">four stars&nbsp;</a>and our <a href=\"https://flexible.gutools.co.uk/admin/content/\">Alex Petridis</a> named it album of the week – a significant improvement from &quot;damp squib&quot;, which is how&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lukejennings\">Luke Jennings</a>&nbsp;described McCartney's ballet production. Macca isn't likely to slow down anytime soon, so if New isn't for you, just wait for the next album.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420048356|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|de550195b0fc560f766df5e238987a6df1f4e23a -->",

        "body":"<p>Professional funnywoman and writer Julieanne Smolinski has endured some dark situations in the name of culture news.</p> <p>Most notably, she was a member of the press corps on Rihanna's 777 tour, which was later recognized as the modern pop-music equivalent of Lord of the Flies. <a href=\"http://popdust.com/2012/11/19/rihanna-air-naked-in-the-aisles/\">A tale from Smolinksi's time on the road</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The wonderful, fantastic flight crew attempted to normalize our blood sugar by bringing us some odd, microwaved hoagie type things, but it was to no avail. The plane took on a weird smell, like hot processed cheese and fear. Finally, an Australian journalist named Tim stripped totally naked and ran up and down the aisles. In London, someone apparently passed out in customs around 5 or 6am, and following a bizarrely long bus ride from the airport, we swayed blearily in line for hotel rooms, sleepless since Paris or longer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last year, she busted open a scandal at the New York Times crossword puzzle when the paper equated the word &quot;illin&quot; with &quot;wack&quot;. She and Times puzzle editor Will Shortz <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5874539/new-york-times-crossword-puzzlemaster-schooled-on-definition-of-illin\">then&nbsp;engaged in the decade's most heated-lexicographic&nbsp;email battle</a>&nbsp;to determine the proper use of the word. The row&nbsp;was settled, in Smolinski's favor,&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/405890/january-12-2012/mike-d-s-hip-hop-semantics\">Beastie Boys' Mike D on The Colbert Report</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>In between these lexicographic duels and loads of writing projects, Smolinski doles out a daily dose of funny on Twitter as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boobsradley\">@BoobsRadley</a>.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BoobsRadley/statuses/286282377808998400\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>&quot;Their, their.&quot; - how to comfort an idiot.</p>— Julieanne Smolinski (@BoobsRadley) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BoobsRadley/statuses/286282377808998400\">January 2, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>These days, she's working on a book, and writing for an American version of the British show Sirens, which will air in 2014.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What was your first screen name?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>It was &quot;MmeMulder,&quot; which is very embarrassing to me now. I'm a feminist, so when David Duchovny and I marry in France, I plan to keep my name.</p> <h2><strong>What was your worst day ever?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>It's hard to pick a worst day. They're like my children. I think the best ones are just so over-the-top bad that they stop being days and become stories. Recently, I was having a nightmare day when a guy I'd written off texted and asked me to drinks. It was one of those, &quot;Maybe he does like me!&quot; things, where you shampoo <em>and</em> condition your hair and swan around your house getting ready, like a fat American Leslie Caron.</p> <p>It turned out he just wanted to tell me he was seeing someone, although he had to sort of yelled it, because we were seated right next to the lounge singers, who had just enthusiastically burst into All of Me, which until that moment was one of my favorite songs. I waved down the waitress and tried my iciest, &quot;Madam, the check please&quot; and she was like, &quot;Uhhhh, there's a two drink per person minimum.&quot; I ended up paying for, like, four martinis and $8 in parking. It was so horrible it was great.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What is your favorite smell?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>I'd like to say it's the chestnut vendors in autumn at the Jardin du Luxembourg, but if I'm being honest? Probably anything from Victoria's Secret's cruelly discontinued line of tropical body splashes.</p> <h2><strong>Who would you invite to your ideal dinner party?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>I am desperately awkward and clumsy around people I'd like to impress. Factor in the utensils, alcohol and cooking elements involved in hosting a dinner party, and you have a real Hindenburg situation on your hands. I can see the Page Six headline, like, 'Idiot Spills Hot Chicken Grease on Nicole Holofcener, Horribly Mutilates Cameron Crowe.' No thank you. Next question please.</p> <h2><strong>What cocktail are you most like and why?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>The fourth. I believe I'm best enjoyed after the first two or three.</p> <h2><strong>What are three items you will always find in your refrigerator?</strong></h2> <p>Water, multiple mustards, wilting pricy produce purchased with the purest intentions.</p> <h2><strong>What were you doing at midnight last night?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Working. I try to time my busiest hours to when other people are sleeping or having meaningful sex with one another.</p> <h2><strong>What did your last text message you received say?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>&quot;Please do!&quot;</p> <h2><strong>What is a word you say a lot?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>I would like to say it's not a swear, but I live in Los Angeles and often drive a vehicle.</p> <h2><strong>Who was your first crush?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Definitely not Dudley Moore in that Christmas movie where he plays a sad elf!&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What was your worst injury ever?</strong></h2> <p>Puberty.</p> <h2><strong>What is the last song you listened to?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>T Rex's Mambo Sun. I wish there were a funnier answer, but on the other hand, it feels good to end on a sincere note.&nbsp;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419952615|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|1e7fd8866bf1af2dc43536cf1541a21d8a9f40c8 -->",

        "body":"<p>Some traditions just don&rsquo;t get the respect they deserve. For the past couple of decades, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/15/flume-aka-harley-streten-dominates-aria-award-nominations\">the announcement of the Aria nominations</a> were greeted by people pretending to celebrate Australian music.&nbsp;Mainstream radio stations would swiftly add some nominated songs to their playlists and insist they&rsquo;d singlehandedly discovered them. Magazines would do features on how we should either Meet the New Breed (young new acts got nominations) or Hail the Old Guard (mainly established acts).&nbsp;People would have arguments about the representation of women in Australian rock, discuss whether Triple J used to be better (spoiler: like everything else in Australian music, it did) and, most of all, rant about how Aria was obviously out of touch.</p> <p>These days, however, the Arias no longer provoke quite such reaction. The ceremony is no longer a key event on the Channel 10 schedule &ndash; this year it will be screened on digital station GO! On December 1 &ndash; and record companies no longer spend the sort of advertising dollars that make magazines keen to invent stories about the renaissance of Australian music. Commercial radio, meanwhile, seems perfectly content to assume that new local talent is developed entirely by The Voice.</p> <p>This month we had the Air awards &ndash; or, to give them their full name, the Carlton Dry Independent Music awards &ndash; the alternative Arias where the argument about what constitutes &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in a world where a good advertising sync is more valuable than a major record label deal grows ever more heated.&nbsp;</p> <p>The big winner was Flume, nom de rock of Sydney bedroom electronica producer Harley Streten, who won three of his five nominations. That was hardly a shock: Flume scored four places in this year&rsquo;s Hottest 100 on Triple J and his self-titled album topped the Aria charts and has already gone platinum.</p> <p>Equally unsurprising is that Flume is the most nominated artist in this year&rsquo;s Aria awards. He&rsquo;s up for eight categories, including album of the year, best male artist and breakthrough artist: Release. If you&rsquo;re betting on a win, Flume for album of the year seems like a reasonable wager &ndash; although it's likely he'll take male artist and breakthrough as well.</p> <p>Close behind are Perth collective Tame Impala, in the running for album of the year with Lonerism &ndash; which I'd argue they certainly deserve &ndash; as well as best group. Despite their many nominations, they&rsquo;re probably dark horses in just about every category.</p> <p>Fellow Perthians Birds of Tokyo pretty much have best rock album sewn up for March Fires and are also in the running for best group and album of the year. They&rsquo;re tied with the most nominated &ldquo;heritage act&rdquo;: Aria hall of famer Nick Cave has taken six nods for last year&rsquo;s Bad Seeds album Push the Sky Away, which is also up for album of the year, and will almost certainly win in the frustratingly difficult-to-define adult contemporary abum category.</p> <p>The field is far more open in best female artist without a clean-sweeping Delta, Missy or Kylie to take out the field. Sarah Blasko seems like a solid bet though, although Missy Higgins has also been nominated in the category. It's probably not Samantha Jade's year but then neither is 2014 likely to be, since that&rsquo;s when Lorde&rsquo;s going to take out every category there is &ndash; assuming, of course, that she gets the honorary Australian title that we assign to New Zealanders when they break big internationally. Isn't that right, Kimbra? Wouldn't you say, Ladyhawke?</p> <p>Other safe-ish bets are Kasey Chambers and Shane Nicholson for best country album, Guy Sebastian for best pop album, the Cat Empire for best blues and roots and Bliss n Eso for best urban &ndash; in genre categories, name recognition is as important as the quality of work.</p> <p>How does the 2013 Aria list compare with previous years? A couple of heavily nominated newcomers are set to dominate their categories, a few recognisable names who should have won big last year (good luck with the best rock album nomination, Rubens), and some familiar names you&rsquo;ve missed for a while (David Bridie, congrats on the best original soundtrack nod).</p> <p>Plus, of course, some weird omissions worth arguing over, like the comparative lack of nominations for the Drones this year despite I See Seaweed being amazing. And a reminder that the last year&rsquo;s seen some amazingly Australian good music. So: much like every other year, really.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419971087|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|405d64f7ee2147f8976371d84509fd3d5b4addf7 -->",

        "headline":"In Spite of Myself by Nicola Gunn",
        "body":"<p>For last year's Melbourne fringe festival, Nicola Gunn led a one-woman performance assault upon Theatre Works with her side-splittingly shambolic show Hello My Name Is, blending a post-dramatic comedy-of-manners with performance art and clowning. </p><p>The beloved St Kilda shed was the perfect venue for Gunn to explore the place of community in community-arts practice: she recruited the audience into costuming her as a Care Bear, there was synchronised basket-weaving, a life-drawing sex confessional and ping-pong. (In my case, with my local Member of Parliament, each as gloriously displaced as the other, paddling for life.)</p><p>Twelve months later, Gunn has matched her ascension to the official festival programme with subject matter that neatly dissembles the elitist assumptions of its Arts Centre site. This is Gunn versus the narrow universe of discourse that is academic high-art practice and consideration; a show in which she appears as curator and academic of her own work in the form of her alter-ego, Susan Becker. </p><p>Becker, wearing what can only be described as a post-structuralist pencil skirt and a wig reminiscent of Julie Christie's Shampoo bob, is appearing at the festival to present a contextualized retrospective of the work of \"the artist known as Nicola Gunn\". The validation of the Melbourne Festival platform allows her to speak total nonsense, most authoritatively.</p><p>It's hilarious. Anyone who has sat through an arts lecture containing the words \"phenomenology\" and \"performativity\" is immediately in on the joke; those lucky enough to escape that particular discursive cul-de-sac get it soon enough, as Gunn embraces the language of academia with a fearless Edward Learesque joy. </p><p>Her delight in nonsense inspires the brilliance of her physical clowning, too – the show begins with a Spanish karaoke rendition of Cher's hit My Baby Shot Me Down that evolves into a highland fling with Gunn's dress tucked into her underpants. Any doubt this is comedy disappears in the face of performance art \"hopenings\" in which Gunn gives herself carpet burn, pretends to be a blanket while wearing a Snuggy, and dances around the Arts Centre singing \"I Am Happy\" while whipping herself with limp celery. </p><p>This is a show, like Gunn's others, that exists on many and complex levels: you can enjoy it simply as a funny clown show, or as a sophisticated comic meta-critique examining the validity of art. And she is perhaps the first artist in history to provide live academic endnotes as a means of contextualising her buffoonery while she crawls into an onstage bed for a nap.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419967558|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|4078f912a16996a123fa025abbffb95e1d2fd901 -->",

        "body":"<p>Eleanor Catton's life swerved off its expected course almost exactly 12 hours before our meeting, the morning after her novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/11/luminaries-eleanor-catton-review\" title=\"\">The Luminaries</a> – a virtuoso work set amid the 1860s New Zealand gold rush – was named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/booker-prize-eleanor-catton-luminaries\" title=\"\">the winner of the 2013 Man Booker prize</a>.</p><p>When the moment came , the TV cameras showed a face as still as a marble sculpture, pinned into immobility by shock. Then she dove into her handbag and rootled through it until she found her acceptance speech, which she delivered in a clear but tremulous voice. \"The superstitious part of me didn't want to make the speech too easy to find,\" she explains. \"At the same time I knew I'd never be able to relax if I hadn't prepared something. At times of emotional intensity I need a script.\"</p><p>A person who radiates immense self-possession and quiet authority, she looks fresh and bright, despite only two-and-a-half hours' sleep; she cheerily attributes that to the fact that she hasn't taken off last night's makeup. She slept through her alarm, and more or less bundled herself into a cab for a breakfast-time radio interview, raking the previous night's pins from her hair as she did so.</p><p>Twelve hours ago Catton was a promising young writer, with two mostly well-received novels under her belt (the first, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/18/rehearsal-eleanor-catton-review\" title=\"\">The Rehearsal</a>, revolved around the figures on the periphery of a school sexual scandal). Now, she's a phenomenon. At 28, she's the youngest ever Man Booker-winning author with the longest-ever novel. She is only the second New Zealander to win it, after Keri Hulme, who was awarded it the year she was born. She has £50,000 in her pocket, and her book, having been a modest seller, has zoomed straight to the top of the Amazon sales ranking.</p><p>The win will mean, finally, a room of her own. At the moment she and her partner, <a href=\"http://steventoussaint.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the American poet Steven Toussaint</a>, whom she met when they were both studying at the <a href=\"http://www.uiowa.edu/~iww/\" title=\"\">Iowa Writers' Workshop</a>, rent a two-bedroom apartment in Auckland. While he works towards his PhD in poetry, \"He gets the study, that's the deal. So at the moment I don't have one. The idea of being able to move into a bigger place is extremely exciting.\"</p><p>With the prize also comes that mixed blessing, fame, and she's already bothered by the uneven treatment accorded to men and women in the public eye.</p><p>\"I have observed that male writers tend to get asked what they think and women what they feel,\" she says. \"In my experience, and that of a lot of other women writers, all of the questions coming at them from interviewers tend to be about how lucky they are to be where they are – about luck and identity and how the idea struck them. The interviews much more seldom engage with the woman as a serious thinker, a philosopher, as a person with preoccupations that are going to sustain them for their lifetime.\"</p><p>And then there is the question of her youth. Though generally well-received in Britain, The Luminaries, she said, was subject to a \"bullying\" reception from certain male reviewers of an older generation – particularly in her native New Zealand. \"People whose negative reaction has been most vehement have all been men over about 45,\" she says.</p><p>\"One of those things that you learn in school about any kind of bullying is that it's always more to do with them than it is to do with you. I don't see that my age has anything to do with what is between the covers of my book, any more than the fact that I am right-handed. It's a fact of my biography, but it's uninteresting.\"</p><p>It is the peculiar constellation of her age, gender and the particular nature of The Luminaries that has, she believes, provoked \"a sense of irritation from some critics – that I have been so audacious to have taken up people's time by writing a long book. There's a sense in there of: 'Who do you think you are? You can't do that.' Something else related to that is to do with the omniscient third person narration of the book. There's a feeling of: 'All right, we can tolerate [this] from a man over 50, but we are not going to be spoken to like that by <em>you</em>.'\"</p><p>The Luminaries is, at the plot level, a page-turning, suspenseful story about a series of unsolved crimes, written in the manner of a Victorian sensation novel. In January 1866, in the New Zealand gold-rush town of Hokitika, a Scot called Moody walks into a hotel smoking room to find 12 men ruminating on a series of mysterious events: the disappearance of a rich prospector, the death of a wealthy recluse, the beating to a pulp of a prostitute. All the men are connected to these events and bound to each other.</p><p>The novel has an entirely original organising principle: each chapter is preceded by an astrological chart and each character is associated with a heavenly body; the characters act in accordance with the actual movements of the cosmos as they were, starting on 27 January 1866. At the same time, the novel is organised in 12 parts, each half the length of the previous one – thus the novel itself wanes.</p><p>These principles may look tricksy or artificial when described rather than experienced but are not, says Catton, an \"exoskeleton\" – rather they are entirely bound up with the ideas of the book. \"The paradox is,\" she says, \"the relationship between, on the one hand,  the characters being the masters of their fates, and on the other hand that being predetermined.\" She talks of the astrological structure as being akin to a structure a composer might work within, and mentions her interest in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567\" title=\"\">Gödel Escher Bach</a>, which explores patterns and systems in the work of the mathematician, artist and composer.</p><p>\"One of the most baffling things is when people assume that when something is structurally ornate it is less human than something that is not structurally ornate,\" she says. \"That puzzles me – I feel as a person the most alive and human and full of wonder when I am contemplating complexities. The ability of humans to read meaning into patterns is the most defining characteristic we have.\"</p><p>It's the seriousness of Catton's work that strikes you when talking to her – her belief in the novel both as a \"builder of empathy\" and as a carrier of ideas. When I spoke to one of the Man Booker judges, critic Stuart Kelly, he said that it was her ability to \"make the novel think in a way that the novel doesn't do normally\" that set her apart; the way that, for example, she sets astrology and capitalism into play as competing systems of dealing with the world, but at the same time has produced \"a rip-roaring read\". \"The prize went to the true avant-gardist,\" he said. \"No novel has been like this before.\"</p><p>For Catton – the daughter of a philosopher and a librarian – the novel is a tool for thinking with, as well as feeling with. \"It is in my view a much better vehicle for philosophy than syllogisms and logical constructs,\" she says.</p><p>\"What I like about fiction most is that it resists closure and exists, if the reader is willing to engage, as a possible encounter - an encounter that is like meeting a human being.\"</p><p><em>Correction: In an earlier version of this article, Keri Hulme's surname was spelt incorrectly.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420152512|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|74d01a06a0d2080af11896a2f7cc75b1a367ae0e -->",

The funny bits all come early, courtesy of James Thurber's original short story, whose comic conceit still chugs along as reliably as a Mini Coupe after all these years. Thurber takes only two-and-a-half pages for Mitty to imagine himself out-flying a storm, performing life-saving surgery, and bombing German ammunition dumps, all the while making it only as far as his local supermarket to buy puppy biscuits — an image of a dreamer softly defeated. The story has always represented something of a false Grail for Hollywood, where they love the sound of all that dreaming, but are less enamoured by the prospect of its defeat. And so it proves here. </p><p>In Stiller's version, Mitty is a photographic archivist for Time magazine who dreams of a life beyond his cubicle — saving children from burning buildings, or bursting through ice-flows, blue eyes boring into his co-worker crush Cheryl (Kristin Wiig). </p><p>As a comedian Stiller comes most zingingly alive at the prospect of male vanity, which may be why Zoolander remains one of the sacred texts of modern American cinema, not least for Terrence Malick, <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/terrence_malick_documentary_voyage_of_time_still_in_the_works_hes_also_a\">who rewatches it with the same religious zeal the rest of us rewatch Tree of Life, Days of Heaven and Badlands</a>. 'Tis a strange world. Similarly inspired is the casting of Sean Penn as the magazine's star photo-journalist, Sean O' Connell, bullishly muscling his way through warzones like the voice of Mitty's self-reproach made manifest. The pairing of the two stars has a delicious perpendicularity. If Ben Stiller is intent on beating himself up for not being somebody — then that somebody, you figure, is surely going to be Sean Penn. </p><p>Working with Jane Campion's cinematographer, Stuart Dryburgh, Stiller films himself small in the frame, frequently viewed from above, more mouse than man, scurrying through the vast modernist spaces of the Time-Life building like the long lost cousin of Jacques Tati in Playtime, whose sleek, slate-grey production design this movie meticulously evokes — a haunting talisman. Playtime was Tati's last film, a ruinously expensive bid for respectability that gave off the empty rattle of perfectionism — pratfalls echoing tinnily through lavish, empty sets. Stiller's film is certainly a looker — there are dissolves that would make Orson Welles blush — but how good-looking does comedy need to be exactly?  As with his last film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125574/tropic.thunder\">Tropic Thunder</a>, the production values sometimes appear to be the joke. There's a battle on the streets of Manhattan involving man-hole covers and Stretch Armstrong — don't ask — whose special effects would be the envy of Michael Bay, but does the money make the sequence funnier? It doesn't make it unfunnier, I suppose. It's just expensive. </p><p> The weird stuff starts at the halfway mark, after Mitty loses one of O Connell's negatives on the eve of a corporate takeover, and jets off to Iceland for a high seas adventure battling sharks and volcanoes — so sudden is the pivot, in fact, that you were to take a toilet break at this point you would spend the rest of the film in a state of unending, head-scratching perplexity. There are two problems with this besides precipitousness. Firstly: with Mitty's real life now as zoomily adventurous as his fantasy life, the laughs begin to dry up. In their place we get the usual rom-comish exhortations to break out of your shell, reach out, connect and whatnot, all of which would be more convincing were it not that what we get in the second hour is basically a series of solo adventures, with Mitty skateboarding through Greenland's mountain ranges to the sound of Jose Gonzales, alone, like someone rocking out to their Walkman, or hiking up the Himalayas, and confiding in his diary, \"I'm alone.\" It's very odd. This has to be one of the loneliest odes to togetherness ever made. </p><p>Wiig checks in with him by phone every now and again — she's also the star of an imaginary sequence, lip-synching David Bowie's Major Tom — but couldn't Mitty's real-life adventures have included her at some point? There's also an eHarmony technician played by Patton Oswalt, whose relationship with him is another long-distance phoner. \"Wow, you're not how I pictured you,\" says Oswalt upon finally meeting Mitty, his chin now brushed with stubble, Fairisle sweater bringing out the blue of his eyes. \"Its like Indiana Jones became the lead singer of the Strokes.\" At such points the daydreams of Walter Mitty seem to shimmer and crackle like a bad radio signal, interrupted by the far more urgent daydreams of Ben Stiller, Gen X star staring down middle age, keen to show a generation weaned on Wes Anderson flicks that he still has the skateboard moves, camera angles and musical tastes to cut it. I kept on expecting cut-aways from those mountain ranges, not to Mitty dreaming in his office, but Stiller half-asleep at the press junket for Meet the Parents 5, dreaming of better things. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty both is that better thing, and isn't — it's too airless, too perfect, a dream of connection with humanity that flees contact with actual people.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420014140|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|ed246c315f3871d216f105ad092b61c3e38f81e7 -->",

Sometimes patronised as kids' stuff, the genre seeks to look beyond the parochialism of most realist drama: to see other worlds and other existences, and therefore to look with a new, radically alienated eye at our own. Maybe something in the limitless possibilities of cinema itself spawned sci-fi.</p><p>George Meliès's A Trip to the Moon (1902) was one of early cinema's biggest hits. In the middle of the 20th century, sci-fi inhabited the B-picture world of monsters and rockets and intuited a \"red scare\" anxiety about aliens. At the end of the 60s, Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey broke through into a new level of poetry and wonder. Films like Dark Star and Alien worked a satirical, pessimistic darkness into sci-fi, but George Lucas and Steven Spielberg together expressed its lighter, more hopeful strain.</p><p>In the 21st century, the Wachowskis' The Matrix sequels and Christopher Nolan's Inception have explored new, interior landscapes: the inner world of the mind may be the genre's new frontier.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77528/matrix\">10.

What's missing? Girls in skin-tight PVC catsuits? Nope: The Matrix has those, too. </p><p>By cherrypicking as many key ingredients from action films as they could (the us-against-the-machines mentality from The Terminator, the wire work from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the star from Johnny Mnemonic), and shooting it through with a timely dose of pre-millennial unease, the directors single-handedly managed to reinvigorate an entire genre. The sight of Arnold Schwarzenegger lunkheadedly charging through armies of ineffectual goons started to look embarrassingly tired. The Matrix marks the point where fans demanded more – they wanted to see themselves on screen. And that's why the casting of Keanu Reeves was a masterstroke. He might be pretty, but he's no one-man army. Plus: Neo is totally an anagram of \"One\".

A time-travel thriller, whose closed-circuit-in-time mechanism is a straight lift from Chris Marker's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76696\">La Jetée</a>, its more cerebral notions – man versus machine, grey matter versus computer, past versus present versus future – are cleverly pondered alongside some of the most visceral and exciting action sequences ever filmed. And the monster, unstoppable and remorselessly murderous, can take on the voices of others, and later (in the sequel), even adopt their outward fleshly appearance, allowing it to take on the form of LAPD cops, step-moms, pet dogs, and who knows what else.</p><p>The follow-up, made for zillions more dollars, was a smash on a far larger scale, offering a metal-based morphing psycho robot (Robert Patrick) and a more sympathetic Schwarzenegger cyborg, this time assigned to protect, not destroy future rebel leader John Connor (Edward Furlong). One of the most likable aspects of this and several other Cameron features is his eagerness to put a tough, resourceful and sexy woman at the head of the cast – look at the muscle tone on that Sarah Connor in Judgment Day! – and never permit anyone to rescue her. State-of-the-art in their day, they still pack a knockout punch. <strong>John Patterson</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36315/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind\">8. Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167327'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/19/close10a.jpg' alt='Close encounters of the third kind, directed by Steven Spielberg (1977)' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Steven Spielberg revived and revitalised the alien-invasion genre after the 50s rush of raygun-wielding creature features. In his luminous 1977 special-effects extravaganza, he saw alien contact as a gateway to new knowledge, new experiences and a higher consciousness.</p><p>Its suburban hero Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is both an everyman and a prophet, a family guy who is haunted by sounds – the film's signature five-note whale call – and images of a rock formation in Wyoming, to the horror of his wife and their children. Spielberg flirts with thriller conventions, though this is ultimately a cosy ride, lightened by a spirit of evangelical zeal concerning Neary's obsession, while the encounter itself plays out like an intellectual version of the rapture, in which only true believers are taken by the sylph-like visitors.</p><p>The film is also as close as Spielberg gets to social comment, and the ending – expanded for the 1980 \"special edition\" – sees Neary, after an unpleasant grilling by the government and the military, turning his back on a US where Watergate and Vietnam were still recent and painful memories. <strong>Damon Wise</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars\">7. Star Wars</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167328'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/26/1380216066648/Mark-Hamill-as-Luke-Skywa-007.jpg' alt='Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars film' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The original Star Wars (let's not bother with this Episode IV: A New Hope subheading nonsense) lays its cards on the table with its opening shot: a gigantic, evil-looking spaceship chasing down a far smaller craft. Like the rest of the movie, you could watch it with the sound off and completely follow what was going on. It's the purity of the story that has made this film endure, the classic themes handed down through the ages. It may be dressed up with robots, spaceships and trash compactors, but it's the old-as-time hero journey – George Lucas has said he consciously modelled his screenplay on Joseph Campbell's study of comparative mythology The Hero With a Thousand Faces.</p><p>In the cynical 70s, the notion of making a movie that mixed Kurosawa and Flash Gordon must have sounded as ludicrous as it does today. The film industry wasn't ready for such an ambitious technical feat (at such a modest budget) as Star Wars, so Lucas changed it by bringing in untested youngsters from experimental and indie movies, or from fields like industrial design. Lucas had a talent for mixing disparate influences and making them fit perfectly. He shepherded together acting stalwarts like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing, experimental film-makers like Adam Beckett (who supervised the effects), and military uniform historian John Mollo; it would otherwise be inconceivable that these people would have all worked on the same project.</p><p>Much has been made of Lucas's repeated direction to his cast (\"Faster and more intense\") or that the dialogue was easier to type than say. Guinness, Cushing and James Earl Jones give it all the gravitas it needs, with the younger members fitting their roles perfectly: Mark Hamill's wide-eyed earnestness, Carrie Fisher's dignity and, perhaps best of all, Harrison Ford looking so mortified and embarrassed to be there. For audiences it resulted in a film unlike any before or since. <strong>Phelim O'Neill</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/92910/e.t.the.extra-terrestrial\">6. ET: The Extra-Terrestrial</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167329'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/05/kobal_ET460.jpg' alt='Henry Thomas in ET the Extra-Terrestrial' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>After 1977's Close Encounters (see no 8), director Steven Spielberg reversed the alien encounter formula to wonder not what we would make of them but what they would make of us. The result was this 1982 blockbuster, which eclipsed even the original Star Wars and received nine Oscar nominations (winning four) – a feat unheard of for a film with such overt sci-fi content.</p><p>Despite its genre trappings, ET balanced its fantasy content with an Academy-pleasing dose of sentiment, played out in the home life of Elliott (Henry Thomas), a lonely 10-year-old whose parents are separating. Little time is spent revealing where the film's ET has come from, or how he came to be left behind. Instead, Spielberg focuses on the film's unlikely-buddy story; the middle child of three (Drew Barrymore is the sweet but clingy younger sister, Robert MacNaughton the cynical teenage big brother), Elliott takes in the ET as the friend and confidant he doesn't have.</p><p>Largely filmed from an adult-waist-height perspective, the film prioritises this world of children and indulges them in their harmless naivety. So when the mean-minded authorities find out about the presence of ET, the effects are doubly shocking. The faceless hordes of uniformed, flashlight-toting militia make an intimidating and brutal sight. After a light-hearted first half, the film takes a plunge into darker drama in the second, when ET is captured and quarantined. Pale and half‑dead, the creature draws uncanny performances from its child cast, and the religious parallels in ET's subsequent \"resurrection\" have never gone unnoticed. However, they are likely accidental; Spielberg has said he sees his film more as a \"minority story\" about two outsiders who join forces in isolation.</p><p>There is also more than a hint of fairytale about ET, notably in the film's final, famous chase sequence, in which Elliott takes to his bicycle with ET on the handlebars and soars, Peter Pan-like, up into the sky. As in Close Encounters, there is a healthy scepticism about authority on show, but ET: The Extra Terrestrial is a less worldly film. Like much of Spielberg's work, it was heavily influenced by his parents' divorce and based on an imaginary friend he created at the same age as Elliott. \"A friend,\" he said, \"who could be the brother I never had, and a father that I didn't feel I had any more.\" <strong>DW</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76558/solaris\">5. Solaris</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167330'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2010/10/20/1287586012881/Solaris-006.jpg' alt='Solaris' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Andrei Tarkovsky started work on an adaptation of Stanisław Lem's philosophical science-fiction novel in 1968 in an attempt to find a popular cinematic subject. After the usual labyrinthine negotations with the Soviet authorities over the script, what emerged was a space film unlike anything before or since. Lem's novel posited the existence of solaristics; the study of an outlying star system that had bizarre effects on human psychology. Tarkovsky took this idea, and turned it into a dreamlike interrogation of faith, memory and the transfiguring power of love.</p><p>Tarkovsky begins his version of the story with some of the most magically earthbound images ever filmed, as his protagonist, a psychologist called Kelvin (Donatas Banionis), contemplates his garden. He then embarks on a voyage to the space station circling Solaris, there to investigate the reports of eccentric behaviour of previous visitors. Kelvin undergoes an ordeal by memory, as Solaris' psychoactive properties trigger the reappearance of his dead wife, Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk). The space station becomes a place of mysterious hauntings and apparitions. His colleagues hardly inspire trust, and Kelvin attempts to make sense of what is happening to him as he retreats further into an internal world.</p><p>Tarkovsky was barely interested in Lem's main preoccupation: to theorise about what might constitute alien life. Solaris, and its apparently animate \"oceans\", are simply a conduit to, and externalisation of, deeper spiritual matters. It's fair to say that no other director can have got anywhere near the mystic uplift of this film - and that includes the Steven Soderbergh remake with George Clooney. Lem didn't like the way his novel had been adapted; Tarkovsky himself considered it a less than successful film. But the clarity and beauty of Solaris ensures its majesty lives on. <strong>Andrew Pulver</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/75860/alien\">4. Alien</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167331'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/20/1287591219675/Alien-006.jpg' alt='Alien' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Alien is a perfect storm of talents: Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's lean screenplay; Derek Vanlint's moody cinematography; Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score; Brian Johnson's miniature effects, and a cast including Sigourney Weaver, Harry Dean Stanton, Ian Holm and John Hurt.</p><p>The most noticeable and revolutionary work on this film was, of course, on the design side. O'Bannon had previously worked on Alejandro Jodorowsky's ill-fated adaptation of Dune (a project that also fell through Ridley Scott's grasp). For that he had assembled an incredible assortment of artists, who he regrouped for Alien, with talents such as Moebius from the Métal Hurlant magazine, Ron Cobb from Star Wars and Swiss artist HR Giger. Years before, Giger had a vivid nightmare where a lavatory and surrounding plumbing came to queasy, pulsating life – and so his \"biomechanical\" style was born. His creations were bizarre, organic machines and his designs for Alien, such as the huge derelict spaceship the astronauts investigate, seem as much grown as constructed.</p><p>Alien uses a similar story framework to the 50s cheapo monster flick It! The Terror from Beyond Space, but adds so much to it that it becomes a far deeper film. There are plenty of subtexts at play here, such as having the lead role played by a woman (the script just used surnames in a non-gender specific manner), or the male Kane giving \"birth\" to the creature in the still-powerful \"chestburster\" scene. However you approach it, this is a wonderfully immersive and terrifying film. It was such a shock to the system when it was released (and a huge hit to boot) that you can still see its influence in countless sci-fi and horror films decades down the line. <strong>PON</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76627/blade-runner\">3. Blade Runner</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167332'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2011/1/25/1295958042496/1982-BLADE-RUNNER-007.jpg' alt='1982, BLADE RUNNER' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Most directors who have finished a science-fiction film tend to choose something a little more down to earth for their next project. Ridley Scott, coming off Alien, launched himself into something even more stylised and visually dense.</p><p>Based on Philip K Dick's novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and borrowing the title from William S Burroughs, Blade Runner follows a detective called Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) as he hunts down a group of replicants. These synthetic humans – almost impossible to discern from the real thing – have escaped from one of the \"off-world\" colonies and returned to Earth. Deckard's mission is to \"retire\" them, but the reason behind the replicants' return is interestingly emotive: they wish to lead their own lives, as is the right of any sentient being.</p><p>Blade Runner, notoriously, was completely misunderstood when it was released. Ford was an action man and audiences could be forgiven for thinking this was going to be a sort of Indiana Jones and the Flying Police Car. It wasn't helped by the clumsy voiceover and coda that the studio insisted upon.</p><p>Now, though, there's no denying its classic status. There are several versions available, each showing that with even a few minor differences, this film can be read in different ways. (Is Deckard a replicant? Even Scott and Ford can't agree.) Designer Syd Mead also pulled his weight. Mead was a visual futurist, a designer of advanced concepts for companies like Chrysler and Philips. However, it is Rutger Hauer's final speech, as the dying replicant leader Roy Batty, that people remember the most. It's an emotional end, adding unexpected heartbreak to a film that may have seemed almost baffling at first viewing. <strong>PON</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/75782/metropolis\">2. Metropolis</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167333'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/2/27/1330340687923/Metropolis-007.jpg' alt='Metropolis' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Although many sci-fi films followed, none have had the lasting, seemingly self-regenerating appeal of Fritz Lang's silent classic – perhaps because, after its Berlin premiere in 1927, it is arguable that no authoritative version of it has ever really been established. Originally clocking in at two hours and 33 minutes, Metropolis has since become a movable feast, with new scenes and scores – Giorgio Moroder issued a derided, colour-tinted synth version in 1984 – that have kept Lang's epic current.</p><p>For its time, the film was a milestone, innovative miniatures and camera tricks to create its city of the future, taking two years to shoot and bankrupting its producers (in modern money, the budget was close to $200m). But the real key to its longevity is its thematic content: more a warning than a romance, it deals with issues of modernity that have never gone away. Class conflict is its main thread: when Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), the idle son of a rich businessman, discovers the primitive conditions the city's workers are living in, the scenes of a dehumanised proletariat – a cast of more than 30,000 extras – still have power today. Lang's fetishising of machinery scarily foregrounds the cost of heavy industrialisation. But what many remember most is an extraordinary sequence in which the woman who pulls the scales from Freder's eyes – Maria (Brigitte Helm), a good-hearted workers' rights agitator – is kidnapped and replaced with a sinister, violence-inciting robot double by evil scientist Rotwang, at Freder's father's command. This hydraulic beauty, with cantilevered breasts, morphs into a wide-eyed, unblinking Maria in a moment of pure magic.</p><p>Many of Lang and writer Thea von Harbou's original subplots have been lost. But even in its shortest form (90 minutes) Metropolis remains a timeless tale. Though made to fit a genre that showcases the possibilities of the future, Lang's film never loses sight of its rights and wrongs. <strong>DW</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36269/2001\">1. 2001: A Space Odyssey</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420167334'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2011/12/12/1323693328754/2001-A-Space-Odyssey-007.jpg' alt='2001: A Space Odyssey' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When 2001: A Space Odyssey was first released, few would have predicted it would still be feted nearly half a century later. In fact few would have tipped it for even short-lived glory. At its premiere – its premiere – there were 241 walkouts, including Rock Hudson, who asked: \"Will someone tell me what the hell this is about?\"</p><p>Even its champions were stumped. \"Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring,\" thought the New York Times; \"Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,\" reckoned Newsday. But bafflement was the intention, explained its creators. Said Arthur C Clarke, whose 1948 story The Sentinel was the starting point for Stanley Kubrick (Clarke's novelisation postdated the film): \"If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.\"</p><p>A cop-out? Far from it: 2001 is magisterial. Its impeccable serious-mindedness is nothing to scoff at; what some saw as ponderous now seems merely prescient. It was both the last space-travel movie shot before men actually landed on the moon, and the first to turn a genre that had been the preserve of B-movie cheese into the highest form of art.</p><p>It looks not just as fresh as the day it was made but as fresh as the day you first saw it: iffy ape costumes aside, it's one of the few 60s movies that stands up to contemporary technical scrutiny. At the time, it must have marked a quantum leap forward: suddenly, space seemed credible. To watch even now is to be awestruck: all those exacting details (the 700-word instructions for using a zero-gravity toilet), the pacing – at once lulling and urgent, the audio – soaring Strauss waltzes spliced with dead air. In space, of course, no one can hear you speak.</p><p>And so to the difficult matter of what on earth it's about. On a bare-bones level, it concerns three artefacts: one left on Earth at the dawn of man by space explorers keen to steer the evolution of the apes, another buried deep in the lunar surface, and programmed to signal word of man's first journey into the universe (in Kubrick's words, \"a kind of cosmic burglar alarm\") and the third in orbit around Jupiter – another alarm, this time for when man breaks out of his own solar system.</p><p>And that's what happens in the film, when a team of five men (three in hibernation) jet off to investigate the second. But the mission goes awry – arguably the fault of the chatty command computer, Hal – and the sole surviving astronaut is swept into a force field that hurls him on a journey through the galaxy. From there it's to a human zoo, built from his own subconscious, where he ages fast, dies, is reborn and enhanced – \"a star child, an angel, a superman\" (said Kubrick) – before returning to Earth to advance evolution.</p><p>2001 is a film whose ambition is only matched by its achievement in pulling it off. It was the world's first – and perhaps only – metaphysical exploration of the workings of humanity, from the beginning of time to the far-flung future, and it's small wonder sci-fi has never really recovered. It has really only been going backwards, relying either on splashy effects or psychological conundrums handled so tritely that they barely seem related to 2001 at all.</p><p>Some complain that it is chilly, inhuman. Perhaps. But the dying song of Hal, warbling out Daisy Bell (A Bicycle Made for Two) as his plug is pulled, must be one of the most haunting scenes in cinema, mechanic or not.</p><p>Not to mention, of course, that 2001 provides the most open-and-shut case for cinema being primarily a visual medium: from the twirling, dancing orbits to the extended acid(ic) trip at the end, it is, quite simply, a knock-out. And it features Leonard Rossiter as a Russian astronaut. The question back in 1968 would have been: how could this possibly be number 1? The question today is: how could it not? <strong>Catherine Shoard</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/top-10-films\">More Guardian and Observer critics' top 10s</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/07/top-10-romantic-movies\">• Top 10 romantic movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/10/top-10-action-movies\">• Top 10 action movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/11/top-10-comedy-movies\">• Top 10 comedy movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/14/top-10-horror-movies\">• Top 10 horror movies</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420041695|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|b48b947e15b1218a16409730ca84cceac79a8e14 -->",

        "body":"<p>Thomas Pynchon, Jhumpa Lahiri and George Saunders were among the finalists Wednesday for the&nbsp;National&nbsp;Book&nbsp;Awards.</p> <p>A month after releasing longlists of 10 in each of the four competitive categories, the&nbsp;National&nbsp;Book Foundation announced the five remaining writers for fiction, non-fiction, poetry and young people's literature.</p> <p>Winners receive $10,000 and will be announced at a dinner ceremony in Manhattan on 20 November.</p> <p>All five fiction nominees are well established, from Pynchon, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/16/thomas-pynchon-bleeding-edge\">Bleeding Edge</a> is set in Manhattan around the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks; to Lahiri, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/12/lowland-jhumpa-lahiri-review\">The Lowland</a> was a Booker finalist; to Saunders, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/03/tenth-of-december-george-saunders-review\">Tenth of December </a>was the rare short story collection to make bestseller lists. The other finalists are Rachel Kushner, nominated for her highly praised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/23/flamethrowers-rachel-kushner-review\">The Flamethrowers</a>, and James McBride, known to millions for The Color of Water and a finalist for The Good Lord Bird.</p> <p>The non-fiction list features three&nbsp;books&nbsp;by New Yorker staff writers: Lawrence Wright's Scientology investigation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/02/going-clear-scientology-wright-review\">Going Clear</a>; George Packer's dire account of contemporary America, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/21/unwinding-history-america-packer-review\">The Unwinding</a>; and Jill Lepore's biography of Benjamin Franklin's sister, Jane Franklin, The&nbsp;Book&nbsp;of Ages. Also nominated for nonfiction are Wendy Lower's Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields, and Alan Taylor's The Internal Enemy: Slavery and War in Virginia, 1772-1832.</p> <p>For poetry, the finalists are Frank Bidart's Metaphysical Dog, Lucie Brock-Broido's Stay, Illusion, Adrian Matejka's The Big Smoke, Matt Rasmussen's Black Aperture, and Mary Szybist's \"Incarnadine.\"</p> <p>The young people's literature nominees are Kathi Appelt's The True Blue Scouts of Sugar Man Swamp, Cynthia Kadohata's The Thing About Luck, Tom McNeal's Far Far Away, Meg Rosoff's Picture Me Gone and Gene Luen Yang's Boxers &amp; Saints, a two-volume graphic novel.</p> <p>Four of the fiction finalists were published by imprints of the recently merged Penguin Random House, which released 10 of the 20 nominees overall.</p> <p>The longlists were started this year as part of an effort to increase awareness of the&nbsp;awards&nbsp;and lead to more sales. New York publishers, several of whom are represented on the foundation's board, have complained that fiction nominees in recent years have been too obscure and have cited Britain's Man Booker Prize as a model. Besides establishing longlists, the foundation has expanded the pool of judges, once exclusively writers, to include journalists, booksellers and librarians.</p> <p>The foundation would likely settle for the success of the&nbsp;National&nbsp;Book&nbsp;Award&nbsp;fiction winner from 2012, Louise Erdrich's The Round House, which has sold more than 300,000 copies. Erdrich's publisher, HarperCollins, credited much of that success to the&nbsp;award.</p> <p>Honorary winners include Maya Angelou, whose medal will be presented by Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, and EL Doctorow, who will be introduced by the publisher emeritus of The&nbsp;Nation&nbsp;and former&nbsp;National&nbsp;Book&nbsp;Awardwinner Victor Navasky.</p> <p>The&nbsp;National&nbsp;Book&nbsp;Foundation, which presents the&nbsp;awards, is a nonprofit organization that sponsors numerous writing and educational events and programs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420147418|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|f08fd9b2f2aaa582e2afbc15b545ba15a430fa25 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is out Wednesday with its annual list of nominees – including Nirvana, Linda Ronstadt, Peter Gabriel and Kiss – who will vie for entry into the hallowed halls of its Cleveland, Ohio museum. The 16 combatants will now enter, two by two, into a metal dome structure on the shores of Lake Erie where Tina Turner will judge who is the rockingest of rock stars, and the contest ends next April when Dave Grohl stands victorious atop the bloodied remains of Hall and Oates to collect Nirvana's trophy. Courtney Love will be seen glowering in a corner claiming she is the rightful heir to Kurt Cobain's genius, while Kiss – perennial nominees whose slippery white face paint is a distinct disadvantage in Rock Star Thunderdome – will retreat to a music studio to work on an album of Christmas songs.&nbsp;</p> <p>An edited version of the contest will air on HBO in May.</p> <p>Oh. Sadly, for TV viewers and music fans the world over, that's not actually what happens. But I think we can all agree it would be far better than the real process, which involves 600 voters narrowing down the 16 nominees to a final list of inductees, who will be announced in December. Then they'll all gather in April for a big concert in New York, and the music industry will spend an evening applauding itself.</p> <p>Half of this year's list are first-time nominees: Nirvana, Ronstadt, Gabriel, Hall and Oates, the Replacements, Yes, Link Wray and the Zombies. Repeat nominees are: Kiss, LL Cool J, NWA, Cat Stevens (who would be inducted under his earlier performing name, instead of Yusuf Islam), Deep Purple, The Meters, The Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Chic.&nbsp;Artists are eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record, and while the voting process officially considers musical impact and contributions, let's call it what it really is: a popularity contest.&nbsp;</p> <p>Which is why you'll see Nirvana sail smoothly&nbsp;into the hall of fame, and why Chic, nominated eight times since 2003, still hasn't found itself accepted. Their best chance comes this year as co-founder Nile Rodgers rides a new wave of popularity thanks to a collaboration with Daft Punk this year.&nbsp;</p> <p>But since this contest is, ostensibly, about the music, let's take a deep dive into this nomination list with a look at the songs that made these acts famous. What follows is one song from our favorite nominees, chosen entirely by my musical whims and those of other Guardian US staff members. <strong>Got a better suggestion? Have at it in the comments.&nbsp;</strong></p> <h2>Nirvana: All Apologies</h2> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWmkuH1k7uA\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWmkuH1k7uA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>News editor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexKoppelman\">Alex Koppelman</a> is a fan of this performance, from MTV's classic Unplugged episode.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Kiss: Shout it Out Loud</h2> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sohB922c2uQ\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sohB922c2uQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>Chosen by national security editor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/attackerman\">Spencer Ackerman</a>.

This performance of Alex Chilton from Chicago's Riot Fest shows it'll be smooth sailing through the induction process this year, the first time they've been nominated.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Chic: Good Times</h2> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WB42LA-oOo\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WB42LA-oOo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>There's something great about this performance from 70s Italian TV.
