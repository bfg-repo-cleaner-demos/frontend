        "body":"<p>Alastair Cook has conceded that Shane Warne may have had a point when criticising a lack of imagination in his captaincy, but is happy to be judged on the results of his England team.</p> <p>Cook spoke to the media ahead of his first appearance of the tour against Australia A in Hobart on Wednesday, and Warne's latest barbs in the direction of the England team were always likely to dominate the agenda.</p> <p>&ldquo;It doesn't seem times have changed at all does it since last summer?&rdquo; said the England captain, who missed the first warm-up game in Perth with a back problem but insisted that he is now feeling fine. &ldquo;It's old news, not surprising, and we don't expect it to exchange in the next couple of months either.</p> <p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, it's results that are the most important thing. That's how you are judged as a captain.</p> <p>&ldquo;At times I&rsquo;ve always said I&rsquo;m trying to learn on the job from experience and there will be times where I could be slightly more imaginative and think slightly differently if the situation arises. [But] we&rsquo;ve had a pretty good run so far as a Test side. In my first year as a Test captain we&rsquo;ve won away in India which wasn&rsquo;t done for a long time, won a series against Australia and I think those are things we can be very proud of as a side. I keep saying it, it&rsquo;s all about results.&rdquo;</p> <p>Cook also backed Joe Root, the other England player to find himself in Warne's pre-series targets, to be unfazed by suggestions he does not have the technique to handle the new ball in Australia &ndash; although he refused to say whether Root will be opening with him in Hobart, stressing that \"all options are open\".</p> <p>&ldquo;Joe's a fantastic player...and he's a pretty unflappable guy,&rdquo; added the captain. &ldquo;So yes, I'm sure it's slightly new to him. But that's where hopefully the experience of people like myself, KP [Kevin Pietersen] who've been there as batters in the top order can give him some advice. But he can handle himself, I've got no worries about that.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421669844|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|9708d3ca1544c7ddadbff211b7e32f83811732e7 -->",

        "body":"<p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/04/warne-attacks-ponting-over-clarke-jibes\">Shane Warne gracelessly weighed</a> in to the debate about Ricky Ponting’s autobiography, it was hard not to sigh in exasperation. Were Ponting’s comments about current Test captain Michael Clarke really as newsworthy as we’ve been led to believe?</p> <p>As far as I could tell at first glance, it was simply a case of Ponting giving an insight into Clarke’s pleasing evolution into a leader in his own right. The observation was hardly even a ground-breaking one and followed the narrative arc of countless journalistic homages to Clarke in recent years. ‘He used to be flashy and brash, but now he’s calmed down and the captaincy suits him well’ was the plot in most cases.</p> <p>But somewhere along the line we all apparently decided that this was an outrageous attack on Clarke’s character, a tongue-lashing from which Ponting hoped to score some publicity for his book. The outrage industry went into overdrive and yet some of us couldn’t help but scan through our memories, mentally perusing the literary output of Australian greats of summers past by way of comparison.</p> <p>Ian Chappell naturally came to mind, with his thinly-veiled disdain for former team-mate Max Walker. Interviewed by one tour-diary author, Chappell stated on record, “If you’re busy trying to grin all the time you can’t think, which doesn’t worry a guy like Max Walker because he doesn’t think anyway.” Chappell continued, “He was never a character. And you know what? I’ve never seen the colour of his money.” Reading that back makes you wonder what Warne would make of some real home truths from Ponting, because his comments are surely on the tamer end of the Chappelli Index.</p> <p>More than anything, the episode actually brings into question Warne’s own eagerness to place his ego before the best interests of the current Australian squad as they head into an important Ashes summer. Defending a mate he might be, but it’s a case of all care and no responsibility for Warne and it can be nothing other than a distraction for Clarke himself.</p> <p>The selfishness that Warne is now displaying by inserting himself into the story is, ironically enough, the exact type of “selfish” behaviour he decried in the so-called <a href=\"http://www.shanewarne.com/blog/330/where-is-australian-cricket-at-part-1\">‘Warnifesto’</a>, but then Ponting’s name was missing from Warne’s proposed coaching dream team, so at least he’s remaining consistent there. Warne’s view that Clarke, “keep[s] stuff in the dressing room. That’s what good leaders are about” was probably not intended to draw laughs, but that it did. Much like the Warnifesto.</p> <p>Given the innocuous nature of Ponting’s comments and the fact that Warne himself has a world-class hide when it comes to dealing with such barbs, could it be that Warne is not even taking offence on behalf of his friend Clarke, but merely using the opportunity to sink the boots in to Ponting? If it is such an act of opportunism it ill-befits an identity of Warne’s standing in the game. It also doesn’t auger particularly well for his post-career influence on Australian cricket.</p> <p>Another interesting element of Warne’s stance is that he should claim Ponting’s comments about Clarke were motivated by “jealousy”. By any objective measurement Ponting does not sit in the shade of too many batsmen and that includes Clarke at this point. Ironically, it was Warne’s own drawn-out retirement via the Indian Premier and Big Bash Leagues that spoke of a man struggling to cope with his own withdrawal from the limelight. In his famous clash with Marlon Samuels he looked like a man trying to convince himself that he was still a part of the big show. It might have provided some temporary exhilaration for Warne, but again it was an embarrassment to those left picking up the pieces. This is becoming a worrying theme for Warne.</p> <p>Ponting has also benefitted from a tidy superannuation top-up through his participation in T20 cricket, but in poignant contrast to Warne he also hung around for an elongated bow in the decidedly less glamorous first-class arena, where his appearances for Tasmania and Surrey reinforced his unyielding love for the game. There he was just another cricketer, a contributor in a team. His Tasmanian team-mate Ed Cowan <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/683261.html\">recently spoke</a> of Ponting’s willingness to perform the selfless team tasks, staying behind to give fringe state players throw-downs. None of these things are the mark of a self-serving or jealous character.</p> <p>History tells us that the focus will soon shift away from this imbroglio, but it’s interesting to note the way that Ponting is being edged gradually by his contemporaries into much the same position long-occupied by one of his most militant critics, Ian Chappell. Like Chappell, Ponting knows the game with an intimacy that few can match and tends to shoot straight. Exactly what role the recently-retired champion comes to occupy in Australian cricket remains to be seen. For now he seems to be gathering as many enemies as allies, but all of a sudden it is Ponting more than Warne or even Clarke who presents the most intriguing proposition on the Australian cricket landscape.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421664452|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|8abf4ff3027712c192b1278de7b5465caeef296a -->",

        "headline":"Joe Root laughs off Shane Warne's warning of Ashes 'crucifixion'",
        "body":"<p>For a man little more than two weeks away from his crucifixion at the Gabba, Joe Root sounded remarkably relaxed. \"You wouldn't expect anything else,\" he smiled, having been informed of Shane Warne's lurid suggestion of the likely consequences if his technique is exposed to Ryan Harris and Mitchell Johnson with a new Kookaburra ball in the first Test of England's return Ashes series in Brisbane.</p><p>\"They could be crucifying him,\" Warne had said, arguing that Root should drop down to the middle order to allow Michael Carberry, a former Hampshire team-mate, to open with Alastair Cook.</p><p>\"I don't think Shane Warne has ever said anything nice about an England touring team, has he?\" Root responded at the Bellerive Oval, now known clunkily as the Blundstone Arena, where he was one of six players whisked across the tall Tasman bridge from the team's central Hobart base to face the media before the second tour game against Australia A. \"When they toured England, they had a very distinct way of attacking us in the media. That's one way they go about things – well, he [Warne] goes about things.\"</p><p>Ian Bell, another of the six whose day off to explore Hobart was interrupted by media commitments, put it more pithily. \"There's no point wasting energy trying to find compliments from Australians,\" said the four-times Ashes winner. \"It's just not going to happen.\"</p><p>The local Mercury newspaper had reported in the morning that \"the English cricket team swaggered into Hobart. With match-winners Kevin Pietersen, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann in tow, the visitors have egos to match even their huge luggage allocation.\"</p><p>Broad, who was not required for either an early charm offensive or to pour further fuel on the fire, had a choice of reading material as England passed through Melbourne airport during their trip from Perth to Hobart on Sunday.</p><p>He was the subject of a column in the Sun-Herald newspaper under the headline \"England all-rounder Broad revels in super tosser role\" – and this was not a reference to his Twenty20 captaincy. Alternatively, he might have purchased the latest edition of Inside Cricket magazine, containing an article about \"The Devil Himself\" billed on the cover as \"More reasons to hate Stuart Broad\".</p><p>Yet there is something unconvincing, phoney and even desperate about the attempts to heat up this rapid resumption of the Ashes rivalry into a grudge match. As Bell said: \"A lot of the public here have been amazingly friendly and nice to us, to be honest.</p><p>\"Certain ex-players will have their say here and there and that's just how it is. We know it will be a tough environment in Brisbane and we'll have to be prepared for that but so far, with a lot of English people in Perth, it's been a nice environment.\"</p><p>Despite the pleasant temperatures and handsome surroundings, the on-field mood promises to be much more intense in Hobart against an Australia A team who have been given an even greater incentive by the latest uncertainty surrounding Shane Watson – although the all-rounder remains confident of being fit for Brisbane despite suffering another recurrence of his hamstring problems in the last match of Australia's one-day series in India at the weekend.</p><p>Alex Doolan, a 27-year-old who hit a match-winning century for Tasmania in the first game of their Sheffield Shield title defence against Michael Clarke's New South Wales in Sydney last week, is now being tipped as the most likely beneficiary at No3 if Watson is ruled out.</p><p>In the more likely scenario that Watson plays but is unable to bowl, Doolan's Tasmania team-mate James Faulkner could come into the Test picture again, fresh from some spectacular performances in India. Faulkner has been given a breather this week while George Bailey, yet another Tasmania contender to come into the Test team – in his case in the problem No6 position – has flown straight to Brisbane to play in a Shield game against Queensland rather than face England with the A-team.</p><p>That leaves all eyes on Doolan at Bellerive, in a strong batting lineup who also include Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Usman Khawaja, Callum Ferguson and Michael Klinger, who had such a good season with Gloucestershire.</p><p>England's team selection will also be fascinating. Cook  and the Mercury's three egos (Broad, Swann and Pietersen) are expected to make their first appearances of the tour. With Root, Bell, Jonathan Trott and Matt Prior all keen to spend as much time as possible in the middle, that may mean that only one of Jonny Bairstow, Gary Ballance, Michael Carberry and Ben Stokes can be included.</p><p>Jimmy Anderson also confirmed that he wants to play in one more game before Brisbane on 21 November, although he was awaiting instruction from Andy Flower and David Saker on whether that appearance would come in Hobart or Sydney next week.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421637210|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|7a48455ba8a4956ea27fb6315e3b8604f5d51e97 -->",

        "body":"<p>Shane Warne was not the only Australian keen to ensure England received a warm welcome following their relocation from parched Perth to temperate and anything but tropical Tasmania.</p><p>In addition to Warne's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/04/ashes-alastair-cook-shane-warne-england\" title=\"\">latest verbal attack</a> on Alastair Cook's captaincy, and a lurid prediction of the crucifixion of Joe Root's young Test career if he is exposed to Ryan Harris and Mitchell Johnson with a new Kookaburra ball, the local Mercury newspaper claimed \"<a href=\"http://www.themercury.com.au/sport/english-cricket-team-arrives-in-hobart-for-game-against-australia-a-at-blundstone-arena/story-fnj4f7g3-1226752430082\" title=\"\">the English cricket team swaggered into Hobart</a>. With match-winners Kevin Pietersen, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann in tow, the visitors have egos to match even their huge luggage allocation.\"</p><p>Meanwhile Richard Hinds had some fun in <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/hinds-england-ashes-allrounder-stuart-broad-revels-in-super-tosser-role/story-fni2u98u-1226752061597\" title=\"\">his column</a> in the weekend's Sun-Herald – headlined \"England all-rounder Broad revels in super tosser role\". Had Broad looked elsewhere at one of the newsagents in Melbourne airport when England were changing planes, he might also have picked up a copy of Inside Cricket, which contains an article about \"The Devil Himself\", billed on the cover as \"More reasons to hate Stuart Broad\".</p><p>All good knockabout stuff, which certainly won't worry Broad, according to Jimmy Anderson, his new-ball partner. \"He's prepared to get a fair bit of stick,\" Anderson said as one of five England players (not including Broad) who were whisked across the Tasman bridge from their central Hobart base to meet the Australian media at the Bellerive Oval, now officially known as the Blundstone Arena, which will stage England's second tour fixture against Australia A (a four-day match starting on Wednesday).</p><p>\"I think he's the sort of character that will deal with it well,\" Anderson added of Broad. \"Everyone is prepared to get some stick out here. There's one way to silence people – and he knows it. Bowl well.\"</p><p>Yet there is something unconvincing, phoney and even desperate about the attempts to ramp up this rapid resumption of the Ashes rivalry into a grudge match. Perhaps the Tasmanian setting provides a false sense of security – the weather was cold and miserable when England arrived on Sunday and, although the sun shone for most of Monday once the cloud had lifted from Mount Wellington, there was a freshness in the air that still had the modest surroundings of Bellerive feeling more like a county ground in May.</p><p>But most Australian cricket followers, and even their media, still seem at least as disillusioned with their own team as they are appalled by the cocky Poms. Warne is doing his best for his old mates Darren Lehmann and Michael Clarke but even that interview was set up to promote Sky's coverage of the series in England.</p><p>In Australia, what little interest there is in cricket on the eve of the Melbourne Cup surrounds Warne's view of the row that has been rumbling for the best part of a week as the result of Ricky Ponting's criticism of Clarke in his autobiography. \"Maybe it was a bit of jealousy because Pup was batting so well and Ricky was at the end of his career and not making runs and just hung in there in the last few years, I don't know,\" Warne said. \"[But] I don't want to be mean about Ricky because he's a good guy and he did the best he could.\" Meow.</p><p>Meanwhile another hamstring problem for Shane Watson prompts much rolling of eyes and, rather than the brash confidence of old, the general view of Australia's prospects seems to lie somewhere between cautious optimism and weary resignation. Maybe it will be different in Sydney next week – although it appears England's last warm-up game will be played at a building site, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/sydney-cricket-grounds-new-stand-not-finished-for-new-years-test-20131104-2wwh2.html\" title=\"\">as work continues on the redevelopment of the SCG</a>  – and the Queenslanders will surely have some warm words for Broad and Root ahead of the first Test in Brisbane.</p><p>Despite the pleasant temperatures and thoroughly civilised surroundings, the on-field mood promises to be much more intense in Hobart against an Australia A team who have been given an even greater incentive by the latest uncertainty surrounding Watson. Alex Doolan, a 27-year-old who hit a match-winning century for Tasmania in the first game of their Sheffield Shield title defence against Clarke's New South Wales in Sydney last week, is now being tipped as the most likely beneficiary at No3 if Watson is ruled out.</p><p>In the more likely scenario that Watson plays but is unable to bowl, Doolan's Tasmania team-mate James Faulkner could again come into the picture, fresh from some spectacular performances on Australia's one-day tour of India. Faulkner has been given a breather this week while George Bailey, yet another Tassie contender to come into the first Test team, in his case in the problem No6 position, has flown straight to Brisbane to play in a Shield game against Queensland rather than facing England with the A-team.</p><p>That leaves all eyes on Doolan at Bellerive, in a strong batting lineup that also includes Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Usman Khawaja, Callum Ferguson and Michael Klinger, who had such a good season with Gloucestershire.</p><p>England's team selection will also be fascinating. Broad, Swann, Pietersen and Cook are expected to make their first appearances of the tour and, with Root, Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell and Matt Prior all keen to spend as much time as possible in the middle, that could mean that only one of Jonny Bairstow, Gary Ballance, Michael Carberry and Ben Stokes can be included, at No6.</p><p>Anderson also confirmed that he wants to play in one more game before Brisbane on 21 November, although he was awaiting instruction from Andy Flower and David Saker on whether that appearance would come in Hobart or Sydney.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421608772|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|542730956f3e604e25e952b14106e848db7e85ed -->",

But Jonathan Trott pointed to England's success on home soil under Cook, saying: \"To win 3-0, I don't think the tactics were that bad.</p><p>\"I know there are people who think he is inept at it, but everyone in the changing room knows he's well ahead of most people in that department.\"</p><p>James Anderson and the vice-captain Matt Prior also defended Cook. \"He leads by example, and just drags everyone with him,\" said Anderson.</p><p>Prior added: \"There is always going to be scrutiny and the captain as a leader is always going to come under fire. But Cooky's a very strong person mentally. He takes it all in his stride, and ultimately his record speaks for itself. He's doing pretty well.\"</p><p>Warne had said: \"He can be negative, boring, not very imaginative, and still win and be happy. But I'll tell you my opinion: I think Alastair Cook has to be more imaginative. I think if Australia play well and he continues to captain the way he does, England will lose the series. He lets the game drift. He waits for the game to come to him.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421607238|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|eb129f9b95e68f03cedf313a6639a11667026d8a -->",

But heading into the first Test in Brisbane on November 21, the skipper could be forgiven for thinking the real enemy is from within.</p><p>Clarke has found himself at the centre of an internal bun fight following a passage in Ricky Ponting's autobiography 'At The Close of Play', critical of his attitude and approach when he was vice-captain.</p><p>Ponting and Clarke exchanged text messages last week which was supposed to put any simmering tension to bed.</p><p>But Clarke's \"best friend\", Shane Warne ensured the subsequent innuendo about the Australian dressing room is unlikely to go away any time soon.</p><p>Warne savaged Ponting in an interview with the British press, accusing his former skipper of being motivated by \"jealousy\".</p><p>\"To bring up the stuff about Pup (Clarke) - maybe there was a bit of jealousy, because Pup was batting so well and Ricky was not making any runs,\" Warner said.</p><p>\"To me, Michael's very well respected. The best captains keep stuff in the dressing room. No-one ever finds out about it. That's what good leaders are about. So to hear all this in a book is pretty ordinary.\"</p><p>Mark Taylor also slammed Ponting last week, believing he put Clarke under the bus for the sake of making a dollar.</p><p>The controversial passage penned by Ponting has become such a talking point, even Australia A batsmen Alex Doolan, who barely even knows Clarke, was asked about the ongoing saga at a media opportunity in Hobart on Monday.</p><p>\"I'm not up to that chapter in Ricky's book yet, so maybe when I get there I'll be able to comment a little more,\" Doolan said diplomatically.</p><p>Coach Darren Lehmann last week said Ponting and Clarke were big enough to sort the matter out themselves. Clarke has stayed largely silent on the Ponting matter, but interestingly, he's also getting in on the book game.</p><p>On the eve of the Brisbane team announcement on November 11, Clarke will release his Ashes tour diary from the winter, which will examine the sacking of Mickey Arthur and the disciplining of David Warner.</p><p>Elsewhere, Ian Chappell revisited his damning critique of George Bailey's batting ahead of the Tasmanian's potential Test debut at the Gabba. That in turn prompted another Test great, Matthew Hayden, to rebuke Chappell.</p><p>Warne however has backtracked on his initial harsh assessment of Bailey.</p><p>\"I put my hand up to say I was wrong about George Bailey, and it's fantastic to see the form he's in,\" he said. \"He has to be in the top six.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421592190|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|f1d971910b3d591441419560294a9911095e3365 -->",

        "headline":"India v Australia ODI series: what we learned",
        "body":"<h2><strong>350 is the new 200</strong></h2><p>I don't know what to say. I don't know what anything means anymore. Whose face is this? Where are my pants? Do you know the weather in Prague? Welcome to Wrexham Cathedral. Australia and India have just played out the most bizarre one-day cricket series of all time. Our concept of normal went out a skyscraper window, turned into a turtle, and used space lasers to destroy San Antonio. </p><p>After a warm-up T20 in which both sides topped 200, Australia cruised past 300 on five out of six ODI attempts. India made four out of five, including successful chases of 350 and 359. Australia chased 303 and very nearly 382. The decider turned my living room into that scene in <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, numb stares at the flickering light; the rain of sixes desensitising to the point that MS Dhoni could have woodchipped a pile of ginger kittens at extra cover and we would only have wondered why Matt Hayden hadn't found a segue to start talking about one of his recipes.</p><p>Of 95 overs bowled on the weekend, a match-record 6.2 of them went into the crowd. Australia were 4/74 with more than 300 to get, but sixed their way to needing 58 from 32 balls. What if Mitchell Johnson had played? What if George Bailey had remembered the fundamental rules of cricket and/or using his legs? What if I could find my pants?</p><p>Six ODIs in history have featured more than 700 runs; three were in this series. Aaron Finch was the only bowler to go for less than five an over. Six batsmen averaged over 50 and four over a hundred. Five and a half matches yielded 107 sixes and 345 fours. You can write the whole series off as an anomaly, but new standards and expectations have been set, especially in chasing. The day after the decider, Bangladesh ran down 308 in Fatullah. A red tide is on the rise.</p><h2><strong>Australia have found three Ashes prospects</strong></h2><p>An ODI tour of India between two Ashes series was widely derided as stupid scheduling, but there have proved to be upsides. When Australia's captain and key batsman pulled out of the tour, George Bailey stepped up to take Michael Clarke's place as both. He led graciously and calmly through the insanity, while stringing together 85, 92*, 43 98, and the highest score by an Australian ODI captain, 156. Aside from one batting brain fade, Bailey's composure was the most impressive aspect of each innings, though he never shirked the responsibility of big shots. While he was there, Australia looked safe. That stability and leadership has been sorely missed in Australia's Test top order.</p><p>Mitchell Johnson was at his fastest in many a year, regularly clocking over 150kph, and was the only bowler to trouble India's run machine. With stress fractures striking down four Test rivals, he's a great chance to return. Don't worry, he's still fond of a wide. James Faulkner, meanwhile, was unlikely to get a Test as a bowling all-rounder, but the fastest ODI century by an Australian, and an average of 115 for the series, can hardly hurt official or personal confidence in his batting.</p><h2><strong>The king is dead, long live the king</strong></h2><p>As the BCCI prepare for the look-what-I-found-at-the-back-of-my-sock-drawer Test series against West Indies, the wider internet prepares for the data overload that will peak with the retirement of Sachin Tendulkar. But as India's cricketing monarch prepares to exit the stage, his heir is ready to assume the duties of office. As Virat Kohli walked to the crease on Saturday the stadium produced a primal, thrumming roar. When Rohit Sharma ran him out for a duck there was devastated silence. This is the man they will clamour to see.</p><p>Kohli will be the great batting talent of the next generation. At not quite 25 years old he already has 17 ODI centuries and averages 51 batting first drop. This series he hit the fastest and third-fastest hundreds by an Indian, providing the second halves of two massive chases. He has work to do in Tests, but four hundreds from 20 matches is hardly a bad start. </p><p>But it's not about numbers, it's the aura. Something beyond arrogance. Kohli this series wasn't cocky. He <em>already knew</em> he was going to score. His emotional side seems to shut down. It's clinical but not mechanical: there remains a predatory lust for the kill. As he stalked off after that run out, radiating cold anger, Kohli looked back at his batting partner with the dead black eyes of a shark. Rohit scored a double hundred that was surely fuelled by fear. Even so, years down the track, don't discount the chance he'll wake up to find himself tied to an operating table covered in plastic. </p><h2><strong>The ICC rule changes worked</strong></h2><p>Blame for the run-fest was generally laid on flat Indian pitches, two new balls, and the new rule allowing only four fieldsmen in the deep. The latter was brought in by the ICC in an attempt to liven up boring overs by encouraging strokeplay. You'd have to say it worked. From overs 21 to 40 across the series, India averaged a run rate of 6.76, Australia 7.21.</p><p>Criticising the rule on the basis of this series though is hasty. On a seaming or turning track, you would imagine that having five close fieldsmen would make batting harder. Big shots would be riskier and singles scarcer, and a good bowling performance could apply a chokehold. The difference would be in pitches that give something to bowlers. How about that for a change?</p><h2><strong>It takes a mountaineering mindset</strong></h2><p>While rules and conditions play their part, cricket philosopher Harsha Bhogle discussed the mindset of batting in the T20 era. With that approach, he argued, different things were possible. He has a point: the importance of mentality was starkly illustrated.</p><p>When one side makes a massive total, replies tend to follow a pattern. The chasing side looks bewildered, there's an early wicket, some hitting with a hint of distress, more wickets fall as they try to force the run rate, some late slogging provides entertainment before the whole thing falls in a heap. Australia followed the early template: nothing stinks of desperation like promoting Brad Haddin to number three. Power hitting from Faulkner and Co. got them closer than they had any right to be, but they were always behind the game. The key is that the chasing side don't think they can win, and don't have a plan to approach it.</p><p>All of which is exactly what India didn't do. Both of their huge chases began looking like the batsmen were clear in their intent. Both involved big opening partnerships that kept up a strong run rate without panicked shots. Both times a platform was set from which their middle order could launch. Both times, by the 20th over, it was India who looked like the side in control, by the 40th they were coasting. Anything the opposition makes can be matched: it just depends on the approach.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421585943|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|d0245cf26e1733e0ae488d82d4e492d082840e08 -->",

        "headline":"Shane Warne condemns 'boring' Cook and tips Australia for Ashes",
        "body":"<p>Shane Warne has strongly criticised Alastair Cook, saying that England could lose the Ashes this winter if their captain continues his \"negative, boring, not very imaginative\" approach to Test cricket.</p><p>The former Australia leg-spinner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/warne888/status/366939881953427456\" title=\"\">first complained about Cook's tactics</a> last summer, prompting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/13/alastair-cook-england-captaincy-ashes-flower\" title=\"\">Andy Flower to insist the Englishman was \"a strong leader\"</a> whose \"captaincy has been excellent\" and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/stuart-broad-shrugs-off-trash-talk-of-darren-lehmann-and-shane-warne-8909625.html\" title=\"\">Stuart Broad to accuse Warne of \"trash-talking\"</a> and insist England \"are not listening to what he says\". Warne, however, has not reconsidered.</p><p>\"It's all about the brand and style of cricket you want to play and what you stand for as a captain,\" Warne said. \"I'm just telling it the way I see it. If it offends people, ignore it. At the end of the day it's all about winning. He can be negative, boring, not very imaginative, and still win and be happy. But I'll tell you my opinion: I think Alastair Cook has to be more imaginative. I think if Australia play well and he continues to captain the way he does, England will lose the series.\"</p><p>\"He lets the game drift. He waits for the game to come to him. If I look at the best captains I played with and the best captains around the world, they got the best out of their team, and they always challenged sides. Stephen Fleming of New Zealand, and Brendan McCullum now – he's a good captain, he's imaginative. Mark Taylor was fantastic, Allan Border, Michael Clarke to me is the best captain in the world at the moment, because he's got a lot of imagination.</p><p>He's not proactive, is a better word than negative. England have got some quality bowlers and over a period of time they'll take wickets but, if they're not having a very good day, there's no imagination, no out-thinking the opposition. He's just going to stand there and let the bowlers bowl. I don't like that style of captaincy and when you're playing the best teams in the world, it won't hold up.</p><p>\"I think in the last few Tests of the last series there were enough encouraging signs for Australia to say, 'We're not far away.' Fast forward to this series, on Australian soil, in Australian conditions, and I think England have to play the best cricket they possibly can to win. I think if they don't, or if Australia don't allow them to play well, I think Australia will win.\"</p><p>Warne believes that England have made a faltering start to their defence, having \"really missed a trick\" by leaving out Graham Onions in favour of \"a few bowlers who are very similar\" in Boyd Rankin, Chris Tremlett and Steven Finn. \"If something happens to James Anderson I'm not sure who's going to replace him,\" Warne said. \"You want a like-for-like bowler rather than four giants who just bang it into the wicket.\"</p><p>He also contends that Joe Root should drop back into the middle order, allowing Michael Carberry to open with Cook. Root's brilliant 180 in the second Test at Lord's was one of the highlights of the last series, but the 22-year-old scored 16 runs or fewer in seven of his 10 Ashes innings last summer, and Warne believes that \"Australia really have got his number\".</p><p>\"I think the No6 spot is a bit of a weak link in the side,\" Warne added. \"Trott, Bell, Pietersen, Root and Prior at seven is a strong middle order and I think that looks better than Root at the top, then Bairstow or one of the other guys at No6. Root played well at Lord's, when Australia had a bit of a horror, but I don't think he's an opener because his technique is not tight enough and I think Australia found him out.</p><p>\"He's a good player of the field, a manipulator of the spinners, a good worker. I think he's a perfect No6. As an opener I think he's going to nick off a lot, and we saw in England that Australia really did have his number. Carberry's better suited to opening than Root and it's a better balanced side without [Jonny] Bairstow, who had plenty of chances in the Ashes and just didn't do enough. I know England like to stick with their team, but sometimes you've got to think: 'Is there a better option?' In my opinion there is. I think Australia would fancy their chances with Root opening the batting and Bairstow at No6.\"</p><p><em>The Ashes are exclusively live on Sky Sports in HD and on mobile and tablet devices via Sky Go as part of a year-round schedule of live cricket.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421566224|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|44f2198f70b335e67213515e208d9278d422af3e -->",

        "body":"<p>To misquote Roald Dahl, they are the three BFRs (big friendly rivals), and with little more than two weeks until the first Ashes Test, England insist the field is still clear for one of them to grab the third seamer's position in Brisbane.</p><p>Steven Finn, Chris Tremlett and Boyd Rankin each improved after a slow start in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/02/england-draw-ashes-warm-up\" title=\"\">opening tour fixture in Perth</a>, but with Stuart Broad due to make his first appearance in the second warm-up game against Australia A in Hobart this week, and Jimmy Anderson also likely to want another bowl before taking a break in the last week before the Test, it may be that only one of the beanpoles will be given another chance to make an impression in Tasmania.</p><p>David Saker, England's bowling coach who makes no secret of his soft spot for tall fast bowlers – especially in his native Australia – is relishing the competition for places between the three.</p><p>\"It's a really healthy thing when you have three people training for one spot,\" said Saker, effectively confirming that Tim Bresnan has no chance of proving his recovery from back problems in time to play in Brisbane by describing the possibility of him bowling in the last of England's warm-up games in Sydney the week before the Test as \"high risk\".</p><p>\"You get them training hard, get them playing hard, they're under pressure all the time – that's a good thing from where we sit and where the selectors sit.\"</p><p>He conceded they had not responded well to that pressure on the first day of the tour in Perth. \"When you play your first warm-up game there's some nerves there,\" Saker added. \"You all know you're playing for one spot so there's a bit of apprehension.\"</p><p>Rankin, the Irish farmer who made such a positive impression in the one-day series against Australia last summer, was the most obviously affected, over-pitching regularly in his first spell. But by the end of a long first innings he was looking the most likely of the three, and he then took two good wickets in four overs when given the new ball second time around.</p><p>Tremlett was rarely better than steady, and occasionally innocuous. But the acting captain Matt Prior singled him out for generating reverse swing in the second innings, and Saker hinted that the impact he made in the last three Tests of England's last Ashes tour could count in his favour.</p><p>\"Chris can swing the ball quite well and his record in 2010-11 was outstanding,\" said the bowling coach. \"Past form does come into selection but ideally we want them to be playing really well before we pick them and I'm confident we'll have two or three really good candidates for that spot come Brisbane.</p><p>\"There's nothing that one player did [in Perth] that made him jump ahead of anybody, and there was nothing someone did that would take him out of consideration.\"</p><p>Finn also played in three Tests on the last tour three winters ago, in his case the first three before he was displaced by Bresnan in Melbourne despite being England's leading wicket-taker in the series to that point. That was largely because he had leaked runs too freely, which made his first-innings figures in Perth – one for 123 in 23 overs – worrying, both for Finn and for England.</p><p>There was no immediate improvement second time round after he replaced Rankin. But in the last session of the match, something seemed to click. England were clearly determined to give Finn a long bowl – he delivered a 10-over spell either side of the tea break – and he had long conversations with both Prior and Alastair Cook, who made a beeline for him when he came on to the field as a highly-qualified 12th man.</p><p>\"There were some really good signs in his last spell,\" said Saker. \"He does need a lot of bowling because he is tuning his body into a new action. I'm sure if he keeps playing and we put enough overs into him, he'll put himself in contention. We know how good he is and how good he has been, so we're going to spend a lot of time with him and make sure we get him back to where we can.\"</p><p>With similar uncertainty over who will bat at No6 – and possibly even a doubt over Cook's opening partner, given the possibility that Joe Root could drop back into the middle order to hand an unexpected chance to Michael Carberry – Saker conceded that England's planning is much more fluid than three years ago, when their preferred Test team was chosen for each of the first two warm-up games, and were required merely to rubber-stamp their selection.</p><p>\"We haven't really talked through these three games as far as structure because we didn't have it in our head at the start,\" he said. \"Last time I think we had a pretty clear idea about our attack and batting line-up down here. So there's just a little bit of different preparation – we'll play it by ear. But again that's a healthy thing. Fighting for spots is always good.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421561156|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|87b340d4611d87877dc2f985ff2f0f95f3f2470c -->",

        "body":"<p>To the uninitiated, cricket is as esoteric as the Kabbalah. To those in the know it, is a game of grace, speed and power. And therein hides the magic, because for many of its fans cricket is almost a philosophy, a way of life embodying a certain sporting spirit that can be carried into other areas of life. Some of the spectators may look half asleep, but in fact they're meditating on the finer points of play while keeping one eye on the weather and the other on the bar.<br /> <br />We begin with <strong>Papa M's I Am Not Lonely with Cricket</strong>, which is worth its selection as an opener for the title alone. A beautiful and strange instrumental, building its guitar structures slowly, evoking a hot day at county level, and lasting about as long as it takes to sip a pint in the sun.<br /> <br />History is inseparably tied to sport. <strong>Latif Nangarhari's Da Cricket Loba Dagatama Lar Aw Bar Afghanan Loy Afghanistan</strong> celebrates his country's admission to the highest level of world cricket. The music is traditionally based and very energetic, while the lyrics are in Pashto, giving Latif access to about 60 million speakers, though he lives in Birmingham these days.<br /> <br />Across the world in Los Angeles, the Compton Cricket Club is bigged in by <strong>Cloth's Bullets</strong> – a song, like the CCC itself, dedicated to fighting homelessness and gang culture with civility and dignity.<br /> <br />Over to the south-eastern Caribbean to Trinidad and Tobago now for an exuberant soca take on the game, <strong>Machel Montano and Claudette Peters's Come Rise with Me</strong>. Guaranteed to get the crowd on its feet.<br /> <br />While we're in the Caribbean we might as well catch <strong>I-Roy's Tribute to Michael Holding</strong>. Known as \"Whispering Death\" because of his quiet approach to the crease, Holding was one of the fastest bowlers ever to play Test cricket. \"Michael Holdin', his performance was golden\", declares I-Roy, in reference to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loYyJllsj68\">Holding's six-ball destruction of England captain Geoffrey Boycott in Bridgetown in 1981</a>.<br /> <br /><strong>The Duckworth Lewis Method's Third Man</strong> melodically shares with us the thoughts of an unsuccessful fielder who has been stranded in the middle of nowhere by his team captain in order to keep him out of trouble. He's dreaming of tea, in between recalling film scenes from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36181/third.man\">The Third Man</a>.<br /> <br /><strong>Roots Manuva's Again and Again</strong> describes the improvement gained by a poor batsman. Or at least the video does, expressing amusingly some of the philosophy embedded in cricket's traditions.<br /> <br /><strong>Jah Thomas's Cricket Lovely Cricket</strong> informs us that the game is actually quite straightforward. Forget philosophy: \"All you got do is lick the ball before it reach the wicket.\"<br /> <br />It's not all glory though – as one country ascends, another declines. Back in 1990, fans of the Windies were wallowing in disappointment. Calypsonian <strong>David Rudder's Rally Round the West Indies</strong> pleads with the fans not to give up hope, using the team's misfortunes as a metaphor for wider political struggles.<br /> <br />In an earlier song, <strong>Lord Relator's Gavaskar Calypso</strong>, we note cricket's innate sportsmanship as Relator tells us that India's Sunil Gavaskar was the master batsman: \"We just couldn't get him out.\"<br /> <br />Apparently rain stopped play in <strong>Pavement's Carrot Rope</strong>. They got beaten, and \"the wicket keeper is down\". In the video they're adequately attired for British cricket in yellow rain macs.<br /> <br /><strong>The Cavaliers' It's a Beautiful Game</strong> simply wants us to love the sport of cricket, encasing the names of dozens of its most famous exponents within a gorgeous melody.</p><h2>The list</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDNANxKOVbM\">Papa M – I Am Not Lonely with Cricket</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5FKZNQrfug\">Latif Nangarhari – Da Cricket Loba Dagatama Lar Aw Bar Afghanan Loy Afghanistan</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKa2mp5ePes\">Cloth – Bullets</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN7rMnuxYIU\">Machel Montano and Claudette Peters – Come Rise with Me</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzJ5PpZ1BdE\">I-Roy – Tribute to Michael Holding</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WHQpg_3ZS4\">The Duckworth Lewis Method – Third Man</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRxYNTH-5Go \">Roots Manuva – Again and Again</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysZWCRCgRsI\">Jah Thomas – Cricket Lovely Cricket</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-MgkoLKMr0\">David Rudder – Rally Round the West Indies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tBp1ClIDys\">Lord Relator – Gavaskar Calypso</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxehrvhNMY8\">Pavement – Carrot Rope</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci8FczAAeHM\">The Cavaliers – It's a Beautiful Game</a></p><p>• Listen to these songs on a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjjJcJNDIhap4N9xNEcg2jtJlPUOZfmk_&amp;feature=mh_lolz\">YouTube playlist</a>.</p><p>• See all the readers' recommendations on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2013/jul/18/readers-recommend-songs-cricket\">last week's blog</a>, from which sonofwebcore selected the songs above.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413611530|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|7c3cbd368d486afcd4d98227a802bf9d7ceea268 -->",

        "body":"<p>Who would dare call Test cricket boring now? In a nerve-shredding denouement to an opening Ashes Test that had already contained enough plot twists to last the entire summer, England sealed a narrow victory in dramatic circumstances.</p><p>With Australia requiring just 15 runs to secure an unlikely victory thanks to a heroic last wicket stand of 65, England fast bowler and man of the match Jimmy Anderson claimed his 10th and final wicket – but not before a lengthy delay while the decision was referred to the third umpire, Marais Erasmus, in a Test where the use of technology has become a significant talking point.</p><p>Eventually, as the decision was confirmed, the England players in the middle and the majority of the crowd erupted in an explosion of joy and relief.</p><p>On the pitch the umpire Aleem Dar was forced to overturn his original decision and confirm that Brad Haddin, who had taken Australia to the brink of victory with a defiant innings of 71, had nicked the ball to wicketkeeper Matt Prior, awarding England victory in a Test match that had swung as wildly as some of Anderson's bowling.</p><p>The match had already taken in a teenage debutant, Ashton Agar, who had scored 98 batting at No 11, a controversial incident in which England player Stuart Broad had refused to walk despite clearly being out, and an innings by Ian Bell for the home side that was widely regarded as his best ever.</p><p>\"I don't think I've played in a Test where the momentum has changed quite so quickly and so often. I'm glad we managed to scrape through in the end,\" said a relieved England captain, Alastair Cook.</p><p>\"I always said I would be the only England captain not to go bald in the job but days like this won't help that.\"</p><p>For those England fans among the packed crowd watching in almost eerie silence as fingernails were bitten to the quick and early optimism evaporated, there were unmistakable echoes of the Edgbaston Test during the summer of 2005. Then, during an epic series that ultimately saw England regain the Ashes after a gap of 18 years, the home side had prevailed by just two runs following a similarly unlikely run chase by Australia that fell just short.</p><p>After the emotion and drama of last summer's London Olympics and with no major international football tournament, 2013 was supposed to be a quieter sporting summer.</p><p>Yet in the space of eight dramatic days, the British and Irish Lions have won their first series since 1997, Andy Murray has become the first British man to win Wimbledon for 77 years and now England have secured victory in the opening Ashes Test of a back-to-back home and away series in thrilling style.</p><p>The use of the controversial DRS system that became a huge talking point when Broad refused to walk after edging a ball to slip at a crucial point during England's second innings again worked to England's benefit at the climax of the match.</p><p>Australia captain Michael Clarke, who was unable to review the dismissal of Broad because he had already made two unsuccessful appeals during that innings, said afterwards he would have to \"get better\" at using the system.</p><p>In the case of Haddin, who had set England hearts racing as he took Australia to the brink of victory in conjunction with 11th man James Pattinson, the decision was the right one.</p><p>Such a nailbiting climax had looked unlikely earlier in the day as Anderson secured three wickets in 24 seemingly game-changing balls, including that of Agar.</p><p>But then Haddin and Pattinson began spraying the ball around Trent Bridge as England's momentum stalled. Steven Finn dropped Haddin in the deep and Jonny Bairstow missed a chance to run the same player out.</p><p>The Barmy Army fell silent and the Australians began dreaming of just the 13th one wicket victory in Test history.</p><p>Australia emerged from lunch needing just 20 to win, buoying the mood of the Fanatics in the crowd and leaving the singer employed to serenade the players with Land of Hope and Glory during the break in danger of looking foolishly premature. But then came one final twist.</p><p>After the game Anderson, who bowled 13 overs in an energy sapping spell before lunch before succumbing to cramp, playfully chided Cook for also dropping a catch earlier, off his bowling, that might have helped avoid the need for such drama.</p><p>Given all the breathless action so far, it seems scarcely credible that the Test that will begin at Lord's on Thursday is just the second of the summer.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412809738|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|89d750b172ca915b20f8cea0846051515909af2d -->",

        "headline":"Ashes 2013: all eyes turn to cricket for a great British summer",
        "body":"<p>The oldest rivalry in cricket reconvenes on Wednesday when, from 11am, England take on Australia at Trent Bridge in Nottingham, a moment eagerly anticipated by players and supporters alike, not least because it's been known for an entire series to be shaped by events on the first morning.</p><p>Whether they will still be as enthusiastic by 7 January next year, after the teams have played 10 Test matches at up to five days apiece home and away, not to mention a slew of Twenty20 and one-day clashes, is a moot point to say the least. With back-to-back Ashes Tests in the same year for the first time, the next six months represent the most concentrated spell of Ashes cricket in its 131-year history.</p><p>But for David Collier, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the impending avalanche of Ashes can't be too much of a good thing.\"On the contrary, it has created intense excitement. I don't see how it can diminish the achievement. If we can retain the Ashes over two series, then it would be an even greater achievement,\" Collier said.</p><p>\"All the tickets are gone. Sold out. You've only got to look at the demand for tickets, at the fact we've got 300 clubs signed up to show the action on big screens, to see how big it is. I don't think anything in cricket captures the imagination of the British public more than the Ashes series.\"</p><p>Collier said England's cricketers would go into Wednesday's first Test hoping to build on the feelgood factor created by the Lions rugby union side and Wimbledon winner Andy Murray. Following a wet summer in 2012 that was dominated by the Olympics, this year is seen as a crucial barometer for the health of the sport in a year without a major football tournament to draw the attention.</p><p>The climactic fifth Ashes Test in August  at the Oval, south London, was sold out before Christmas for the first time and the same was true at Trent Bridge. \"We couldn't process the orders quickly enough,\" said a Trent Bridge spokesman.</p><p>David Cameron, the day after his No 10 reception with Murray, released a message of support for England: \"Whether you remember Botham and Willis at Headingley, like I do, or Kevin Pietersen's defiant stance at the Oval in 2005 – I remember where I was when that happened – nothing captures the public's imagination quite like a Test match against Australia. The nation's got high hopes. We're right behind the team, and I'm sure they're going to rise to the occasion. So best of luck from everyone at Downing Street to [England captain] Alastair Cook and the boys.\"</p><p>Collier said the huge demand for tickets proved the switch to pay TV in 2005 had not diminished cricket's appeal,  despite concerns it had lessened its ability to become part of the national conversation.</p><p>The back-to-back series have been scheduled to realign the Ashes so they do not take place in the same year as a cricket World Cup, which is due to be held in Australia and New Zealand in 2015.By next January, Cook's sside could have won four Ashes series in a row.</p><p>The Australians are in some disarray, after a 4-0 Test series defeat in India and a disappointing showing in the Champions Trophy, interspersed with an unsavoury incident in a bar when David Warner aimed a punch at young England batsman Joe Root at 2am. Warner, a batsman, was fined £7,000 and suspended until the start of the first Test.</p><p>As a result, Cricket Australia sacked their coach Mickey Arthur just 16 days before Wednesday's opener. He was replaced by straight-talking Darren Lehmann, a move which former players including Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath have said can give Australia back their momentum.</p><p>But some former England players, including Sir Ian Botham, have predicted a 10-0 whitewash.</p><p>Collier said it would be closer than that and, even if England won relatively easily, it wouldn't diminish the appeal of one of the oldest and most keenly fought rivalries in sport. When England won in 2005, it was the first time they had captured a series since 1987.</p><p>The ECB points to the strength of the elite game, where England have prospered since regaining the Ashes in 2005, and further investment in the grassroots to justify the removal of live coverage of the sport from free-to-air TV.</p><p>Sky, gearing up for a battle with BT Sport, has renamed one of its channels Sky Ashes and will screen only cricket on it for the summer.</p><p>Aside from the investment of £260m over four years, Sky says it is able to devote more resources and airtime to the sport. Yet some insist something has been lost along the way, including the ability to inspire children whose parents may not be cricket fans.</p><p>\"All the objective facts totally rubbish that argument. What is critical to engaging people is local club facilities and local coaches. We have invested a lot of time and a lot of effort and that's paid off. People tend to forget there was no terrestrial bid for cricket on the table, so it's a redundant argument,\" said Collier.</p><h2>No fanfare for fans</h2><p>England's players have failed in an attempt to get Billy Cooper – aka Billy the Trumpet – into Trent Bridge so he can help England's \"Barmy Army\" create a raucous atmosphere.</p><p>Players Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann, among others, have been lobbying administrators to force the ground to change its policy of not allowing entry to those with musical instruments, but to no avail.</p><p>Pietersen said the team's pleas had \"fallen on deaf ears\", while Swann added: \"Personally, I think it's a shame. I know the whole team are behind Billy, and the Barmy Army are a massive part of the English team.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412490118|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|99695640a3385ce100115a3c7b7380af71af2bbf -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>I gave my life to cricket, it's as simple as that. </strong>I never got married because I&nbsp;was married to the game.</p><p><strong>My father came to watch me play often, </strong>but I never knew he was there. That's&nbsp;how parents should be. He worked as a miner from when he was a boy until the day he turned 65 and retired. He kept on to me: \"This is no life for you.\" We both saw sport as a way out.</p><p><strong>For the first time in my life I'm beginning to feel my age.</strong> Four years ago I had a stroke, but I'm soldiering on. It has made me very emotional – I have always felt things very deeply, but more so now. Some mornings I can't face getting up, but you force yourself. I do my exercises, have a shave, and get on with it.</p><p><strong>I realised early on that nothing would come easy. </strong>One time I scored 181 not out, and straight after the chairman came to me and said: \"Well played, but you&nbsp;will be back in the second XI next week.\"</p><p><strong>My mother made me go to church every Sunday, </strong>morning and evening, and I'm glad she did. I still go, and I say my prayers every night, though since I have a new knee I have to sit on the edge of the bed rather than kneel.</p><p><strong>You learned a lot about politics in Yorkshire cricket. </strong>You learned to be hard, determined. That wasn't natural for me. But I did it all the same.</p><p><strong>I always lived out of a suitcase, </strong>but it never struck me as a lonely life. Depression seems to have come in the game more these days.</p><p><strong>I do believe in miracles.</strong> One morning I woke up completely blind.  The doctor said it was down to all the years I had stood on a cricket field in  the sun. The operation was a huge gamble and it took three months for me  to see again. But&nbsp;I thanked the good Lord – and the surgeon – when I did.</p><p><strong>A good night's sleep </strong>was my best friend as an umpire.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/dec/28/guardianobituaries.cricket\" title=\"\"><strong>Kerry Packer</strong></a><strong> offered me a huge amount of money</strong> to join his tour in the 1970s. I thought about it a lot, then and since, but I wanted to stand by the establishment, the game I knew. <strong>As an umpire you had to be a bit detached.</strong> But watching those great players at close quarters – Dennis Lillee, Garfield Sobers, Ian Botham – was a thrilling thing. What you really wanted to do was applaud.</p><p><strong>I never found it hard to see the ball. </strong>The quickest bowler I ever saw was Frank&nbsp;Tyson. Fifty-odd years ago when I was batting he hit me with a ball on the inside of the jaw at Scarborough. I can still feel that now.</p><p><strong>Whatever job you do –</strong> dustman, cricketer, doctor – any pressure you bring you bring on yourself.</p><p><strong>Before I went out in the middle I would meditate,</strong> have a bit of quiet. You&nbsp;see, you need to relax to be ready for anything.</p><p><strong>If I have one regret, it is not having a family. </strong>I'd have liked to watch a lad or a&nbsp;grandson playing sport. I miss it more now than ever.</p><p>80 Not Out: My Favourite Cricket Memories <em>by Dickie Bird is out now (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, £20).

Boult was spent but to the roars of the crowd, he thrashed the ball into an unresponsive pitch for the last time, Prior defended and then raised his arms in triumph. England had survived the match and earned themselves a draw in the series by the skin of their teeth. </p><p>It was a day for heroes, players who reined in their natural instincts to carve out one of the great rearguards for only three teams previously had entered the final day of a Test with four wickets down and survived to the end of the day.</p><p>First came Ian Bell, who batted with skill and monumental application for almost six hours, making 75, only to be dismissed, to his obvious distress, on the very stroke of tea. Then there was Stuart Broad, whose batting has deteriorated to such an extent since his century against Pakistan that the life expectancy of each innings since has been four overs. Broad batted for two hours and seventeen minutes, the first 103 minutes of which were scoreless, longer than anyone in Tests has ever gone without opening their account and in terms of deliveries, 62 balls, only 15 shy of that record. He survived until the shadows were lengthening and there were just 21 deliveries remaining.</p><p>Then there was Monty Panesar, called upon at the very death to reprise his Cardiff heroics and doing so nervelessly apart from one harem-scarem scampered single to get off the strike that ended with a swallow dive so mistimed that it left him still a foot short of the crease and scrabbling desperately to get home.</p><p>Above it all though was Prior. His unbeaten 110 was the seventh century of his Test career and by a distance his best given the responsibility he was handed in seeing things through once Bell had departed head down to the dressing room. Only Les Ames, of England wicketkeepers, has more, with eight.</p><p>Prior rode his luck. An early attempted pull was mistimed barely out of reach of a desperately backpedalling mid wicket. One ferocious bouncer to him clipped him on the head, looped over him and dropped onto the stumps without dislodging the bails. He had 28 then. Indeed the only time he seemed disconcerted was when Neil Wagner, the battling left armer, hurled in his clever variations of slow and faster bouncers. Prior felt the need to take them on as the best means of defending against them, and several times pulled the ball just out of reach of fielders placed short on the legside for that purpose. That which he just scraped over the top of midwicket to bring up his hundred was greeted with his own cry of admonishment, furious with himself for getting sucked in. Given the defensive nature of his task, his innings, over 182 deliveries, still ranks as brisk and there were 20 boundaries. </p><p>Although the result means that they just retain their position as the number two ranked side, and the extra cash that goes with it, the England euphoria that accompanied the result cannot camouflage the fact that in the course of the three matches they have been outplayed overall by a good New Zealand side that Graham Gooch, the batting coach, has confessed they underestimated. In Dunedin, where a day was lost to the weather, it is likely New Zealand would have won, while in Wellington, the dreadful weather probably prevented England from doing likewise. Here it has been New Zealand who have bossed the game. Whether they would have won had Brendon McCullum enforced the follow-on is a moot point, but aside from some help from the bowlers rough there was precious help for spin or seam even on the fifth day once the new ball had been negotiated by England. </p><p>England had begun the day with Bell and Joe Root at the crease and the pair managed to stay together until shortly before lunch when McCullum handed the second new ball to Boult. His first delivery with it was perfect, swinging down the line of the stumps and catching Root in front. If the young batsman has ambition to be an international opener then, fine delivery as it was, he ought to have anticipated the possibility. Then came two rare mistakes by New Zealand, one costly the other not, for in the space of two deliveries, Bell, who had made 40 by then, was dropped at third slip by Dean Brownlie, and Jonny Bairstow was missed in the gully. Bairstow, hopelessly but not unexpectedly, out of touch, was caught at first slip straight after the interval but Bell was able to bat for almost another full session, with Prior, before he lost concentration, flicked at Wagner and was caught at third slip. At that point , with 32 overs still remaining,the game really did seem up. </p><p>But Broad entrenched himself, overcoming a nervy start and surviving one close lbw call, a thin edge saving him as he was knocked off his feet by a yorker, but his bat handle jamming itself into his neck as he fell. It did appear that he would be able to see things through with Prior, until McCullum called up Kane Williamson to send down his gentle offspin to the left hander. Broad pushed, the ball spun out of the rough and Ross Taylor took the catch, the combination repeating itself two balls later when Anderson, who had shared the Cardiff heroics with Panesar, also edged. When Panesar, left to face the final over, managed to get off strike with the third ball, the relief was palpable.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406216762|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|bf91a32b39d3c7f22f4cac2dca5236b591ab86be -->",

        "headline":"England on brink of defeat as New Zealand take total command",
        "body":"<p>England were in a desperate position at the close of the fourth day of a match dominated by a vibrant New Zealand team. Battered and bruised in the field by a second century in the match from Peter Fulton and McCullumed into oblivion for the umpteenth time in the past two months, England were set the notional target of 481 to win – uncharted territory in that regard for any side in the history of the game – but more realistically 143 overs to bat out and claim a share of the three-match series.</p><p>They do have history of surviving such a challenge, most recently the 141 overs they used up against South Africa in Cape Town three years ago, when Paul Collingwood – Brigadier Block – spent four and a half hours over 40 and Ian Bell as long over 78. </p><p>As the shadows lengthened though, and the teams left the field, the innings, at 90 for four, was in tatters once more, surely along with their hopes. They lost Nick Compton in the third over of the innings and later Jonathan Trott, a second bastion, to the first delivery purveyed from round the wicket by the indefatigable Neil Wagner, a wide ball at which the batsman drove without due care and attention and edged, an uncharacteristic lapse in his concentration: it was a dismissal that had its roots, perhaps, in the time spent in the field watching the ball sail into the stands.</p><p>It appeared that the captain Alastair Cook had the resolve at least to see things through to the close, with Bell digging in alongside him. But like Trott even Cook's powers of concentration wavered and with fewer than four overs of the day remaining he too drove vigorously at Kane Williamson's offbreak where he need not have done, and Dean Brownlie held a stupendous reflex catch at slip. Cook had made 43 from 145 balls. One further wicket went to what proved the final ball of the day, when Steve Finn, the nightwatchman who survived more than two sessions in Dunedin, prodded a catch, from Williamson once more, to gully where Tim Southee held a second reflex catch. Such things stick when you are on a high. Bell at least remained, with eight runs from 89 balls. </p><p>England have been unravelled by the New Zealanders at Eden Park, outbatted by Fulton, a revelation after a four-year absence (to himself as much as anyone no doubt) and recipient of a message from the prime minister for his efforts; outbowled by Trent Boult, Southee and Bruce Martin; outfielded (although that might be harsh for England's rarely flagged under the assault and Matt Prior was terrific throughout); and certainly outgeneralled by McCullum.</p><p>It is easy to captain when you have a team on the ropes but New Zealand were able to reach that stage in the first place through his proactivity. The pity is that few Aucklanders have bothered to turn up, even over the weekend, for this has the makings not just of a team that punches above its weight (the default position for Kiwi sides of the past) but with a couple of additions – another top flight batsman for instance, and the return of pacemen such as Doug Bracewell – could be regarded as one of the best around. Indeed the return series in England, in May, can no longer be looked at as the safe bet it is viewed as by many. A loss here and England will have slipped down the rankings to third place, below India. </p><p>Until McCullum pulled the plug on the innings at 241 for six, with a little more than an hour to tea, England had been reduced to rubble. New Zealand already had a sizeable lead at the start of play and after a little early reconnaissance, with licence then, and no consequences, to swing like the Krankies on a Saturday night, batting becomes easier.</p><p>England did try a different strategy to Fulton, whose disdain for the offside is matched by his penchant for the onside, by setting a short midwicket and bowling straighter. It might have brought his wicket when he had 32, Anderson unable to cling on in that very position, but it was the last offering he gave until Joe Root held a mishit at long on.</p><p>By then he had made 110, his last 60 runs coming from 44 balls, including five sixes as he opened his considerable shoulders: his stand with McCullum was worth 94 from 81 balls and at one time England employed every fielder on the fence except Prior, who in order to do so would have been compelled to hand in his gloves and pads. Later, as England defended, New Zealand had every man bar one around the bat. </p><p>Once again they were monstered by McCullum, who should become the threat of choice for errant children: \"Be quiet or Brendon McCullum will come and belt your attempted yorker into the stands.\" In the course of 10 innings in all formats he has made 576 runs at considerably more than a run a ball, hit seven half-centuries and 24 sixes, three of them in his unbeaten 67 here. It is an astounding run of form given the manner in which he plays.</p><p>As for his team, they managed 16 sixes in this match, just two short of the record of 18 by West Indies (against England in Antigua in 1986) for a single team in a Test. England's only one thus far has come from Stuart Broad.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406161122|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1cfe1c36347ff570e12b1e99ade823060be130fa -->",

        "headline":"England's bowlers struggle after putting New Zealand into bat on day one",
        "body":"<p>This was not one of England's finest days. With New Zealand put in to bat by Alastair Cook they suffered through a day in the field that yielded a maiden Test century, 124 not out, for Peter Fulton at the age of 34, another approaching for the brilliant young tyro Kane Williamson who left the field unbeaten on 83, and the single wicket, to Steve Finn, of Hamish Rutherford. Already, by the close of the first day, New Zealand, at 250 for one, had the solid foundations of a draw and thus a drawn series that one suspects has been the primary ambition since the first two matches ended in stalemate, with anything beyond that a bonus.<br /> <br />To this end they have had a compliant groundsman who, while capable of producing a drop-in pitch with genuine pace and bounce, has seen how Steve Finn got the ball through during the limited overs matches and appears to have top-dressed this offering with Mogadon. The bowlers, who have suffered their way through the featherbeds in Dunedin and Wellington, were made to do so again now in Eden Park, where they would get more help from a surly teenager asked to tidy his room. It might help New Zealand's cause and hinder that of England but it does very little for the game as a spectacle. </p><p>The debate will rage long and hard on whether Cook's decision to bowl first constitutes a blunder, and no doubt there will be the usual kneejerk reaction that inevitably accompanies such a day. It is a facile way of thinking. Nothing proves a decision such as this to be right or wrong until there is a much broader picture on which to draw.</p><p>England might reasonably have expected more assistance from a pitch that because of the Warriors rugby league team's match on the ground last Saturday would not have been put in place until Sunday at the earliest and must have had some residual moisture in it as a result. This is the first Test match at Eden Park in seven years so there is no real precedent on which to draw in terms of its behaviour. Even so it is the nature of drop-in pitches elsewhere generally to improve as matches wear on, as indeed it is for many natural surfaces: the days of always batting regardless are long since gone and sides now see bowling first as just as important in establishing a hold on a match as supposed scoreboard pressure.</p><p>The fullness of time may prove it a bad decision should New Zealand's bowlers make their way through the England order when their turn comes, or Cook and his advisers may be vindicated by England racking up a large total themselves, but it it would not be unreasonable to expect the most help for the seamers, whatever that might be, to be on the first day. Brendon McCullum has said he would have adopted the same strategy himself, as indeed he did in the first two Tests. It is just the modern way. </p><p>Nothing though should be taken away from Fulton, Two Metre Peter, whose Test career, which began in 2006, has been resurrected after a four-year absence, and as a makeshift opener. In the first two matches he had moderate success with one half-century but the feeling was that he was static, a bat-hanger, and did not make use of his height. But here, over the course of six hours' batting, he scarcely put a foot wrong, discrete outside offstump when England attacked him there and prolific on the legside both when the ball was pitched up or when dropped short. Only twice was he troubled: first, early on, when there was still hardness in the ball, Jimmy Anderson found the outside edge and the ball flew high to the right of Joe Root at third slip who could not quite get there; and once, off Anderson again, when an attempted hook spiralled high off the top edge but carried for six over the minuscule fine leg boundary.</p><p>He took his chances too against Monty Panesar – who had kept his place, despite a temptation to go with four seamers – clubbing him into the stand and once to the longest boundary. His century, reached with a single to mid-on, was marked with nice understatement and a look of mild relief that his career had gained some fulfilment. </p><p>Williamson, on the other hand, is a young player with the cricket world before him. The contrast at the crease between he and Fulton, during their unbroken second wicket stand of 171, could scarcely be greater. But diminutive batsmen, or the best ones at any rate, tend to be the best judges of length simply because they have to be. Essentially Williamson is a proficient cutter and puller as might be expected. Bowlers though will tend to overcompensate to someone who hangs back in the crease, and as such he is very quick and solid into the drive. In simple terms he looks a composed, solid, technically sound all-round batsman who might be troubled only by bounce on more flirty pitches than this.<br /> <br />The England seamers found no swing or seam movement and the bounce died once the hardness left the ball. Reverse swing is not an option with a thick lush outfield and no used pitches on which to scuff the ball. So they were reduced to attempting novelty field-placings, angles of attack, 10 minutes of short stuff – anything to break the rhythm of batting – to no avail until they took the second new ball 10 overs from the close and Anderson and Broad managed to sneak a couple past the bat of tiring <br />batsmen.</p><p>Panesar meanwhile twirled away, trying to mix things up occasionally and suffering when he did so. This is not turning into one of his more prolific series but a first day pitch is no place to be expecting any spinner to run through a team.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406043785|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|5291aafade6a30226b8437385f916914509645b9 -->",
