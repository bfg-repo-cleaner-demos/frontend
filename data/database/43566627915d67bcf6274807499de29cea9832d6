Democrats would&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to pay a ransom. Republicans spent weeks prodding for every weakness. Would Senate Democrats from deep red states be pried away?

If Boehner ever threatens to do so again in the future, no one should take it seriously. He no longer has the credibility to make those threats. The debt limit is not an extortion device.

        "body":"<p>On 1 October, democracy was officially suspended in the US people's House of Representatives.</p><p>Now, two weeks in to the federal shutdown, we are living with the results. Millions of Americans are going without important government services, and hundreds of thousands of hardworking civil servants are being forced to go without pay while bills pile up and mortgages come due. Children with cancer are being <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/19kyUsv\">turned away from experimental drug trials</a> at the National Institutes of Health. The Center for Disease Control is left <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/flu-season-may-be-starting-feds-furlough-cant-track-it-8C11329868\">without enough manpower to track the spread of the flu</a>, potentially leaving vulnerable populations at risk. Small business owners are finding it <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1bc51tF\">difficult to secure loans</a>. And the list goes on – <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-08/shutdown-costs-at-1-6-billion-with-160-million-each-day.html\">to the tune of $160m</a> or more in lost economic activity every day.</p><p>It didn't have to be this way. There are enough votes in the House to pass the Senate's \"clean\" bill to fund government – and this already represents Democrats being willing to compromise to accept the GOP's post-sequester funding levels for the short term. It would have easily passed the House with a bipartisan majority – had the House Republican leadership brought it to the floor for a simple up-or-down vote. But House Republicans – <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/rachel-maddow/53151808\">many of whom have long had the goal of shutting down the government</a> – effectively wrote the shutdown into law with just hours left on the clock.</p><p>If that sounds unbelievable and outrageous, it's because it is.</p><p>The chairman of the House rules committee conceded that, under normal procedure with clause 4 of rule 22, if the House amends a Senate bill and the Senate rejects the House's amendment(s), <em>any</em> House member has the right to bring the original Senate bill up for an immediate up-or-down vote in the House. But just two hours before the government was poised to shut down, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd-iaYLO1A&amp;sns=tw\">House Republicans quietly rigged the rules in their favor</a>. They changed that rule to ensure that <em>only</em> Republican majority leader Eric Cantor could bring the Senate bill to reopen the government up for a vote – something they have refused to do.</p><p>The Republicans thought they would get away with this. They had assumed that voters would not notice this egregious display of power and would overlook the fact that they had fundamentally changed the way our representative democracy operates. But they were wrong.</p><p>This past Saturday, on the House floor, as almost 200 Democrats lined up to sign a petition to open the government, I called the Republicans out on their manipulation of the rules – and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd-iaYLO1A&amp;sns=tw\">video of the exchange has already been viewed nearly 3m times</a>.</p><p>While it involves arcane parliamentary procedure, this issue is fundamental to our democracy. The public recognizes what's at stake in this debate. They recognize that rigging the rules to keep the government shut down makes a mockery of the democratic process in the people's House.</p><p>It's time to stop stalling and allow democracy to work its will. If Speaker Boehner would simply allow the House of Representatives to work as it was designed to, we could open the government immediately.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420148929|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|616ae6775d838105adeef4109c1908a8afbce29c -->",

This time is no different. They can take some comfort in the rock-bottom approval ratings for Congress – currently hovering somewhere between <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-congress-poll-shutdown-zombies-20131008,0,1626947.story\">hemorrhoids and Charles Manson</a> – and specifically for the House Tea Party caucus that precipitated the shutdown. But this is an old story: we<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/04/americans-blame-republicans-government-shutdown\"> all hate Congress</a>, but love our own representatives. Members of Congress don't answer to national polls, they answer to their constituents. And<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/09/meadows-boehner-defund-obamacare-suicide-caucus-geography.html\"> thanks to redistricting</a>, a large chunk of the House Republicans are insulated in ultra-conservative districts that have been gerrymandered to a point beyond all recognition to the rest of the country (while the remainder live in fear of getting challenge in the primaries if they don't go along with the former's reckless endeavors).</p><p>This is why Representative Ted Yoho, described by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/us/politics/many-in-gop-offer-theory-default-wouldnt-be-that-bad.html?_r=1&amp;\">New York Times</a> as \"a freshman Florida Republican who had no experience in elective office before this year [who] said the largest economy on earth should learn from his large-animal veterinary practice\", suggested \"<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/yoho-furloughed-workers-should-not-get-back-pay/2146575\">if they're not working, they shouldn't get paid</a>\", regarding those federal workers he helped put out of work. Yoho wasn't just spouting off; he was at a town hall meeting responding to a caller from his home district who complained about the federal workers \"at home watching Netflix or whatever\", as if being furloughed had been their choice. </p><p>In the end, even Congressman Yoho went along with the rest of the House, which <a href=\"mailto:http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/05/20822136-house-unanimously-approves-back-pay-for-800000-furloughed-federal-workers?lite\">unanimously voted </a>to provide back pay to furloughed workers whenever the shutdown ends. But the promise of a check at some uncertain, future date doesn't cover rent, groceries or electricity bills now for the 800,000 workers affected, many of whom <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/20/living-paycheck-to-paycheck_n_1899685.html\">live paycheck to paycheck</a>. Federal workers have reported <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/yoho-furloughed-workers-should-not-get-back-pay/2146575\">taking out loans</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101087804\">selling possessions on eBay</a>, and getting second jobs (the Department of Energy helpfully posted <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/11/energy-department-shutdown_n_4085959.html\">guidelines </a>for moonlighting: bartending is OK, lobbying for energy companies is not). In a member survey by the National Treasury Employees Union, <a href=\"http://www.nteu.org/Documents/ShutdownEffectsSurvey.pdf\">84% reported cutting back </a> (pdf) on necessities, and nearly half have delayed medical treatment to save money.</p><p>Elizabeth Lytle, a furloughed administrative program assistant with the Environmental Protection Agency in Illinois and retired navy reservist, says: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The shutdown has put tremendous financial stress on my family. There's no money coming in. In September my husband was laid off, and I was furloughed the first of October. And if the VA doesn't get any money, I won't get my disability check at the end of the month.</p></blockquote><p>As for back pay, \"I'll believe it when I see it.\" Lytle notes that as a result of the EPA shutdown, cleanup at a nearby <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/region5/cleanup/outboardmarine/index.htm\">superfund site in Waukegan</a> (the former location of a large outboard-boat-motor manufacturing plant and a former railroad tie, coal gasification, and coke plant facility) has stopped.</p><p>Yet it's not just a matter of a handful of stubborn legislators. Politicians like Yoho reflect a nasty political current within a part of the American electorate: that civil servants like Lytle are not real workers, that they don't matter, that their livelihoods are expendable for the sake of some broader ideological agenda.</p><p>It's reflected by conservative radio host Laura Ingraham gloating \"Starve the beast!\" in response to furloughs at the IRS, by <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/crowd-heckles-cops-at-white-house-brown-shirts-looks-like-something-out-of-kenya/\">Tea Party protesters heckling </a>White House police with calls of \"brownshirts\" and \"Stasi\". </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Starve the beast! \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico\">@politico</a>: Furloughs to shut down IRS for a day: <a href=\"http://t.co/eKANDoRnpN\">http://t.co/eKANDoRnpN</a>\"</p><p>&mdash; Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/statuses/334743671817773057\">May 15, 2013</a></p></blockquote><p>It could be seen during the last round of furloughs resulting from sequestration (for which workers did not receive back pay), when Fox News' Neil Cavuto wondered out loud if this isn't a good thing: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Maybe we have too many federal workers in the first place period, if there's any place to cut it's got to be there.</p></blockquote><p>Civil servants make a handy punching bag. They're to blame for deficits, although total expenditures on federal employees (both civilian and military) make up <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2013/10/03/we-are-shutting-down-only-thirteen-percent-of-the-government-at-most/\">about 13%</a> of the federal budget far less than Social Security or Medicare, and, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/07/29/wrestling_with_the_federal_budget/\">according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew</a>, firing every single federal worker in the country would only shrink the deficit by a third. It's an easy sell to balance budgets on the backs of civil servants: the last budget crisis resulted in federal workers being denied cost-of-living raises for the third straight year, along with agency budget cuts and layoffs. In their competing budget proposals, both <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/10/obama-budget-pensions_n_3054071.html\">President Obama </a>and <a href=\"http://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2013/03/gop-budget-calls-smaller-federal-workforce-less-generous-benefits/61813/\">Paul Ryan</a> agreed to cutting federal employee retirement benefits; the only question is by how much.</p><p>Anti-government hysteria has fueled everything from <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/09/16/fox-news-krauthammer-cruz-leading-republican-suicide-caucus-by-opposing-obamacare/\">congressional kamikaze attacks</a> on Obamacare to<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Austin_suicide_attack\"> actual kamikaze attacks</a> on federal buildings, and those who get hurt are inevitably people doing their jobs. </p><p>Bureaucracies are easy to despise when they make us wait at the Department if Motor Vehicles and take for granted when they fix the roads, but no society of laws<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/04/government-shutdown-affects-you\"> can function without one</a>. Now that veterans' and Social Security claims are going unprocessed, food is not being inspected, parks are closed, and Head Start programs are not staffed, maybe the anti-government caucus will change its tune. But don't count on a<a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/10/theres-major-salmonella-outbreak-during-government-shutdown/70286/\"> salmonella outbreak</a> or two changing much.

        "body":"<p>The government shutdown has so far cost the US economy $24bn &ndash; or $1.5bn a day, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s said on Wednesday.</p> <p>The argument over the government shutdown, now in its 16th day, and over raising the US&rsquo;s debt ceiling, appeared to have come to a short-term resolution Wednesday as Congress rolled out a plan to fund federal agencies and extend America's borrowing authority into early next year.</p> <p>The news of the deal boosted stock markets. S&amp;P warned, however, that the political impasse had shaved at least 0.6% off US GDP on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter of 2013. The cut is equivalent to taking $24bn out of the economy.</p> <p>S&amp;P triggered selloffs on stock markets around the world in 2011 when it downgraded US debt during the previous row over raising the debt ceiling. This week rival Fitch warned that it, too, had turned negative on US credit and was considering a downgrade.</p> <p>S&amp;P said it expected the Congress would pass the Senate resolution to fund the federal government and raise the debt ceiling.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, the current chatter coming out of Washington suggests that any continuing resolution will be a temporary one, with an early 2014 timeframe for the next set of Washington deadlines. The short turnaround for politicians to negotiate some sort of lasting deal will likely weigh on consumer confidence, especially among government workers that were furloughed,&rdquo; the agency said.</p> <p>&ldquo;If people are afraid that the government policy brinkmanship will resurface again, and with it the risk of another shutdown or worse, they'll remain afraid to open up their checkbooks. That points to another humbug holiday season,&rdquo; the agency said. &ldquo;The bottom line is the government shutdown has hurt the US economy.&rdquo;</p> <p>US markets rebounded on news of a deal in Washington. The Dow closed up 205 points (1.36%), the S&amp;P 500 rose 23.45 points (1.38%) and the Nasdaq 45.42 points (1.2%). Markets had fallen Tuesday when it appeared that a deal was out of reach.</p> <p>In a note to investors Paul Ashworth, the chief US economist at Capital Economics, wrote: &ldquo;Financial markets have been buoyed by media reports indicating that both the Senate and the House are preparing to vote imminently on a bill to reopen the federal government and raise the debt ceiling.</p> <p>\"Once the initial euphoria has worn off, however, we suspect that investors will begin to focus on the short-term nature of the deal, which means that another shutdown is possible early in the New Year.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420191944|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|08cf96bb070c7378e5d94d6432db780cd1c7aa2a -->",

It then passed the US House of Represenatives by 285 votes to 144, with a majority of Democrats bolstered by a minority of Republicans.</p><p>In brief remarks at the White House, shortly before the House was due to vote, president Barack Obama said he hoped the deal would \"lift the cloud of uncertainty\" that has hung over the country in recent weeks. </p><p>\"Once this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately,\" he said, saying he hoped the next round of spending negotiations between the parties would be more successful.</p><p>\"Hopefully next time it won't be in the eleventh hour. We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.\"</p><p>Earlier in the day, House Republican leaders conceded defeat in their two-week battle to derail Obama's healthcare reforms on Wednesday, and said they would not block the deal, despite winning virtually no concessions.</p><p>With just hours to go until the start of the deadline set by the US Treasury for extending the debt limit, House speaker John Boehner signalled he was ready to accept a Senate-drafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to conservatives who had driven the country the precipice of a new financial crisis.</p><p>The Republican capitulation was swift and dramatic. \"We fought the good fight, but we just didn't win,\" Boehner told a local TV station in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio.</p><p>Moderate Republicans, bitter at the wounds inflicted on the party by a fight that ended in an almost complete failure to achieve any of the concessions they had sought, lashed out at their conservative colleagues.</p><p>The standoff ended just after midday when Harry Reid, the majority leader, announced the deal on the the floor of the Senate. Calling for all sides to work together, he said: \"Now is not the time for pointing the fingers of blame. Now is the time for reconciliation.\"</p><p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, acknowledged the fight was over. \"This has been a long, challenging few weeks,\" McConnell said. \"This is far less than many of us had hoped for, but it is far better than some had sought.\"</p><p>The deal, crafted by Reid and McConnell, will fund the government until 15 January and lift the debt ceiling until 7 February. It will force both sides into a formal budget conference in an attempt to reach a longer-term deal by 13 December.</p><p>The only apparent change to the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans had targeted when they precipitated the government shutdown, involves asking the Obama administration to carry out better checks on the incomes of people registering for insurance exchanges.</p><p>A senior Republican aide told the Guardian that Boehner had agreed to allow the House to vote on the deal, which in practice means it would pass with support from Democrats and moderate Republicans. The vote was due to take place on Wednesday evening.</p><p>At 3pm, Boehner hosted a short meeting with Republicans in the House. Sources inside said he effectively told his colleagues they had lost the fight, before he was given a tepid applause.</p><p>Several congressman leaving the meeting conceded that hardline Republican tactics, which forced a two-week government shutdown and took the government to the brink of an economic crisis, had left them empty-handed.</p><p>The White House welcomed the Senate deal but cautioned that the battle would not be finally over until House lawmakers voted in favour of it. \"The president applauds leader Reid and minority leader McConnell for working together to forge this compromise and encourages the Congress to act swiftly to end this shutdown and protect the full faith and credit of the United States of America,\" said Obama's chief spokesman, Jay Carney.</p><p>The White House also hinted that Obama may use the defeat of conservatives in Congress as a way to push ahead with other administration priorities such as immigration reform, that were previously blocked from coming to the floor of the House of Representatives.</p><p>\"The president believes that one of the consequences of these manufactured crises is that time is taken away from the pursuit of other goals that we have as a nation,\" added Carney. \"That includes ... the project of bringing about legislation that he can sign that comprehensively reforms our immigration system.\"</p><p>Recriminations among Republicans flew thick and fast, with moderates accusing House conservatives of trashing the party's reputation in pursuit of an impossible ambition to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said this had \"been the best two weeks for the Democratic party in recent times\".</p><p>\"When we evaluate the last couple of weeks, it should be entitled the time of great lost opportunity. If we had been focused on the rollout of Obamacare and its confusion, public support would have diminished. Instead, our numbers have gone down, Obamacare has mysteriously gone up, and other than that, this has been great.\"</p><p>Graham was scathing about the influence of conservative advocacy groups such as Heritage Action, which torpedoed a deal on Tuesday when it threatened to withdraw support from Republicans who backed it. He also warned of the damage that the party had inflicted on itself: \"The way we are behaving and the path we have taken the last couple of weeks leads to a marginalised party in the eyes of the American people,\" he said.</p><p>Ted Cruz, the first-term Republican senator from Texas who had led the rebellion against Obamacare with a marathon 21-hour speech last month, was unrepentant but said he would not stand in the way of the Senate vote even though he opposes the deal.</p><p>Underscoring the fault lines in the Republican party, he blamed fellow senators for failing to go along with his strategy. \"Unfortunately the Senate chose not to follow the House and in particular we saw real division among Senate Republicans. Had Senate Republicans united and supported House Republicans the outcome of this would have been very, very different,\" Cruz said.</p><p>Shortly before the Senate vote, Cruz took to the floor to urge his colleagues to vote against it. \"This is a terrible deal,\" he said. \"It embodies everything about the Washington establishment that frustrates the American people.\"</p><p>It was the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans. None of their stated goals were achieved, and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis. By refusing to blink, Democrats pushed Republicans to show that they would not let the US default on its debts, making it hard for the GOP to repeat its tactic.</p><p>Charles Boustany, a Louisiana Republican Charles Boustany, said the Tea Party-backed members of the House of Representatives had put the GOP's position at risk. \"This could trigger a wave of discontent that could wash out our Republican majority in the House if we're not careful – it's getting to that level,\" Boustany told the National Journal.</p><p>However, conservatives were equally robust in return. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, admitted his side had emerged with \"a goose egg\". \"We got nothing,\" he said.</p><p>Asked if his party had been damaged in any way over the last two weeks, he replied: \"No, I don't think so.

        "body":"<p>The US Congress passed legislation to rescue the country from the brink of a looming debt default on Wednesday night, bringing an end to the two-week crisis that has closed large portions of the government, revealed deep divisions in the Republican party and threatened a global financial crisis.</p> <p>A temporary fix that will last only through to the start of 2014, the bill passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement just hours earlier.</p> <p>But it was able to pass the Republican-dominated House shortly after 10pm only with the support of Democrats. It laid bare a rupture between moderate and more rightwing Republicans, who triggered the crisis by using their budgetary leverage in what turned out to be a futile effort to undermine Obama's signature healthcare reforms.</p> <p>Only 87 House Republicans voted for the bill. The party leadership was opposed by 144 members, including Paul Ryan, the former vice-presidential candidate and a key figure in Congress.</p> <p>President Barack Obama signed the spending measure into law at about 12.30 am ET on Thursday.&nbsp;In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would &quot;lift the cloud of uncertainty&quot; that had hung over the country in recent weeks.</p> <p>&quot;Once this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately,&quot; he said in a statement delivered at the White House. &quot;Hopefully next time it won't be in the 11th hour. We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.&quot;</p> <p>Minutes after the bill was passed, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said government employees &quot;should expect to return to work in the morning&quot;.</p> <p>On both sides of the Capitol building Republican lawmakers looked deflated after the votes, which capped a dramatic capitulation after weeks of brinkmanship with Democrats who refused to blink.</p> <p>When it came, the Republican surrender was swift. With just hours to go until the deadline set by the US Treasury for extending the debt limit, House Speaker John Boehner signalled he was ready to accept a Senate-drafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to the conservatives who had driven the country the precipice of a new financial crisis.</p> <p>&quot;We fought the good fight, but we just didn't win,&quot; Boehner told a local TV station in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio.</p> <p>The standoff ended just after midday when Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, announced the deal on the the floor of the Senate. Calling for all sides to work together, he said: &quot;Now is not the time for pointing the fingers of blame. Now is the time for reconciliation.&quot;</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, acknowledged the fight was over. &quot;This has been a long, challenging few weeks,&quot; McConnell said. &quot;This is far less than many of us had hoped for, but it is far better than some had sought.&quot;</p> <p>The deal, crafted by Reid and McConnell, will fund the government until 15 January and lift the debt ceiling until 7 February, setting the stage for a possible repeat of the showdown. Both sides also agreed to a formal budget conference in an attempt to reach a longer-term deal by 13 December.</p> <p>The only change to the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans had targeted when they precipitated the government shutdown, requires the Obama administration to carry out better checks on the incomes of people registering for insurance exchanges.</p> <p>The bill also ensures the 800,000 federal workers who were furloughed for at least part of the shutdown will receive back pay.</p> <p>By 3pm, Boehner hosted a short meeting with forlorn-looking Republicans in the House. Sources inside the meeting said he told his colleagues they had lost the fight, and was then given a tepid applause.</p> <p>Several conservative members leaving the meeting conceded that the hardline Republican tactics had left them empty-handed. &quot;We got nothing,&quot; said&nbsp;Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, who admitted his side had emerged with &quot;a goose egg&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet for the most part they rallied behind Boehner, who had sought to appease the restive conservative element until it was no longer feasible to do so.</p> <p>Recriminations among Republicans flew thick and fast, with moderates accusing House conservatives of trashing the party's reputation in pursuit of an impossible ambition to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.</p> <p>Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said the Democractic party had experienced the &quot;best two weeks&quot; in recent history. &quot;When we evaluate the last couple of weeks, it should be entitled the time of great lost opportunity,&quot; he said. &quot;If we had been focused on the rollout of Obamacare and its confusion, public support would have diminished. Instead, our numbers have gone down, Obamacare has mysteriously gone up, and other than that, this has been great.&quot;</p> <p>Graham was scathing about the influence of conservative advocacy groups such as Heritage Action, which torpedoed a deal on Tuesday when it threatened to withdraw support from Republicans who backed it. He also warned of the damage that the party had inflicted on itself.</p> <p>&quot;The way we are behaving and the path we have taken the last couple of weeks leads to a marginalised party in the eyes of the American people,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Ted Cruz, the first-term Republican senator from Texas who had led the rebellion against Obamacare with a marathon 21-hour speech last month, was unrepentant. The Tea Party-backed senator was one of 18 Republicans who rebelled against their leadership to vote against the bill in the Senate.</p> <p>Shortly before the Senate vote, Cruz took to the floor to urge his colleagues to vote against it. &quot;This is a terrible deal,&quot; he said. &quot;It embodies everything about the Washington establishment that frustrates the American people.&quot;</p> <p>However he did not attempt any tactics to delay or stall the vote.</p> <p>Underscoring the fault lines in the Republican party, Cruz blamed fellow senators for failing to go along with his strategy. &quot;Unfortunately the Senate chose not to follow the House and in particular we saw real division among Senate Republicans. Had Senate Republicans united and supported House Republicans the outcome of this would have been very, very different,&quot; he said.</p> <p>It was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans. None of their stated goals were achieved, and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis. By refusing to blink, Democrats pushed Republicans to show that they would not let the US default on its debts, making it hard for the GOP to repeat its tactic.</p> <p>A Louisiana Republican, Charles Boustany, said the Tea Party-backed members of the House of Representatives had put the GOP's position at risk. &quot;This could trigger a wave of discontent that could wash out our Republican majority in the House if we're not careful – it's getting to that level,&quot; he told the National Journal.</p> <p>Tim Huelskamp, a member of Tea Party congressional caucus, told the Guardian the divisive vote in the House would help identify the moderates in his party which he said had “given up the fight”.</p> <p>“People back at home realise not all Republicans are conservatives,” he said. “And some Republicans are anti-conservative.”</p> <p>Senator Mike Lee, a Republican ally of Cruz, struck a defiant tone on the floor, perhaps indicating more trouble ahead “The media keeps asking: was it worth it? My answer is it is always worth it to do the right thing,” he said, adding: “This is not over.”</p> <p>That view was not shared at the White House.

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13406.htm\" title=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13406.htm\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a> has appealed to Washington to sort out its finances after the US pulled back from the brink of a debt default and hundreds of thousands of federal employees prepared to return to work after a 16-day government shutdown.</p><p>As the US president, Barack Obama, warned: \"We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis,\" the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, appealed for more stability.</p><p>\"It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner,\" she said.</p><p>\"We also continue to encourage the US to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phased-in measures that would not harm the recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan.\"</p><p>A Senate-drafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to the conservatives who had driven the country to the precipice of a new financial crisis was passed by the Republican-dominated House of Representatives just hours before a deadline to extend the US debt limit was to pass.</p><p>The World Bank too expressed its relief that the global economy had \"dodged a potential catastrophe\", with its president, Jim Yong Kim, urging policymakers in all countries to \"continue to focus on crafting and implementing policies that promote economic growth and boost jobs and opportunity for all\".</p><p>Stock markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea initially reflected relief after the Republicans finally capitulated in their failed attempt to undermine Obama's healthcare reforms. But in Asia and Europe stock markets overall displayed a muted reaction with traders apparently expecting another battle in Washington early in 2014.</p><p>The shutdown is estimated to <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/16/government-shutdown-has-cost-us-economy-15bn-a-day-sp-says\" title=\"\">have cost the US $24bn – £1.5bn a day – according to the ratings agency Standard and Poor</a>. China's official Xinhua news agency had accused Washington of jeopardising other countries' dollar assets. China is the US government's largest creditor.</p><p>Obama signed the necessary legislation to fend off a default shortly after midnight on Thursday after a Republican split in the House of Representatives. The bill had passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement. It offers a temporary fix, funding the government until 15 January and raising the debt ceiling until 7 February.</p><p>But the president made clear he did not expect another bitter budget fight and shutdown next year.</p><p>In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would \"lift the cloud of uncertainty\" that had hung over the country in recent weeks.</p><p>\"Once this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately,\" he said, in a statement delivered at the White House. \"Hopefully next time it won't be in the 11th hour. We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.\"</p><p>As he left the lectern after his Wednesday night press briefing, the president was asked by a journalist whether the crisis would happen all over again in a few months. Speaking over his shoulder, Obama replied: \"No.\"</p><p>Earlier, the Republican senator Mike Lee had struck a defiant tone, perhaps indicating more trouble ahead: \"The media keeps asking: 'Was it worth it?' My answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing,\" he said, adding: \"This is not over.\"</p><p>However, the political deal on Wednesday was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans. None of their stated goals were achieved and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420229420|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|f80e573852a0d222ca82834f86ec2ff1b3cfcea0 -->",
