        "headline":"Perpetual motion leaves Invesco investors looking for next big thing",
        "body":"<p>Neil Woodford is that rare beast in the City jungle: an investor who has consistently overperformed over the long term. This week he stunned financial advisers and his devoted army of small investors when he revealed he will quit <a href=\"http://www.invescoperpetual.co.uk/portal/site/ip/home/\" title=\"Invesco Perpetual website\">Invesco Perpetual</a>, where he looks after an astonishing £33bn of their money.</p><p>Woodford joined Invesco Perpetual 25 years ago, and investors who put their cash into his funds early on have made huge returns. Someone investing £1,000 in October 1990 in Invesco Perpetual High Income would have seen it grow to £23,265 by the end of September 2013, compared to £9,714 if they had left the money tracking the FTSE All-Share index.</p><p>But much of Woodford's success has occurred over the past 15 years, in part because he refused to be drawn into the internet stock bubble of 1999-2000, and because he bought tobacco companies at a time when most other investors thought they were doomed.</p><p>Woodford has skilfully satisified both growth investors looking for a fund as a nest egg for the future, and the income-hungry investor fed up with 2% returns on cash Isas, who has enjoyed dividends worth 3%-4% a year plus capital growth.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420252885'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382011260637/Invesco-returns-graph-001.jpg' alt='Invesco returns graph' width='460' height='274' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graphic: Hargreaves Lansdown</figcaption></figure><p>Brian Dennehy of advisers Dennehy Weller says: \"Woodford's success over the past 15 years has to a large extent been based on one huge bet – one we have called the biggest and longest bet in fund management history: a consistently large overweight in defensives, and in particular utilities, tobacco, and pharmaceuticals. Would any other manager have had the foresight to begin this strategy, and the fortitude to continue with it over such a prolonged period? I don't think so.\"</p><p>But the size of the Woodford funds has become a worry for some advisers, who fear that giant ones can do little more than replicate the FTSE index. Around £500m has come out of the Woodford funds over the past year, Dennehy says. \"This suggests that some time ago the retail funds market became saturated with the Woodford funds. The risk for Invesco Perpetual now is that a significant leak could turn into a flood.\"</p><p>Others point out that aura around Woodford has blinded some advisers to the other income funds that have matched or beaten his performance in recent years. Gary Potter, who spends his time analysing investment managers for his Navigator fund-of-funds business, says: \"We have not owned any Woodford funds for a number of years. Yes, he is a tremendous fund manager with a tremendous track  record, and he's the best of anyone who has managed a large amount of assets and still been able to outperform.</p><p>\"But however good a ship's captain is, the bigger the boat you put him in charge of, the harder it is to navigate. Clive Beagles at JO UK Hambro Equity Income has outperformed Woodford over the past five years, making a 128% gain for investors compared to 71% in the Invesco Perpetual funds.\"</p><p>Over the next few months, small investors will be assailed by fund management groups wanting to attract them away from Invesco Perpetual. Guardian Money asked advisers what they are recommending to clients.</p><h2><strong>Which funds are affected?</strong></h2><p>A wide variety of funds that invest in UK shares for an income, mostly under the Invesco Perpetual name, but also some under the St James Place name. Many savers will be invested in Woodford funds through their pension schemes, with Prudential, Standard Life, Aviva and Legal &amp; General all offering his income funds under their investment ranges.</p><p>Woodford directly manages Invesco Perpetual High Income (with £14bn under management); Invesco Perpetual Income (£10.5bn); Invesco Perpetual UK Equity Pension (£500m); and the Edinburgh Investment Trust (£1.3bn). He also manages the equity components of Invesco Perpetual Monthly Income Plus (£3.8bn) and Invesco Perpetual Distribution (£2.6bn).</p><h2><strong>Where is he going?</strong></h2><p>Woodford leaves Invesco Perpetual in April 2014, and in a statement said he would be opening his own investment management company.</p><p>\"My decision to leave is a personal one based on my views about where I see long-term opportunities in the fund management industry. My intention is to establish a new fund management business serving institutional and retail clients as soon as possible after 29 April 2014.\" He says he won't make any other announcements about the new business until after he has left.</p><h2><strong>Why is he going?</strong></h2><p>The unconfirmed speculation is that Woodford will be happier running smaller funds again, where, according to Alan Miller of SCM Private (and better known as one of the key figures behind New Star Asset Management), he will be able to buy his favourite small companies. \"Whatever his stake or incentive was in Invesco, he will almost certainly be much better off holding the majority of 'Woodford asset management',\" Miller adds.</p><h2><strong>Should investors stick with Invesco?</strong></h2><p>Mark Barnett, who has been at Invesco for 17 years, will take over the management of Woodford's funds. Barnett has actually beaten Woodford's performance since he took over management of the Invesco Perpetual UK Strategic Income fund, says Adrian Lowcock of Hargreaves Lansdown, returning 49.9% since January 2006 compared to Woodford's return of 35.3%. But Barnett's fund is substantially smaller at £285m, compared to the billions run by Woodford, and he has invested less in healthcare and has a larger exposure to financials. At Bestinvest, Jason Hollands says: \"[Barnett] has a lot of similar shareholdings to Woodford and is a safe pair of hands.\"</p><p>But others wonder how Barnett will progress post-Woodford. \"His top 10 holdings do appear to reflect 'the hand of Woodford'. What happens without that guiding hand? It is a huge unknown for investors,\" Dennehy says.</p><h2><strong>What are the alternatives?</strong></h2><p>There are plenty. The two giant equity income funds Potter rates are <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=8AI&amp;univ=U\" title=\"Artemis fund\">Artemis Income</a>, managed by Adrian Frost, and Beagles' <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=JOF98&amp;univ=U\" title=\"JO Hambro fund\">JO Hambro fund</a>. But with the Artemis fund nearly £6bn in size, and the JO Hambro fund more than £2bn, they may both arguably suffer the same size problems as Woodford.</p><p>Smaller funds that have enjoyed strong performance and are tipped by Potter include <a href=\"http://www.chelvertonam.com/home/chelverton-uk-equity-income-fund-oeic.php\" title=\"Chelverton UK Equity Income fund\">Chelverton UK Equity Income</a>, which he says \"has been the absolutely number one performer this year, yet it still only has £140m under management.\" He also likes <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=K4F41&amp;univ=U\" title=\"Standard Life UK Equity Income fund\">Standard Life UK Equity Income Unconstrained</a>, <a href=\"http://www.riverandmercantile.com/investment_divisions/uk_equity_division/r_m_uk_income_fund\" title=\"River  Mercantile UK Equity Income fund\">River &amp; Mercantile UK Equity Income</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ardevora.com/index.php/ardevora/products\" title=\"Ardevora UK Income fund\">Ardevora UK Income</a> and <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=KRF58&amp;univ=U\" title=\"Cazenove UK Equity Income fund\">Cazenove UK Equity Income</a>.</p><p>Lowcock also tips Artemis Income, as well as <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=BEINC&amp;univ=U\" title=\"Rathbone Income fund\">Rathbone Income</a>, while at Bestinvest Hollands also likes Artemis Income, as well as <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=ESHII&amp;univ=U\" title=\"Threadneedle UK Equity Income fund\">Threadneedle UK Equity Income</a>, <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=FIMXIE&amp;univ=U\" title=\"Fidelity Moneybuilder Dividend fund\">Fidelity Moneybuilder Dividend</a> and <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=UFF54&amp;univ=U\" title=\"Unicorn UK Income fund\">Unicorn UK Income</a>.</p><p>Investors more keen on growth rather than income should consider <a href=\"http://www.mandg.co.uk/investor/funds/recovery-fund/gb0031289100/overview.aspx\" title=\"MG Recovery fund\">M&amp;G Recovery</a> or <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=SZUKMI&amp;univ=U\" title=\"Schroder UK Mid 250 fund\">Schroder UK Mid 250</a>, Dennehy says. \"For a fund with momentum in its favour right now, opt for <a href=\"http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=S6F73&amp;univ=U\" title=\"Standard Life UK Opportunities fund\">Standard Life UK Opportunities</a>.\"</p><h2><strong>Should I wait and see what Woodford's new offering is?</strong></h2><p>Probably. As Lowcock says: \"We do not believe investors should rush to a decision – in our view Woodford is an exceptional manager and will continue to work hard at achieving strong performance for investors until he departs.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420248293|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|ed5126aa85ef493087efbcc283b221fa7b460c6f -->",

        "headline":"Labour vows to impose new tax on payday lenders",
        "body":"<p>Labour would impose a levy on the profits of payday lenders that would be used to double the amount of public funding for low-cost alternatives, such as credit unions.</p><p>The levy is intended to raise an additional £13m from the much reviled payday loans industry, and will be seen as another attempt by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, to take the side of the consumer against \"profiteering capitalism\".</p><p>Miliband will also confirm that Labour would impose a cap on the cost of credit and give councils the power to stop the spread of payday lending shops in town centres.</p><p>He will announce the next steps in his cost of living campaign as he also reveals Stella Creasy, the new shadow minister for competition and consumer affairs, will lead Labour's campaign against legal loan sharks.</p><p>It comes on the day that the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, urges Anglicans to help the formation of credit unions in their localities as a way of beating back the payday lenders.</p><p>Creasy has been campaigning energetically on the issue for more than two years, and has played a part in forcing the Office of Fair Trading to demand reforms from the industry. Her transfer from shadow home affairs team to the shadow business team gives her formal party responsibility for the issue for the first time.</p><p>Miliband will say the levy will be in addition to the levies the payday industry is due in April to hand to the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to help fund services such as debt advice.</p><p>He will claim the payday loans industry is making very high profits, and this levy need not lead to an increase in the cost of loans.</p><p>Labour says it will consult on the level of rate of the proposed cap on the cost of credit and details of its addition to the levy, but the intention is to double the income due to be received from existing levies, bringing £26m in total from the industry.</p><p>David Cameron said he was open to the idea of a cap on payday lenders at prime minister's questions on Wednesday, saying: \"We continue to look at the issue of a cap and I don't think we should rule that out.\"</p><p>But he added: \"We do have to bear in mind what has been found out in other countries and through our own searches about whether a cap would prove effective.\"</p><p>Earlier in the year the coalition allowed amendments to give powers for the FCA to introduce a cap.</p><p>But Labour claims the FCA is reluctant to use these powers, and the party has criticised the government for not doing more to speed up the decision.</p><p>Miliband has also promised to change planning law to make it easier for councils to prevent payday lenders filling a high street where banks close. Labour suggests that councils should be given powers to assert that a change from a bank to payday lender represents a change of planning use and can therefore be blocked by the council.</p><p>Miliband is on Thursday expected to say: \"The market in payday lending has doubled in just four years. Almost a third of payday loans taken out in Britain at the moment are to cover the cost of people's gas and electricity bills. For too many people the end of the month is their own personal credit crunch.</p><p>\"It is right that companies that benefit from people's financial plight accept their responsibilities.\"</p><p>Creasey will say: \"Across the country Sharkstoppers and Debtbusters campaigners are working to address the damage payday lending debt is doing to the finances of millions of families.</p><p>\"Whether helping to increase the capital that credit unions have to enable them to lend more, kicking these companies out of football grounds and shopping centres or supporting debt advice to those caught in the spiral of debt by the practices of these firms these are the people that are dealing firsthand with this government's failure to learn from other countries in capping the cost of credit.\"</p><p>Welby said the aim was to double the number of credit unions over five years, adding the church could do more to help the formation of credit unions themselves, including through the formation of a Church Mutual Credit Union.</p><p>In a message on Thursday he writes: \"Our faith in Christ calls us to love the poor and vulnerable with our actions. That is why churches must be actively involved in supporting the development of real lending alternatives such as credit unions. That is not an optional activity, but a fundamental part of our witness and service to God's people.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420227569|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|e1f3e75605e244ad3134d0857264185d763499bb -->",

        "body":"<p>A Labour government would impose a new tax on payday lenders to fund a multimillion-pound increase in public support for low-cost alternatives, such as credit unions, Ed Miliband announced on Wednesday.</p> <p>Details of the rates at which the levy would be imposed on the profits of companies such as Wonga have not yet been announced, but Labour said it aimed to raise enough cash to double the &pound;13m currently provided by the government each year to fund the expansion of credit unions.</p> <p>Payday lenders, which offer short-term loans to tide over customers who run out of money while waiting for their monthly pay cheque, have been widely criticised for charging vulnerable individuals sky-high interest rates which can top 5,000% a year.</p> <p>Companies will have to pay an existing levy when they start being regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority next year, but Labour is proposing an additional charge on top of this to boost the credit union market, in which loans are available at much lower rates to households unable to access the mainstream credit market.</p> <p>The party has already proposed a cap on the cost of credit, which was included in the bill establishing the authority, but has not yet been implemented.</p> <p>Prime minister David Cameron told the House of Commons on Wednesday he had not ruled out a cap, saying: \"We must bear in mind what has been established in other countries, and by our own research, about whether a cap would prove effective. It is absolutely right for us to regulate this area properly.\"</p> <p>Labour says families across Britain are facing the most sustained cost-of-living crisis since 1870, due to inflation outstripping stagnating wages. Miliband said this was creating a \"personal debt crisis\" for many households.</p> <p>On Thursday the Labour leader is due to visit a south London credit union, where he is expected to say: \"The prices families have to pay keep on rising faster and faster than the wages they are paid.</p> <p>\"And, as a result, the market in payday lending has doubled in just four years. Almost a third of the payday loans taken out in Britain at the moment are to cover the cost of people's gas and electricity bills.</p> <p>\"For too many families the end of the month is now their own personal credit crunch.</p> <p>\"A One Nation Labour government would deal with the causes of the cost of living crisis. But it would also act to help prevent people falling into unpayable debt with radical reform of the payday lending market.</p> <p>\"We would cap the cost of credit, halt the spread of payday lenders on our high streets and force them to fund the credit unions that can offer a real alternative for people in desperate need.</p> <p>\"We must protect the most vulnerable people in our society from the worst of exploitation by payday lenders. And it is right that the companies that benefit from people's financial plight accept their responsibilities to help ensure affordable credit is available.\" </p> <p>Labour's competition and consumer affairs spokeswoman, Stella Creasy, has been given special responsibility to lead a campaign against abuses by legal loan sharks, Miliband said.</p> <p>The Walthamstow MP, who has been a prominent campaigner against excessive interest rates, said: \"Across the country Sharkstoppers and Debtbusters campaigners are working to address the damage payday lending debt is doing to the finances of millions of families who are struggling to make ends meet.</p> <p>\"Whether helping to increase the capital credit unions have to enable them to lend more, kicking these companies out of their football grounds and shopping centres, or supporting debt advice to those caught in a spiral of debt by the practices of these firms, these are the people dealing first-hand with this government's failure to learn from other countries in capping the cost of credit.</p> <p>\"We are determined to see a cap introduced in the UK so that we can see an end to this legal loan sharking and give British consumers the protection they deserve.\"</p> <p>The payday lending market has more than doubled in size since 2008-09 to &pound;2.2bn, and up to 5 million families are believed to be planning to borrow money from this source in the next six months, Labour said.</p> <p>More than 1.5m households were believed to be spending more than 30% of their income on unsecured credit repayments, the party said.</p> <p>Non-profit credit unions limit interest to 26% a year, but lack the capacity to make significant inroads into the market.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420201718|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|49f15056511a3860d5c85c288f360f5a8ee849f8 -->",

        "body":"<p>September saw the biggest cuts to savings rates in recent memory, with returns on more than 240 accounts lowered during the month, according to savings analysts.</p><p>Nationwide and Sainsbury's were among the account providers slashing rates, with some customers seeing interest cut by 1%. However, in a glimmer of hope for savers experts are also reporting the first rate increases to the fixed-rate savings bond market in many months.</p><p>Since the government introduced the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/funding-for-lending\" title=\"\">Funding for Lending</a> programme in the summer of 2012, Britain's savers have endured a torrid time with many watching as their savings income has been halved. The latest round of cuts in September are possibly a result of the Bank of England's recent confirmation that base rates will remain at current levels for some time.</p><p>Anna Bowes, a founder of the <a href=\"https://www.savingschampion.co.uk/\" title=\"\">SavingsChampion.co.uk</a> website that tracks rates paid by banks and building societies, said: \"September was a terrible month for existing savers with 241 rate cuts across the market.</p><p>\"At the same time, though, several firms started vying to be at the top of the fixed-rate savings bonds tables. As a result, rates for those willing to tie their money up for a set period have started to look a little better. It's long overdue and good to see that there is finally some light at the end of the tunnel. British savers have endured a terrible year.\"</p><p>Last month, Bowes says, Nationwide lowered the interest rate paid on its Loyalty Saver Issue 1 by 0.5% to 2.1%; Sainsbury's halved its Cash Isa rate from 2% to 1%; while NS&amp;I Income Bonds rate dropped by 0.5% to 1.25%. The Newcastle building society cuts its Loyalty Access Isa (Issue 2) by 0.75% to 1.5%.</p><p>So far in October, Sainsbury's has cut its Easy Saver by 0.7% to 1%, while the rates paid by Derbyshire, Cheshire and Dunfermline Platinum Notice accounts have all been halved to 1.25%.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, over the past six weeks, fixed-rate savings products have been creeping up. Bowes says those prepared to lock away at least £1,000 for five years will now get 3.15% at the West Bromwich building society. Birmingham Midshires has the top paying one-year bond – 2% – while Close Brothers is paying 2.3% for two years on balances in excess of £10,000. Aldermore pays 2.6% to those putting at least £1,000 in its three-year bond.</p><p>Despite the rise in fixed-rate savings, those looking for instant access are still suffering low rates. SavingsChampion says the average of the easy access, best-buy accounts remains stuck around 1.5% – half the 3.2% savers were getting on average in August 2012.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Moneyfacts said rates on fixed-term deals were slowly rising again. \"As the mortgage market has seen a resurgence with the recent launch of the government's Help to Buy scheme, banks are now looking for extra funds, by increasing long-term fixed rate deals,\" she said.</p><p>\"Longer term fixed rates and Isas have seen a resurgence – these offer the highest rates in the market and therefore grab attention of savers looking to make the most of their money. Because the market is still volatile, customers would be wise to spread their savings across short-term fix and easy access, as they then have the choice of moving some of their investment quickly with market movements.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420169258|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|c5e4cdca6c62a226b3c28368448f37aa35d392d5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Some good news at last for consumers hit by rising prices pretty much everywhere else: car insurance premiums are apparently plummeting. The average cost of an annual comprehensive policy has fallen almost 24% – or £206 – over the last two-and-a-half years to £652, according to according a report by Confused.com, the price comparison website, and Towers Watson, a consultant.</p><p></p><p>Premiums have dropped by 3.9%, or £26, in the past three months alone, the report found, and are expected to keep falling. This is thanks partly to an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/21/women-car-insurance-eu\" title=\"\">EC gender directive</a> that came into force in December 2012 meaning insurers are no longer able to use gender as a factor when pricing insurance.</p><p></p><p>Female motorists have traditionally enjoyed far lower premiums than their male counterparts, as men are statistically more likely to have an accident. However, the average difference between premiums for men and women now stands at just £30. The introduction of telematics, or black box technology, is also credited with driving down costs for those who can prove they are better drivers.</p><p></p><p>However, while premiums for young men have fallen substantially since gender equality was introduced, for young women they've risen substantially. The average comprehensive cover for women aged 17 to 20 rose by 9.1% in the last 12 months to an eye-watering £1,862. In comparison, the average male driver aged between 17 and 20 have seen their premiums sink by a hefty 29.2% in the last year, from £3,314 to £2,345 – or £969 less.</p><p></p><p>Have you noticed a reduction in what you pay – or have your premiums managed to buck the overall trend?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420149227|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|4143309659fd4fa1109420373524738a781f54d8 -->",

        "body":"<p>The number of complaints about financial services firms fell in the first half of 2013. However, consumers still raised almost 16,000 issues a day about insurance and banking products, figures from the regulator show.</p><p></p><p>Between January and June, 2.9m complaints were lodged with firms, 15% fewer than in the previous six months, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said.</p><p></p><p>Of those, customers' complaints were upheld in 51% of cases, and firms paid £2.55bn in compensation.</p><p></p><p>The fall in the number of reported complaints was chiefly driven by an 18% drop in the number of consumers seeking redress for mis-sold payment protection insurance policies.</p><p></p><p>However, cases around mis-selling of PPI, which was sold alongside loans and credit cards, often to consumers who would never be able to make a successful claim, still accounted for 1.8m complaints – or 61% of the total – and for £2.4bn worth of compensation.</p><p></p><p>Other insurance products were the subject of 313,860 consumer complaints, a 6% increase on the second half of 2012. The only other area to see a rise in complaints was personal pensions, where the number of complaints also rose by 6%.</p><p></p><p>The FCA figures show the most complained about company was Barclays bank, which received 370,733 new complaints, a drop of 10.52% on the previous six months. Of those, 90% were closed in eight weeks and 62% were found in favour of the consumer.</p><p></p><p>Lloyds TSB came second, with 253,735 complaints, a drop of 27% on the second half of 2012. Its settlement rate was identical to Barclays' rate.</p><p></p><p>Although overall complaints about credit cards were down by 42% over the period, card provider MBNA featured third in the league table of most complained-about companies. It received 237,103 over the period, but the vast majority were for sales of insurance, including PPI, rather than the cards it issued. It found in favour of customers in just over a third of cases.</p><p></p><p>Martin Wheatley, the FCA's chief executive, said: \"We expect firms to put their customers at the heart of their business – an important part of this is the way they handle customer complaints.</p><p></p><p>\"Publishing complaints data is a powerful tool that helps encourage competition between firms to improve their service to customers and helps consumers assess their relationships with banks and other providers.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420131305|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|d7ba00c67962ff5c2ef60f259608d943b34b69af -->",

        "body":"<p>You'd think that the financial services industry would still be smarting from the kicking it has received over PPI, endowment and pension-switch mis-selling. You might think it had learned the lesson that selling financial products to people who would later regret buying them because they were either overpriced, useless or deleterious to their pecuniary health, was generally a bad idea – not least because the regulator would eventually find the culprits out and make them pay their victims lots of compensation.</p><p></p><p>Would that it were so. Sadly, the lending industry is still finding creative ways to part the unwary, the naive and the plain greedy from their cash. So, who these days (apart from bankers) has enough money to make it worth a company's while to fleece them? The answer is, of course, pensioners, or at least the asset-rich, cash-poor babyboomers, who are sitting on a gold mine in the shape of their property, just waiting to be excavated by a nice equity release salesman.</p><p></p><p>I'll address the special pleaders right now with a declaration that, yes, equity release can be a lifeline for some people whose home is already so small that they can't downsize to release cash, or who need money for life-saving surgery in Moscow that is not available on the NHS. Equity release may even have a role in inheritance tax planning.</p><p></p><p>What I'm talking about is financial promotions that induce those who have a slender grasp of how compound interest works to do something frivolous or even downright stupid with money they are able to lay their hands on immediately by remortgaging their home with an equity release plan.</p><p></p><p>The latest of these marketing pushes tells us that selfless grandparents are taking out equity release to repay their grandchildren's student debt. According to research undertaken by one equity release firm with the International Longevity Centre UK, <a href=\"http://www.keyrs.co.uk/press-releases/bank-gran-grandad-opens-university/\" title=\"\">almost three-quarters of over-55s expect to dip into their savings to help grandchildren with university costs</a>, while 4% of them will increase their mortgage or take out equity release to do so. This is little short of lunacy.</p><p></p><p>The numbers involved suggest that most of these grandchildren will not be doing MBAs at Wharton or doctorates at Harvard. The money will be going to pay off UK undergraduate debt owed to the Student Loans Company. Yet, UK undergraduate loans as they are currently structured are a kind of graduate tax, with repayments contingent on income received in the years after graduation, rather than the amount of money owed (like a mortgage or credit card). Paying off a chunk of the debt doesn't make the monthly payments smaller and it doesn't shorten the term except for very high earners. So, paying off some of the debt doesn't mean higher disposable income for the graduate – at least in the short term – and may actually just end up as a gift to the government.</p><p></p><p>That's because, according to the latest research, a massive 85% of students will never pay off the full amount they have borrowed plus interest before the debt is written off under the rules after 30 years.. Even government figures produced before the latest research was published estimate that 40% of students won't ever pay off their loans before they are written off. It therefore seems pretty clear that many of the grandparents who take out equity release to help with student fees are wasting their money.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Also on the \"daft things to do\" list is a suggestion by another member of the Equity Release Council that 55-year-olds might like to release money from their homes to spend on Christmas present. Its spiel goes: \"Instead of buying him a new set of golf gloves, why not splash out on a one-to-one coaching session with a PGA professional instead? This is a once in a lifetime experience you could make possible.\" It continues: \"Try spoiling your daughter and granddaughter with a trip to Reims for a weekend of champagne tasting and appreciation.\" Or how about aerobatic stunt flying for a grandson? \"Is grandson a real daredevil? They will certainly never forget the experience.\"</p><p></p><p>The children and grandchildren of a pair of 55-year-olds who take out equity release to spend on Christmas presents may or may not forget the gifts. They are certainly unlikely to be able to ignore their older relative's distress 25 years down the line, when the loan has more than doubled under the weight of compound interest, one of the borrowers is now widowed and the mortgaged house is too big to heat properly, the stairs are awkward, the garden needs attention and the roof needs fixing. But moving is difficult now that grandma is older, and in any case the sheltered accommodation that relatives think might be suitable doesn't meet the lenders' borrowing criteria to port the loan.</p><p></p><p>Suggesting people borrow to pay for Christmas or fund university really is a study in cynicism.</p><p></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420126115|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|7f8e9a2a0d1ade4be1a479161232bb84118cdc73 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Q </strong>I am based in London and work full-time earning around £33,000. I'm keen to get onto the property ladder as I'm nearly 37-years-old and feel that time is running out. I would look to buy on the outskirts of London or further out if I could commute in easily. Based on my income I estimate I could apply for a mortgage of between £105,000 and £125,000. I'm working hard to pull together a deposit and hope to have 5% to 10% saved in about a year's time. Based on my current salary I estimate I could purchase a property of around £160,000 with Help to Buy.</p><p></p><p>There has been a lot written about the second phase of the government's Help to Buy scheme and in my circumstances applying for the scheme is very attractive as it would help me get on the housing ladder a lot more quickly, with a smaller deposit in London, where prices are so high. I'm not sure I could save for a deposit large enough without the Help to Buy scheme if I wanted to buy in London before I'm 40-years-old.</p><p>In a couple of years' time I expect my salary to increase as I move roles which could mean I borrow more if I applied for a mortgage later but I would prefer not to wait until then. &nbsp;</p><p></p><p>My concern with Help to Buy is all the controversy that surrounds it and comments from economists about inflating the property market but it would help me personally get a foot on the property ladder. Should I take advantage of Help to Buy or should I wait longer to save a bigger deposit further down the line (though due to my age I wouldn't want to do this any later than 40 and I may not catch up if prices continue to rise)? <strong>SM</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A</strong> A lot has been written about the second phase of the government's Help to Buy scheme in recent weeks because it has been launched earlier than originally planned. Unlike the first part, which offers homebuyers an interest-free loan, the second phase of Help to buy doesn't give the buyer any cash but instead provides a limited number of mortgage lenders with a partial mortgage guarantee to encourage them to offer mortgages of up to 95% of the value of the property. In common with the first phase of Help to Buy, buyers will have to provide a cash deposit on their home of at least 5% of the purchase price.</p><p></p><p>The taxpayer-backed guarantee does not, however, guarantee that you will get a 95% mortgage, as you will need to pass lender affordability checks and have no history of difficulties in meeting debt repayments. Even if you do qualify for a 95% Help to Buy mortgage, the question you should be asking yourself is not whether you want to use Help to Buy but whether you want to take on that level of debt. If you bought somewhere for £160,000 with a 95% 25-year repayment mortgage (interest-only aren't allowed) with an interest rate of 5%, your monthly mortgage payments would be just under £890. Only you (and a potential lender) can say whether that's affordable but over a year, it works out as just under a third of your pre-tax salary.</p><p></p><p>I suspect that if you really do want to get on the property ladder as quickly as possible, you might be better off going for a new build property with the first stage of Help to Buy. For a property costing £160,000, you would need a deposit of £8,000, a 75% mortgage of £120,000 and a cash loan of £32,000 from the bank of Dave and George to put towards the purchase price. Again, assuming an interest rate of 5%, your monthly mortgage repayments would be about £700.  In addition, for the first five years, there would be no interest to pay on the government loan so if, as you say, your salary will increase in the future, you could aim to save up enough to repay at least some of the interest-free money before you have to start paying interest on it in year six of the loan.</p><p></p><p>Note that the equivalent of the first stage of the Help to Buy scheme in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales works differently, although the second mortgage-guarantee Help to Buy scheme is available throughout the UK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420041609|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|841d0e5fe9e7b5622e1d1af034f0a236a273d954 -->",

        "body":"<p>British Gas will raise energy prices by an average of 9.2% next month, piling further financial pressure on 7.8 million households and reigniting the political row over soaring gas and electricity prices.</p><p>Parent company Centrica became the second of the big six energy firms to announce a price rise after SSE raised prices last week. The average annual dual-fuel bill with British Gas will increase by £107 to £1,297.</p><p>Centrica blamed the above-inflation hike on higher costs for wholesale energy and delivering gas and electricity to homes, and government's \"social and environmental programmes\" which are paid for through customers' bills.</p><p>Electricity bills will rise by 10.4% and gas bills by 8.4% from 23 November. With usage and regional variations this equates to an average price rise of 9.2%, Centrica said.</p><p>The move escalated the row between energy providers and the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who accused SSE of \"ripping off\" customers after it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill\" title=\"\">announced an 8.2% price rise for its 7 million customers</a>.</p><p>Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, said the latest rise by British Gas showed \"clearer than ever\" why Miliband's proposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/sep/25/centrica-sse-labour-miliband-price-freeze\" title=\"\">20-month energy price freeze</a> was needed.</p><p>British Gas said on Thursday that although it recognised energy bills were a \"real worry for hard-pressed households\", the decision was down to rising costs \"that are not all directly under our control\".</p><p>Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas residential energy, said: \"I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes aren't keeping pace. We haven't taken this decision lightly.\"</p><p>He said the best way to keep bills down was by increased energy efficiency, and urged customers to check whether they were eligible for measures such as insulation.</p><p>Tom Lyon, an energy expert at uSwitch.com, said the rise would leave customers feeling \"betrayed\".</p><p>\"Today's price hike will be seen by many as a broken promise after the supplier suggested in May that it would use the extra profits it made last winter to hold off from any price hikes.</p><p>\"British Gas customers have had the rug pulled from under their feet and I suspect that many will be feeling let down and betrayed.\"</p><p>The company, however, insisted it was making \"fair profits\" for \"keeping homes warm and keeping the lights on\".</p><p>It said it was offering a new tariff which guarantees that prices will not go up until 30 November 2014. If standard prices fall, the fixed tariff will fall too, it said.</p><p>Clare Francis, editor-in-chief of Moneysupermarket.com, said other energy providers were likely to follow the move.</p><p>\"It won't stop there. We can expect the other four major providers – EDF, E.ON, npower and Scottish Power – to also announce price hikes over the coming weeks.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420240604|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|60262bdde29961cc2504ae24d99d04feb63c5ee8 -->",

        "headline":"Labour vows to impose new tax on payday lenders",
        "body":"<p>Labour would impose a levy on the profits of payday lenders that would be used to double the amount of public funding for low-cost alternatives, such as credit unions.</p><p>The levy is intended to raise an additional £13m from the much reviled payday loans industry, and will be seen as another attempt by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, to take the side of the consumer against \"profiteering capitalism\".</p><p>Miliband will also confirm that Labour would impose a cap on the cost of credit and give councils the power to stop the spread of payday lending shops in town centres.</p><p>He will announce the next steps in his cost of living campaign as he also reveals Stella Creasy, the new shadow minister for competition and consumer affairs, will lead Labour's campaign against legal loan sharks.</p><p>It comes on the day that the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, urges Anglicans to help the formation of credit unions in their localities as a way of beating back the payday lenders.</p><p>Creasy has been campaigning energetically on the issue for more than two years, and has played a part in forcing the Office of Fair Trading to demand reforms from the industry. Her transfer from shadow home affairs team to the shadow business team gives her formal party responsibility for the issue for the first time.</p><p>Miliband will say the levy will be in addition to the levies the payday industry is due in April to hand to the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to help fund services such as debt advice.</p><p>He will claim the payday loans industry is making very high profits, and this levy need not lead to an increase in the cost of loans.</p><p>Labour says it will consult on the level of rate of the proposed cap on the cost of credit and details of its addition to the levy, but the intention is to double the income due to be received from existing levies, bringing £26m in total from the industry.</p><p>David Cameron said he was open to the idea of a cap on payday lenders at prime minister's questions on Wednesday, saying: \"We continue to look at the issue of a cap and I don't think we should rule that out.\"</p><p>But he added: \"We do have to bear in mind what has been found out in other countries and through our own searches about whether a cap would prove effective.\"</p><p>Earlier in the year the coalition allowed amendments to give powers for the FCA to introduce a cap.</p><p>But Labour claims the FCA is reluctant to use these powers, and the party has criticised the government for not doing more to speed up the decision.</p><p>Miliband has also promised to change planning law to make it easier for councils to prevent payday lenders filling a high street where banks close. Labour suggests that councils should be given powers to assert that a change from a bank to payday lender represents a change of planning use and can therefore be blocked by the council.</p><p>Miliband is on Thursday expected to say: \"The market in payday lending has doubled in just four years. Almost a third of payday loans taken out in Britain at the moment are to cover the cost of people's gas and electricity bills. For too many people the end of the month is their own personal credit crunch.</p><p>\"It is right that companies that benefit from people's financial plight accept their responsibilities.\"</p><p>Creasey will say: \"Across the country Sharkstoppers and Debtbusters campaigners are working to address the damage payday lending debt is doing to the finances of millions of families.</p><p>\"Whether helping to increase the capital that credit unions have to enable them to lend more, kicking these companies out of football grounds and shopping centres or supporting debt advice to those caught in the spiral of debt by the practices of these firms these are the people that are dealing firsthand with this government's failure to learn from other countries in capping the cost of credit.\"</p><p>Welby said the aim was to double the number of credit unions over five years, adding the church could do more to help the formation of credit unions themselves, including through the formation of a Church Mutual Credit Union.</p><p>In a message on Thursday he writes: \"Our faith in Christ calls us to love the poor and vulnerable with our actions. That is why churches must be actively involved in supporting the development of real lending alternatives such as credit unions. That is not an optional activity, but a fundamental part of our witness and service to God's people.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420227569|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|e1f3e75605e244ad3134d0857264185d763499bb -->",

        "body":"<p>September saw the biggest cuts to savings rates in recent memory, with returns on more than 240 accounts lowered during the month, according to savings analysts.</p><p>Nationwide and Sainsbury's were among the account providers slashing rates, with some customers seeing interest cut by 1%. However, in a glimmer of hope for savers experts are also reporting the first rate increases to the fixed-rate savings bond market in many months.</p><p>Since the government introduced the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/funding-for-lending\" title=\"\">Funding for Lending</a> programme in the summer of 2012, Britain's savers have endured a torrid time with many watching as their savings income has been halved. The latest round of cuts in September are possibly a result of the Bank of England's recent confirmation that base rates will remain at current levels for some time.</p><p>Anna Bowes, a founder of the <a href=\"https://www.savingschampion.co.uk/\" title=\"\">SavingsChampion.co.uk</a> website that tracks rates paid by banks and building societies, said: \"September was a terrible month for existing savers with 241 rate cuts across the market.</p><p>\"At the same time, though, several firms started vying to be at the top of the fixed-rate savings bonds tables. As a result, rates for those willing to tie their money up for a set period have started to look a little better. It's long overdue and good to see that there is finally some light at the end of the tunnel. British savers have endured a terrible year.\"</p><p>Last month, Bowes says, Nationwide lowered the interest rate paid on its Loyalty Saver Issue 1 by 0.5% to 2.1%; Sainsbury's halved its Cash Isa rate from 2% to 1%; while NS&amp;I Income Bonds rate dropped by 0.5% to 1.25%. The Newcastle building society cuts its Loyalty Access Isa (Issue 2) by 0.75% to 1.5%.</p><p>So far in October, Sainsbury's has cut its Easy Saver by 0.7% to 1%, while the rates paid by Derbyshire, Cheshire and Dunfermline Platinum Notice accounts have all been halved to 1.25%.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, over the past six weeks, fixed-rate savings products have been creeping up. Bowes says those prepared to lock away at least £1,000 for five years will now get 3.15% at the West Bromwich building society. Birmingham Midshires has the top paying one-year bond – 2% – while Close Brothers is paying 2.3% for two years on balances in excess of £10,000. Aldermore pays 2.6% to those putting at least £1,000 in its three-year bond.</p><p>Despite the rise in fixed-rate savings, those looking for instant access are still suffering low rates. SavingsChampion says the average of the easy access, best-buy accounts remains stuck around 1.5% – half the 3.2% savers were getting on average in August 2012.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Moneyfacts said rates on fixed-term deals were slowly rising again. \"As the mortgage market has seen a resurgence with the recent launch of the government's Help to Buy scheme, banks are now looking for extra funds, by increasing long-term fixed rate deals,\" she said.</p><p>\"Longer term fixed rates and Isas have seen a resurgence – these offer the highest rates in the market and therefore grab attention of savers looking to make the most of their money. Because the market is still volatile, customers would be wise to spread their savings across short-term fix and easy access, as they then have the choice of moving some of their investment quickly with market movements.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420169258|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|c5e4cdca6c62a226b3c28368448f37aa35d392d5 -->",

        "body":"<p>EE has cut the cost of access to its 4G network, offering handset plans from £19 a month in what one analyst calls an \"aggressive\" move that rivals are likely to follow.</p><p>Similar cuts at O2 and Vodafone are now likely, and will hasten the spread of superfast mobile internet access. This is despite the fact that their 4G networks, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/28/vodafone-o2-launch-4g\" title=\"\">launched nine months after EE's</a>, are still in the early stages of rollout and remain far from nationwide.</p><p>Vodafone's entry-level offer for a 4G handset plan is £34, while O2 offers a similar deal at £32.</p><p>\"This is an aggressive move from EE that considerably widens its target market for 4G,\" said analyst Kester Mann at CCS Insight. \"The move will force Vodafone and O2 to reassess their pricing strategy.\"</p><p>EE's entry-level plan is now just £2 more than the cheapest equivalent 3G rates on its Orange and T-Mobile networks, which do not offer 4G. Previously, EE's cheapest 4G plan was £26.</p><p>The UK's largest network operator, created through the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, has been pushing its EE brand at the expense of the older names, amid speculation that they may eventually be replaced. However, the majority of its 26 million customers are still on either Orange or T-Mobile contracts, with just over 1 million signed to the EE network to date.</p><p>\"This clearly offers greater incentive for existing Orange and T-Mobile customers to upgrade to EE,\" said Mann, \"and casts further doubt on the long-term future for these brands.\"</p><p>The arrival of cheaper 4G handsets from Nokia and Samsung has enabled EE to drop its prices. Those signing up for its  £18.99 plan will get 1,000 minutes of calls a month, unlimited texts and a small 500 Megabit bundle of data. They will have to pay some money upfront for better handsets – for example £50 for the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3, £100 for the Nokia Lumia 625, and £380 for the iPhone 5C.</p><p>\"The general push of this is making 4G more accessible to the mass market through offering it on prepay and on cheaper handsets,\" said telecoms expert James Barford at Enders Analysis.</p><p>The price drop comes ahead of Three's 4G launch, expected in December. Three has said it will offer the faster internet service at no extra cost to existing customers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420143379|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|aaa9d990db3df2be70160e2c74f68cf810ab6acc -->",

Excluding bonuses, pay growth was marginally stronger, at just 0.8% – the weakest figure since comparable records began in 2001. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/15/inflation-higher-than-expected-energy-price-rise\" title=\"\">Inflation was running at 2.7% in August</a>.</p><p>These latest figures will help to underpin Labour's claims that while the economy may have \"turned a corner\" as the chancellor suggests, many ordinary families are still suffering a \"cost-of-living crisis\".</p><p>James Plunkett, of the thinktank the Resolution Foundation, said: \"It is now well-established that this has been a tough downturn for wages. The fall in real wages we've seen has been unprecedented.  But perhaps most worrying today is that there's still no sign of the wage squeeze ending – despite some better economic news, the gap between pay and prices is wider now than it was a year ago.\"</p><p>Pay is particularly weak in the public sector, the details of the ONS data reveal, declining by 1.6% in the year to August. Much of the fall came in the state-backed banks, where bonuses were down, and the make-up of the workforce has shifted towards lower-paid staff.</p><p>But even excluding financial services, public sector workers saw their pay decrease by 0.8% in the year to August: the weakest since records began in 2001, against a background of above-target inflation.</p><p>John Philpott, of the consultancy the Jobs Economist, said: \"Workers in the public sector are now bearing the brunt of the real pay squeeze, adding to the pain imposed by job cuts in the order of 10,000 per month. This degree of real wage squeeze is not conducive to a strong and sustained recovery in the UK economy.\"</p><p>The unemployment rate – closely tracked by the Bank of England, which has promised not to raise interest rates until it falls at least to 7%, provided inflation remains under control – was unchanged, at 7.7% between June and August.</p><p>On the more timely claimant count measure, which only takes into account people receiving out-of-work benefits, unemployment fell by a chunky 41,700 between August and September, to hit 1.35 million. Meanwhile, the number of vacancies available across the economy hit its highest level since 2008, the ONS said.</p><p>Young people appear to have been left on the sidelines as the jobs market has recovered over the past 12 months, however, with unemployment among 16- to 24-year-olds almost unchanged at 958,000 between June and August.</p><p>Despite the unchanged unemployment rate, City analysts said the strong improvement in employment suggested the Bank might have to tighten monetary policy earlier than 2016, when it expects the unemployment rate to have hit its 7% threshold.</p><p>Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"Although the unemployment rate was stable at 7.7% in the three months to August, the healthy overall tone of the labour market data does little to dilute expectations that it will get down to 7% well before the Bank of England is currently forecasting.\"</p><p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \"The upturn is welcome news as far as the economy is concerned, but raises the possibility that the Bank of England has underestimated the speed with which the economy is reviving.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420117450|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|da5e02117be12e0dac54f8ee8b66988b2e7d4765 -->",

The average cost of an annual comprehensive policy has fallen almost 24% – or £206 – over the last two-and-a-half years to £652, according to according a report by Confused.com, the price comparison website, and Towers Watson, a consultant.</p><p></p><p>Premiums have dropped by 3.9%, or £26, in the past three months alone, the report found, and are expected to keep falling. This is thanks partly to an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/21/women-car-insurance-eu\" title=\"\">EC gender directive</a> that came into force in December 2012 meaning insurers are no longer able to use gender as a factor when pricing insurance.</p><p></p><p>Female motorists have traditionally enjoyed far lower premiums than their male counterparts, as men are statistically more likely to have an accident. However, the average difference between premiums for men and women now stands at just £30. The introduction of telematics, or black box technology, is also credited with driving down costs for those who can prove they are better drivers.</p><p></p><p>However, while premiums for young men have fallen substantially since gender equality was introduced, for young women they've risen substantially. The average comprehensive cover for women aged 17 to 20 rose by 9.1% in the last 12 months to an eye-watering £1,862. In comparison, the average male driver aged between 17 and 20 have seen their premiums sink by a hefty 29.2% in the last year, from £3,314 to £2,345 – or £969 less.</p><p></p><p>Have you noticed a reduction in what you pay – or have your premiums managed to buck the overall trend?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420149227|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|4143309659fd4fa1109420373524738a781f54d8 -->",

        "body":"<p>You'd think that the financial services industry would still be smarting from the kicking it has received over PPI, endowment and pension-switch mis-selling. You might think it had learned the lesson that selling financial products to people who would later regret buying them because they were either overpriced, useless or deleterious to their pecuniary health, was generally a bad idea – not least because the regulator would eventually find the culprits out and make them pay their victims lots of compensation.</p><p></p><p>Would that it were so. Sadly, the lending industry is still finding creative ways to part the unwary, the naive and the plain greedy from their cash. So, who these days (apart from bankers) has enough money to make it worth a company's while to fleece them? The answer is, of course, pensioners, or at least the asset-rich, cash-poor babyboomers, who are sitting on a gold mine in the shape of their property, just waiting to be excavated by a nice equity release salesman.</p><p></p><p>I'll address the special pleaders right now with a declaration that, yes, equity release can be a lifeline for some people whose home is already so small that they can't downsize to release cash, or who need money for life-saving surgery in Moscow that is not available on the NHS. Equity release may even have a role in inheritance tax planning.</p><p></p><p>What I'm talking about is financial promotions that induce those who have a slender grasp of how compound interest works to do something frivolous or even downright stupid with money they are able to lay their hands on immediately by remortgaging their home with an equity release plan.</p><p></p><p>The latest of these marketing pushes tells us that selfless grandparents are taking out equity release to repay their grandchildren's student debt. According to research undertaken by one equity release firm with the International Longevity Centre UK, <a href=\"http://www.keyrs.co.uk/press-releases/bank-gran-grandad-opens-university/\" title=\"\">almost three-quarters of over-55s expect to dip into their savings to help grandchildren with university costs</a>, while 4% of them will increase their mortgage or take out equity release to do so. This is little short of lunacy.</p><p></p><p>The numbers involved suggest that most of these grandchildren will not be doing MBAs at Wharton or doctorates at Harvard. The money will be going to pay off UK undergraduate debt owed to the Student Loans Company. Yet, UK undergraduate loans as they are currently structured are a kind of graduate tax, with repayments contingent on income received in the years after graduation, rather than the amount of money owed (like a mortgage or credit card). Paying off a chunk of the debt doesn't make the monthly payments smaller and it doesn't shorten the term except for very high earners. So, paying off some of the debt doesn't mean higher disposable income for the graduate – at least in the short term – and may actually just end up as a gift to the government.</p><p></p><p>That's because, according to the latest research, a massive 85% of students will never pay off the full amount they have borrowed plus interest before the debt is written off under the rules after 30 years.. Even government figures produced before the latest research was published estimate that 40% of students won't ever pay off their loans before they are written off. It therefore seems pretty clear that many of the grandparents who take out equity release to help with student fees are wasting their money.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Also on the \"daft things to do\" list is a suggestion by another member of the Equity Release Council that 55-year-olds might like to release money from their homes to spend on Christmas present. Its spiel goes: \"Instead of buying him a new set of golf gloves, why not splash out on a one-to-one coaching session with a PGA professional instead? This is a once in a lifetime experience you could make possible.\" It continues: \"Try spoiling your daughter and granddaughter with a trip to Reims for a weekend of champagne tasting and appreciation.\" Or how about aerobatic stunt flying for a grandson? \"Is grandson a real daredevil? They will certainly never forget the experience.\"</p><p></p><p>The children and grandchildren of a pair of 55-year-olds who take out equity release to spend on Christmas presents may or may not forget the gifts. They are certainly unlikely to be able to ignore their older relative's distress 25 years down the line, when the loan has more than doubled under the weight of compound interest, one of the borrowers is now widowed and the mortgaged house is too big to heat properly, the stairs are awkward, the garden needs attention and the roof needs fixing. But moving is difficult now that grandma is older, and in any case the sheltered accommodation that relatives think might be suitable doesn't meet the lenders' borrowing criteria to port the loan.</p><p></p><p>Suggesting people borrow to pay for Christmas or fund university really is a study in cynicism.</p><p></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420126115|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|7f8e9a2a0d1ade4be1a479161232bb84118cdc73 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Q </strong>I am based in London and work full-time earning around £33,000. I'm keen to get onto the property ladder as I'm nearly 37-years-old and feel that time is running out. I would look to buy on the outskirts of London or further out if I could commute in easily. Based on my income I estimate I could apply for a mortgage of between £105,000 and £125,000. I'm working hard to pull together a deposit and hope to have 5% to 10% saved in about a year's time. Based on my current salary I estimate I could purchase a property of around £160,000 with Help to Buy.</p><p></p><p>There has been a lot written about the second phase of the government's Help to Buy scheme and in my circumstances applying for the scheme is very attractive as it would help me get on the housing ladder a lot more quickly, with a smaller deposit in London, where prices are so high. I'm not sure I could save for a deposit large enough without the Help to Buy scheme if I wanted to buy in London before I'm 40-years-old.</p><p>In a couple of years' time I expect my salary to increase as I move roles which could mean I borrow more if I applied for a mortgage later but I would prefer not to wait until then. &nbsp;</p><p></p><p>My concern with Help to Buy is all the controversy that surrounds it and comments from economists about inflating the property market but it would help me personally get a foot on the property ladder. Should I take advantage of Help to Buy or should I wait longer to save a bigger deposit further down the line (though due to my age I wouldn't want to do this any later than 40 and I may not catch up if prices continue to rise)? <strong>SM</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A</strong> A lot has been written about the second phase of the government's Help to Buy scheme in recent weeks because it has been launched earlier than originally planned. Unlike the first part, which offers homebuyers an interest-free loan, the second phase of Help to buy doesn't give the buyer any cash but instead provides a limited number of mortgage lenders with a partial mortgage guarantee to encourage them to offer mortgages of up to 95% of the value of the property. In common with the first phase of Help to Buy, buyers will have to provide a cash deposit on their home of at least 5% of the purchase price.</p><p></p><p>The taxpayer-backed guarantee does not, however, guarantee that you will get a 95% mortgage, as you will need to pass lender affordability checks and have no history of difficulties in meeting debt repayments. Even if you do qualify for a 95% Help to Buy mortgage, the question you should be asking yourself is not whether you want to use Help to Buy but whether you want to take on that level of debt. If you bought somewhere for £160,000 with a 95% 25-year repayment mortgage (interest-only aren't allowed) with an interest rate of 5%, your monthly mortgage payments would be just under £890. Only you (and a potential lender) can say whether that's affordable but over a year, it works out as just under a third of your pre-tax salary.</p><p></p><p>I suspect that if you really do want to get on the property ladder as quickly as possible, you might be better off going for a new build property with the first stage of Help to Buy. For a property costing £160,000, you would need a deposit of £8,000, a 75% mortgage of £120,000 and a cash loan of £32,000 from the bank of Dave and George to put towards the purchase price. Again, assuming an interest rate of 5%, your monthly mortgage repayments would be about £700.  In addition, for the first five years, there would be no interest to pay on the government loan so if, as you say, your salary will increase in the future, you could aim to save up enough to repay at least some of the interest-free money before you have to start paying interest on it in year six of the loan.</p><p></p><p>Note that the equivalent of the first stage of the Help to Buy scheme in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales works differently, although the second mortgage-guarantee Help to Buy scheme is available throughout the UK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420041609|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|841d0e5fe9e7b5622e1d1af034f0a236a273d954 -->",

        "body":"<p>The water regulator Ofwat plans to block an \"unjustified\" 8% increase in customer bills proposed by Thames Water.</p><p>Thames Water <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/aug/12/thames-water-charge-super-sewer-tideway-tunnel\" title=\"\">wants to add £29 to the bills of its 14 million customers in London</a> and the south of England, arguing that the one-off charge is needed to help pay for the Thames tideway \"super-sewer\" in the capital, as well as an increase in Environment Agency charges and a spike in unpaid bills. The price hike would take the average annual bill to almost £400 by 2015.</p><p>Ofwat said the company had failed to justify the increase, having only made the case for a £7 increase to bills.</p><p>Its chief regulation officer, Sonia Brown, said: \"We said we would challenge Thames Water's request. We have looked at the details and do not believe the current evidence justifies an increase in bills.\"</p><p>Thames Water now has the chance to submit new evidence before Ofwat makes a final decision in November.</p><p>The rebuff is yet another sign of toughness from the water regulator, which last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/13/ofwat-challenges-thames-water-increase-bills\" title=\"\">accused Thames Water of underspending on sewer flood defences</a> and not maintaining its waste water network.</p><p>Under water industry privatisation rules, companies are able to ask for supplementary charges to be levied on their customers, but have to prove their case to Ofwat.</p><p>Thames Water is the only one of the 19 regulated water companies to ask for a supplementary charge and it follows an attempt in 2009 to raise bills by 19%. This earlier request was knocked back by Ofwat, which allowed Thames Water to raise its bills by an extra 3% only.</p><p>A spokesman for Thames Water said: \"We will review Ofwat's draft proposals, and submit our response in due course.\"</p><p>Sir Tony Redmond, of the Consumer Council for Water, welcomed Ofwat's announcement. \"Customers will be relieved if they do not have to face a further price hike at a time when many people are already struggling to cope with the cost of living. Other water companies have absorbed many of the same costs Thames says it is facing. We would urge the company to reconsider its position and not challenge the decision of the regulator.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420101432|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|e7e3b782795469640a7907a5732b4d8f73cbbdee -->",

        "body":"<p>The UK's biggest star fund manager, Neil Woodford, is to quit Invesco Perpetual to open his own fund management business in April in a move that has stunned the asset management industry.</p><p>Woodford, who personally manages funds at Invesco Perpetual totalling £24.6bn and co-manages another £6.4bn, with vast stakes in Glaxo, AstraZeneca, BT and several big tobacco companies, will leave the company on 29 April after 25 years. He said the decision to move was a personal one and that he leaves on good terms.</p><p>\"I leave the company on good terms and remain fully committed to my fund management responsibilities at Invesco Perpetual until my departure. The Invesco Perpetual High Income Fund, Invesco Perpetual Income Fund and other client mandates will be transitioned into the hands of my long-standing, experienced colleagues. I wish my colleagues all the best for the future,\" said Woodford.</p><p>\"My decision to leave is a personal one based on my views about where I see long-term opportunities in the fund management industry. My intention is to establish a new fund management business serving institutional and retail clients as soon as possible after 29 April 2014. There will be no further comment at this stage. Further announcements about the new business will be made after I have left.\"</p><p>Recent performance of Woodford's flagship funds has been middling, with Income and High Income both currently ranked third quartile over one year. But over three years he remains a top quartile performer.</p><p>His departure will be a major blow for Invesco Perpetual, which is likely to see billions of pounds flow out to join Woodford when he opens his new venture. The company said his fund responsibilities would shift to Mark Barnett and the Invesco Perpetual UK equities team.</p><p>The news has rocked the investment world, in which Woodford has earned hero status. On Twitter, the editor of Citywire, Gavin Lumsden said: \"Invesco must be wetting themselves. Neil Woodford setting up a new fund manager.\"</p><p>Patrick Connolly of financial advisers Chase de Vere, said: \"This is terrible news for Invesco Perpetual and will be a cause for concern for many investors who trust their investments and pensions with Neil Woodford. It will be impossible for Invesco Perpetual to replace Woodford with somebody of similar standing because, particularly in the world of UK equity income funds, there is nobody of similar standing. However, there is no reason for investors to panic. Woodford is still running the same investment funds today as he did yesterday and this will continue until next April.\"</p><p>However, Connolly added that he felt investors should not switch automatically to Woodford's new funds, suggesting alternatives such as Artemis Income, Threadneedle UK Equity Income and Rathbone Income.</p><p>At Invesco Perpetual, Mark Armour, CEO said the company has planned for Woodford's succession \"for many years\". He said: \"Neil has served clients of Invesco Perpetual with commitment for over 25 years. It has been a privilege for us all to work alongside him, and I understand that, after 25 years, he is ready for new challenges.\"</p><p>He added:  \"We have planned for succession for many years and have built a world-class investment culture that develops and supports gifted and experienced managers.  Mark Barnett is an exceptional fund manager who has the same active, value-driven investment approach and long-term focus as Neil. A key member of the UK Equities team for 17 years, Mark has a first-quartile track record over one, three and five years.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420030786|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|93172798619180ec810ce856ab7b38976dab590d -->",

Privatisation makes the need for a legally binding deal on jobs more important than ever. CWU is here for the long term, regardless of who owns this company.\"</p><p>The CWU said it is \"almost certain\" that its 115,000 members will vote for industrial action.A nationwide strike, the first since 2009, could be held as soon as 23 October.</p><p>The 99% of Royal Mail's 150,000 workers who accepted £2,200 worth of free shares as part of the privatisation have made paper profits of more than £900, although they cannot sell the shares for three years.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420008309|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|2bae4a9d2a7fe548246e42863571ea32eb95c61d -->",

        "body":"<p>Payday lenders are facing fresh calls for a regulatory crackdown with the launch of a campaign backed by MPs, debt campaigners and consumer groups on Tuesday.</p><p>Consumers are being urged to sign up to the <a href=\"http://www.change.org/paydayloancharter\" title=\"\">Charter to Stop the Payday Loan Rip-Off</a>, which demands that the government takes a stronger stance against the £2bn industry in shorter-term loans.</p><p>Lenders, which can charge annual interest rates in excess of 5,000%, will be regulated from April 2014 by the Financial Conduct Authority, which recently outlined new rules for the sector, including limiting the number of times a loan can be extended and how many attempts a lender can make to recover payments from a borrower's bank account.</p><p>However, campaigners said the rules did not go far enough and are calling for better affordability checks, a crackdown on advertising which would include rules on when promotions could be shown, and real-time data from the industry so lenders can check if a borrower already has other loans. They also want to see restrictions on the total amount lenders can charge so that loans do not spiral out of control.</p><p>Paul Blomfield MP, who has been attempting to get a private member's bill through parliament, said: \"The FCA's proposals for regulation are a step in the right direction, but they don't go far enough. We want members of the public, MPs, councils and charities to back the Charter and join our call for tougher regulation and enforcement.</p><p>\"If this 'once in a generation' opportunity is missed, payday lenders will be able to carry on exploiting people.\"</p><p>The Charter has cross-party support and the backing of a number of debt charities, who have reported growing numbers of clients falling into difficulties with repayments.</p><p>Peter Tutton, head of policy at StepChange Debt Charity, said: \"Over 30,000 people contacted us for help with payday loans in the first half of 2013, almost the same as for the whole of 2012. This is a dangerous market for financially vulnerable consumers and effective regulation is long overdue.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419976358|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|46b83d5c625dafff3b163a16622832f56fc3a657 -->",

In this short time, 320 hours-worth of conference calls were made leaving me with a bill of £4,356.11. </strong></p><p><strong>Orange never alerted me to this blatantly suspicious activity, but it initially promised in writing that I would not have to pay because the charges were \"obvious results of crime\". Two weeks later it attempted to debit my account for the full amount and told me I was liable. I am 23 and have no savings, an entry-level job, a large student loan and I am suffering some serious health problems as a result of this. </strong><em>CM, Ilkeston, Derbyshire</em></p><p></p><p>Unsurprisingly, Orange backs down when its press office gets involved and it has now refunded the charges as \"a gesture of goodwill\".</p><p>The question remains why such frenetic, uncharacteristic activity was not flagged up by its security systems. According to Orange, unusual usage is monitored, but when calls are made abroad there can be a time lag before the foreign network operator reports it.</p><p>Currently mobile phone customers can be held liable for all charges fraudulently incurred before a phone is reported stolen unlike bank customers who are only liable for the first £50 – although Orange was unforgivably heartless to insist on such a huge sum.</p><p>The government and its telecoms regulator, Ofcom, are working on a code of practice to bring greater protection to fraud victims, including the possibility of a maximum liability when large bills are run up by thieves. In the meantime, initiate pin protection on your handset.</p><p></p><p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at </strong><a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\" title=\"your.problems@observer.co.uk\"><strong>your.problems@observer.co.uk</strong></a><strong> or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

        "headline":"Dear Jeremy – your work issues solved",
        "body":"<h2><strong>How does a grown-up teen mum step into the&nbsp;workplace at 35?</strong></h2><p><strong>I am 35 and having trouble finding a job in the arts. I know it is hard, but I have an extra problem: I was one of those teen mums. You know the ones that skulked off mid-A-levels to give birth and never returned? I did, however, do a degree in fine art when my son was a bit older, and got a first.</strong></p><p><strong>The trouble is, since then I have been through a disgusting divorce and lost my house, although I did get some money to go travelling for a year from the proceeds, from which I have just returned.</strong></p><p><strong>My son is now grown up, and  with the emotional scars healed  and everything back in place I am for  the first time able to concentrate on my career.</strong></p><p><strong>I would like to work in arts education in a gallery setting. But how do I go about applying for jobs when my CV looks erratic and sketchy?</strong></p><p><strong>How do I construct a CV or explain all this to potential bosses, and show that my skill set is way beyond the written document presented before them? How do teen mums who are now grown up find their value in the workplace?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p><p>There is a great deal to like about your letter. It is self-aware but wholly without self-pity. You know that jobs in the arts are fiendishly difficult to find, and that a great many conventional employers are going to look at your CV without much enthusiasm. But at the same time you have shown admirable resilience – and the dedication and intelligence to knuckle down and get yourself an excellent degree.</p><p>In the kind of job you're hoping to find, personality should count for as much as formal qualifications. The difficulty, as you clearly realise, is that qualifications speak for themselves while personality – at least until you get to interview stage – doesn't.</p><p>Shrewd potential bosses will know that someone with your sort of background, looking to start a career for the first time at the age of 35, is likely to be unusually grateful for a job, and unusually determined to make a go of it. This has its own appeal.</p><p>So don't be tempted, in your written applications and in constructing your CV, to try to gloss over your personal history; don't try to make yourself sound like everyone else. In the first place, you wouldn't succeed – you'd only come across as evasive; in the second place, an absolutely honest declaration of your past and your present determination is much the best way for your personality to shine through.</p><p>Don't be deterred by the fact that such an approach won't work for everyone; you don't need to appeal to everyone. You just need to intrigue enough people to win yourself a few interviews.</p><p></p><p><strong>Readers say</strong></p><p>• I am the director of an arts organisation working with children and young people. Gallery education is an incredibly competitive field, but there are lots of ways to get started. Arts Council England has funded a number of \"Bridge\" organisations to help children, young people and children's settings to work together effectively. You could also ask to talk to the education lead in your local public arts gallery or museum to help you get a sense of how to get on the road to this sort of career. Volunteering or running your own workshops is also good; just make sure you're insured and have safeguarding checks in place. <strong>EffervescentAlchemy</strong></p><p></p><p>• I recently came back from eight months travelling but was able to talk up skills like negotiating, getting on with different groups of people, budgeting, long-term planning and being able to adapt to changing situations etc. If you dig deep enough you'll be able to turn up things you may not have thought applied to the workplace. <strong>tyorkshiretealass</strong></p><h2><strong>Is age 55 too late&nbsp;to swap drudgery for a job inspiring passion?</strong></h2><p><strong>Until recently I was a successful 55-year-old professional. I am financially comfortable, but I've always despised my work to the extent that a few months ago I resigned to write a book. The book is now finished and I really ought to get back to work, but I am determined not to go back to the loathsome drudgery of the rat race. </strong></p><p><strong>I know I should find a job for which I have a passion; my problem is I've spent decades looking for a passion from which I could make a living and still haven't found one.</strong></p><p><strong>Do you have any advice as to where I might get help to find a meaningful role for the last decade of my career? I want to leap out of bed every morning, excited to go to work. I don't need a handsome salary.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p><p>I am always been a bit leery about applying the word \"passion\" to jobs. You say you've spent decades looking for one, but the thing about real passions is that you don't have to go looking for them; like it or not, they take you over.</p><p>There are certainly some who are genuinely consumed by a very strong vocational drive, who find particular subjects irresistibly fascinating. But millions of other people have enjoyable, rewarding, socially useful jobs that they would never claim to be passions.</p><p>I am not suggesting you should lower your sights and settle for another role you despise, just that between \"the loathsome drudgery of the rat race\" and those rare true passions is a whole range of occupations that you could well find stimulating. If a passion hasn't taken hold of you by now, it probably never will – and there's no tragedy in that.</p><p>You've written a book. I wish you'd told me what it was about. Writing a book demands time, persistence and self-discipline. Something must have held your interest for long enough for you to finish it.</p><p>And your interests are exactly what you should be exploring right now. Is there nothing in the subject of this book that might lead, however indirectly, to a possible new role? My guess is that anything that engaged your mind and your imagination, that presented you with challenging problems that demanded intelligent solutions, would very soon satisfy you.</p><p>You might never develop a passion for it; you might never leap out of bed every morning, excited to go to work (who does, I wonder?). But the chances are, as is true for most people, that as your experience deepened so would your interest. And with that comes satisfaction.</p><p></p><p><strong>Readers say</strong></p><p>• If you managed to write a book within a few months, you must have loved doing that. So why not write another one or become a ghostwriter for others? <strong>Aranzazu</strong></p><p></p><p>• List everything you've done recently that has made your heart sing (whether work-related or not) on a huge piece of paper. Then look at your list and see whether different combinations of activities could form a job. <strong>CareersPartnershipUK</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to </strong><a href=\"mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong>dear.jeremy@theguardian.com</strong></a><strong>.

        "body":"<p><strong>Q</strong> Can you get the government's Help to Buy scheme if you have a rental property already?</p><p>We have a family home in Cleethorpes and need to move to Leicester for work. Our home in Cleethorpes is valued at around £250,000 and we have around £140,000 left to pay on our repayment mortgage. My husband also has a house from before we met which is also on a repayment mortgage. This house is valued at around £200,000 and we have around £130,000 left to pay on that one. We rent this one out and we don't want to sell it.</p><p>If we sold the house in Cleethorpes, could we (with scraping together around about £50,000 in savings) pay off the mortgage on the rental house and then apply for the Help to Buy scheme to buy another house in Leicester which would be our family home. This would leave us with the rental house as our pension plan and just the one mortgage.</p><p>I would be really grateful if you could answer this question as I can't find any advice on the web about it at all. <strong>AB</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A</strong> You'll find a lot of information about the government's current Help to Buy scheme in the <a href=\"http://www.helptobuy.org.uk/wpcontent/uploads/2013/06/Help-to-Buy-equity-loan-buyers-guide.pdf\" title=\"\">Help to Buy Buyer's Guide (pdf)</a> published on the <a href=\"http://www.helptobuy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Help to Buy website</a>. This categorically states that \"the property purchased [using the Help to Buy scheme] must be your only residence. Help to Buy is not available to assist buy-to-let investors or those who will own any property other than their Help to Buy property after completing their purchase\". More seriously, \"applicants who make fraudulent claims for Help to Buy assistance will be liable to criminal prosecution\" so just not mentioning your rental property is not an option.</p><p>The first part of Help to Buy, which came into place in April, can only be used on new-build properties. Had you been eligible, you would have been expected to put down a cash deposit of 5% on your new home in Leicester, take out a Help to Buy mortgage of 75% with the remaining 20% of the purchase price being funded by an equity loan from government. The Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme which will apply to both newly built and existing homes will be available from 1 January 2014. However, the fact you plan to own more than one property means you will not qualify to use it.</p><p>Given that you can't get government help with buying your new home, and you don't want to sell the rental property, your options are limited. One option would be to keep the current mortgage on the rental property and use the £110,000 from selling your home (assuming you sell for £250,000 and pay off the outstanding mortgage of £140,000) to put towards buying your new home in Leicester. Alternatively, if you are determined to clear the mortgage on the rental property, you could use the proceeds from selling your home together with some of your £50,000 in savings to do just that.</p><p>However, that would leave you with only £30,000 of your savings to put down as a deposit on the Leicester house. Assuming you would get a mortgage of 80% of the value on your new home, this would buy you a property costing £150,000.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417533454|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|fbd378e79bdfe3c6b61fd6aaa9e8f093c8f9644c -->",
