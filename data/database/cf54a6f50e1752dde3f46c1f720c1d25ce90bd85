        "body":"<p>Mystery continues to surround the fate of Vittorio Missoni, the Italian fashion executive, after reports that his body had been recovered from an aircraft off the Venezuelan coast went unconfirmed by his relatives.</p><p>The Italian Ansa news agency reported on Thursday morning that the remains of five people – including Missoni and his wife, Maurizia Castiglioni – had been recovered from the Islander plane in which they were last seen in January.</p><p>The aircraft carrying the couple, along with two of their friends and two pilots, went missing on 4 January during the flight from the resort islands of Los Roques to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas.</p><p>Ansa originally said that the remains of five bodies had been found in the plane. But later on Thursday it said that the remains of only three people had been found, and did not identify who. The recovery mission had begun today, it said, and DNA tests would need to be run on the remains.</p><p>The reports, meanwhile, were not confirmed by the Missoni family. \"We do not yet have an official confirmation from the Venezuelan institutions. We don't yet know anything and no members of my family have been informed that operations to recover the bodies … were being carried out,\" Missoni's ex-wife, Tania Caputi, told the Adnkronos news agency.</p><p>The plane wreck itself was located in June, at a depth of 76 metres.</p><p>Missoni, who was 58 when the plane went missing, was the son of Ottavio Missoni, the man who started a small Italian knitwear shop in 1953 and turned it into a hugely successful name famed for its multicoloured zigzags and other striking patterns.</p><p>Ottavio Missoni <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/may/09/ottavio-missoni-dies-aged-92\" title=\"\">died in May</a>, aged 92, before his son's body was discovered.</p><p>• This article was updated on 17 October 2013. The original version stated definitively that the bodies of Vittorio Missoni, his wife Maurizia Castiglioni, their friends and a co-pilot had been found. This has yet to be confirmed.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420232537|2013-10-18T10:23:04Z|22622cc9daab8e61fac1e7eb4732d551d65f2472 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ottavio Missoni, the founding member of the Missoni fashion dynasty, has died aged 92. He set up the Italian fashion house in 1953 and quickly established its colourful geometric knits as the brand's trademark. A Missoni statement said he \"passed away peacefully at home surrounded by his family\".</p><p>Ottavio, who represented Italy as a hurdler at the 1948 Olympic Games, started out by designing knitted tracksuits for athletes, which were then adopted by the Italian Olympic team. He began the Missoni brand with his wife Rosita. Starting with knitwear, Missoni is now a major force across men's and womenswear. The label had a turnover of £59m in 2012, boasts 40 stores around the world, and has even extended the brand to Missoni Hotels in <a href=\"http://www.hotelmissoni.com/hotelmissoni-edinburgh\" title=\"\">Edinburgh and Kuwait</a>.</p><p>Missoni has always been a brand with family at its heart. Three generations are now involved in the business, with Ottavio and Rosita's three children working for the brand. Their granddaughter Margherita, who designs accessories for Missoni, is also the label's ambassador. They have translated these family ties to something that appeals to consumers; photographer Juergen Teller has photographed the family for the ad campaigns since 2010.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-408555997'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2013/5/9/1368091783628/Rosita-and-Ottavio-Misson-009.jpg' alt='Rosita and Ottavio Missoni in Milan.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rosita and Ottavio Missoni in Milan.

        "body":"<p>Ottavio Missoni, who has died aged 92, was the co-founder of the Italian fashion brand <a href=\"http://www.missoni.com/gb/fashion?gclid=COzP-4u0ibcCFXMRtAodS34Amg&amp;tp=47456\" title=\"\">Missoni</a> and the patriarch of a dynasty. In 1953, with his wife, Rosita, he set up the company that became known around the world for its brightly coloured geometric knits and zigzag patterns.</p><p>Ottavio, known as Tai, and Rosita began with a few knitting machines, making designs for other brands. The first Missoni collection appeared in 1958 and included two striped dresses that sold out in the Milan store La Rinascente. Adapting the Raschel knitting machine (which was usually used for shawls) in 1963, the Missonis created the distinctive zigzag lightweight knits which became their signature.</p><p>Their first fashion show was in 1966, and the brand began to grow in the 70s, with a colourful, bohemian aesthetic. Supporters included the influential fashion journalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/aug/10/anna-piaggi\" title=\"\">Anna Piaggi</a> and the American Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, who reportedly commented, on seeing the vibrant knits: \"Who said that only colours exist? There are also tones.\"</p><p>Sixty years after its foundation, Missoni, based in Sumirago, in the countryside outside Milan, continues to be successful – it had a turnover of £59m last year, with 40 stores around the world and celebrity fans ranging from the <a href=\"http://style.uk.msn.com/fashion/duchess-of-cambridge-wardrobe-re-wears?page=2\" title=\"\">Duchess of Cambridge</a> to Jennifer Lopez. It has also expanded into homewear and hotels. This suited Ottavio perfectly. \"I've never done what was fashionable,\" he said in 2011. \"Going against the rules comes naturally to me.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-408587686'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/9/1368114058122/A-classic-Missoni-creatio-001.jpg' alt='A classic Missoni creation of tthe mid-70s.' width='160' height='176' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A classic Missoni creation of the mid-70s. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The son of a sea captain, Vittorio, and his wife, Teresa De Vidovich, Countess of Capocesto and Ragosniza, Ottavio was born in Dubrovnik and grew up in Zadar – now part of Croatia but then Italian territory. He fought with the Italian army in the second world war at the Battle of El Alamein and was a prisoner of war in Egypt for four years.</p><p>He was also a talented athlete, who had competed in track events before the war. A member of the Italian national team at 16, he was a champion at the World Student Games in 1939. He continued exercising regularly into his 90s, and had a swimming pool and gym installed at his home. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily in 2011 he said: \"Running was a natural gift. They called me 'son of Apollo'.\"</p><p>Sport turned out to be his unlikely entry into fashion. He represented Italy in the 400m hurdles at the 1948 Olympic Games in London, and made knitted tracksuits that were worn by members of the Italian team. Sixteen-year-old Rosita Jelmini was a student spectator at the event and the couple met at a lunch organised by the Italian team.</p><p>Married in 1953, they turned out to be a formidable fashion force. The Missoni brand combined Ottavio's burgeoning design skills with Rosita's background in textiles – her family had owned a shawl-making factory. They began with a small factory in Gallarate, Lombardy, where Rosita had grown up.</p><p>As with other Italian fashion houses, from Versace to Ferragamo, family has been central to the Missoni brand. Although Ottavio and Rosita continued to preside over its progress, in the 90s they handed over the day-to-day running of the business to their three children, Vittorio, Luca and Angela. Angela has designed the ready-to-wear collections since 1996. The couple continued to live near Sumirago and Ottavio devoted more time to painting and tapestry, also writing an autobiography, Una Vita sul Filo di Lana (A Life on the Woollen Thread, 2011).</p><p>Ottavio saw the evolution of the Missoni dynasty as a natural choice rather than something expected of the second generation. \"I never pushed for them to pursue this career,\" he said, \"but I'm happy because they chose the company themselves. And we all agree it's a family firm and it must remain as such.\"</p><p>Three generations are now involved in the business – Ottavio and Rosita's granddaughter, Margherita, designs accessories – and rather than using models, the photographer Juergen Teller has captured the family at home for ad campaigns since 2010.</p><p>Ottavio is survived by Rosita, their children and grandchildren. Their son Vittorio and his wife, Maurizia, have been missing since January, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/09/vittorio-missoni-family-crash-scenario\" title=\"\">their plane disappeared over the coast of Venezuela</a>.</p><p><em>•</em> Ottavio Missoni, fashion designer, born 11 February 1921; died 9 May 2013</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/408584360|2013-10-18T10:23:04Z|e05c86d824da031d13300b22cf8b99612ab3e228 -->",

        "body":"<p>The international men's fashion shows continued this weekend, moving to the Italian fashion capital of Milan. Shows for autumn/winter 2013 by some of fashion's biggest power players, including Burberry, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Prada, were on the schedule.</p><p>But regardless of next season's trends, the biggest story in Milan this season surrounds Missoni.</p><p>Famed for its patterned knitwear, the company staged their catwalk presentation on Sunday  despite the disappearance of Vittorio Missoni, son of Ottavio and Rosita, founders of the label in the 1950s.</p><p>Missoni's two-engine plane, also carrying his partner Maurizia Castiglioni, two friends and two pilots, went missing on a flight in Venezuela on 4 January.</p><p>Various theories, including suggestions that the place where the plane disappeared had been located, circulated in Italian media over the weekend.</p><p>On Saturday, before her show, Donatella Versace said: \"No one better than me can understand the pain and anguish that they are experiencing.\" Versace's brother, Gianni, the founder of the company, was murdered in 1997.</p><p>The latest Missoni catwalk collection marked the brand's 60th anniversary. Angela Missoni, Vittorio's sister who is the chief designer for the label, was backstage to add finishing touches but did not come out at the end of the show to take the customary bow.</p><p>Despite the label's Italian roots, the show had a distinctive US theme running through it. The great North American landscape was cited as inspiration in the show notes. Coloured sand made up the catwalk and featured contrast sections, which echoed the outlines of mountains.</p><p>Towards the end of the show, knitwear featured similar mountain landscapes on their reverse – a riff perhaps on the label's signature zigzag motif.</p><p>The soundtrack, the twang of a guitar on a loop, plus fringed footwear and looks featuring double-denim, also conveyed an American story.</p><p>Butter soft suede bomber jackets boasted knitted backs while smart tailored coats also featured. But it was the trademark textured and colourful knits, from turtle necks to cardigan-jackets, that were by far the strongest pieces.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/402314646|2013-10-18T10:23:04Z|6fac89037c36a5970ab012ed4ae21ea9b80b2ee2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Mystery continues to surround the fate of Vittorio Missoni, the Italian fashion executive, after reports that his body had been recovered from an aircraft off the Venezuelan coast went unconfirmed by his relatives.</p><p>The Italian Ansa news agency reported on Thursday morning that the remains of five people – including Missoni and his wife, Maurizia Castiglioni – had been recovered from the Islander plane in which they were last seen in January.</p><p>The aircraft carrying the couple, along with two of their friends and two pilots, went missing on 4 January during the flight from the resort islands of Los Roques to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas.</p><p>Ansa originally said that the remains of five bodies had been found in the plane. But later on Thursday it said that the remains of only three people had been found, and did not identify who. The recovery mission had begun today, it said, and DNA tests would need to be run on the remains.</p><p>The reports, meanwhile, were not confirmed by the Missoni family. \"We do not yet have an official confirmation from the Venezuelan institutions. We don't yet know anything and no members of my family have been informed that operations to recover the bodies … were being carried out,\" Missoni's ex-wife, Tania Caputi, told the Adnkronos news agency.</p><p>The plane wreck itself was located in June, at a depth of 76 metres.</p><p>Missoni, who was 58 when the plane went missing, was the son of Ottavio Missoni, the man who started a small Italian knitwear shop in 1953 and turned it into a hugely successful name famed for its multicoloured zigzags and other striking patterns.</p><p>Ottavio Missoni <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/may/09/ottavio-missoni-dies-aged-92\" title=\"\">died in May</a>, aged 92, before his son's body was discovered.</p><p>• This article was updated on 17 October 2013. The original version stated definitively that the bodies of Vittorio Missoni, his wife Maurizia Castiglioni, their friends and a co-pilot had been found. This has yet to be confirmed.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420232537|2013-10-18T10:23:04Z|22622cc9daab8e61fac1e7eb4732d551d65f2472 -->",
