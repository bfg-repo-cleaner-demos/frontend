        "body":"<p>A top official with China's sovereign wealth fund has issued a blunt warning that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/gallery/2012/nov/14/anti-austerity-strikes-europe-eurozone\" title=\"\">the latest unrest across the eurozone</a> shows austerity has stretched the public's tolerance \"to breaking point\".</p><p>Jin Liqun, chair of the supervisory board of the $480bn (£300bn) China Investment Corporation (CIC), warned that undue harshness risked a backlash which could end with necessary economic reforms being abandoned.</p><p>Jin has been extremely critical of Europe's handling of the debt crisis, warning that authorities have taken a piecemeal approach and suggesting Greece should be given more time to work off its debt. But he has previously stressed the need for Europeans to \"work a bit harder … work a bit longer\" like Chinese citizens, complaining about \"sloth-inducing\" labour laws.</p><p>Speaking at a forum in Beijing on Friday he repeated his warning that governments had spent unsustainably in the past.</p><p>But he went on to warn that Europe was now seeing social and political unrest across several states.</p><p>\"One commonality is that unions are now involved in organised protests; demonstrations and strikes. It smacks of the solidarity movement witnessed in the 1930s,\" he said.</p><p>\"The general public's tolerance of austerity has been stretched to breaking point.\"</p><p>Jin pointed to the unemployment rates in Spain and Greece and added: \"The worst case could be a complete discarding of austerity programmes. The fact the public are taking to the streets and resorting to violence indicates the general public's tolerance has hit its limits.\"</p><p>He went on: \"The eurozone needs to strike a proper balance between austerity and growth. Austerity without growth is a cul de sac.\"</p><p>Jin also suggested that the European Central Bank should launch further unorthodox measures to help the eurozone, which is now officially in recession.</p><p>\"Monetary easing is considered too radical but we believe it to be a practical move. The crisis is pulling the economy underwater.</p><p>\"People need breathing space. People should be helped to implement austerity programmes.\"</p><p>Jin told the Guardian after his speech: \"European governments should be given some time … If you ask the Greek people to slash their spending by 30-40%, it's not possible. So there should be some tolerance, but the determination to carry on austerity should not be relaxed. It is only the issue of how you can balance one against the other.\"</p><p>CIC is one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds and recently <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/31/china-takes-stake-heathrow\" title=\"\">bought a 10% stake in Heathrow airport</a>.</p><p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/14/eurozone-crisis-general-strikes-protest-day-of-action\" title=\"\">Europe saw its biggest ever protests against austerity</a>. There were general strikes in Spain and Portugal, walkouts in Italy and Greece, and demonstrations in hundreds of cities across the region. Demonstrators clashed with riot police in Milan, and rubber bullets were fired in Madrid and Barcelona.</p><p>• Jin was speaking at a forum organised by business magazine Caixin.

        "headline":"Britain's rebate could be cut under proposed EU budget changes",
        "body":"<p>Britain stands to lose around 1bn euros a year in its contentious EU budget rebate under the latest proposals being circulated ahead of what is certain to be an extremely bruising summit devoted to the trillion-euro budget next week.</p><p>The chair of the summit, Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European council of national government leaders, has drafted new seven-year budget proposals, slashing the original figures from the European Commission by between 75bn and 81bn euros. His team is presenting the reduced budget as a figure that David Cameron could live with despite the prime minister's threat to veto a deal unless EU spending is frozen at 2011 levels plus inflation until 2020.</p><p>The Van Rompuy team also say that the British rebate, worth 3.6bn euros last year, is being retained. But two changes to the way it is calculated would result in the rebate being cut by almost 28% or around 1bn euros a year, according to senior UK officials who on Thursday lambasted both the rebate rejigging and the overall thrust of the Van Rompuy proposals.</p><p>Italy and France, who bear the brunt of funding the UK rebate because Germany won an exemption from contributing to the costs, are piling on the pressure for a new rebate regime, not to abolish it but to change the way it is calculated.</p><p>The Van Rompuy draft says all 27 EU countries should have to finance the \"correction\", including Britain itself, which effectively means a rebate cut of almost 15%. Additionally, part of a deal struck by Tony Blair in 2005 would be scrapped meaning that there would be no redress for British money spent on rural development, resulting in a further 13% reduction in the UK rebate.</p><p>Senior officials in Brussels familiar with the thinking behind Van Rompuy's gambit said he had \"tackled the British rebate in a clever way.\"</p><p>But at a meeting on Thursday of senior officials on the draft budget, Sir Jon Cunliffe, the UK ambassador to the EU, argued strongly for a retention of the status quo and rejected any attempt to shift the rebate's calculation on to a different basis.</p><p>The rebate row multiplies Cameron's problems and isolation on the EU budget ahead of what is certain to be a very fraught summit that may fail to decide how to fund the EU in the years ahead.</p><p>Cameron is caught between his own backbenches and a host of EU leaders alarmed at his threat to veto a budget deal unless the outcome is a lot lower than everyone else is willing to accept.</p><p>Van Rompuy has stitched together his proposals in such a way as to produce an actual reduction, his officials say, of 2% in spending planned for 2014-2000 compared to the 2007-2013 period. His total comes out at 973bn euros, 75bn less than the initial commission draft from last summer. It would cut 25bn from farm spending and another 25bn from cohesion funds that go to the union's poorer areas - by far the biggest items in the budget.</p><p>Officials say this would enable Cameron to claim victory in the budget battle by demonstrating that EU spending is being cut and not merely frozen.</p><p>But British officials on Thursday abruptly dismissed the Van Rompuy estimates, saying the cuts did not go far enough. The 973bn figure contrasts with a UK target guesstimated of just over 900bn for the seven-year period. The British are refusing to show their hand and name a figure for their preferred budget to the frustration of key senior officials in Brussels.</p><p>For different reasons, the Van Rompuy draft has also managed to alienate several other countries. France rejected the proposals because the cuts to farming subsidies were too high. Portugal, Poland, Austria, and Hungary are also incensed. The Germans are pushing a figure that would entail shaving another 20bn from Van Rompuy's total.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399477801|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|ac2d485d0d16da494425ba3830c8101a9614ac87 -->",

        "headline":"Eurozone recession: what the economists say",
        "body":"<h2>Paul de Grauwe, London School of Economics</h2><p>We are now getting into a double-dip recession which is entirely self-made. It is a result of excessive austerity in southern countries and unwillingness in the north to do anything else. Countries in the south have to reduce their deficits, but they cannot if those in the north with a surplus are not willing to help with stimulus. This divide, even hostility, between countries is stronger than I have seen in the last 20 years. The degree of austerity has now put so many people in terrible conditions that they reject all of this. That's a very dangerous situation.</p><p></p><h2>Martin Van Vliet, ING</h2><p>What you notice is that the recession in southern Europe is slowly creeping to other countries. If you look at the indicators for the fourth quarter you see that even Germany many not grow again and that shows that the economy has an enormous need for a new impulse. If the global economy grows faster again, there are rays of light in China, if the US sails past the fiscal cliff, Germany could pick up again but the question is whether that would be enough to counteract the contraction in other parts of the eurozone.</p><p></p><h2>Steen Jakobsen, Saxobank</h2><p>This was totally expected because of austerity policies combined with world growth slowing down and a dramatic fall in activity in Germany and the Netherlands. Social tensions are rising, as we saw [on Wednesday], because the first casualty is the real economy. The balance now will have to be to continue to implement reforms and also reducing the burden of austerity through debt relief, which is a very difficult balance.</p><p></p><h2>Chris Williamson, Markit</h2><p>The data were better than expected, with analysts having anticipated a 0.2% decline. However, worse is probably yet to come, with a stronger downturn likely to be seen in the fourth quarter as output looks set to fall in Germany and France after showing surprising resilience in the region's two largest economies third quarter.</p><p></p><p>These numbers are unlikely to lead to any change of course at the European Central Bank. President Draghi has clearly stated that the ECB are aware that the economy is weak and will remain weak for some time, and that policy is suitable accommodative, so the dip back into recession is highly unlikely to prompt further policy easing.</p><p></p><h2>Holger Schmieding, Berenberg bank</h2><p>As the eurozone recession will likely get worse before it can get better, many countries may miss their next fiscal targets for 2012 and 2013. The challenge for eurozone policy makers will be to accept such fiscal shortfalls and not prolong the recession by imposing extra austerity on countries that fail to meet their fiscal targets for cyclical reasons.</p><p></p><h2>Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight</h2><p>With the eurozone seemingly headed for further GDP contraction in the fourth quarter after moving officially into recession in the third quarter, and with the underlying inflation situation in the single currency area looking far from alarming, we believe that the ECB will take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50% sooner rather than later. Indeed, an interest rate cut in December is very possible.</p><p></p><h2>Victoria Clarke, Investec</h2><p>No-one's been kidding themselves that the euro area economy isn't very, very weak. The PMIs have been consistently poor for some time now, and there's no real evidence there of any pick-up in momentum for the quarters ahead.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399442531|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|f1b58fc174151618f318cf752ab297632a918176 -->",

        "headline":"Eurozone's double-dip recession shows contagion spreading to 'core' countries",
        "body":"<p>It's official. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession\" title=\"\">The eurozone has entered a double-dip recession</a> after recording a 0.1% contraction in the third quarter of 2012.</p><p>Some officials in Brussels might argue that the outcome, all things considered, is not that bad. The decline was smaller than expected and the single currency's big two economies – Germany and France – both grew by 0.2%. Austerity was bound to exact a price but the price is proving bearable.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/14/europe-unite-austerity-protests\" title=\"\">The serious unrest that swept across Europe on Wednesday</a> provides one counter to the glass-half-full way of looking at things. The fine print of Thursday's data offers a second reason to be less sanguine. The grim prospects for the fourth quarter of 2012 and beyond are a third.</p><p>Clearly, parts of the eurozone are suffering grievously from slow growth, frighteningly high levels of unemployment and falling living standards. The fact that eurozone GDP still fell even when Germany and France were growing indicates that activity was falling quite fast in some of the smaller economies. The problems of Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy have been well documented; the worry in Thursday's numbers was that \"core\" countries like Austria and the Netherlands saw their economies shrink in the third quarter. For Angela Merkel and François Hollande, the worrying message from the data is that the contagion is spreading from the periphery to the core.</p><p>What's more, all the signs are that the downturn is intensifying in the final three months of the year. So far this year, the eurozone has been gently declining rather than collapsing. There was no growth in the first quarter, a 0.2% drop in GDP in the second quarter, and now a 0.1% fall in the third quarter. Analysts think the fourth quarter will see a decline of 0.5%, with a strong chance that both Germany and France will go backwards.</p><p>Nor are the prospects much brighter for next year. Greece has just signed up to another batch of spending cuts, the Spanish economy is in freefall and Germany will continue to struggle all the while world trade remains weak. European banks remain in a parlous state and would go under without life support from the European Central Bank and national governments. The first half of 2013 will be grim.</p><p>Britain is not in the eurozone but, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/14/uk-risks-triple-dip-recession-mervyn-king\" title=\"\">as Sir Mervyn King noted</a> on Wednesday, events on the other side of the Channel are stifling recovery. The Bank of England's view that the UK economy will contract in the fourth quarter was supported by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/15/retail-sales-triple-dip-recession\" title=\"\">unexpectedly poor figures for high street sales</a> in October, an indication of the pressures on discretionary spending.</p><p>In past years, consumers have tended to tighten their belts in October and November before having a splurge just before Christmas, when jittery retailers cut prices to shift stock, so it is premature at this stage to assume that there will be falling output in the final three months of 2012, let alone two consecutive quarters of negative GDP over the winter that would constitute a triple-dip recession. But the desperate state of the eurozone economy makes a third leg to the UK slump a real possibility. You would not want to bet against it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399442376|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|e07b0d2fe52c4f4f1c269475067e019fdc8d6057 -->",

        "body":"<p>Friendship and co-operation were at the top of the agenda. The meeting was meant to prove how Greece and Germany, Europe's two sparring allies, can actually get along swimmingly.</p><p>But before mayors from both countries could even face each other across the table at Thessaloniki's exhibition centre, furious municipal workers had not only stormed the building but had gone on the attack, hurling coffee, water bottles, eggs and abuse at German officials.</p><p>In the melee, the German consul general to the Greek city, Wolfgang Hoelscher-Obermaier, was pelted with projectiles and his speech was snatched from him as protesters shouted \"Nazis out\" and \"It's now or never.\" Riot police were left chasing protesters as they pushed their way into the complex and its various halls.</p><p>Barely a month after a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/09/eurozone-crisis-angela-merkel-visits-greece\" title=\"\">combustible visit to Athens by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel</a>, relations between the eurozone's richest and poorest partners are still a long way from cordial.</p><p>\"You could say it was quite tense,\" said an employee at Thessaloniki's town hall, where the bilateral meeting took place. \"Municipal workers are angry anyway, but the remarks made by [German politician Hans-Joachim] Fuchtel really made them mad.\"</p><p>Fuchtel, Germany's deputy minister of labour and social affairs, is Merkel's choice to promote bilateral ties at a regional level. On Wednesday, however, the politician, who has island-hopped and mountain-trekked to win favour with ordinary Greeks, ignited a firestorm after saying local authorities in Greece were overstaffed.</p><p>\"There are studies and research which have shown that as far as local administration is concerned 3,000 workers are needed in Greece to do the work carried out by 1,000 Germans,\" he said on the eve of the two-day conference whose aim is to promote regional co-operation by bringing together mayors from both countries. \"Answers should be given especially to those [EU] partners who are financing processes in Greece, as to why there is not a more effective exploitation of the labour force.\"</p><p>Berlin has been the biggest bankroller of the €240bn (£193bn) bailouts propping up the debt-choked Greek economy – and with it – the toughest advocate of austerity in Athens.</p><p>But for Greek municipal workers who stand to be axed in the latest round of belt-tightening demanded of the country – and who have begun occupying town halls nationwide – Fuchtel's statement appears to have been the last straw.</p><p>\"These people haven't come to help us, but to announce our death sentence,\" said Themis Balassopoulos, who, as head of the municipal workers' union, had travelled to Thessaloniki to attend the demonstration.</p><p>In Berlin, a spokesman at the foreign office, mindful of the meeting's raison d'etre, tried to play down the incident. \"We can confirm that there was a demonstration on the margin of the conference but to our knowledge there were no injuries,\" he said.</p><p>Later in the day Hoelscher-Obermaier emerged from the building to say he thought Fuchtel's comments had been misconstrued. \"It was a misunderstanding. I am more pro-Greek than I was before today,\" he told reporters.</p><p>Even Merkel, who had been the target of virulent anti-German sentiment during her six-hour stopover in Athens last month, said she believed the Thessaloniki meeting was \"a good thing\". \"I heard that there were some very constructive talks,\" she said, before adding: \"Violence is no means for political disputes.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399479452|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|e7cc7695ea4bd15558bcca2be292cd4ba267b67c -->",

        "headline":"Double-dip recession confirmed in eurozone",
        "body":"<p>The head of the European Central Bank has warned that time is running out to resolve the crisis in the eurozone as the latest figures showed the 17 nations of the single currency have slid into a double-dip recession.</p><p>With financial markets convinced that even worse data will emerge over the winter, Mario Draghi urged policy makers to take full advantage of the breathing space won by the ECB when it announced in the summer it would buy unlimited amounts of government bonds from troubled euro zone countries.</p><p>\"With the ECB unconventional measures, we have been able to steady the course ... We have gained precious time, but this is not infinite\", Draghi said in a speech in Milan.</p><p>Shares fell on all the major European bourses after officials in Brussels announced that the euro zone was officially back in recession after a 0.1% fall in output in the third quarter. The decline followed a 0.2% drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter.</p><p>Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund announced that she was cutting short a visit to Asia in order to hold more talks with European policy makers about how to end the crisis.</p><p>Lagarde has been urging swifter action to reduce Greece's debts to a sustainable level, but Angela Merkel ruled out the possibility that European governments would accept losses on their holdings of Greek bonds.</p><p>\"I hope the time is near when we can reach the solution that is needed\", Merkel said after a meeting with the French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. \"Of course we did not talk about debt haircuts, you know our view and that has not changed, nor should it.\"</p><p>Greece, where the economy shrank at an annual rate of almost 8% in the third quarter, is pressing George Osborne for details of Greek citizens who have moved funds into HSBC accounts in the tax haven of Jersey.</p><p>Greece's finance minister, Yiannis Stournaras, has written to the chancellor after the names of Greek citizens turned up on the list of HSBC account holders. \"We had no idea about their existence and were surprised when their names were included on the list recently made public by HSBC,\" said a senior finance ministry official. \"The minister sent the letter because he wants to get to the bottom of it. Tax evasion is one of our biggest problems.\"</p><p>Germany and France - the two biggest economies in the eurozone - posted modest growth of 0.2% in the third quarter, but this was more than offset by the recession spreading northwards from the countries on the single currency's southern periphery.</p><p>Germany's growth rate has slowed since the start of 2012, when it was expanding at a quarterly rate of 0.5%. France's growth was a surprise to the markets amid fears that it was heading back into recession. The growth followed data revisions which turned a flat economy in the second quarter into a 0.1% contraction.</p><p>As expected, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and Cyprus all saw their economies contract in the third quarter, but the biggest surprise was the sharp 1.1% quarterly fall in Netherlands GDP, which was more than five times as large as the expected 0.2% drop.  Austria posted a 0.1% decline in output.</p><p>Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said: \"The business surveys point to far worse to come throughout the region in the fourth quarter. With austerity starting to hit French households and German unemployment beginning to rise, the outlook for domestic spending is bleak even in the core.\" She expects eurozone GDP to shrink by up to 0.7% this year, and another 2.5% in 2013.</p><p>Economists said the data could prompt the European Central Bank to cut rates from 0.75% to 0.5% sooner rather than later. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"Indeed, an interest rate cut in December is very possible.\"</p><p>Michael Taylor of Lombard Street Research, said: Weak growth in Germany and France in Q3 did not prevent another quarterly fall in real GDP in the euro area as a whole. This tips the EA economy back into recession, where it is likely to stay well into 2013.  Fiscal retrenchment, low confidence levels and a weak economy all point to ongoing contraction in the euro.\"</p><p></p><h2>Dutch decline<br /></h2><p>The big surprise in the eurozone GDP figures was the triple-A rated Netherlands, whose economy shrank by a dramatic 1.1% in the third quarter, far worse than expected, with economists having forecast a fall in output of just 0.2%.</p><p>Business and consumer confidence remain low and economists now warn that the Netherlands faces the prospect of another quarter of decline and its third recession in three years.</p><p>So, what went wrong? First, the Netherlands processes a lot of trade into and out of Europe. Holger Schmieding at Berenberg bank said: \"If we look at the Netherlands as a big harbour, it reacts very sensitively to the gyrations of global trade. Just as London is disproportionately affected by the ups and downs of the global financial market, the Netherlands is disproportionately affected by the ups and downs of trade.\"</p><p>Then there is the stinging Dutch austerity programme. The new coalition government recently announced €16bn of new austerity measures on top of already significant cuts. Economists say the rise in VAT from 19% to 21%, in particular, is punishing already stretched household budgets. Wages fell 1% in real terms last year, while unemployment has been rising since the middle of last year and is at a 15-year high.</p><p>That combined with the ongoing eurozone crisis have battered consumer and business morale, in turn hitting investment. Last quarter's GDP was dragged lower by shrinking investment across the board. Business investment has dropped by almost 6% since the third quarter last year, while government investment shrank by 8.4%.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399438479|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|5400138c86e944e4eb0e2ccf49bc2018f62a8d6f -->",

But he has previously stressed the need for Europeans to \"work a bit harder … work a bit longer\" like Chinese citizens, complaining about \"sloth-inducing\" labour laws.</p><p>Speaking at a forum in Beijing on Friday he repeated his warning that governments had spent unsustainably in the past.</p><p>But he went on to warn that Europe was now seeing social and political unrest across several states.</p><p>\"One commonality is that unions are now involved in organised protests; demonstrations and strikes. It smacks of the solidarity movement witnessed in the 1930s,\" he said.</p><p>\"The general public's tolerance of austerity has been stretched to breaking point.\"</p><p>Jin pointed to the unemployment rates in Spain and Greece and added: \"The worst case could be a complete discarding of austerity programmes. The fact the public are taking to the streets and resorting to violence indicates the general public's tolerance has hit its limits.\"</p><p>He went on: \"The eurozone needs to strike a proper balance between austerity and growth. Austerity without growth is a cul de sac.\"</p><p>Jin also suggested that the European Central Bank should launch further unorthodox measures to help the eurozone, which is now officially in recession.</p><p>\"Monetary easing is considered too radical but we believe it to be a practical move. The crisis is pulling the economy underwater.</p><p>\"People need breathing space. People should be helped to implement austerity programmes.\"</p><p>Jin told the Guardian after his speech: \"European governments should be given some time … If you ask the Greek people to slash their spending by 30-40%, it's not possible. So there should be some tolerance, but the determination to carry on austerity should not be relaxed. It is only the issue of how you can balance one against the other.\"</p><p>CIC is one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds and recently <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/31/china-takes-stake-heathrow\" title=\"\">bought a 10% stake in Heathrow airport</a>.</p><p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/14/eurozone-crisis-general-strikes-protest-day-of-action\" title=\"\">Europe saw its biggest ever protests against austerity</a>. There were general strikes in Spain and Portugal, walkouts in Italy and Greece, and demonstrations in hundreds of cities across the region. Demonstrators clashed with riot police in Milan, and rubber bullets were fired in Madrid and Barcelona.</p><p>• Jin was speaking at a forum organised by business magazine Caixin.
