Snowden, who has reportedly been learning Russian, has been granted asylum for one year.</p> <p><strong>Russia's decision has sparked a diplomatic row, with the White House &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; by the move. </strong>Jay Carney, Obama's press secretary, said the administration had been lobbying &quot;publicly and privately&quot; for Snowden to be returned to the US.</p> <p><strong>&quot;In the end, the law is winning,&quot; Snowden said in comments released by WikiLeaks. </strong><strong>He said the Obama administration had shown &quot;no respect for international or domestic law&quot;.&nbsp;</strong>In a statement Snowden thanked Russia for its decision in his favour.

Paul picked out some key Carney quotes, noting that he made it clear that the US relationship with Russia was on the line.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Carney said: &quot;It is not just a legal matter. There is the matter with our relations with Russia. There is the matter of the release in an unauthorised fashion of classified information and the possible release of more classified information. &quot;</p> <p>He indicated that the US feared Russia would be able to get state secrets from Snowden. &quot;Let's be clear, Mr Snowden has been, since he left the United States, in possession of classified material in China and in Russia. Simply the possession of that kind of highly-sensitive, classified information outside of secure areas is both a huge risk and a violation. He has been in Russia now for many weeks.&quot;</p> <p>Carney said that Obama hopes relations with his counterpart in Russia would not be damaged: &quot;The president expressed a desire that the Snowden matter not cause damage to our relationship with Russia. That is a sentiment that president Putin also expressed and it is one that he [Obama] agreed on with president Putin. That is partly why we are extremely disappointed by this decision by Russian authorities.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51faa1f9e4b0c2a8b3a249fc\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-01T18:59:22.215+01:00\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Amnesty International</strong> has called for the focus to switch from Edward Snowden's asylum plight to the &quot;sweeping nature and unlawfulness&quot; of the US government's surveillance programs.</p> <p>Widney Brown, senior director for international law and policy at Amnesty said in a statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now that Edward Snowden has left the airport and has protected status in Russia, the focus really needs to be on the U.S. government's surveillance programs.&nbsp;Snowden would not have needed temporary asylum but for revealing the sweeping nature and unlawfulness of a massive system of domestic and international surveillance by the United States government.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51fa9925e4b080181c7551b8\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-01T18:21:46.030+01:00\">6.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>&quot;We're very disappointed, extremely disappointed in Russia's decision to provide temporary asylum to Mr Snowden,&quot;</strong> Carney says when asked about President Obama's personal level of disappointment.</p> <p>&quot;We made clear both privately and publicly that there was ample legal justification for his expulsion from Russia and return to the United States, that's a discussion we've had with Russia as well as with other countries that might have been considering providing asylum to Mr Snowden.&quot;</p> <p>The Russian government did not give the Obama administration any advance notice that it was going to grant Snowden asylum, Carney says.

In reality he is learning Russian and ploughing his way through Doystoyevsky. Snowden’s stay in Russia could be indefinite.</p> <p>Among other things, the Snowden story has exposed the impotence of twenty-first century US power. With no US-Russia extradition treaty there is little the White House can do to winkle Snowden out. It can, of course, express displeasure. Obama is likely to cancel a trip in September to Saint Petersburg for Russia’s forthcoming G20 summit.</p> <p>The irony, as Senator John McCain was quick to point out, is that Moscow’s record on human rights and freedom of speech is far worse than Washington’s. While Snowden was stuck at the airport, the opposition leader Alexei Navalny got five years in jail. (Navalny was promptly bailed following his provincial show trial, apparently amid Kremlin in-fighting.)</p> <p>Since returning for a third time as president, Putin has moved to crush mass protests against his rule. They began in late 2011-2012. He has introduced a series of repressive new laws against human rights organisations, selectively arrested leading critics, and jailed the feminist punk combo Pussy Riot.</p> <p>Russia’s treatment of its own whistle-blowers, meanwhile, is grim and awful. (Think Anna Politkovskaya, shot dead in Moscow in 2006, or Natalia Estemirova, kidnapped in Chechnya’s capital Grozny in 2009 and murdered.) Last month (July 11) Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who exposed massive interior ministry fraud, was himself convicted of crimes. Magnitsky was an unusual defendant: he was already dead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Luke has plenty of experience of the intricacies of being allowed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/07/guardian-moscow-correspondent-expelled-from-russia\">or not being allowed</a>, into Russia.

He said that he had passed documents confirming this status from the migration service to Snowden, who left the airport for a “safe place&quot;.</p> <p>“This is a certificate that gives him the right to temporary asylum on the territory of the Russian Federation,” Kucherena said, holding up a copy of the document.</p> <p>A security official said Snowden had crossed the border at about 3.30pm, and a source at the airport confirmed he had left the airport, state news agency RIA Novosti reported.</p> <p>According to Kucherena, the whistleblower left the airport alone in an ordinary taxi. He declined to provide details on where Snowden was located, citing safety concerns.</p> <p>“Since he is the most hunted person in the world, he will address the question of security today,” Kucherena told journalists.</p> <p>The former National Security Agency employee will himself choose his place of residence and forms of protection.</p> <p>Although Snowden had originally said he intended to eventually move on to South America, more recently he had indicated that he wants to stay in Russia for the long term. Kucherena has previously said Snowden had been reading classic Russian literature and learning the language. In an interview today with Rossiya 24 television, he said Snowden had “no plans” to leave Russia for another country.</p> <p>The whistleblower's father Lon Snowden had reportedly been planning to visit his son, and Kucherena said yesterday that he was sending an invitation to the elder Snowden so he could obtain a Russian visa. Kucherena told Rossiya 24 television Thursday that he would be speaking to Lon Snowden later that day to arrange his visit.</p> <p>WikiLeaks announced that Snowden would make a statement Thursday about whistleblower Bradley Manning, who was found guilty of espionage Wednesday.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51fa655ce4b0d4c01459e0b5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-01T14:40:44.786+01:00\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Is this Snowden?</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/patrickgjackson/statuses/362930684454641664\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>RT AFP's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mashant\">@mashant</a> Picture of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Snowden&amp;src=hash\">#Snowden</a> leaving the airport today <a href=\"http://t.co/r4wPOOXc3f\">pic.twitter.com/r4wPOOXc3f</a></p>— Patrick Jackson (@patrickgjackson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickgjackson/statuses/362930684454641664\">August 1, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51fa64eee4b02ecb2cd8936a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-01T14:38:54.731+01:00\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Television channel Rossiya 24 displayed a photo showing the back of a blonde man in a light blue shirt, apparently Snowden, speaking to Kucherena next to an unmarked car in the airport loading area, reports&nbsp;<strong>Alec Luhn</strong> in Moscow.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-01T15:08:09.106+01:00\">at 3.08pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-51fa646ae4b02ecb2cd89369\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-01T14:36:43.158+01:00\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>US senator John McCain, who ran for president against Barack Obama in 2008, has tweeted to point out – as many have done – an apparent contradiction between Snowden's ideals and the actions of the Russian government.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/statuses/362924248077049858\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Snowden stays in the land of transparency and human rights.

        "body":"<p><strong>Age: </strong>Launched in October 2006.</p><p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Almost <a href=\"http://vk.com/\" title=\"\">identical</a> to Facebook.</p><p><strong>What does VK stand for? </strong>It's short for VKontakte. Which is Russian for \"in contact\".</p><p><strong>And what is VK? </strong>Russia's biggest social network.</p><p><strong>How big are we talking here? </strong>Big. The site has an estimated 46 million users a day and around 220 million accounts.</p><p><strong>That is big. Where did it come from?</strong> From Russia's answer to Mark Zuckerberg, young entrepreneur <a href=\"http://www.arcticstartup.com/2011/07/18/the-story-and-plans-of-vkontakte-told-by-founder-and-ceo\" title=\"\">Pavel Durov</a>. He set up VKontakte after leaving university, aged 21.</p><p><strong>And what has he done now? </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/edward-snowden-asylum-us-disappointed\" title=\"\">Offered Edward Snowden a job.</a></p><p><strong>The NSA whistleblower? </strong>Yes, that Edward Snowden. The one who revealed to the world that the NSA have access to users' data from every major social networking site – including VK's global rival Facebook.</p><p><strong>Is he looking for work then? </strong>He may be. He has just been granted one year's temporary asylum in Russia. So he might be up for finding something to fill his days.</p><p><strong>What's the job? </strong>Durov wants him to help VK with their data protection measures. He announced on his profile: \"We invite Edward Snowden to Petersburg and will be happy if he decides to join the star team of programmers at VKontakte.\"</p><p><strong>Is Snowden likely to accept? </strong>Probably not. VK has come under pressure from the Russian government after Durov's refusal to block opposition groups from the site in 2011.</p><p><strong>What pressure? </strong>The site was later \"accidentally\" black-listed by the Russian media regulator – a move one analyst described as a warning to be \"more compliant\". And, since then, VK's offices and Durov's home have been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22186258\" title=\"\">raided by Russian police</a>, Durov has disappeared into hiding, and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-25/fish-tie-kremlin-to-new-owner-of-facebook-s-russian-rival.html\" title=\"\">a private equity firm with close ties to the Kremlin</a> has bought a 48% stake in the company.</p><p><strong>Meaning? </strong>Meaning VK may now be under closer scrutiny by its own government than before.</p><p><strong>So it really is almost identical to Facebook then? </strong>Pretty much.</p><p><strong>Do say: </strong>\"Sounds like the ideal job for a world-famous whistleblower.\"</p><p><strong>Don't say: </strong>\"It's as if we can't even trust the Russian government any more.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414223056|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|f9c14ece14f0f2434a554afe67cf9ae64adaff81 -->",

        "headline":"Edward Snowden asylum case is a gift for Vladimir Putin",
        "body":"<p>For the past four years the Obama administration has tried hard to \"reset\" relations with Russia. The idea wasn't a bad one. A more co-operative Kremlin might help the White House with its pressing international problems – the war in Syria, the US military draw-down in Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme.</p><p>On Thursday, however, bilateral relations appeared anything but reset as Edward Snowden – dressed in his trademark grey shirt and carrying a dark backpack – strolled out of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. He had been holed up there for five and a half weeks, ever since he slipped out of Hong Kong. Now he was free.</p><p>Vladimir Putin's decision to grant Snowden asylum – and make no mistake, Putin called this one – is a humiliating, wounding rebuff to the US. In theory Snowden has been allowed to stay for one year. In reality he is learning Russian and ploughing his way through Dostoyevsky. Snowden's stay in Russia could be indefinite.</p><p>Among other things, the Snowden story has exposed the impotence of 21st-century US power. With no US-Russia extradition treaty there is little the White House can do to winkle Snowden out. It can, of course, express displeasure. Obama is likely to cancel a trip to St Petersburg for the G20 summit in September.</p><p>The irony, as Senator John McCain was quick to point out, is that Moscow's record on human rights and freedom of speech is far worse than Washington's. While Snowden was stuck at the airport the opposition leader Alexei Navalny got five years in jail. (Navalny was promptly bailed following his provincial show trial, apparently amid Kremlin in-fighting.)</p><p>Since returning for a third term as president, Putin has moved to crush mass protests against his rule. He has introduced a series of repressive laws against human rights organisations, selectively arrested leading critics and jailed the feminist punk band Pussy Riot.</p><p>Russia's treatment of its own whistleblowers is grim and awful. Think Anna Politkovskaya, shot dead in Moscow in 2006, or Natalia Estemirova, kidnapped in Chechnya's capital, Grozny, in 2009 and murdered. Last month Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who exposed massive fraud at the interior ministry, was convicted of tax evasion. Magnitsky was an unusual defendant: he was already dead.</p><p>All of this provides ammunition to Snowden's critics. They seek to portray him not as a heroic information activist but as a traitor and a spy. They point out, correctly, that Russia's surveillance state is nasty and intrusive. The FSB, the ubiquitous successor to the KGB, has more extensive secret powers than the NSA. It can snoop on anyone, and frequently does.</p><p>Ultimately, though, the US has only itself to blame for this cold war-style mess. You can hardly fault Snowden for wanting to avoid the fate of Bradley Manning, who following his conviction this week for espionage faces 136 years in jail. The US has taken a vengeful attitude towards those who leak classified information. It cancelled Snowden's passport. It (wrongly) forced down the plane of Bolivia's president. Snowden wasn't exactly left with options.</p><p>For Putin, meanwhile, Snowden is a wonderful gift. By granting the American asylum he can pose as the champion of human rights in the face of US aggression. Russia's president is already a master of \"whataboutism\" – indeed, it is practically a national ideology. (Whenever visiting western heads of state complain of Russia's alleged democratic failings, Putin points to their own record with the words: \"What about …\")</p><p>On the face of it Snowden's situation appears rosy, though as his lawyer admitted on Thursday that Snowden missed his girlfriend. Over time his position may seem less alluring. Russia's spy agencies will keep a close and unfaltering watch over their new guest, not just now but in the years and decades to come.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414159269|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|f0f571dfd108601b0407d40e6e9fcd616e2883c0 -->",

        "body":"<p>By the time he was granted temporary asylum in Russia and left Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Thursday, the National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden had spent 40 days in the confines of the airport's transit zone.</p><p>According to his lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden kept himself busy by reading Russian literature and history and learning the Russian alphabet.</p><p>The circumstances of his stay in Sheremetyevo were similar to \"house arrest, only not at home\", said Kucherena, who noted the psychological pressures of remaining confined indoors in a legal no man's land.</p><p>\"I wouldn't have held out for 24 hours with him in the airport,\" he said. \"What is the transit zone? It's a sterile zone. There are constant loudspeaker announcements every day – a flight from Washington has arrived, a flight from London has arrived, a flight from Barcelona has arrived. I heard them for hours when I was there. If a person is there indefinitely it can drive him to psychosis.\"</p><p>Kucherena began helping Snowden to seek temporary asylum in Russia after a meeting between the whistleblower and government and human rights officials on 12 July, and he became Snowden's only human connection with the outside world.</p><p>He went to the airport several times a week, taken each time by bus from the departures area to a room where Snowden had no bodyguards or minders. Snowden had arrived with almost no luggage, so the lawyer brought him new shirts and a new pair of shoes, as well as books. The American had little to do besides surf the internet and read.</p><p>Kucherena said he selected a number of classic books to help Snowden understand the mentality of the Russian people: Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, a collection of stories by Anton Chekhov, and writings by the historian Nikolai Karamzin. Snowden quickly finished Crime and Punishment. After reading selections from Karamzin, a 19th-century writer who penned the first comprehensive history of the Russian state, he asked for the author's complete works. Kucherena also gave Snowden an alphabet book to help him to start learning Russian.</p><p>Snowden was not able to go outside – \"he breathes disgusting air, the air of the airport,\" Kucherena said – but nevertheless remained in good health and told his lawyer he had \"been in worse circumstances\". Nonetheless, the psychological pressures of the waiting game took its toll.</p><p>\"It's hard for him, when he's always in a state of expectation,\" Kucherena said. \"On the inside, Edward is absolutely independent, he absolutely follows his convictions. As for the reaction, he is convinced and genuinely believes he did it first of all so that Americans and all people would find out that they are spying on us.\"</p><p>After appearing on a Russian news show via video link with Snowden's father, Lon, Kucherena has been helping the elder Snowden obtain a visa to visit his son in Russia. Kucherena said he spoke with Lon Snowden after the show to discuss the logistics of a trip, which the lawyer said should be possible to arrange despite there being \"some sort of game with the FBI that is not legal\".</p><p>\"It's visible that he worries about his son, which is important,\" Kucherena said. \"He's proud that his son grew up to be such a person … He understands what a burden his son is bearing now, the pressure on him.</p><p>\"He asked me to say hi to Edward and give him a hug. He wants to see him,\" he added.</p><p>Snowden has reportedly spoken with his father only through intermediaries. Kucherena said he did not know whether the whistleblower was in touch with other families or friends, or with his girlfriend.</p><p>People had been writing from all over Russia offering Snowden lodging, protection and money, Kucherena said. \"I was surprised there was so much activity on the part of Russians and such concern about him,\" he said.</p><p>The lawyer denied that he or Snowden had had any contact with foreign governments, or that he had spoken with the Kremlin about Snowden's asylum. \"I don't need to talk to high-ranking officials,\" Kucherena said. \"I don't want to engage in big politics. [Law] is my trade.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414162542|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|cc30e7001346e69ce27722f6c67560b3648afb9a -->",

These lines came from the chapter \"<a href=\"http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/OnWar1873/BK1ch06.html\">Information in War</a>\", a topic that resonates today, from Fort Meade, Maryland, where Bradley Manning has just been convicted of espionage in a military court, to the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has lived for more than a year, having been granted political asylum to avoid political persecution by the United States, to Russia, where National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden has been granted temporary aslyum.</p><p>Manning's conviction sparked momentary interest among members of the elite media in the US, who spent scant time at the two-month court-martial, located just miles north of Washington DC, Manning's supporters expressed relief that he was found not guilty of the most serious charge, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/30/bradley-manning-wikileaks-judge-verdict\">aiding the enemy</a>, which would likely have carried a sentence of life in prison. He was convicted on 20 of 22 charges, and could face up to 136 years in prison. The sentencing hearing is underway.</p><p>\"Bradley Manning's alleged disclosures have exposed war crimes, sparked revolutions and induced democratic reforms,\" <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130730/wikileaks-expects-manning-appeal-dangerous-verdict\">Assange said</a> from the embassy. \"He is the quintessential whistle-blower.\" Interestingly, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/world/asia/17gates.html?_r=0\">wrote about the leaks</a> to Senator Carl Levin in 2010, saying, </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The review to date has not revealed any sensitive intelligence sources and methods compromised by this disclosure.</p></blockquote><p>Manning made a statement at the start of the court-martial, wherein he took responsibility for the leaks, but, importantly, expressed his motivation. He commented specifically on the Apache attack helicopter video that recorded the slaughter of a dozen civilians in Baghdad on 12 July 2007. Two of those killed worked for the Reuters news agency, cameraman <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namir_Noor-Eldeen‎\">Namir Noor-Eldeen</a>, 22, and his driver, <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Chmagh‎\">Saeed Chmagh</a>, a father of four.<br />  <br />We can listen to Manning in his own words, thanks to an unauthorized audio recording of his statement, anonymously leaked. <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/manning-tell-judge-about-wikileaks-disclosures\">He said</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The most alarming aspect of the video to me was the seeming delightful blood-lust the aerial weapons team happened to have. They dehumanized the individuals they were engaging and seemed to not value human life, and referred to them as quote-unquote 'dead bastards,' and congratulated each other on their ability to kill in large numbers. ... For me, this seemed similar to a child torturing ants with a magnifying glass.</p></blockquote><p><br />One of the charges for which Manning was found guilty was \"wanton publication\". It's unprecedented in military law. Manning's lawyer called it a made-up offense. The real offense, for which no one has been charged, is the wanton disregard for human life that Manning exposed.</p><p>Manning's leak gave Reuters, and the world, a graphic view of the horror of modern war, of the violent death of two media workers in the line of duty. <br />  <br />As the young soldier also said in <a href=\"http://www.bradleymanning.org/learn-more/in-his-own-words\">his eloquent statement</a>, \"I believed that if the general public, especially the American public, had access to the information contained [in the leaks], it could spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general as it related to Iraq and Afghanistan.\"</p><p>Indeed, he did spark such a debate. The latest wave of disclosures, from Edward Snowden, has only intensified the debate, with a rare bipartisan coalition in Congress growing to clamp down on what many see as a runaway national-security state. Although a legislative amendment by Republican Justin Amash and Democrat John Conyers in the US House of Representatives was narrowly defeated last week, the two have authored a stand-alone bill, <a href=\"http://amash.house.gov/press-release/nsa-surveillance-amash-conyers-introduce-major-bill\">HR 2399</a>, that will do the same.<br />  <br />Carl von Clausewitz wrote, \"The great uncertainty of all data in war is a peculiar difficulty, because all action must, to a certain extent, be planned in a mere twilight.\" Manning took incredibly courageous actions to release data, to pierce the fog of war, to make public the machinations of modern American war-making. Edward Snowden has exposed the sophistication and extraordinary reach of the US surveillance state, cracking down on those who would dare to release information. And Julian Assange sits within the four walls of his embassy redoubt, persecuted for the crime of publishing. Yet those who planned the wars, those who committed war crimes, those who conduct illegal spying, for now, walk free.</p><p>• Denis Moynihan contributed research to this column</p><p>© 2013 Amy Goodman; distributed by King Features Syndicate</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414159093|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d11d89cd79d34e6f97b088adfe5513577c080af9 -->",

        "body":"<p>The NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has been granted temporary asylum in Russia and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/edward-snowden-leaves-moscow-airport-live\" title=\"\">has left the Moscow airport where he had stayed for over a month</a>, his lawyer said on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Anatoly Kucherena told journalists at Sheremetyevo airport that Russia's Federal Migration Service had granted Snowden temporary asylum for one year. The lawyer said that he had passed documents confirming this status from the migration service to Snowden, who left the airport for a \"safe place\".</p><p>\"This is a certificate that gives him the right to temporary asylum on the territory of the Russian federation,\" Kucherena said, holding up a copy of the document.</p><p>A security official said Snowden had crossed the border into Russia at about 3.30pm local time, and a source at the airport confirmed the American had left, the state news agency RIA Novosti reported.</p><p>Snowden has been sought by US authorities since he began leaking documents revealing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">extensive secret surveillance programmes</a> conducted by the National Security Agency and others. He remained in the airport transit zone for more than a month after the US annulled his American passport while he was flying from Hong Kong on 23 June. Arguing that the US was preventing him from travelling on to South America, where three countries had said they were willing to grant him asylum, Snowden applied for temporary asylum in Russia on 16 July.</p><p>According to Kucherena, the whistleblower left the airport alone in an ordinary taxi. The lawyer declined to provide details on where Snowden was heading, citing safety concerns.</p><p>\"Since he is the most hunted person in the world, he will address the question of security today,\" he told journalists.</p><p>The former NSA employee will himself choose his place of residence and forms of protection. Although Snowden had originally said he intended to eventually move on to South America, more recently he had indicated that he wants to stay in Russia for the long term. Kucherena previously said Snowden has been reading classic Russian literature and learning the language. In an interview on Thursday with Rossiya 24, a Russian television channel, he said Snowden had no plans to leave Russia for another country.</p><p>Previously, some speculated that the Russian government was keeping Snowden hidden, although the whistleblower and his lawyer have denied that, adding that he has had no contact with Russian security services.</p><p>The whistleblower's father, Lon Snowden, had reportedly been planning to visit his son. Kucherena said on Wednesday that he was sending an invitation to Snowden's father so he could obtain a Russian visa. Kucherena told Rossiya 24 on Thursday that he would be speaking to Lon Snowden later that day to arrange his visit.</p><p>US authorities have repeatedly called on Moscow to return the fugitive to face charges in America. Last week America's attorney general, Eric Holder, sent a letter to Russia's justice minister promising that Snowden would not be tortured and that he would not face the death penalty if handed over to the US.</p><p>Russian officials previously said they had no jurisdiction to return Snowden, as he was not officially located on Russian territory, and that the US had not filed an official extradition request.</p><p>WikiLeaks announced that Snowden would make a statement on Thursday about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/bradley-manning-sentencing-hearing-pentagon\" title=\"\">the whistleblower Bradley Manning, who was found guilty of espionage</a> on Wednesday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414143463|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|136a7d3e6473f576febee235a301c568e1d975ae -->",

Snowden, who has reportedly been learning Russian, has been granted asylum for one year.</p> <p><strong>Russia's decision has sparked a diplomatic row, with the White House &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; by the move. </strong>Jay Carney, Obama's press secretary, said the administration had been lobbying &quot;publicly and privately&quot; for Snowden to be returned to the US.</p> <p><strong>&quot;In the end, the law is winning,&quot; Snowden said in comments released by WikiLeaks. </strong><strong>He said the Obama administration had shown &quot;no respect for international or domestic law&quot;.&nbsp;</strong>In a statement Snowden thanked Russia for its decision in his favour. He will be free to travel around Russia during his year-long stay.</p> <p>That's it for now. <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/edward-snowden-asylum-us-disappointed\">You can read the Guardian's main news stories on today's developments here.</a></strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51faaa51e4b09fe7db8e243e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-01T19:34:58.022+01:00\">7.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Paul Lewis, </strong>the Guardian's DC correspondent, writes that the White House briefing was dominated by questions about Edward Snowden and the ongoing fallout over leaks about US surveillance tactics. Paul picked out some key Carney quotes, noting that he made it clear that the US relationship with Russia was on the line.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Carney said: &quot;It is not just a legal matter. There is the matter with our relations with Russia. There is the matter of the release in an unauthorised fashion of classified information and the possible release of more classified information. &quot;</p> <p>He indicated that the US feared Russia would be able to get state secrets from Snowden. &quot;Let's be clear, Mr Snowden has been, since he left the United States, in possession of classified material in China and in Russia. Simply the possession of that kind of highly-sensitive, classified information outside of secure areas is both a huge risk and a violation. He has been in Russia now for many weeks.&quot;</p> <p>Carney said that Obama hopes relations with his counterpart in Russia would not be damaged: &quot;The president expressed a desire that the Snowden matter not cause damage to our relationship with Russia. That is a sentiment that president Putin also expressed and it is one that he [Obama] agreed on with president Putin. That is partly why we are extremely disappointed by this decision by Russian authorities.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51faa1f9e4b0c2a8b3a249fc\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-01T18:59:22.215+01:00\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Amnesty International</strong> has called for the focus to switch from Edward Snowden's asylum plight to the &quot;sweeping nature and unlawfulness&quot; of the US government's surveillance programs.</p> <p>Widney Brown, senior director for international law and policy at Amnesty said in a statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now that Edward Snowden has left the airport and has protected status in Russia, the focus really needs to be on the U.S. government's surveillance programs.&nbsp;Snowden would not have needed temporary asylum but for revealing the sweeping nature and unlawfulness of a massive system of domestic and international surveillance by the United States government.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51fa9925e4b080181c7551b8\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-01T18:21:46.030+01:00\">6.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>&quot;We're very disappointed, extremely disappointed in Russia's decision to provide temporary asylum to Mr Snowden,&quot;</strong> Carney says when asked about President Obama's personal level of disappointment.</p> <p>&quot;We made clear both privately and publicly that there was ample legal justification for his expulsion from Russia and return to the United States, that's a discussion we've had with Russia as well as with other countries that might have been considering providing asylum to Mr Snowden.&quot;</p> <p>The Russian government did not give the Obama administration any advance notice that it was going to grant Snowden asylum, Carney says. He touches on the concern the US has over Snowden still being in possession of sensitive material:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let's be clear Mr Snowden has been, since he left the United States, in possession of classified material in China and in Russia.

In reality he is learning Russian and ploughing his way through Doystoyevsky. Snowden’s stay in Russia could be indefinite.</p> <p>Among other things, the Snowden story has exposed the impotence of twenty-first century US power. With no US-Russia extradition treaty there is little the White House can do to winkle Snowden out. It can, of course, express displeasure. Obama is likely to cancel a trip in September to Saint Petersburg for Russia’s forthcoming G20 summit.</p> <p>The irony, as Senator John McCain was quick to point out, is that Moscow’s record on human rights and freedom of speech is far worse than Washington’s. While Snowden was stuck at the airport, the opposition leader Alexei Navalny got five years in jail. (Navalny was promptly bailed following his provincial show trial, apparently amid Kremlin in-fighting.)</p> <p>Since returning for a third time as president, Putin has moved to crush mass protests against his rule. They began in late 2011-2012. He has introduced a series of repressive new laws against human rights organisations, selectively arrested leading critics, and jailed the feminist punk combo Pussy Riot.</p> <p>Russia’s treatment of its own whistle-blowers, meanwhile, is grim and awful. (Think Anna Politkovskaya, shot dead in Moscow in 2006, or Natalia Estemirova, kidnapped in Chechnya’s capital Grozny in 2009 and murdered.) Last month (July 11) Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who exposed massive interior ministry fraud, was himself convicted of crimes. Magnitsky was an unusual defendant: he was already dead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Luke has plenty of experience of the intricacies of being allowed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/07/guardian-moscow-correspondent-expelled-from-russia\">or not being allowed</a>, into Russia.

        "body":"<p>The United States may boycott a planned summit with president Vladimir Putin next month in protest at Russia's decision to grant whistleblower Edward Snowden asylum.</p><p>The White House said it was \"extremely disappointed\" at the decision to give Snowden sanctuary in Russia, adding that a high-profile meeting between Barack Obama and Putin, scheduled for next month, was now being reconsidered.</p><p>\"It is not just a legal matter,\" said Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney. \"There is the matter with our relations with Russia.\"</p><p>\"We are extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful requests in public and private that Mr Snowden be expelled and returned to the United States,\" Carney said. \"This move by the Russian government undermines a long-standing record of law enforcement co-operation.\"</p><p>The decision to grant Snowden asylum threatens to cause a diplomatic rift between the US and Russia, undoing recent attempts to heal relations.</p><p>Obama was scheduled to travel to Russia in September for at meeting of G20 leaders in St Petersburg. He also planned to meet with Putin for a bilateral summit during the trip in what would have been a sign of improving relations between the two powers. </p><p>However, that meeting is now under review. \"Obviously this is not a positive development,\" Carney said. \"We have a wide range of interests with the Russians. We are evaluating the utility of the summit.\"</p><p>At previous White House briefings, Carney had consistently said that, despite the controversy over Snowden, Obama still \"intended\" to meet the Russian president.</p><p>Snowden slipped out of Sheremetyevo airport on Thursday afternoon. His lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, said Russia's federal migration service had granted him temporary asylum for one year.</p><p>Carney said that the US had not been given \"any advance notice\" of the decision by Russia. He also hinted at concerns that Russia would be able to access state secrets held by the former NSA contractor.</p><p>\"Let's be clear, Mr Snowden has been, since he left the United States, in possession of classified material in China and in Russia. Simply the possession of that kind of highly sensitive, classified information outside of secure areas is both a huge risk and a violation. He has been in Russia now for many weeks.\"</p><p>Carney repeated the position of the Obama administration that Snowden is not a whistleblower. \"He is accused of leaking classified information and has been charged with three felony accounts.\"</p><p>However, reporters pressed the spokesman on the Obama administration's continued insistence that Snowden is not a whistleblower. </p><p>In the wake of the scandal sparked by Snowden's leaks, some members of Congress  have expressed concerns over the breadth of US surveillance capabilities.</p><p>Less than 30 minutes after the White House briefing, which which was almost completely dominated by Snowden and the fallout over his leaks, Obama was scheduled to meet with congressmen to discuss NSA surveillance tactics.</p><p>Carney said that some of those at the meeting were critics of the administration and said Obama wanted to to hear their \"concerns and issues\".</p><p>Asked by a journalist whether Snowden had actually done the US \"a favour\", Carney said unauthorised leaking had done \"enormous damage\" to US interests. He said: \"When you take an oath to protect the secrets of the US, you are bound to protect them, and there are consequences if you don't.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414172446|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|170d8fc79a611c872a5e41182da49c7713408754 -->",

        "trailText":"<p>White House says Moscow should hand back whistleblower and hints Barack Obama might boycott Vladimir Putin meeting</p>",
        "headline":"Edward Snowden asylum: US 'disappointed' by Russian decision",
        "body":"<p>The White House expressed anger and dismay on Thursday after Russia granted temporary asylum to the American whistleblower Edward Snowden and allowed him to leave the Moscow airport where he had been holed up for over a month.</p><p>White House spokesman Jay Carney said the US was \"extremely disappointed\" by the decision, almost certainly taken personally by President Vladimir Putin. He said Moscow should hand Snowden back and hinted that Barack Obama might now boycott a bilateral meeting with Putin in September, due to be held when the US president travels to Russia for a G20 summit.</p><p>Carney added that Snowden had arrived in both China and Russia carrying with him thousands of top secret US documents. He said: \"Simply the possession of that kind of highly sensitive classified information outside of secure areas is both a huge risk and a violation.</p><p>\"As we know he's been in Russia now for many weeks. There is a huge risk associated with … removing that information from secure areas. You shouldn't do it, you can't do it, it's wrong.\"</p><p>With US-Russian relations now at a cold war-style low, Snowden slipped out of Sheremetyevo airport on Thursday  afternoon. His lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, said Russia's federal migration service had granted him temporary asylum for one year. Snowden had left the airport to stay at an undisclosed location with expatriate Americans, he added.</p><p>Putin made no immediate comment. But having weighed Russia's options for some weeks, he appears to have decided that Snowden's propaganda value outweighs any possible US repercussions. Obama's already floundering attempts to \"reset\", or improve, relations with Moscow are in effect over.</p><p>In a statement released by WikiLeaks, Snowden thanked the Russian authorities and accused the US of behaving illegally. He made no explicit mention of the trial of Bradley Manning, who this week was convicted of espionage and faces 136 years in jail.</p><p>Snowden said: \"Over the past eight weeks we have seen the Obama administration show no respect for international or domestic law, but in the end the law is winning.\"</p><p>He added: \"I thank the Russian Federation for granting me asylum in accordance with its laws and international obligations.\"</p><p>Snowden has been given a temporary Russian travel document, with his name in Cyrillic and a fresh passport photo. \"This gave him the right to temporary asylum on the territory of the Russian Federation, Kucherena said, holding up a copy of the document. US authorities had cancelled his American passport.</p><p>Security officials said Snowden officially crossed the border into Russia from the airport's transit zone at about 3.30pm local time. Russia had apparently not informed the US of the move in advance. The state TV channel Rossiya 24 showed a photograph of Snowden's departure, as he clambered into a grey unmarked car.</p><p>Despite being pictured from behind Snowden was instantly recognisable wearing his trademark grey shirt and carrying a black backpack. Next to him was Sarah Harrison, the WikiLeaks representative who accompanied him last month on his flight from Hong Kong.</p><p>Kucherena declined to provide details on where Snowden was heading, citing safety concerns. \"Since he is the most hunted person in the world, he will address the question of security today,\" he told journalists.</p><p>The former NSA employee will himself choose his place of residence and forms of protection, he added. Previously, some speculated that the Russian government was keeping Snowden hidden, although the whistleblower and his lawyer have denied that, adding that he has had no contact with Russian security services.</p><p>The whistleblower's father, Lon Snowden, had reportedly been planning to visit his son. Kucherena said on Wednesday that he was sending an invitation to Snowden's father so he could obtain a Russian visa. Kucherena told Rossiya 24 on Thursday that he would be speaking to the father later in the day to arrange his visit.</p><p>US authorities have repeatedly called on Moscow to return the fugitive to face charges in America. Last week America's attorney general, Eric Holder, sent a letter to Russia's justice minister promising that Snowden would not be tortured and that he would not face the death penalty if handed over to the US.</p><p>Russian officials previously said they had no jurisdiction to return Snowden, as he was not officially located on Russian territory, and that the US had not filed an official extradition request.</p><p>The Kremlin did not immediately comment on Snowden's temporary asylum. Putin has previously said repeatedly that to remain in Russia, Snowden must stop activities harming the United States. His lawyer suggested that fresh revelations published by the Guardian on Wednesday and Thursday had come from documents that Snowden had already given the paper before Putin made his comments.</p><p>Russia's decision has emboldened hawkish critics of the White House, who have long dubbed Obama's attempts to improve relations with Putin as naive and inappropriate. In a statement on his website, Senator John McCain said: \"Russia's action today is a disgrace and a deliberate effort to embarrass the United States. It is a slap in the face of all Americans. Now is the time to fundamentally rethink our relationship with Putin's Russia.\"</p><p>He proposed in response to expand the Magnitsky Act list of banned Russian officials, push for Georgia's acceptance into Nato and implement US missile defence programmes in Europe.</p><p>At the White House, Carney made it clear that President Obama was frustrated by the decision by Russia to allow Snowden to enter the country, and that a planned presidential summit was now in jeopardy.</p><p>Obama is scheduled to travel to Russia in September for at meeting of G20 leaders in St Petersburg. He also planned to meet Putin for a bilateral summit during the trip in what would have been a sign of improving relations between the two powers.</p><p>That meeting is now under review. \"Obviously this is not a positive development,\" Carney said. \"We have a wide range of interests with the Russians. We are evaluating the utility of the summit.\"</p><p>Amnesty International called for the focus to switch from Snowden's asylum plight to the \"sweeping nature and unlawfulness\" of the US government's surveillance programmes.</p><p>Widney Brown, senior director for international law and policy at Amnesty, said in a statement: \"Now that Edward Snowden has left the airport and has protected status in Russia, the focus really needs to be on the US government's surveillance programs. Snowden would not have needed temporary asylum but for revealing the sweeping nature and unlawfulness of a massive system of domestic and international surveillance by the United States government.\"</p><p>A survey showed that 43% of Russians supported granting Snowden asylum and 51% approved of his whistleblowing activities. Kucherena said he had received numerous letters from Russians offering Snowden lodging, protection and money, as well as from women interested in Snowden romantically.</p><p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Russia's most popular social network, VKontakte, invited Snowden to come work as a programmer at the network, in a post on his VKontakte page on Thursday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414168884|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|efb8ffd65c51394a61c6d2f37b2f8391964190af -->",

        "body":"<p>Russian human rights activists welcomed the decision to give temporary asylum to National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden on Thursday, but pointed out that Moscow was unlikely to look kindly on local whistleblowers who leaked its secrets.</p><p></p><p>Sergei Nikitin, the head of Amnesty International Russia, pointed out that Russia was not usually a staunch defender of transparency. Asked what would happen to a whistleblower who exposed Russian secrets, Nikitin said that he or she would likely be persecuted by the state.</p><p>\"We could probably expect a diametrically opposed reaction by the countries that participated in this,\" he said.</p><p>Like the NSA in the United States, Russian security services reportedly have far-reaching abilities to monitor telephone and internet communications in their own country through a program known by its Russian acronym SORM.</p><p>\"It should be noted that the Russian Federation is a country that human rights organisations have found to be a serious violator of human rights including the right to express information,\" Nikitin said. \"Human rights are international and to give these rights only to certain people is not fair.\"</p><p>Former Pussy Riot lawyer Mark Feigin questioned whether Snowden would be safe in Russia. \"Snowden doesn't fully understand that accepting asylum in Russia is about the same as agreeing to receive an inheritance from a lawyer in Nigeria by email,\" Feigin tweeted Thursday.</p><p>Nikitin and Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch have criticised president Vladimir Putin's statements that Snowden must stop harming the United States if he wants to stay in Russia. The right to asylum should not be tied to political concerns, they have said.</p><p>Boris Ratnikov, a former major-general of the Federal Guard Service, told the newspaper Izvestiya that the whistleblower remained in limbo. \"If there was a firm decision to defend Snowden, they would have given him citizenship. One-year temporary asylum is 'he's neither ours nor yours',\" he said.</p><p>A mid-July poll found that 51% of Russians approved of Snowden's whistleblowing activities and 43% supported granting him asylum in the country.</p><p>Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena has been receiving letters and calls in support of his client following the asylum approval. \"Many people in Russia hope that he will quickly adapt to life here and support him,\" Kucherena said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414248375|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|ba6afa28ae18bc82554efe6e455338b91d5ec191 -->",
