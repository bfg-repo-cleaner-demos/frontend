        "body":"<p>The National Security Agency is storing the online metadata of millions of internet users for up to a year, regardless of whether or not they are persons of interest to the agency, top secret documents reveal.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/interactive/2013/jun/12/what-is-metadata-nsa-surveillance\">Metadata provides a record of almost anything a user does online</a>, from browsing history – such as map searches and websites visited – to account details, email activity, and even some account passwords. This can be used to build a detailed picture of an individual's life.</p><p>The Obama administration has repeatedly stated that the NSA keeps only the content of messages and communications of people it is intentionally targeting – but internal documents reveal the agency retains vast amounts of metadata.</p><p>An introductory guide to digital network intelligence for NSA field agents, included in documents disclosed by former contractor Edward Snowden, describes the agency's metadata repository, codenamed Marina. Any computer metadata picked up by NSA collection systems is routed to the Marina database, the guide explains. Phone metadata is sent to a separate system.</p><p>\"The Marina metadata application tracks a user's browser experience, gathers contact information/content and develops summaries of target,\" the analysts' guide explains. \"This tool offers the ability to export the data in a variety of formats, as well as create various charts to assist in pattern-of-life development.\"</p><p>The guide goes on to explain Marina's unique capability: \"Of the more distinguishing features, Marina has the ability to look back on the last 365 days' worth of DNI metadata seen by the Sigint collection system, <strong>regardless</strong> whether or not it was tasked for collection.\" [Emphasis in original.]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html\">On Saturday, the New York Times reported</a> that the NSA was using its metadata troves to build profiles of US citizens' social connections, associations and in some cases location, augmenting the material the agency collects with additional information bought in from the commercial sector, which is is not subject to the same legal restrictions as other data.</p><p>The ability to look back on a full year's history for any individual whose data was collected – either deliberately or incidentally – offers the NSA the potential to find information on people who have later become targets. But it relies on storing the personal data of large numbers of internet users who are not, and never will be, of interest to the US intelligence community.</p><p>Marina aggregates NSA metadata from an array of sources, some targeted, others on a large scale. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">Programs such as Prism</a> – which operates through legally compelled \"partnerships\" with major internet companies – allow the NSA to obtain content and metadata on thousands of targets without individual warrants.</p><p>The NSA also collects enormous quantities of metadata from the fibre-optic cables that make up the backbone of the internet. The agency has placed taps on undersea cables, and is given access to internet data through partnerships with American telecoms companies.</p><p>About 90% of the world's online communications cross the US, giving the NSA what it calls in classified documents a \"home-field advantage\" when it comes to intercepting information.</p><p>By confirming that all metadata \"seen\" by NSA collection systems is stored, the Marina document suggests such collections are not merely used to filter target information, but also to store data at scale.</p><p>A sign of how much information could be contained within the repository comes from a <a href=\"http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/speeches_testimonies/2013_08_09_the_nsa_story.pdf\">document voluntarily disclosed by the NSA in August</a>, in the wake of the first tranche of revelations from the Snowden documents.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/speeches_testimonies/2013_08_09_the_nsa_story.pdf\">The seven-page document</a>, titled \"The National Security Agency: Missions, Authorities, Oversight and Partnerships\", says the agency \"touches\" 1.6% of daily internet traffic – an estimate which is not believed to include large-scale internet taps operated by GCHQ, the NSA's UK counterpart.</p><p>The document cites figures from a major tech provider that the internet carries 1,826 petabytes of information per day. One petabyte, <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5309889/how-large-is-a-petabyte\">according to tech website Gizmodo</a>, is equivalent to over 13 years of HDTV video. </p><p>\"In its foreign intelligence mission, NSA touches about 1.6% of that,\" the document states. \"However, of the 1.6% of the data, only 0.025% is actually selected for review.</p><p>\"The net effect is that NSA analysts look at 0.00004% of the world's traffic in conducting their mission – that's less than one part in a million.\"</p><p>However, critics were skeptical of the reassurances, because large quantities of internet data is represented by music and video sharing, or large file transfers – content which is easy to identify and dismiss without entering it into systems. Therefore, the NSA could be picking up a much larger percentage of internet traffic that contains communications and browsing activity.<br /> <br />Journalism professor and internet commentator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/13/nsa-internet-traffic-surveillance\">Jeff Jarvis noted</a>: \"[By] very rough, beer-soaked-napkin numbers, the NSA's 1.6% of net traffic would be half of the communication on the net. That's one helluva lot of 'touching'.\"</p><p>Much of the NSA's data collection is carried out under section 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act. This provision allows for the collection of data without individual warrants of communications, where at least one end of the conversation, or data exchange, involves a non-American located outside the US at the time of collection.</p><p>The NSA is required to \"minimize\" the data of US persons, but is permitted to keep US communications where it is not technically possible to remove them, and also to keep and use any \"inadvertently\" obtained US communications if they contain intelligence material, evidence of a crime, or if they are encrypted.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/nsa-loophole-warrantless-searches-email-calls\">The Guardian has also revealed the existence</a> of a so-called \"backdoor search loophole\", a 2011 rule change that allows NSA analysts to search for the names of US citizens, under certain circumstances, in mass-data repositories collected under section 702. <br /> <br />According to the New York Times, NSA analysts were told that metadata could be used \"without regard to the nationality or location of the communicants\", and that Americans' social contacts could be traced by the agency, providing there was some foreign intelligence justification for doing so.</p><p>The Guardian approached the NSA with four specific questions about the use of metadata, including a request for the rationale behind storing 365 days' worth of untargeted data, and an estimate of the quantity of US citizens' metadata stored in its repositories.  </p><p>But the NSA did not address any of these questions in its response, providing instead a statement focusing on its foreign intelligence activities.</p><p>\"NSA is a foreign intelligence agency,\" the statement said. \"NSA's foreign intelligence activities are conducted pursuant to procedures approved by the US attorney general and the secretary of defense, and, where applicable, the foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court, to protect the privacy interests of Americans.</p><p>\"These interests must be addressed in the collection, retention, and dissemination of any information. Moreover, all queries of lawfully collected data must be conducted for a foreign intelligence purpose.\"</p><p>It continued: \"We know there is a false perception out there that NSA listens to the phone calls and reads the email of everyday Americans, aiming to unlawfully monitor or profile US citizens. It's just not the case.</p><p>\"NSA's activities are directed against foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements from US leaders in order to protect the nation and its interests from threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418658009|2013-10-16T15:58:10Z|33ef35d9c481e78d20e5dba957d5d5e9b5fd63e7 -->",

It's at the heart of this story. And we fundamentally think it's a debate best had in the open. It's going to come down to what citizens, users and voters think about how much they're prepared to give up in order to feel secure. It's not an easy question.</p> <p>We had an event recently in NYC and the former general counsel for the NSA said this is a debate that has to be had once a generation – that each generation needs to feel it has given consent. I think that's an interesting point. It certainly feels like there are a couple&nbsp;of generations who have been taken aback by the sheer size and scale of surveillance.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/JimmyOConnell\">JimmyOConnell</a></strong>&nbsp;replies:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unfortunately, I suspect that like a lot of things, money is at the root of this question. The NSA's ecosystem is so gigantic that it has created its own little economy, into which the government has poured hundreds of billions. For example, what hope can there be of shutting down the Utah Data Center when it cost something in the region of $60bn to create?</p> <p>One only has to look at the police opposing the recent decision to relax some drug laws, not on any moral grounds but because so many of heir jobs depend on the war on drugs. I'm not saying it's impossible, but I can genuinely see economic arguments trumping moral ones – &quot;We can't defund the NSA, the unemployment crisis is bad enough as it is&quot; or &quot;So you're going to spend billions building a data center and then not use it?&quot;</p> <p>Very disheartening to think about, but soldier on we must and hope for the best.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nisdy/were_glenn_greenwald_and_janine_gibson_of_the/cciy59q\">grayghosted</a>:&nbsp;Do you see the Democratic party as hopelessly corrupt in terms of orchestrating progressive change?

That continued to be true through 2008.</p> <p>Now, a mere four later, Democrats have become the most vehement defenders of the NSA and the most vicious attackers of my work on the NSA – often, some of the very same people cheering so loudly in 2006 and 2007 are the ones protesting most loudly and viciously now.</p> <p>Gee, I wonder what changed?

How do you justify releasing those documents?</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/glenngreenwald\">GlennGreenwald</a></strong>:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No.</p> <p>Snowden answered this in the online interview with him. He doesn't believe that the only privacy rights that matter are those of Americans. He's an American, but not a jingoist, and he's also other things besides an &quot;American&quot;, including a human being. That privacy is being destroyed globally matters, both to him and journalistically.</p> <p>Moreover, even if you do jingoistically care only about Americans: the internet is a global means of communication. There is no viable way to segregate the communications of Americans from foreigners. If you allow the NSA to run rampant over the internet and turn it into a means of control, monitoring and oppression, it will affect everyone.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nisdy/were_glenn_greenwald_and_janine_gibson_of_the/ccixzx9\">Vervex</a>:&nbsp;</strong>Do you feel that the protections that journalists count on are disappearing?&nbsp;Is journalism as a whole in danger?&nbsp;Can we in the US trust our major publications for the true story or is there to much manipulation?&nbsp;Is Rupert Murdoch the antichrist?</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nisdy/were_glenn_greenwald_and_janine_gibson_of_the/cciymqa\"><strong>Janine_Gibson</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a critical time for journalistic freedom, and there are two major shifts which are threatening important work. One is the attempt to categorise &quot;who is a journalist&quot;, which we are in danger, as an industry, of enabling. I feel profoundly uncomfortable about any line drawn around pay, employer, hours or volume of work that will define a &quot;real&quot; journalist. And then only the &quot;real&quot; journalists will be protected.</p> <p>I don't think that's how the world works any more, so that's problematic.</p> <p>The second is the attempt to define journalism as outside the national interest, and the Guardian has felt the impact of that in the UK, when the government demanded we destroy some of the material we were working on.

Do you agree with this statement, and if that is the case how do you think America can take steps towards limiting the power and abuses of the NSA?&nbsp;Thank you … for everything.</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nisdy/were_glenn_greenwald_and_janine_gibson_of_the/cciybnk\">GlennGreenwald</a>:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That document did not state definitively that the NSA provided the communications of members of Congress and judges to Israel, though it did reference such communication. Other reports, as we indicated (including from the New York Times in 2009), have previously reported on efforts to wiretap even members of Congress.</p> <p>A major reason why those in power always try to use surveillance is because surveillance = power. The more you know about someone, the more you can control and manipulate them in all sorts of ways. That is one reason a surveillance state is so menacing to basic political liberties.</p> <p>But there are all sorts of examples, including from recent history, demonstrating that even the most seemingly insurmountable institutions can be weakened or uprooted when they become abusive enough. The tide is clearly turning against the US national security state in general and the NSA in particular in terms of their ability to dictate terms and control the debate, and they know it.</p> <p>What will ultimately determine the outcome here is how much pressure citizens continue to apply in defense of their privacy rights and against massive, ubiquitous, secret spying systems aimed at them.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1nisdy/were_glenn_greenwald_and_janine_gibson_of_the/cciy4e5\">dschuma</a>:&nbsp;Often times, it seems like stories in the Guardian are shadow-boxing with the Obama administration.

It can feel a lot like that. We have a process that we run with every story where we approach the administration, tell them what we're doing and identify any documents that we might quote from or publish. We invite them to share any specific national security concerns that would result from those disclosures.</p> <p>What happens next varies. Sometimes they respond with redaction requests (and sometimes we agree and sometimes not). Sometimes just a statement. Sometimes we ask questions. Sometimes they answer. Much of the time, we've already made some decisions ourselves on redactions of obviously sensitive operational detail or people's names etc.</p> <p>As we've gone on, working this story has become closer to journalistic standard practice (or at least, how we practice it).</p> <p>In terms of the news cycle – obviously we try and make sure each story has as much impact as possible, but we tend to publish when we've found a story, worked it up to our satisfaction, determined that it's in the public interest and it's ready.

This can be used to build a detailed picture of an individual's life.</p><p>The Obama administration has repeatedly stated that the NSA keeps only the content of messages and communications of people it is intentionally targeting – but internal documents reveal the agency retains vast amounts of metadata.</p><p>An introductory guide to digital network intelligence for NSA field agents, included in documents disclosed by former contractor Edward Snowden, describes the agency's metadata repository, codenamed Marina. Any computer metadata picked up by NSA collection systems is routed to the Marina database, the guide explains. Phone metadata is sent to a separate system.</p><p>\"The Marina metadata application tracks a user's browser experience, gathers contact information/content and develops summaries of target,\" the analysts' guide explains. \"This tool offers the ability to export the data in a variety of formats, as well as create various charts to assist in pattern-of-life development.\"</p><p>The guide goes on to explain Marina's unique capability: \"Of the more distinguishing features, Marina has the ability to look back on the last 365 days' worth of DNI metadata seen by the Sigint collection system, <strong>regardless</strong> whether or not it was tasked for collection.\" [Emphasis in original.]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html\">On Saturday, the New York Times reported</a> that the NSA was using its metadata troves to build profiles of US citizens' social connections, associations and in some cases location, augmenting the material the agency collects with additional information bought in from the commercial sector, which is is not subject to the same legal restrictions as other data.</p><p>The ability to look back on a full year's history for any individual whose data was collected – either deliberately or incidentally – offers the NSA the potential to find information on people who have later become targets. But it relies on storing the personal data of large numbers of internet users who are not, and never will be, of interest to the US intelligence community.</p><p>Marina aggregates NSA metadata from an array of sources, some targeted, others on a large scale. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">Programs such as Prism</a> – which operates through legally compelled \"partnerships\" with major internet companies – allow the NSA to obtain content and metadata on thousands of targets without individual warrants.</p><p>The NSA also collects enormous quantities of metadata from the fibre-optic cables that make up the backbone of the internet. The agency has placed taps on undersea cables, and is given access to internet data through partnerships with American telecoms companies.</p><p>About 90% of the world's online communications cross the US, giving the NSA what it calls in classified documents a \"home-field advantage\" when it comes to intercepting information.</p><p>By confirming that all metadata \"seen\" by NSA collection systems is stored, the Marina document suggests such collections are not merely used to filter target information, but also to store data at scale.</p><p>A sign of how much information could be contained within the repository comes from a <a href=\"http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/speeches_testimonies/2013_08_09_the_nsa_story.pdf\">document voluntarily disclosed by the NSA in August</a>, in the wake of the first tranche of revelations from the Snowden documents.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/speeches_testimonies/2013_08_09_the_nsa_story.pdf\">The seven-page document</a>, titled \"The National Security Agency: Missions, Authorities, Oversight and Partnerships\", says the agency \"touches\" 1.6% of daily internet traffic – an estimate which is not believed to include large-scale internet taps operated by GCHQ, the NSA's UK counterpart.</p><p>The document cites figures from a major tech provider that the internet carries 1,826 petabytes of information per day. One petabyte, <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5309889/how-large-is-a-petabyte\">according to tech website Gizmodo</a>, is equivalent to over 13 years of HDTV video. </p><p>\"In its foreign intelligence mission, NSA touches about 1.6% of that,\" the document states. \"However, of the 1.6% of the data, only 0.025% is actually selected for review.</p><p>\"The net effect is that NSA analysts look at 0.00004% of the world's traffic in conducting their mission – that's less than one part in a million.\"</p><p>However, critics were skeptical of the reassurances, because large quantities of internet data is represented by music and video sharing, or large file transfers – content which is easy to identify and dismiss without entering it into systems. Therefore, the NSA could be picking up a much larger percentage of internet traffic that contains communications and browsing activity.<br /> <br />Journalism professor and internet commentator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/13/nsa-internet-traffic-surveillance\">Jeff Jarvis noted</a>: \"[By] very rough, beer-soaked-napkin numbers, the NSA's 1.6% of net traffic would be half of the communication on the net. That's one helluva lot of 'touching'.\"</p><p>Much of the NSA's data collection is carried out under section 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act. This provision allows for the collection of data without individual warrants of communications, where at least one end of the conversation, or data exchange, involves a non-American located outside the US at the time of collection.</p><p>The NSA is required to \"minimize\" the data of US persons, but is permitted to keep US communications where it is not technically possible to remove them, and also to keep and use any \"inadvertently\" obtained US communications if they contain intelligence material, evidence of a crime, or if they are encrypted.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/nsa-loophole-warrantless-searches-email-calls\">The Guardian has also revealed the existence</a> of a so-called \"backdoor search loophole\", a 2011 rule change that allows NSA analysts to search for the names of US citizens, under certain circumstances, in mass-data repositories collected under section 702. <br /> <br />According to the New York Times, NSA analysts were told that metadata could be used \"without regard to the nationality or location of the communicants\", and that Americans' social contacts could be traced by the agency, providing there was some foreign intelligence justification for doing so.</p><p>The Guardian approached the NSA with four specific questions about the use of metadata, including a request for the rationale behind storing 365 days' worth of untargeted data, and an estimate of the quantity of US citizens' metadata stored in its repositories.  </p><p>But the NSA did not address any of these questions in its response, providing instead a statement focusing on its foreign intelligence activities.</p><p>\"NSA is a foreign intelligence agency,\" the statement said. \"NSA's foreign intelligence activities are conducted pursuant to procedures approved by the US attorney general and the secretary of defense, and, where applicable, the foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court, to protect the privacy interests of Americans.</p><p>\"These interests must be addressed in the collection, retention, and dissemination of any information. Moreover, all queries of lawfully collected data must be conducted for a foreign intelligence purpose.\"</p><p>It continued: \"We know there is a false perception out there that NSA listens to the phone calls and reads the email of everyday Americans, aiming to unlawfully monitor or profile US citizens. It's just not the case.</p><p>\"NSA's activities are directed against foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements from US leaders in order to protect the nation and its interests from threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418658009|2013-10-16T15:58:10Z|33ef35d9c481e78d20e5dba957d5d5e9b5fd63e7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Western intelligence agencies must be more transparent and open to scrutiny if they are to keep public support for the type of mass surveillance techniques that have been revealed by Edward Snowden, a former director of the US National Security Agency has admitted.</p><p>General Michael Hayden said he believed the American and British intelligence agencies had to \"show a lot more leg\" if they wanted to win broad public understanding and support for the type of programmes they were undertaking.</p><p>Speaking in London, Hayden said western security services were having to make difficult adjustments to new challenges. It was not fair for America's critics to \"cross your arms and cluck at us\", he said.</p><p>Hayden was director of the NSA for six years between 1999 and 2005, and was director of the CIA for three years until 2009.</p><p>Speaking in Westminster at an event organised by the Henry Jackson Society, Hayden admitted security agencies had become too secretive for their own good.</p><p>Even if every individual decision to keep something secret could be justified, the total effect was harmful, he argued.</p><p>\"It's clear to me now that in liberal democracies the security services don't get to do what they do without broad public understanding and support.</p><p>\"And although the public cannot be briefed on everything, there has to be enough out there so that the majority of the population believe what they are doing is acceptable.\"</p><p>He added: \"My community has to show a lot more leg or we won't get to do any of what we want to do because the public support is so withdrawn that, politically, nobody is going to give us the authorisation.\"</p><p>Presidents can do \"one-offs\" without constitutional authority, he said, but \"no president can do something repeatedly over a long term without that broad popular support\".</p><p>The problem for western intelligence agencies was that they were designed in a different era, and are trying to change tack to face new enemies.</p><p>\"All US security structures were created in about 1947, and so we are hardwired for the security problems of 1947, which fundamentally were encompassed by the power of nation states.</p><p>\"We are still hardwired to deal with those issues. But now the things that fundamentally affect citizens most, like cyber attacks, terrorism and transnational crime, are not the product of nation states. They are the product of nation state weakness or nation state absence.</p><p>\"So we are taking this hardwired national security structure which is designed to go this way, and we are trying to get it to go that way.\"</p><p>Hayden defended the NSA's Prism programme which, he said, had not \"caused much of a ripple in the United States\".</p><p>But he admitted that a separate programme that allowed the NSA to collect simple 'metadata' on all phone calls in the United States was \"going deep and to the edge of the line.\"</p><p>Hayden said: \"I can understand congressmen saying, 'I'm not sure that was the intent in that provision of the Patriot Act'.</p><p>\"But then I would say, 'Why didn't you read the letter sent to all of you in 2009 and in 2011 before you reauthorised the Patriot Act, which clearly says the NSA was collecting metadata on all phone calls in the United States.'\"</p><p>Hayden said he did not regard Snowden as a whistleblower because he had not highlighted any wrongdoing.</p><p>\"He has pointed out many things that people may think are unwise but they are not illegal.\"</p><p>He added: \"Even if you object to some of the things my government has done or is doing, I am asking for deeper understanding.</p><p>\"We are trying to adapt security services that were designed for state powers [to deal with] non state actors. Many dangers for our citizens don't come from other states, they come from individuals and states are not well equipped to deal with that.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418679834|2013-10-16T15:58:10Z|94470529968831405d3fd2d4e56271666dafbb8f -->",

        "headline":"NSA chief admits agency tracked US cellphone locations in secret tests",
        "body":"<p>The head of the National Security Agency has admitted to secret pilot programs to monitor the precise location of Americans through their cellphones, saying the highly intrusive tracking data \"may be something that is a future requirement for the country\".</p><p>General Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, said that the pilot programs from 2010 and 2011 were intended to test the compatibility of the location data with the agency's databases, but were not used for any intelligence analysis purposes.</p><p>However, giving evidence to the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday, Alexander left little doubt that the NSA was interested in a potential dragnet of location data, which would constitute a significant extension of its surveillance powers.</p><p>Last week, before another Senate committee, Alexander evaded questions about whether the NSA had ever collected information from cellphone towers, which helps pinpoint an individual's movement, suggesting the information might be classified.</p><p>Asked on Wednesday by Republican senator Ted Cruz whether the NSA would ever seek location data of Americans to combat terrorism, Alexander said that would be a possibility, but that the agency currently obtains the information on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>\"I would just say that this may be something that is a future requirement for the country, but it is not right now, because when we identify a number, we can give that to the FBI,\" Alexander said. \"When they get their probable cause [to justify obtaining the data] they can get the location data that they need.\"</p><p>\"The NSA's attempt to collect this data shows the need for stronger legislative oversight of the agency's activities, but the fact is that federal, state, and local law enforcement are already regularly collecting cell phone location information without a warrant,\" said Christopher Calabrese, ACLU legislative counsel. \"Last year a majority of the supreme court recognized that location information is sensitive, and we need legislation that respects privacy rights when it comes to Americans' movements.\"</p><p>After the hearing, the ACLU objected to the phone-tracking revelation. \"The NSA's attempt to collect this data shows the need for stronger legislative oversight of the agency's activities, but the fact is that federal, state, and local law enforcement are already regularly collecting cell phone location information without a warrant,\" said Christopher Calabrese, ACLU legislative counsel.</p><p>\"Last year a majority of the Supreme Court recognized that location information is sensitive, and we need legislation that respects privacy rights when it comes to Americans' movements.\"</p><p>In another exchange, Alexander and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, appealed to Congress not to allow the string of disclosures based on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\">documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden</a> to limit the powers of the intelligence community.</p><p>Both men criticised some media reports, which they said were misleading and dangerous to national security. However, in a series of revealing exchanges, they were themselves accused of misleading the public and forced to shed light on the pilot programme to obtain cellphone data, as well as another effort to collect huge amounts of social network data on foreign citizens.</p><p>Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the committee, also criticised the information had that been provided to a privileged few lawmakers.</p><p>\"We get more in the newspapers than we do in the classified briefings that you give us,\" Leahy said.</p><p>Leahy, a Democrat who is drafting legislation to reform US government surveillance, pressed Alexander and Clapper on the accuracy of their previous testimony.</p><p>\"Both of you have raised concerns that the media reports about the government's surveillance programs have been incomplete, inaccurate, misleading,\" Leahy said. \"But I worry that we're still getting inaccurate and incomplete statements from the administration.\"</p><p>He drew attention to repeated claims by the intelligence agencies that 54 terrorist attacks had been thwarted by two particular programs.</p><p>\"That is plainly wrong, but we still get it in letters to members of Congress, [and] we get it in statements,\" Leahy said. \"These weren't all plots, and they weren't all thwarted. The American people are getting left with inaccurate reflection of the NSA's programs.\"</p><p>Alexander then conceded that the 54 examples were \"not all plots\" and only 13 had a nexus in the US. He also admitted there were only \"one or possibly two\" cases of terrorist activity that would not have been prevented \"but for\" section 215 of the Patriot Act, which authorises bulk phone record collection.</p><p>The majority of reports based on Snowden's disclosures have been published in the Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">including the first disclosure</a>, in June, that the NSA was secretly feeding a huge database of the records of phone calls of millions of Americans.</p><p>Since then, a number of other media outlets have published reports based on some top-secret documents disclosed by Snowden, including, most recently, the New York Times. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html\">It reported over the weekend</a> that the NSA has been exploiting its huge collections of data to create sophisticated graphs of some Americans' social connections, for foreign intelligence purposes.</p><p>Alexander said the report, based upon an internal NSA memo from January 2011, that lifted previous restrictions on \"discover and track\" connections between foreign intelligence targets and people in the United States, were \"inaccurate and wrong\".</p><p>Asked if he was collecting data to build portraits of social networks, Alexander replied: \"No.\"</p><p>However, Alexander then appeared to row back on that position, stressing that the NSA was obtaining supplementary information, under executive order 12333, to connect data they already have \"to social networks abroad\".</p><p>He said the order, which would not be subject to oversight mechanisms that apply to other programs, was still operating.</p><p>Earlier, Leahy spoke about the bill he is drafting to limit the intelligence agencies surveillance reach in partnership with Republican Jim Sensenbrenner, who chairs the crime and terrorism subcommittee of the House of Representatives.</p><p>Their legislation, which is still being drafted, would end the bulk collection of phone records under section 215 of the Patriot Act, introduce a special advocate to the foreign intelligence surveillance act (Fisa) court – along with some measures to make the court more transparent. The Leahy-Sensenbrenner legislation has a good chance of rising above the dozen or so other bills being proposed in the aftermath of the Snowden disclosures.</p><p>Leahy and Sensenbrenner are heavyweight politicians from opposite sides of the political spectrum. After the September 11 attacks, Sensenbrenner introduced the Patriot Act, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/09/abuse-patriot-act-must-end\">a law he now says was misinterpreted by spy agencies</a> and used to justify surveillance programs that infringe on constitutional rights.</p><p>\"Just because something is technologically possible, and just because something may be deemed technically legal, does not mean it is the right thing to do,\" Leahy said.</p><p>\"The government has not made the case that at the bulk collection of phone records is an effective tool,\" he added.</p><p>Leahy said he had reviewed the classified case the intelligence community makes for the phone collection program, \"and I find it to be unconvincing\".</p><p>Senator Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the committee, said that recent revelations that NSA staff had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/nsa-employee-spied-detection-internal-memo\">used the agency's powerful surveillance tools to spy on their spouses</a> had fed into a \"broader crisis of trust\" that the intelligence establishment would struggle to recover from.</p><p>Alexander assured the committee that most of the violations of NSA rules related to \"foreign persons in foreign places\".</p><p>In opening statements, Clapper and Alexander echoed almost word for word the evidence they provided the Senate intelligence committee last week, arguing that media outlets have endangered national security by publishing Snowden's disclosures, and claiming that intelligence agencies are not interested in spying on US citizens.</p><p>In a written submission to the committee, the pair reiterated the position of the intelligence establishment: that while they will consider some minor changes to the way they do business to increase public confidence in the wake of the Snowden disclosures, they will not countenance any significant diminution of their powers, which they believe are vital for national security.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418883334|2013-10-16T15:58:10Z|1924b629a9d7196cede8999607d03284f7bae049 -->",
