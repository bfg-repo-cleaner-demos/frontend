        "headline":"David Baddiel, comedian and writer – portrait of the artist",
        "body":"<p><strong>When did you first realise you were funny?</strong></p><p>At school <strong>(1)</strong>. The sixth form put on a lunchtime show that was regularly booed off. So another bloke and I wrote a show ridiculing all the teachers: we had the music teacher with a big fake nose, and the geography teacher having&nbsp;sex with his assistant on a photocopier. It was shut down after one performance, and I almost got expelled, but&nbsp;the audience loved it.</p><p><strong>What was your big breakthrough?</strong></p><p>Persuading the BBC to do a pilot of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nCKYEM8qRc\" title=\"\">The Mary Whitehouse Experience for BBC2</a>. Graduating from Cambridge in 1986, after alternative comedy had completely taken over the cultural landscape, had been a disaster. The only way I could get a gig at the Comedy Store was by pretending I'd never been to Cambridge or done any standup.</p><p><strong>You've paired up with a number of other comics. What's the key to a successful double act?</strong></p><p>I don't think there is one – each double act is very different. With Rob [Newman, with whom he made The Mary Whitehouse Experience], there was an awful lot of tension: we did originally get on well, but as we worked together we got on much less. With Frank <strong>(2)</strong>, it was always massively affectionate.</p><p><strong>Do you suffer for your art?</strong></p><p>No. I certainly don't think comedians are more depressive than any other walk of life. I have had clinical depression, as it happens. The stress of&nbsp;performing didn't help, but it wasn't about being a comedian in itself.</p><p><strong>How did you come to write fiction?</strong></p><p>By accident. I was touring with Rob; at that point, we weren't getting on at all, and we were being interviewed separately. A journalist said to me, \"Rob's writing a&nbsp;novel; are you?\" So I just said, \"Yes.\" After that, I thought <a href=\"http://www.4thestate.co.uk/author/david-baddiel/\" title=\"\">I'd better do it</a>.</p><p><strong>Is there a downside to fame?</strong></p><p>My show <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/david-baddiel-78334\" title=\"\">Fame: Not the Musical</a> is about the fact that fame is seen in two ways in our culture: either as a glittering bauble we desperately covet, or as a narrative of tragedy and despair. My own experience of fame is a third, mundane way, which often involves being mistaken for someone else – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/01/ian-brodie-four-winds\" title=\"\">Ian Broudie from the Lightning Seeds</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2011/aug/04/steve-wright-tabloid-feeding-frenzy\" title=\"\">Steve Wright</a>. Andrew Lloyd Webber even thinks I'm Ben Elton, despite having written a musical <strong>(3)</strong> with him.</p><p><strong>Is there an art form you don't relate to?</strong></p><p>I have an issue with classical music. Like a lot of lower-middle-class parents, especially immigrant ones (my mum was a refugee from the Nazis), my parents saw cultural aspiration in terms of classical music: they took me&nbsp;to concerts and made me learn the piano. Unfortunately, it put me off.</p><p><strong>What's the worst thing anyone ever said about you?</strong></p><p>A magazine once wrote a piece about Three Lions that said, \"In the future, folk memory will have erased the memory of David Baddiel singing just&nbsp;as effectively as it has erased the memory of corpse robbers during the&nbsp;Blitz.\" I was almost proud to be insulted on such a baroque scale.</p><h2>In short</h2><p><strong>Born</strong>: Troy, New York, 1964.</p><p><strong>Career</strong>: Started as a standup, and came to prominence through his partnership with <a href=\"http://www.robnewman.com\" title=\"\">Rob Newman</a>, which led to The Mary Whitehouse Experience. Has also written screenplays, sitcoms and four novels. His latest standup show, <a href=\"http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/david-baddiel-78334\" title=\"\">Fame: Not the Musical</a>, is at the Southbank Centre, London SE1, until Friday.</p><p><strong>Low point</strong>: \"I spent a long time on a big studio sitcom, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/dec/31/features.review47\" title=\"\">Baddiel's Syndrome</a>, for Sky, and got no audience.\"</p><p><strong>High point</strong>: \"Singing Three Lions at Wembley during an England match at Euro 96.\"</p><h2>Footnotes</h2><p><strong>(1)</strong> <a href=\"http://www.habsboys.org.uk\" title=\"\">Haberdashers Aske's</a> independent school in north London, also alma mater to Sacha Baron Cohen and Matt Lucas.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> Skinner, with whom Baddiel penned such laddish comedy hits as Fantasy Football League, Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned, and the unforgettable single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM\" title=\"\">Three Lions</a>.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong> <a href=\"http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/culture/arts/ben-eltonandrew-lloyd-webber-musical-5514760\" title=\"\">The Beautiful Game</a>, their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2000/sep/28/theatre.artsfeatures1\" title=\"\">musical about northern Irish football fans</a>, opened to a mainly warm critical reception in 2000, but closed after a year. It has since been rewritten (by Elton, not Baddiel) as The Boys in the Photograph.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421222610|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|3ef09129dbc2fb4e4e692fdfd938c3791a8b1832 -->",
