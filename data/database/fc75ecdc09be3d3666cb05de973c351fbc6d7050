        "headline":"EU helping prop up Belarus president Lukashenko, says opposition",
        "body":"<p>The EU is playing a key role in propping up the rule of Alexander Lukashenko, widely seen as \"Europe's last dictator\", according to one of the country's leading opposition figures who spent a year in jail after challenging the leader for the presidency.</p><p>A policy paper has been delivered to all 28 EU foreign ministries this week, along with a letter calling on ministers to back a broadening of sanctions against Belarusian individuals and companies. It is signed by a number of NGOs and activists, including Andrei Sannikov, who stood for the presidency in 2010, in elections widely seen as rigged.</p><p>\"Europe is again pursuing a policy of engagement,\" Sannikov said. \"But the policy of engagement with dictators simply doesn't work.\"</p><p>Sannikov was beaten by police <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/30/belarus-lukashenko-rivals-charged-over-protests?guni=Article:in%20body%20\" title=\"\">and arrested at a rally that turned violent</a> following the 2010 vote, and later sentenced to five years in prison in May 2011, for organising mass unrest. He was released about a year later, following international pressure. Sannikov claimed that sanctions are the only way to force the Belarusian regime to release its remaining political prisoners, and make much-needed concessions to civil society – Belarus is the only country in Europe to retain the death penalty, with Lukashenko running the economy and political system on neo-Soviet lines.</p><p>EU sanctions are already in place against some individuals and firms in Belarus, and are due for routine annual renewal at the end of the month. Sannikov and others claim they are ineffective, as they do not cover the main sources of income for Lukashenko and his regime.</p><p>The policy paper outlines a number of businessmen identified as Lukashenko's \"bagmen\" but who are not currently covered by the punitive sanctions. The paper identified Belarusian oligarchs whose businesses, it said, would be impossible without the \"permission and deep involvement\" of the regime. One, Yuri Chizh, is already present on the sanctions list, along with most of his companies, although three of his profitable firms were left off last year after lobbying from Latvia.</p><p>The activists demand that these companies, as well as firms belonging to businessmen Nikolai Vorobei and Alexander Shakutin, are also included on the sanctions list.</p><p>Sannikov said he personally handed the letter to the minister for Europe, David Lidington, earlier this week, and asked him to pass it on to the foreign secretary, William Hague.</p><p>In response to the claims, the Foreign Office said: \"We continue to be very clear with the Belarusian government in public and in private. All EU member states agree that there can be no change in the EU's position, including sanctions, until we see the immediate release and rehabilitation of the [seven] remaining political prisoners.  Absent any positive change in Belarus, sanctions will be rolled over in October.</p><p>\"We regularly discuss the situation in Belarus with our EU partners, and have done so in recent weeks. The UK, along with all EU [members states], remains concerned about the situation in Belarus, the lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law.\"</p><p>Recent changes in the rules governing sanctions mean that in order for an individual or company to be included on the list, the EU merely has to be satisfied that it either benefits from, or supports, the regime.</p><p>\"It is very difficult to prove that these companies give a percentage of their profits to the regime, but it is much easier to show that they are benefiting from it, because they clearly all get very beneficial agreements,\" said an international human rights lawyer who consulted on the paper.</p><p>The policy paper also demands that sanctions are extended to cover state-controlled oil and potash export companies.</p><p>In 2012, overall exports from Belarus to the EU totalled €12.9bn (£10.9bn), including transit fees, according to the report's authors. The real figures are often disguised amid the huge revenues that Belarus receives from both transit and re-export fees. Another loophole involves the re-registration of several Belarusian companies in Latvia, with thinly veiled attempts to hide their real owners to avoid sanctions.</p><p>\"Sanctions exist on paper, and the EU thinks it is putting pressure on Belarus, but in reality they are not working any more,\" said Yuri Dzhibladze, one of the co-ordinators of the policy paper.</p><p>Sannikov put it more bluntly: \"It is the EU that is propping up Lukashenko's repressive apparatus.\"</p><p>According to the authors, Lukashenko will be vulnerable to financial pressure ahead of the 2015 presidential election, as he tries to maintain salaries and pensions at artificially high levels. Financial analysts claim that the moderate well-being of most Belarusians has only been possible via huge subsidies from the Kremlin, which dried up when Moscow became irritated with Lukashenko's unwillingness to sell it key infrastructure.</p><p>\"He does not care about resolutions,\" said Dzhibladze, pointing to dozens of resolutions by the UN Human Rights Council, the EU and other international bodies calling on Belarus to release political prisoners and improve rule of law. \"We believe that targeted and smart sanctions are the only way to make Lukashenko act on his international commitments.\"</p><p>The activists' problem is that in order for sanctions to take effect, all 28 EU members states have to agree, and the bloc has faced particular obstruction from Latvia and Slovenia over the inclusion of Belarusian oligarchs on the sanctions list. Any inclkusion would lose the countries  significant revenue streams.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, business interests often triumph over values,\" said Dzhibladze.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420181842|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|5b6a01f365bcd931f5b5fcd496fc3ebe4dd4d46b -->",

        "body":"<p>Just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin landed a giant pike on a fishing trip, his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko has boasted about catching a man-sized catfish.</p><p>Putin's office said last week he had caught a 21kg (46lb) pike while fishing in Siberia, describing it as a \"gigantic animal\". The latest in a long string of macho exploits by the Kremlin leader drew scepticism and mockery on social media.</p><p>On Wednesday, Belarusian state television showed Lukashenko telling a government meeting about his own catch, including a 57kg (126lb) catfish hauled out of the Pripyat river. He did not mention Putin or say exactly when he had landed the monster.</p><p>\"It was as long as I am tall,\" said deputy prime minister Mikhail Rusiy.</p><p>Although Belarus is Russia's closest ally, the relationship between Lukashenko, 58, and Putin, 60, has long been uneasy. The pair have exchanged critical and sometimes sarcastic comments about each other for years as Lukashenko has resisted the strengthening of Russia's influence over its smaller neighbour.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414060928|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|73be7bdbd6c58560755a726e65b8119bfb83df0e -->",

        "body":"<p>Russia banned pork imports from Belarus on Friday, stepping up a diplomatic and trade war over the arrest of a Russian businessman and threatening to deepen the isolation of its former Soviet ally.</p><p>Russia is one of Belarus's few diplomatic backers after 19 years of authoritarian rule by the president, Alexander Lukashenko, but Moscow has responded furiously to the arrest this week of Vladislav Baumgertner, head of the Russian potash company Uralkali. Baumgertner  was seized on Monday at the airport outside the Belarusian capital, Minsk, after being invited to talks with the prime minister, and then humiliated by television footage showing him being searched in his prison cell.</p><p>Since then, Russian officials have announced a 25% cut in oil supplies to Belarus in September, threatened to extend the cuts for several months and hinted at possible restrictions on imports of Belarusian dairy products.</p><p>Russia's veterinary regulator said the restrictions on hog and pork product imports had been imposed over concerns about African swine fever in Belarus and would not be lifted until the virus was wiped out or brought under control.</p><p>The moves could deal a significant blow to Belarus, a transit country for Russian oil and natural gas to Europe. Its economy, in danger of collapse, is heavily reliant on agriculture and Russian oil supplies. \"Relations between Russia and Belarus seem to be delving to new lows and the expectation is that Russia will further ratchet up pressure on its neighbour via the trade channel,\" said Timothy Ash, an analyst at Standard Bank in London.</p><p>\"All this comes as the economy in Belarus looks precariously fragile.\"</p><p>The dispute followed the collapse this month of a Russia-Belarus sales cartel that controlled two-fifths of the $20bn global market for potash, an ingredient used in mineral fertilisers. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said nothing in public about the dispute but his foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Moscow was counting on Belarus freeing Baumgertner quickly and described the dispute as commercial but not political.</p><p>The Kremlin also tried to play down the political impact by saying Putin had followed protocol by sending a telegram congratulating Lukashenko on his 59th birthday on Friday.  </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416184871|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|798dc0d2d8180b94d144fbd039a3573608109f6e -->",

        "body":"<p>He is a pariah in the west, viewed suspiciously by Russia and loathed by opponents in exile or jail, but the Belarussian president, Alexander Lukashenko, is relishing his notoriety as Europe's last dictator.</p><p></p><p>After 18 years in power, the blunt, forceful and heavily built former state farm manager shows no sign of bowing to western pressure to relax his grip on the former Soviet republic squeezed between Russia and the European Union.</p><p></p><p>Always defiant, often cantankerous and sometimes provocative, Lukashenko has added irony to his armoury to deflect western politicians' criticism, touting their dictator tag as a badge of honour.</p><p></p><p>\"I am the last and only dictator in Europe. Indeed there are none anywhere else in the world,\" he told Reuters in a rare interview in the Belarus capital, Minsk.</p><p></p><p>\"You came here and looked at a living dictator. Where else would you see one? There is something in this. They say that even bad publicity is good publicity.\"</p><p></p><p>Lukashenko's words are delivered with a wry grin and a wave of his immense hands, and appear intended to taunt the critics whose calls for more economic and political freedom have gone largely unheeded since he first became president in 1994.</p><p></p><p>The 58-year-old leader does not tire of telling guests that Belarus is the geographical centre of Europe. But the country of 9.5 million does not share the same democratic values as its western neighbours.</p><p></p><p>Minsk's broad thoroughfares are still lined with monolithic Soviet-era buildings. There are streets named after Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, though some may now boast smart western shops, such as a Porsche showroom and McDonald's.</p><p></p><p>There is not a single opposition deputy in parliament. Lukashenko, if re-elected, can rule indefinitely following a referendum that allowed term limits to be lifted, and the opposition has been all but crushed into submission.</p><p></p><p>His strongest rival, Andrei Sannikov, once a deputy foreign minister, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/23/andrei-sannikov-world-complacent-belarus\" title=\"\">took political refuge in Britain last month after 16 months in prison in which he said prison staff tortured him and tried to get him to kill himself</a>.</p><p></p><p>Years of diplomatic spats with the west have left Belarus isolated, but a European Union travel and assets ban on people and companies associated with his government has had no obvious impact on Lukashenko's policies. He is promising to modernise the largely state-run economy and possibly one day build a party-based political system. But he scoffs at talk of rapid change or the possibility of upheaval like the \"Arab spring\" that swept away Middle East leaders.</p><p></p><p>\"Every day we have changes here. There is no scope for revolutions coming to Belarus,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>In mid-2010, after signs Lukashenko was easing pressure on the political opposition, it seemed western governments might be ready to relax their harsh criticism of him. But  that ended in December 2010 when, after he was voted in for a fourth consecutive term, riot police broke up protest rallies by tens of thousands of people unhappy at his re-election.</p><p></p><p>Several politicians who ran against him for office, including Sannikov, were detained by security forces,  and scores of opponents were picked up in their homes. The EU and the US tightened sanctions on Lukashenko and his inner circle.</p><p></p><p>This week, the justice ministry closed down the Minsk office of the human rights organisation Viasna, whose head, Ales Beliatski, is serving a four-and-a-half-year-jail term after a trial for tax evasion described as unfair by Amnesty International.</p><p></p><p>Lukashenko's message to the west is one of defiance, coupled with a sense of seething injustice at being ostracised for not following western-style policies.</p><p></p><p>\"You [Europe] do not like the course Belarus is taking. You would like everything here to be sold off – in the interests of Russia or in the interests of western companies,\" he said, shifting forward in his chair and almost shouting.</p><p></p><p>\"You do not like the fact that we have good relations with Russia. This is determined by our history. During the last war we fought together in the trenches against the Nazis. We saved you, Europe, from being slaves to your own fuhrer.\"</p><p></p><p>In a veiled threat to stop \"choking\" Belarus, he reminded Europe that it receives much of its oil and natural gas from Russia via pipelines that run through the country. \"Who needs these double standards? Who needs instability in the heart of Europe? Not you, not us, not Russia. Let's talk, we are people,\" he said.</p><p>Lukashenko rejected western charges of holding political prisoners, saying specific cases raised by the west relate to people who committed criminal offences. Asked about alleged abuse of human rights, he waved the question to one side, saying he was the guarantor of the most important right – the right to live.</p><p></p><p>Lukashenko has kept the loyalty of  workers in big factories by awarding them pay rises when economic times get hard, even though critics say this has contributed to the country's economic problems and rising debts.</p><p></p><p>He seethes, too, as he recalls a pro-democracy stunt by a Swedish PR company in which hundreds of teddy bears were dropped from a light airplane over Belarus last July. \"You recently sent over a plane with humorous toys and this was a violation [of Belarus's air space]. And what if the military had opened fire and people had been killed?\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/400103724|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|2baeaf040b41ffd698ab8f0336e9818d8d1f1239 -->",

        "body":"<p>Actors including Joanna Lumley, Sam West, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Mark Rylance and Simon Callow have recorded video messages to David Cameron highlighting the plight of political prisoners held under the autocratic regime of the Belarusian dictator, Alexander Lukashenko.</p><p>The initiative has been organised by Natalia Kaliada and Nicolai Khazelin, co-founders of the <a href=\"http://www.belarusfreetheatre.com/\" title=\"\">Belarus Free Theatre</a>, as part of the<a href=\"http://www.freebelarusnow.org/\" title=\"\"> Free Belarus Now</a> campaign and marks Wednesday's second anniversary of the rigged election that returned Lukashenko to power and a period when thousands of peaceful protesters were arrested.</p><p>\"The regime does not want to show that there are any political prisoners,\" said  Kaliada. \"The authorities found different pretexts to make the arrests, things like hooliganism. Today there are still 14 political prisoners in jails of Belarus and they and their families are hostages of the last dictatorship of Europe.\"</p><p>The theatre company, as well as its artistic work, works to publicise the oppression that still goes on in Belarus. \"They are a very brave gang of people,\" said long-term supporter Tom Stoppard.</p><p>The messages have been recorded by Lumley, Fiennes, West, Callow, Rylance, Rickman, Tim Rice and Adjoa Andoh. Fiennes highlights the cases of <a href=\"http://humanrightshouse.org/Articles/18838.html\" title=\"\">Zmitser Dashkevich</a> and <a href=\"http://www.freebelarusnow.org/2011/11/pavel-seviarynets/\" title=\"\">Pavel Seviarynets</a>, who were detained in 2010 and are, according to Amnesty International, both prisoners of conscience.</p><p>Fiennes says: \"Today, I appeal to David Cameron, prime minister of my country, to use the power of morality in politics, to disturb the sleep of conscience and urge Alexander Lukashenko, Europe's last dictator, to end the torture of his own people and release all political prisoners before the new year.\"</p><p>Despite the crackdown on the company, the Belarus Free Theatre continues to perform – at great personal danger and necessarily underground – in Belarus. Kaliada and her husband, Nicolai Khalezin, lead the company in exile and now live in the UK. In May, the company staged King Lear in Belarusian at Shakespeare's Globe to critical acclaim. Next year it will bring its new production, Trash Cuisine, to the Young Vic.</p><p>Stoppard said the situation in Belarus was bleak and there was more that the EU should be doing. \"Democracies ought to be trying to make democracy contagious,\" he said, adding that he was full of admiration for the campaigners. \"They are trying to remind the world at large that the Belarus problem hasn't gone away – it's got worse.</p><p>\"The point is, what was true in the good old bad old days of communism is still true in the case of the Belarusian dictatorship. It is that publicity is definitely an inhibiting factor on people who would just like to have a free hand when it comes to thumping dissent on the back of the neck. Just the fact that this makes the news now and again is extremely important.\"</p><p>The initiative is about keeping the stories of unjustly persecuted people alive, giving moral support, he added. \"It is about letting these people know that you haven't been filed away under 'oblivion'.\"</p><p>One year ago, an artists' manifesto for Belarus was published, calling for free speech and signed by Stoppard, Ai Weiwei and, in one of his last public acts, Václav Havel.</p><p>Irina Bogdanova, the director of <a href=\"http://www.freebelarusnow.org/\" title=\"\">Free Belarus Now</a>, said of the new initiative: \"I &nbsp;believe that sometimes what politicians can't do, people who genuinely care can. I hope that the voice of UK artistic elite will carry a strong message to the government and galvanize politicians into action.</p><p>\"Messages coming from their hearts can't go unnoticed. I wish for a miracle to happen and for political prisoners to be with their loved ones for the new year celebration.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 19 December 2012 to clarify details of the initiative highlighting the plight of political prisoners.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401278539|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|27b3b138c3fa16141f6023f09aaf1430145215b1 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Netherlands' iconoclastic populist and Islam-baiter <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/geert-wilders\" title=\"\">Geert Wilders</a> is plotting a new campaign to rile the political establishment – a \"resistance tour\" of the country.</p><p>It is not difficult to discern where Wilders, who combines far-right anti-immigrant positions with leftist welfarism, is getting his inspiration: Rome.</p><p>The barnstorming and highly effective campaign by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/beppe-grillo\" title=\"\">Beppe Grillo</a> and his Five Star Movement in Italy, combining the latest in social media and internet savvy with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/11/beppe-grillo-italy-general-election\" title=\"\">old-fashioned piazza-pounding up and down the country</a>, has transformed Italian politics. It may yet amplify its effect across a Europe uncommonly volatile and vulnerable to a Grillo-style insurrection.</p><p>Wilders promised to take to the bike paths, squares and shopping malls of small-town Holland later this year to mobilise resistance to Europe, immigration and bailing out Greece with Dutch taxpayers' money.</p><p>That's an agenda that fits squarely with Nigel Farage's, following Ukip's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/mar/01/ukip-victory-revulsion-nigel-farage\" title=\"\">triumph coming second and beating the Tories in Eastleigh</a>, leaving the party leader relishing next year's elections for the European parliament.</p><p>Next door to Holland in the Belgian region of Flanders, the national political establishment is running scared of, while closing ranks to try to stop, the new mayor of Antwerp, Bart De Wever, who hopes to \"confederalise\" Belgium en route to killing the country off altogether.</p><p>De Wever, leading his New Flemish Alliance, is regarded as the most popular politician in Belgium.</p><p>Separatism, in Antwerp or Barcelona, is one grassroots response to the financial and economic crisis that now appears to be raising much more fundamental questions about political legitimacy across Europe.</p><p>But the backlash against the tight fiscal one-shape-fits-all orthodoxy spearheaded by Germany and orchestrated by Brussels takes various forms across Europe. In Greece the hard-left Syriza movement has prospered, along with the neo-fascist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/golden-dawn\" title=\"\">Golden Dawn</a>, which added violence to the list of instruments deployed in the backlash of the new politics.</p><p>In Denmark, the reaction has been the more common one of Ukip-style protest politics, with opinion polls this week showing the nationalist, anti-immigrant, rightwing Danish People's party has overtaken the governing social democrats in support.</p><p>The suddenness with which Grillo has emerged and taken one in four of Italian votes may have shocked the traditional governing elite across the EU, but it shows little sign of knowing how to respond or adjusting to the message being sent by voters who have sent incumbents tumbling one after the other from Greece to Finland over the past three years.</p><p>Where voters have not \"kicked out the bums\", the big EU rulers have acted instead, with Berlin, Paris, Brussels, and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt conspiring to bring down elected prime ministers Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and George Papandreou in Greece.</p><p>The message to the Italians from the German government this week was \"you may have kicked out our politicians, but you must not kick out their policies\". That was echoed by the European commission in Brussels, while the German opposition social democrat leader, Peer Steinbrück, ventured to suggest that the Italians had voted for \"clowns\".</p><p>On Thursday the outgoing Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, comprehensively trounced in the election, attended a European commission conference in Brussels where he enjoyed a standing ovation almost as if he had been the victor. The mismatch between the popular and elite verdicts was striking.</p><p>Monti said that in his 15 months in office he deliberately never told Italians that his programme of austerity, structural reforms, and tax rises was being implemented because of EU orders. Then he added: \"Although of course it was true that the European Union was asking for them.\"</p><p>Given his failure, there may now be a slight shift to soften the edges of German-prescribed austerity while EU leaders also harp on, but do nothing, about repairing the vast gap opening up between the more integrationist policies they are pursuing and democratic accountability and legitimacy to underpin them.</p><p>Asked this week about this discrepancy and whether growth could be generated by austerity, a former European prime minister who also served as a senior EU official told the Guardian: \"There is no growth, there won't be any growth.\"</p><p>\"Voters now associate structural reforms with slump, rising unemployment and social stress,\" said Charles Grant and Simon Tilford of the Centre for European Reform in a paper published on Friday. \"The Berlin-Brussels-Frankfurt consensus on austerity that Monti's government [pursued] has discredited the very reforms that are needed to boost the Italian economy.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/404875134|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|1377a1209e40f9d7c60f92c8cb2d7bfde33d45de -->",

        "headline":"Beaver kills man in Belarus",
        "body":"<p>A beaver has attacked a 60-year-old fisherman in Belarus, slicing an artery and causing him to bleed to death.</p><p></p><p>It was the latest in a series of beaver attacks on humans in the country, as the rodents, who have razor-sharp teeth, have turned increasingly aggressive after wandering near homes, shops and schools.</p><p></p><p>\"The character of the wound was totally shocking,\" said the village doctor Leonty Sulim. \"We had never run into anything like this before.\"</p><p></p><p>Once hunted nearly to extinction in Europe, beavers have made a comeback as hunting has been banned or restricted and new populations were introduced.</p><p></p><p>In Belarus, a former Soviet republic between Russia and Poland, the beaver population has tripled in the past decade to an estimated 80,000, according to wildlife experts. That has caused beavers increasingly to encroach on populated areas.</p><p></p><p>The Belarusian emergency services said they have received a rash of reports of aggression by beavers, which can weigh up to 30kg (65lbs) and stand about a metre (3ft) high. Officials have responded to some calls by sending out crews to drive away the animals, often by spraying them with water from a fire hose.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman, who has not been named at the request of his family, was driving with friends toward the Shestakovskoye lake, west of the capital, Minsk, when he spotted the beaver along the side of the road and stopped the car. As he tried to grab the animal to have his picture taken, it bit him several times. One of the bites cut a major artery in his leg, according to Sulim.</p><p></p><p>The man's friends were unable to stem the bleeding, and he was pronounced dead when he arrived at Sulim's clinic in the village of Ostromechevo.</p><p></p><p>He is the only person known to have died from a beaver attack in Belarus.</p><p>The rise in the number of attacks is attributed partly to spring bringing about more aggressive behaviour in young beavers that are sent away to stake out their own territory. Largely nocturnal, beavers can also become disoriented during the daytime and attack out of fear, according to Viktor Kozlovsky, a wildlife expert.</p><p></p><p>Kozlovsky said the large beaver population was beginning to cause significant damage to forests and farms. The forestry ministry said it was encouraging the hunting of beavers, once prized for their fur and gland secretions used for medicinal purposes. But since they are such easy targets near dams, says the ministry spokesman Alexander Kozorez, \"beaver hunting holds little sporting interest\".</p><p></p><p>\"Hunting them is more like work,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409682039|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|405225b4c8701756a4b64ca3ce01e1ebaca72ace -->",

        "headline":"EU helping prop up Belarus president Lukashenko, says opposition",
        "body":"<p>The EU is playing a key role in propping up the rule of Alexander Lukashenko, widely seen as \"Europe's last dictator\", according to one of the country's leading opposition figures who spent a year in jail after challenging the leader for the presidency.</p><p>A policy paper has been delivered to all 28 EU foreign ministries this week, along with a letter calling on ministers to back a broadening of sanctions against Belarusian individuals and companies. It is signed by a number of NGOs and activists, including Andrei Sannikov, who stood for the presidency in 2010, in elections widely seen as rigged.</p><p>\"Europe is again pursuing a policy of engagement,\" Sannikov said. \"But the policy of engagement with dictators simply doesn't work.\"</p><p>Sannikov was beaten by police <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/30/belarus-lukashenko-rivals-charged-over-protests?guni=Article:in%20body%20\" title=\"\">and arrested at a rally that turned violent</a> following the 2010 vote, and later sentenced to five years in prison in May 2011, for organising mass unrest. He was released about a year later, following international pressure. Sannikov claimed that sanctions are the only way to force the Belarusian regime to release its remaining political prisoners, and make much-needed concessions to civil society – Belarus is the only country in Europe to retain the death penalty, with Lukashenko running the economy and political system on neo-Soviet lines.</p><p>EU sanctions are already in place against some individuals and firms in Belarus, and are due for routine annual renewal at the end of the month. Sannikov and others claim they are ineffective, as they do not cover the main sources of income for Lukashenko and his regime.</p><p>The policy paper outlines a number of businessmen identified as Lukashenko's \"bagmen\" but who are not currently covered by the punitive sanctions. The paper identified Belarusian oligarchs whose businesses, it said, would be impossible without the \"permission and deep involvement\" of the regime. One, Yuri Chizh, is already present on the sanctions list, along with most of his companies, although three of his profitable firms were left off last year after lobbying from Latvia.</p><p>The activists demand that these companies, as well as firms belonging to businessmen Nikolai Vorobei and Alexander Shakutin, are also included on the sanctions list.</p><p>Sannikov said he personally handed the letter to the minister for Europe, David Lidington, earlier this week, and asked him to pass it on to the foreign secretary, William Hague.</p><p>In response to the claims, the Foreign Office said: \"We continue to be very clear with the Belarusian government in public and in private. All EU member states agree that there can be no change in the EU's position, including sanctions, until we see the immediate release and rehabilitation of the [seven] remaining political prisoners.  Absent any positive change in Belarus, sanctions will be rolled over in October.</p><p>\"We regularly discuss the situation in Belarus with our EU partners, and have done so in recent weeks. The UK, along with all EU [members states], remains concerned about the situation in Belarus, the lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law.\"</p><p>Recent changes in the rules governing sanctions mean that in order for an individual or company to be included on the list, the EU merely has to be satisfied that it either benefits from, or supports, the regime.</p><p>\"It is very difficult to prove that these companies give a percentage of their profits to the regime, but it is much easier to show that they are benefiting from it, because they clearly all get very beneficial agreements,\" said an international human rights lawyer who consulted on the paper.</p><p>The policy paper also demands that sanctions are extended to cover state-controlled oil and potash export companies.</p><p>In 2012, overall exports from Belarus to the EU totalled €12.9bn (£10.9bn), including transit fees, according to the report's authors. The real figures are often disguised amid the huge revenues that Belarus receives from both transit and re-export fees. Another loophole involves the re-registration of several Belarusian companies in Latvia, with thinly veiled attempts to hide their real owners to avoid sanctions.</p><p>\"Sanctions exist on paper, and the EU thinks it is putting pressure on Belarus, but in reality they are not working any more,\" said Yuri Dzhibladze, one of the co-ordinators of the policy paper.</p><p>Sannikov put it more bluntly: \"It is the EU that is propping up Lukashenko's repressive apparatus.\"</p><p>According to the authors, Lukashenko will be vulnerable to financial pressure ahead of the 2015 presidential election, as he tries to maintain salaries and pensions at artificially high levels. Financial analysts claim that the moderate well-being of most Belarusians has only been possible via huge subsidies from the Kremlin, which dried up when Moscow became irritated with Lukashenko's unwillingness to sell it key infrastructure.</p><p>\"He does not care about resolutions,\" said Dzhibladze, pointing to dozens of resolutions by the UN Human Rights Council, the EU and other international bodies calling on Belarus to release political prisoners and improve rule of law. \"We believe that targeted and smart sanctions are the only way to make Lukashenko act on his international commitments.\"</p><p>The activists' problem is that in order for sanctions to take effect, all 28 EU members states have to agree, and the bloc has faced particular obstruction from Latvia and Slovenia over the inclusion of Belarusian oligarchs on the sanctions list. Any inclkusion would lose the countries  significant revenue streams.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, business interests often triumph over values,\" said Dzhibladze.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420181842|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|5b6a01f365bcd931f5b5fcd496fc3ebe4dd4d46b -->",
