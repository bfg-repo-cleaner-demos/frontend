Photograph: guardian.co.uk</figcaption></figure><p>Kate Winslet is on the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/14/kate-winslet-vogue-photos_n_4096789.html\">cover of this month's Vogue</a> and the photo is unbelievable.</p><p>I mean, literally unbelievable. The 38-year-old, who does OK without <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/21/mario-testino-interview-fashion-photography\">Mario Testino's</a> help, looks in this portrait like a CGI version of herself. Her hair is detachable plastic; her eyes are like marbles. Her expression, which I guess is her own, albeit under Testino's direction, is sort of mysterious with a touch of, \"Help! I've been laminated!\"</p><p>It is abominably, thrillingly awful.</p><p>Like the plastic surgery debate, the airbrushing debate never gets us anywhere. Who, given the kind of scrutiny these women fall under, wouldn't beg and plead for a little help from the art department? Not that they need much encouraging. It's a catch-22: the movie and beauty industries won't change until older women are more visible, but older women don't want to be visible until the industries change. (And by older, obviously, I mean post-34.)</p><p>Who can blame them? You could probably mount a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/29/malcolm-gladwell-david-and-goliath-interview\">Malcolm Gladwell-type argument</a> that, like drug use in sport, women movie stars should be allowed to use any resources available to them, to level the playing field against the God-given gifts of youth and symmetry. It puts the rest of us under pressure, of course, and trickles down into all sorts of considerations, but there comes a point in life when you understand you aren't a movie star and move on. Honestly, good luck to them.</p><p>In this case, the Vogue cover will probably end up doing us all favour, since it's so blatantly, revealingly ludicrous. Testino, whose job I recall seeing described once as being that of making beautiful people look more beautiful, has always produced crashingly boring portraits, which kitsch out every last shred of his subjects' humanity. Say what you like about Annie Leibovitz, at least she brings props.</p><p>The actual interview with Winslet, on the other hand, is quite good. She defends her right to have three children by three different fathers and, sounding like Edith Evans, says briskly:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[M]y kids don't go back and forth; none of this 50/50 time with the mums and dads. My children live with me; that is it. That is it!</p></blockquote><p>It's the kind of quote that, if you're not careful, will land you a <a href=\"http://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/taunton_news/10693454.One_arrested_after_Fathers4Justice__Spiderman__ends_Taunton_bridge_protest/\">guy in a Spiderman suit</a> with a Fathers 4 Justice placard on your doorstep.</p><p>Perhaps, the Barbie-like cover shot will repel people; perhaps, there will be enough outrage to provoke Winslet to respond, as she did after she was airbrushed on the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2643777.stm\">cover of GQ</a> ten years ago. Though, that was slightly different, since weight was a factor and Winslet has always campaigned about size-ism.</p><p>But this is ageism: they've stripped the lines from her face, and, at 38, she is entering the danger zone for actresses and is probably inclined to capitulate. (On point, I saw a preview of a new biopic of Dickens last week, in which Ralph Fiennes plays the hero and Kristin Scott Thomas, his former leading lady from The English Patient, plays <em>the mother</em> of his mistress.)</p><p>The best response to the Vogue cover is to laugh: the magazine is so far out to sea at this point, it has no sense of how transparent its manipulations are. It's like the inverse of Dorian Grey â€“ as the portraits on the cover get more and more \"perfect\", the body of the product gets ever more sickly. You almost wonder if, as in Spike Jonze's new movie, Her, it is making a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/sep/09/spike-jonze-her-scarlett-johansson\">satirical point about realism</a>, although neither satire nor point-making is quite the magazine's style. Its style, this month at least, is flat and fake, a fantasy that fails on its own terms.</p><p>The grotesque can be beautiful, but not here.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420070199|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|d42b2e32e1c71950e72117b745e460bc6301480e -->",

        "body":"<p>Suppose you were to have a debate about \"chemicals\" and whether they were a bad thing. There's no doubt that lots of people agree. Harmful chemicals are something they will pay extra to avoid, just as they will pay to avoid tomatoes that have been genetically modified. But it would be a difficult debate for people who understand chemistry. I felt like that on Tuesday night, debating religion at York University with the Oxford chemist (and atheist) <a href=\"http://philosopedia.org/index.php/Peter_Atkins\" title=\"\">Peter Atkins</a>. My side suffered a crushing defeat but I never felt that the people denouncing \"religion\" knew anything about it at all.</p><p>Just as \"chemicals\" means nasty things produced from oil and added to shampoo to some people, so \"religion\" meant, for most of the audience, Christianity or Islam.</p><p>If you take a young, white, middle-class British audience and ask them if the world would be a better place without Christianity or Islam, of course many will suppose it would. All that they know about those religions is that the moderates are opposed to sex, which is nonsensical if not actively evil, while the extremists are nonsensical and evil in all kinds of other ways as well. Nor will they know many believers socially. Religiously fervent students are quite rightly shunned by everyone normal.</p><p>The trouble is that nothing in this harmlessly parochial view equips people to think about religion in general. And it can easily lead to the terrible confusion that follows when we consider religious belief, or religions, \"irrational\".</p><p>The confusion here comes from supposing that whatever is not rational must be irrational and forgetting that there is a huge area of life where questions of rationality are wholly irrelevant. To ask whether religions are rational makes as much sense as asking whether they are pale green, or whether they taste like orange juice.</p><p>Yet underlying the rejection of religion as \"irrational\" is a completely unfounded belief that whatever replaces it must be more rational. If anything does replace a religion, it will in fact be something that does the same job â€“ which, as far as I am concerned, makes it another religion. The needs that religion meets â€“ for society as much as for the individual â€“ arise from the nature of the world and of our evolved natures. It completely mystifies me that Darwinians can be shallow optimists. They will cheerfully explain that religions promote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/aug/13/religion-human-evolution-group-identity\" title=\"\">\"groupishness\"-building</a> without asking whether groupishness-building is a successful strategy, as it very obviously is. Instead, they talk as if we could eliminate groupishness if only we could get rid of those other bastards, the groupish ones who build groups.</p><p>This is the kind of thinking that a university education is meant to eliminate, or at least weaken. I can't say I accomplished much along those lines the other day.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420179252|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|d05311fad2654083e5098971521ffc092d79cb20 -->",

        "body":"<p><em>This article was published on the English-language website of the <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2013-10/13/c_132794246.htm\">Chinese government's official news agency, Xinhua, on 13 October 2013</a>, before the conclusion of a deal in Washington on the US government shutdown and debt ceiling:</em></p><p>As US politicians of both political parties are still shuffling back and forth between the White House and the Capitol Hill without striking a viable deal to bring normality to the body politic they brag about, it is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanized world.</p><p>Emerging from the bloodshed of the second world war as the world's most powerful nation, the United States has since then been trying to build a global empire by imposing a postwar world order, fueling recovery in Europe, and encouraging regime change in nations that it deems hardly Washington-friendly. With its seemingly unrivaled economic and military might, the United States has declared that it has vital national interests to protect in nearly every corner of the globe, and been habituated to meddling in the business of other countries and regions far away from its shores.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US government has gone to all lengths to appear before the world as the one that claims the moral high ground, yet covertly doing things that are as audacious as torturing prisoners of war, slaying civilians in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/12/pakistan-us-drone-strikes\">drone attacks</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/08/brazil-accuses-canada-spying-nsa-leaks\">spying</a> on world leaders.</p><p>Under what is known as the Pax Americana, we fail to see a world where the United States is helping to defuse violence and conflicts, reduce poor and displaced population, and bring about real, lasting peace.</p><p>Moreover, instead of honoring its duties as a responsible leading power, a self-serving Washington has abused its superpower status and introduced even more chaos into the world by shifting financial risks overseas, instigating regional tensions amid territorial disputes, and fighting unwarranted wars under the cover of outright lies. As a result, the world is still crawling its way out of an economic disaster thanks to the voracious Wall Street elites, while <a href=\"http://www.arabnews.com/news/467967\">bombings and killings</a> have become virtually daily routines in Iraq years after Washington claimed it has liberated its people from tyrannical rule.</p><p>Most recently, the cyclical stagnation in Washington for a viable bipartisan solution over a federal budget and an approval for <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/budget-debt-and-deficits/us-debt-ceiling-costs-consequences/p24751\">raising debt ceiling</a> has again left many nations' tremendous dollar assets in jeopardy and the international community highly agonized. Such alarming days when the destinies of others are in the hands of a hypocritical nation have to be terminated, and a new world order should be put in place, according to which all nations, big or small, poor or rich, can have their key interests respected and protected on an equal footing.</p><p>To that end, several corner stones should be laid to underpin a de-Americanized world.</p><p>For starters, all nations need to hew to the basic principles of the international law, including respect for sovereignty, and keeping hands off domestic affairs of others. Furthermore, the authority of the United Nations in handling global hotspot issues has to be recognized. That means no one has the right to wage any form of military action against others without a UN mandate.</p><p>Apart from that, the world's financial system also has to embrace some substantial reforms. The developing and emerging market economies need to have more say in major international financial institutions including the World Bank and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund</a>, so that they could better reflect the transformations of the global economic and political landscape.</p><p>What may also be included as a key part of an effective reform is the introduction of a new international reserve currency that is to be created to replace the dominant US dollar, so that the international community could permanently stay away from the spillover of the intensifying domestic political turmoil in the United States.</p><p>Of course, the purpose of promoting these changes is not to completely toss the United States aside, which is also impossible. Rather, it is to encourage Washington to play a much more constructive role in addressing global affairs.</p><p>And among all options, it is suggested that the beltway politicians first begin with ending the pernicious impasse.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420265698|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|2235db519b21958c531a79e9262176590149cfb8 -->",

        "headline":"What does China want with Britain's nuclear industry?",
        "body":"<p>For a chancellor so keen on the defence of UK national sovereignty against democratic Europeans, George Osborne's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/17/china-buy-uk-nuclear-power-stations-george-osborne\" title=\"\">unbridled enthusiasm for Chinese investment in the UK's critical infrastructure</a> is striking. If all these memorandums of understanding come to fruition, Chinese entities will hold important stakes in water in the UK, airports, IT infrastructure and now nuclear power generation, all without a serious national debate on any potential risks such involvement might bring.</p><p>Since the Chinese government does its homework, it knows that Osborne represents a country reduced to penury by the financial crisis, and with some tricky, big-ticket items on its wishlist. Since the Chinese appreciate deference from their visitors, they must have been delighted by the chancellor. Britain is open for business, as he likes to say. Just make me an offer.</p><p>Neither China's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/16/china-investment-corporation-eurozone-austerity-jin-liqun\" title=\"\">sovereign wealth fund</a> nor its state-owned enterprises are philanthropic. All have large war chests, and their search for profitable, secure investments around the world has stimulated competition among aspirant recipients. But good bargains are not always done in haste and a number of unanswered questions hang over China's proposed investment, future majority stake-holding and possible future operational involvement in Britain's nuclear power.</p><p>Some are hardy perennials: the world has 270,000 tonnes of high-level waste in temporary storage, an unlovely heap that grows by 10,000 tonnes each year. In 50 years of nuclear power, nobody has come up with a workable plan for the million years that safety regulations demand. Are the costs of that, and of decommissioning, built into the deal and if so, who pays?</p><p>Then there is public subsidy: nobody has ever built a nuclear power plant without it, but the mandatory opening up of European electricity systems to competition means consumers are no longer obliged to underwrite unlimited costs, or to pay for expensive nuclear energy. This transfers the financial risk to the owners and financiers â€“ hence the difficulty of finding the cash. What is different here?</p><p><a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-04/26/c_124633021.htm\" title=\"\">French enthusiasm</a> is explained by the attempt to save their industry after decades of nuclear chill: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/16/japan-nuclear-shutdown-raises-energy-prices\" title=\"\">Japan's plants are currently shuttered</a>, for obvious reasons; new licensing is suspended in the United States; many countries (Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium) are phasing out nuclear power, or have never had it (Ireland, Austria, Norway, Greece, Portugal, Italy and Denmark).</p><p>But what is in it for China? China has been the global nuclear industry's main hope of survival in recent years. It is a newcomer, starting to build its first commercial reactor only in 1985. It now has 16 in operation and a further 26 under construction, and more are planned. Now China hopes to become the world's next big nuclear exporter and sees involvement in a British plant as a key step to gaining credibility in the market.</p><p>This is an ambitious programme, not least on the management side. Most nuclear accidents resulted from human error and today industry experts are worried by China's weak regulatory structure and its unproven capacity to build a safe management culture at such speed. Even in China, post <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\" title=\"\">Fukushima</a>, public anxiety over the nuclear programme has begun to spill out on to the streets: earlier this year, public protests halted the construction of a waste processing plant in Guangdong that the authorities had insisted was perfectly safe.</p><p>Surely we, too, should be asking more questions of a chancellor who appears to think that Chinese money buys him out of the intractable difficulties and uncertain costs of nuclear power? Will British consumers end up paying high energy prices to guarantee a Chinese investor a good return? What future leverage will Chinese investment in British infrastructure give to an emerging power that frequently says it does not accept established global rules? What degree of transparency and accountability can we, as supplicants, enforce on our new partner? What guarantee have we that in depending on Chinese finance, we haven't surrendered more than we bargained for? Perhaps it is not too late to ask.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420263056|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|4ec73b6a32070b51210ff0c7155b973cdb5b8168 -->",

As much as I might like to point to my lectures, or the 85 pieces of assigned background reading, the most obvious answer turns out to be in online discussion forums â€“ where the conversation is so compelling that I have posted more than 250 times myself. There, in hundreds of asynchronous conversations with peers in every time zone, thousands of learners are working out what they think about the intersection of the web with journalism and media, as they peer through the lens provided by this one particular company.</p><p>I really shouldn't have been surprised by the quality of discourse that my teaching assistants and I are tracking (for an average of 10 hours a day), given that a pre-course and a mid-course survey both indicate that 80% or more of the students in out class have four-year college degrees or better. And I really didn't stop to think about how rich the discussions would be due to the diversity of geography and life experiences of the student body â€“ only 20% of whom report they live in the United States. The second largest cohort comprises students in India.</p><p>My teacher friend also wanted to know how I could gauge how much the students were learning. But because the class is still running, my answers have to be framed as questions I am trying to answer myself.</p><p>First, with more than half the class never having taken a Mooc before, I wonder if what I'm observing is obscured by unfamiliarity with the platform, or the vagaries of technology and spotty bandwidth. The answer is yes, for some, but not for the majority.</p><p>Many students are clearly running the text of my lectures, their own work, and their peers' efforts through <a href=\"http://www.wiredacademic.com/2012/09/found-in-translation-mooc-player-coursera-partners-with-amara-for-wiki-translations/\">translation software</a> â€“ some of it twice, in a tech-driven version of that old parlor game \"telephone\". So, a second question is whether the learning is masked by language issues. The answer is sometimes, but not usually.</p><p>A third question is if open-book, untimed, automatically-graded quizzes can be valuable in helping students assess their learning. The answer here is 50:50. Hey, the class is partly about Google; so they can pretty much Google the answers, right?</p><p>Last, I must ask how good peer-graded homework assignments really are for this type of learning. That question requires the most reflection. Language limitations, time pressures and job responsibilities â€“ not to mention, the reality that anyone who's on the web can be distracted from a task at any time â€“ may make it too early to judge definitively. But because many people who appear to be among the class's best students are sharing their very, very low opinion of peer-grading, attention must be paid.</p><p>Let's frame this as a business challenge. My students may not be paying with dollars and rupees, but they are paying with something equally scarce â€“ their time and attention. If massive online courses are ever going to include paid options, as well as classes that are open and free, the efficacy of peer-grading is an issue that universities and platform providers must address.</p><p>Meanwhile, as the instructor, I am learning a lot, as well. And I see, through the growing sophistication of their weekly homework, that students are improving their understanding not just of this topic, but also of their own habits and behavior. To \"pass\", students need to score 70 out of a possible 100 points during the six-week course, and I expect that thousands will do just that.</p><p>Even in a free course, students hold themselves and their classmates to high standards. The more students are engaged with one another, the more likely they are to push themselves to achieve those standards. And again, these engaged, self-critical students are well worth the time spent listening and communicating with them.</p><p>To realize the potential of the Mooc \"movement\", <a href=\"http://www.theawl.com/2013/02/how-to-save-college\">universities</a>, <a href=\"http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/\">faculties</a>, and platform providers are all going to need to up our games. As has always been true on a traditional, physical campus, the best students already have.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420180516|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|bbd8c25c43b7c5bc812125c2c8cab90542c29f14 -->",

        "body":"<p>In February 1972, US president Richard Nixon made a \"surprise\" visit to China, recognising Mao Zedong's communist regime and opening the door to the more or less peaceful relations that have prevailed ever since between the two countries. Although Nixon had built his political career on the anticommunist campaigns that were in part a reaction to the \"loss of China\" in 1949, he was then following in the footsteps of General Charles de Gaulle, who had established diplomatic relations with China eight years earlier, in 1964, because, as De Gaulle said, one must \"recognise the world as it is\", and \"before being communist, China is China\".</p><p>In 1973 Nixon and Henry Kissinger signed the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/honor/peopleevents/e_paris.html\" title=\"\">Paris accords</a> that put an official end to the US war in Vietnam. A decade before that, John F Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev resolved the Cuban missile crisis by, on the Soviet side, <a href=\"http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Cuban-Missile-Crisis.aspx\" title=\"\">withdrawing missiles from Cuba</a>, and, on the US side, by promising not to attack Cuba and withdrawing missiles from Turkey.</p><p>These events changed the course of history away from endless confrontation and the risk of global war. It must be remembered that neither China nor the Soviet Union nor North Vietnam met western standards of democracy, less so in fact than present-day Iran. De Gaulle, Kennedy, Nixon and Kissinger were no friends of communism and, on the other side, neither Khrushchev, Mao nor the Vietnamese had any use for capitalism and western imperialism.</p><p>Peace is not something to be made between friends but between adversaries. It is based on a recognition of reality. When countries or ideologies are in conflict, there are only two issues: total destruction of one side, as with Rome and Carthage, or peace and negotiations. As history shows, in the case of the Soviet Union, China and Vietnam, peace was a precondition that made the internal evolution of those countries possible.</p><p>During recent decades, when it comes to the Middle East, the west has forgotten the very notion of diplomacy. Instead, it has followed the line of \"total destruction of the enemy\", whether Saddam Hussein in Iraq, Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, the Assad regime in Syria or the Islamic Republic of Iran. That line has been based on ideology: a mixture of human rights fundamentalism and blind support for the \"only democracy in the region\", Israel. However, it has led to a total failure: this policy has brought no benefit whatsoever to the west and has only caused immense suffering to the populations that it claimed to be helping.</p><p>There are signs that the situation is changing. First, the British and then the American people and their representatives rejected a new war in Syria. Russia, the US and Syria reached an agreement over Syria's chemical weapons. US president Barack Obama is making moves towards honest negotiations with Iran, and the EU's foreign policy chief and Iran's foreign minister judged talks just concluded in Geneva as \"substantive and forward-looking\".</p><p>All these developments should be pursued with the utmost energy. The planned second Geneva conference on Syria must include all internal and external parties to the conflict if it is to constitute an important step towards finding a solution to the tragedy of that war-torn country. The unjust sanctions against Iran, as in the earlier case of Iraq, are severely punishing the population and must be lifted as soon as possible.</p><p>Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his supporters are staunchly opposed to these moves towards peace. But they must realise that we might start asking questions about the biggest elephant in the room: Israel's weapons of mass destruction. Why should that country, alone in the region, possess such weapons? If its security is sacrosanct, what about the security of the Palestinians, or of the Lebanese? And why should the US, in the midst of a dire financial crisis, continue to bankroll a country that superbly ignores all its requests, such as stopping settlements in the Occupied Territories?</p><p>The west must understand that before being Ba'athist or Islamist, or communist in the past, countries are inhabited by people possessing common humanity, with the same right to live, regardless of ideology. The west must choose realism that unites over ideology that divides. It is only then that we will move towards achieving our real interests, which presuppose peaceful relations between different social systems and mutual respect of national sovereignty.</p><p>Ultimately, our interests, if well understood, coincide with those of the rest of mankind.</p><p></p><p><em>â€¢ Hans Christof von Sponeck was UN assistant secretary general and United Nations humanitarian co-ordinator for Iraq from 1998-2000</em></p><p><em>Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann was president of the UN general assembly between 2008 and 2009 and foreign minister of Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990</em></p><p><em>Denis J Halliday was UN assistant secretary general from 1994-98</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420243981|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|ea593dc75c091994804bcc359426663cd893a52b -->",

        "headline":"The Koch brothers' beer offensive against Obamacare loses its fizz",
        "body":"<p>What's a family values conservative to do when every effort to protect millions of Americans from the scourge of affordable healthcare fails? </p><p>Break out the beer, of course. The latest campaign to kill off Obamacare in its infancy is now playing out on college campuses where a conservative group known as Generation Opportunity (GO), who are funded in part by the billionaire Koch brothers, is using the <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/10/14/3689755/young-are-being-recruited-to-help.html\">lure of free beer</a> and \"opt out\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_koozie\">beer koozies</a> to persuade young students not to buy health insurance â€“ or, at least, not to buy it from the Obamacare exchanges.</p><p>Traditionally, one might expect God-fearing conservatives to be warning youth about the dangers of alcohol consumption, rather than plying them with free liquor, but these are desperate times. The determined Koch brothers have already spent <a href=\"http://www.prwatch.org/news/2013/09/12247/breaking-new-list-dark-money-shell-game-groups-connected-kochs\">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> trying to derail the president's healthcare law. So far, though, despite their best efforts, Obamacare has proved as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-01/will-the-young-invincibles-join-obamacare-.html\">\"invincible\" as the young people</a> it needs to enroll. While it's unlikely that the beer exchanges, shall we call them, will be the game-changer, the Kochs may well end up driving many of us to drink with their relentless and futile vendetta to undo the law â€“ not just the college students.</p><p>Nearly every movement to \"educate the public\" about the \"dangers\" of Obamacare can be linked in some way to the Koch brothers, and this latest college campus effort is no different. Last month, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/koch-brothers-heritage-action-donation-98054.html\">Politico revealed</a> that GO has received $5.04m from the Koch-funded entity known as Freedom Works. This \"grassroots\" movement is now about to embark on an \"<a href=\"http://optout.org/\">Opt Out</a>\" tour of 20 college towns across the country as part of its effort to steer young people away from the Obamacare exchanges. As GO's 29-year-old president, Evan Feinberg, put it:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>What we're trying to communicate is, 'No, you're not actually required to buy health insurance' â€¦ you might have to pay a fine, but that's going to be cheaper for you, and better for you.</p></blockquote><p>After coming under criticism for this statement, Feinberg (who previously worked at the Charles Koch Institute) has since clarified that GO is not trying to persuade young people to opt out of buying insurance altogether, just from buying it through the healthcare exchanges.</p><p>Maybe, I'm naive to think that most young Americans will not fall for this cynical ploy, no matter how much free beer they are plied with. It seems to me that any campaign that is based on a false premise â€“ in this case, that young people could get cheaper insurance before Obamacare or since â€“ seems destined for failure. </p><p>According to a report released in September by the Department of the Health and Human Services, <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/09/20130917b.html\">56% of the people</a> who are applying for health insurance today will be able to get coverage through the health insurance marketplace for <em>less than $100 a month</em>. This means that a large percentage of the youth market that GO are targeting would be able to get comprehensive health coverage under Obamacare for a very low rate.</p><p>If Feinberg or any other GO employee genuinely knows about better insurance deals than that for students, it would be really helpful if they listed them on their Opt Out website. Surely, that would be a far better use of their Koch dollars than buying more crates of beer?</p><p>As it is, the Opt Out website contains no information beyond vague and unsubstantiated claims about Obamacare being a \"bad deal\", and two embarrassingly poorly made ads featuring a \"Creepy Uncle Sam\" character who pops up between a woman's legs as she undergoes a gynaecological exam and asks a young man to roll over while he pulls on a surgical glove. The message â€“ that government should stay out of healthcare â€“ is about as subtle as Miley Cyrus' recent sledgehammer licking antics.</p><p>Whether Creepy Uncle Sam and his creepier backers will succeed in bringing down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) remains to be seen, but the prognosis is not good. Since the ACA was signed into law in 2010, it has miraculously managed to withstand \"Hitler death panel\" comparisons, state by state efforts to block its implementation, a US supreme court challenge to its constitutionality and, most recently, a defunding effort that led to the federal government shutdown. </p><p>As the New York Times recently reported, the Koch brothers <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/us/a-federal-budget-crisis-months-in-the-planning.html?_r=0\">have been heavily involved</a> in all of these separate efforts through their generous funding of groups like Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action and, of course, Generation Opportunity. But so far, their efforts have been in vain. Not only is Obamacare still the law of the land, but the law has actually <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/gop-plummets-obamacare-soars-shutdown\">gained a major bump</a> in support since the shutdown stand-off.</p><p>As it happens, even the Koch brothers have begun to realize that their attempts to stop the ACA are getting them nowhere. Last week, a representative of Koch Industries sent a <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/10/koch-industries-doesnt-want-be-tainted-obamacare-prompted-shutdown/70350/\">letter</a> to members of the Senate distancing the company from efforts to defund Obamacare, while still making it clear that Koch really does not like the law. </p><p>Does this mean the Koch brothers are done with their various and multifaceted efforts to bring it down? Probably not, but if they at least scale back their efforts to just distributing free beers, that might not be such a bad thing.</p><p>After what they have put us all through, we deserve one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420191676|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|5337a05051b4ffb61ada51781ef49d009cdca8b5 -->",

        "body":"<p>I don't believe the Democrats <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/11/democrats-win-house-2014-midterms\">will win back the House of Representatives</a> in 2014. President Obama's low approval rating, combined with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_midterm_election\">usual midterm loss</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cla.temple.edu/ipa/wp-content/blogs.dir/8/files/2012/12/Bafumi-Erikson-Wlezien-Midterm-Elections.pdf\">normal movement away (pdf)</a> from the White House party on the national House ballot, should keep Republicans in control. Yet, there's a difference between thinking whether the Democrats \"will\" win back the House or whether they \"can\" win it back.</p><p>Right now, the Democrats hold a lead of about 4-5pt per the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-national-house-race\">HuffPollster</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/generic_congressional_vote-2170.html\">Real Clear Politics</a> average. Many have concluded that this lead would not be enough to take back the House, if the election were held today. However, I believe that it quite likely <em>would be enough</em>. </p><p>How so? Let's address a bunch of reasons people expect that a 4-5pt Democratic lead on the national House ballot would result in Republicans still holding the House â€“ and then show why I think those could be wrong. </p><p><strong>1. A uniform shift of 4-5pt on all House seats would still leave Republicans winning a majority of seats</strong></p><p>North Carolina Republican Congressman Robert Pittenger was the <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2013/01/02/1382471/thanks-to-gerrymandering-democrats-would-need-to-win-the-popular-vote-by-over-7-percent-to-take-back-the-house/\">\"median\" representative in 2012</a>. Half the races were decided by more than his 6.1pt margin and half were decided by less. Given that Democrats won the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012\">national House vote</a> by 1.4pt, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_national_swing\">uniform swing</a> across all districts would imply that Democrats would need to win the national House vote by 7.5pt to take back the House. </p><p>Count me as one of the people who does not believe in uniform swings. It's not that the uniform swing is uninformative; it's that it is very inexact. There are <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/g-o-p-has-2-in-3-chance-of-taking-house-model-forecasts/\">many factors</a> that go into House races, including challenger quality, money spent, and whether or not the incumbent is running for re-election. Most of those are unknown at this point for key races. </p><p>You only need to look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2006\">2006 election</a> to get an idea. Back <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2004\">in 2004</a>, Republicans won the national House vote by 2.6pt. They won the median district by a little over 10pt. In other words, there was that same 7.5pt pro-Republican bias between the national House vote and the median district in 2004 as there was last year.</p><p>When we examine 2006, we see the bias simply didn't hold. Democrats only won the national House vote by 8pt, which should have given them the thinnest of majorities per a uniform swing. Instead, they took 233, or 13 more, seats than a uniform swing implied. </p><p>The 218th seat won by the Democrats belonged to Leonard Boswell, who had actually taken the seat easily in 2004. He had health problems, which led to a closer than expected re-election campaign. Boswell, with a winning margin of 5.4pt, might have survived even if the national Democratic margin had been closer to 3pt. </p><p>My <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/20/democrats-have-a-chance-2014\">own math</a>, taking into account redistricting in 2011, says a 3pt Democratic win in the national vote and a takeover of the House would not be nearly as likely as in 2006; but a 4 or 5pt victory would probably do the trick.</p><p><strong>2. The experts say there are very few seats up for grabs</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings\">indispensable Cook Political Report</a> has only has 13 Democratic-held seats listed in the relatively competitive tossup or \"lean\" category. Of course, Democrats need to take 17 seats to win the House. The ratings reflect, among other things, a lack of strong challengers for the Democrats and lack of retirements by Republicans.</p><p>The thing is that expert ratings (like most polling) are not all that predictive a year out from an election. At this point in the 2006 cycle, there were 17 Republican seats in the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20060627180349/http://www.cookpolitical.com/races/report_pdfs/2006_house_comp_oct8.pdf\">lean or tossup categories (pdf)</a>. That's well short of the 30 seats that Democrats would ultimately take from Republicans. At this point in the 2010 cycle, there were 28 Democratic seats in the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101029020519/http://cookpolitical.com/charts/house/competitive_2009-10-08_12-03-36.php\">lean or tossup category</a>. Republicans, of course, went onto gain <em>63 seats</em> in 2010.</p><p>It's not until later in the cycle when individual seat rankings become quite useful. That's when potential challengers and incumbents read the national environment and decide to run or not. Chances are that if the 4-5pt Democratic lead holds, the individual seat rankings will reflect that edge. For now, individual seat ratings probably aren't all that helpful to understanding which way and how hard the wind is blowing.</p><p><strong>3. The Abramowitz model says Democrats need something like a 13pt margin on the national House ballot</strong></p><p>Alan Abramowitz's <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/midterm-forecast-democrats-may-gain-house-seats-in-2014-but-majority-probably-out-of-reach/\">national House ballot to seats model</a> seems to have <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/07/news/la-pn-small-democratic-gain-midterm-election-20130207\">unusual sway</a> among some. The model is elegant in the sense that it does a good job of trying to map the midterm penalty and how much exposure the majority party has, in a minimalistic fashion. The problem is that some don't seem to quite understand how the model should work.</p><p>It's not a straight national vote-to-seat equation. It's built for early September of a midterm year. Abramowitz isn't saying that a 13pt Democratic margin in the national House ballot on election day is what Democrats need to take over the House. What he is saying is that a 13pt lead in September is likely to shrink because of the natural movement away from the White House party on the national House ballot during the course of the election year. </p><p>Moreover, the model is inexact. It would be within the margin of error of the model for Democrats to take back the House with a 2pt September lead on the national House ballot. In 2010, the model forecasted a Republican gain of 45 seats per my calculation. That was 18 seats off the final Republican gain of 63 seats. </p><p>Abramowitz's forecast is a good starting-point for understanding how uphill is the Democrats' task in taking back the House, but it is far from perfect.</p><p><strong>4. The final national House ballot surveys are biased against Republicans</strong></p><p>Charlie Cook has a <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/off-to-the-races/midterm-elections-could-be-a-wave-but-who-s-going-to-drown-20130729\">rule that you subtract 2pt</a> from the Democratic margin on the final national House ballot to know how the national House vote is actually going to pan out. That may have worked over five years ago, though it doesn't seem to work anymore. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2008_generic_congressional_vote-2173.html\">2008</a>, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2010_generic_congressional_vote-2171.html\">2010</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2012_generic_congressional_vote-3525.html\">2012</a>, the Real Clear Politics average of the national House ballot underestimated the actual Democratic standing in the national House vote. So, there's no reason to think the final national House ballot will overstate the Democrats' standing in 2014.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There are plenty of reasons the Democrats won't win back the House. But it's not impossible that they will. If the same national environment that is producing a 4-5pt on the national House ballot still exists in a year's time, Democrats may very well win back the House.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420078259|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|a3e9d189de7d70899ad0b2d7b614590526dedb04 -->",

        "headline":"Pity poor Eleanor Catton, winning the Man Booker prize so young",
        "body":"<p>In 1956 Samuel Beckett, then 50 years old, wrote to his American publisher about how he viewed his newfound fame, as Waiting for Godot suddenly gave him an audience that had hitherto been ignoring him for decades. \"Success and failure on the public level never mattered much to me. In fact, I feel more at home with the latter, having breathed deep of its vivifying air all my writing life up to the last couple of years.\"</p><p>That's always been one of my favourite quotations: it advances the idea that success is somehow not good for one, and that failure is bracing and healthy for the soul. So we sympathise deeply with the unfortunate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/booker-prize-eleanor-catton-luminaries\" title=\"\">Eleanor Catton</a>, who at 28 has become the youngest-ever winner of the Man Booker prize. What is more, she did it with an 800-plus-page book. I am fairly sure there are plenty of people who, by the age of 28, have not read 800 pages, let alone written them.</p><p>As I grew up, I did what I suspect is very widespread practice: I would note my own age, and compare it with the ages of people I aspired to be like. So when I first got into the Beatles, aged 12, I would say to myself: \"Plenty of time yet,\" as I knew that I had 11 years before I needed to sign my first record deal (if we count from Lennon's age, not Harrison's). How foolish! Twenty-eight, McCartney's age when the Beatles split up, is now a dot in the rear-view mirror.</p><p>Contemplation of the successful young gets more depressing as we get older without achieving anything, apart from that time you won the girl's year nine discus event or, in my case, a year's free <a href=\"http://www.puffin.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Puffin Club</a> membership in 1974. It has all been downhill ever since and although â€“ like all authors â€“ I imagined, on the eve of my books' publications, that I would awake the next day to find myself, like Byron, famous, fame somehow remains elusive. (This happened to Byron after the publication of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jan/22/romantic-poets-lord-byron-childe-harold\" title=\"\">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</a>, when he was â€“ eurgh â€“ 24.)</p><p>The problem, I like to think, is peaking too early. One does not want to wear the batteries out. Well, that's what you say as the milestones fall. (Traditionally, the first one of these to topple is Jesus Christ, and everyone who has passed 33 has ruefully conceded that they have failed to establish a world religion by that age. At least God had the decency to wait until Muhammad was 40 before bestowing his visions upon him.)</p><p>We now tend to dwell on those who took a while to get cracking. Anton Bruckner was 48 before he composed a symphony he was happy with (and he was still tinkering with it 20 years later). Kenneth Grahame was 49 when he published The Wind in the Willows. Lowry didn't have his first London exhibition until the beginning of his sixth decade, which puts whippersnappers such as Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin in their place. Now round about the half-century mark themselves, they could be said, if the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/tracey-emin-and-damien-hirsts-works-could-lose-significant-value-after-death-8871263.html\" title=\"\">reviews and the evidence of my own eyes are anything to go by</a>, to be entering the twilight of their careers. Get knocked down at that age and it becomes harder to get up again.</p><p>So let us salute the masters â€“ or mistresses, if you prefer â€“ of the art of starting late: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/01/guardianobituaries.books1\" title=\"\">Mary Wesley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/12/working-old-age-dont-want-to-sleep\" title=\"\">Diana Athill</a>, 70 and â€“ amazingly â€“ 83, respectively, before their careers really got going. There is also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/08/nobel-laureate-peter-higgs-boson-elusive\" title=\"\">Professor Peter Higgs</a>, a Nobel laureate at 84 (albeit for work he'd done 50 years earlier). Contemplate these most worthy and excellent examples, breathe deeply of the vivifying air of failure, and heap pity upon the likes of poor Eleanor Catton, who is going to have to spend the rest of her life with a major achievement behind her.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420158488|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|193bc19d19f9a51c08443c01076fb7145b9d24f5 -->",

It&rsquo;s watching the immediate family of the 37th&nbsp;richest person in the world, Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/14/gina-rinehart-family-accused-kamikaze-trustee-proposal\">battle one another across courts, torts and media reports</a> with the civic equivalents of axes, staves and mouth-frothing fury.</p> <p>That there is no one yet bleeding on the ground from a battle-axe to the head does not detract from the entertainment value of the family&rsquo;s skirmishes, given what it reveals about the dark similarities of all families, as well as the unique realities of very rich people.</p> <p>The Hancock-Rinehart family story has the theatrical advantage over the sagas of middle Australia because their wealth buys their drama bigger props. Their now-dead patriarch,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lang_Hancock\">Lang Hancock</a>, was already from a rich landowning Western Australian family when he&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/archives/80days/stories/2012/01/19/3411295.htm\">discovered the world&rsquo;s largest iron ore deposit</a>&nbsp;in the Pilbara in 1952. With the discovery came enough ready cash for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/rineharts-halfsister-speaks-out-on-family-20120703-21fia.html\">messy questions about Hancock&rsquo;s child with an Aboriginal woman</a>&nbsp;to be raised, and huge sums to be donated to the campaigns of right-wing politicians like <a href=\"http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/remembering-lang/280/\">Joh Bjelke-Petersen</a>. It also provided him the platform to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/lang-hancock-was-almost-the-iron-man-of-australian-film/story-e6frg8h6-1226271969002\">call for the censorship</a>&nbsp;of work by Ralph Nader and John Kenneth Galbraith, lest their ideas wreck an Australia in which he believed &ldquo;the question of Aboriginal land rights and things of this nature shouldn&rsquo;t exist.\"</p> <p>His second marriage produced his only acknowledged daughter, Gina &ndash; and within a year of Gina&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s death, Hancock married his maid, Rose Porteous. As the granddaughter of a famous Filipino general, it really was Porteous&rsquo; extraordinary good fortune to meet an amorous billionaire within the three months she spent slumming it as a domestic on a temporary work visa. She was 39 years his junior, and the deterioration of their relationship in the months before Hancock&rsquo;s death impelled Rinehart into a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/04/26/1019441302945.html\">series of court actions</a>&nbsp;to contest whether Porteous&nbsp;had nagged Hancock&nbsp;towards mortality. Porteous&nbsp;was exonerated from any role in Hancock&rsquo;s death after years of legal agitation by Rinehart concluded only with a coronial inquest in 2001.</p> <p>So far, so much like a vintage episode of&nbsp;Dynasty&nbsp;that everyone can enjoy. Porteous, in her 1980s heyday, certainly rocked very similar frocks to Joan Collins at her best.</p> <p>As Hancock&rsquo;s only acknowledged child, Gina inherited control of 75% of Hancock Prospecting. What is at present in dispute is a remaining percentage of the fortune left by her father in a trust for her four children. Rinehart is the trustee of her children&rsquo;s stake, but, as the stake remains unvested, three of the four children are now battling their mother in court for delivery of their share. There are media gag orders, suppression statements and ongoing redistributions of power and alliance.</p> <p>On an internal and familiar level, of course, this is not an episode of&nbsp;Dynasty&nbsp;&ndash; it&rsquo;s a family implosion that must be enormously upsetting for the claimants. Let me assure the Rinehart-Hancocks that while their problems may be those occupying the public eye, when it comes to money and disputes over inheritance, few Australian families are spared the specific psychosis of greed and retribution that accompanies competitive claims of family members in the posthumous legal carve-up. Even my own humble clan spent years memorising the detail of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/63\">Family Provision Act (1995)</a>&nbsp;when the modest bequest of my grandmother to my mother, her carer, was contested by family members. Having gone though the process in which the intimacies of family relationships are spread as if on the slab at a scalpel party run by hemophiliac vampires, my heart goes out to anyone feeling that specific sharp stab &ndash; Hancock&rsquo;s offspring or not.</p> <p>But the Hancock-Rineharts feud also is about a symbolic corporate institution indulging some inner thumbwrestling&nbsp;while it continues to profit from this country&rsquo;s enduring Indigenous shame.&nbsp;Some people would consider, perhaps, that the iron ore wealth fought over by the Hancock-Rinehart family is actually that of the minelands&rsquo; traditional owners, the Martidja Banyjima people. Hancock could stake his mining claim there in 1952 because he was white, they were black and had no land rights under the flora and fauna act.&nbsp;</p> <p>Consider also that the mineral wealth of Hancock claims is not a wealth the family cares to share with the nation that provided their lease to mine there. The former Labor government fought a doomed campaign to at least tax the superprofits of the family business in order to redress the financial stake of the nation. Rinehart, who always <a href=\"http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/gina-rinehart-urges-australians-to-fight-against-c\">opposed carbon and mining taxes</a>, responded as only a billionaire can or would, by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://theconversation.com/why-does-gina-rinehart-want-control-of-fairfax-7774\">purchasing media interests like Fairfax</a>&nbsp;and the <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/business/companies/rinehart-threatens-to-sell-her-stake-in-fairfax/story-fnda1bsz-1226408507588\">Ten Network</a> &ndash; although Fairfax&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/26/gina-rinehart-threatens-exit-fairfax\">fought her desire to editorially control</a>&nbsp;its publications.</p> <p>And while Rinehart has been claiming that she&rsquo;s only fighting her children to protect her family&rsquo;s $4bn trust from capital gains tax, her respect for the incomes of other families has not been so high. Despite enjoying an estimated personal wealth of more than $18bn, only last year Gina Rinehart&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-05/rinehart-says-aussie-workers-overpaid-unproductive/4243866\">commented</a>&nbsp;that &ldquo;Africans want to work, and its workers are willing to work for less than two dollars a day&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p> <p>While following the latest events in the court proceedings as one would a&nbsp;Dallas&nbsp;boxed-set on a wet weekend, there can exist a temptation to pity the Hancock-Rineharts. It&rsquo;s easy to mutter &ldquo;all that money and they can&rsquo;t buy happiness&rdquo;, and to explain away Rinehart&rsquo;s anti-tax campaign as a sad symptom of growing up in&nbsp;her family.</p> <p>Yep, I&rsquo;m sure it sucked &hellip; but turn off the sympathy taps, Australia. Save your tears for an actual soap opera.&nbsp;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420082129|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|3f29880584ad2df5cd8210e87f640a32450c6fa0 -->",

        "body":"<p>When the first Christmas items start appearing in the supermarket, you know the year&rsquo;s starting to wind down. Recognising that the public needs a rest from him, Tony Abbott is also keeping a low profile, eager to ease us into a more relaxed and comfortable state. Keep calm, carry on and enjoy the coming summer knowing that &ldquo;the adults are running the show&rdquo;, as he says.</p> <p>There&rsquo;s nothing new about conservatives slowing down the pace of reform, offering paternal protection and preserving the status quo. Some might say that&rsquo;s what defines them.</p> <p>However, Abbott is failing in what Ronald Reagan reportedly described as a government&rsquo;s first duty: to protect its people. Global warming poses the biggest ever threat to Australians and the Australian way of life, but he is siding with the enemy. This week he has put us on the fast-track to become the first ever country to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/16/abbott-repeal-carbon-tax-stalled\">introduce a price on pollution, and then repeal it</a>.</p> <p>Countries&rsquo; identities are always contested and many eschew scoundrels taking refuge in nationalism. Fair enough. But surely those who profess to be conservatives should take their creed seriously. Even the left is intent on defending some important but threatened parts of the Australian institutional arrangement. A decent amount of time off work to spend with your family and friends, for example. A Christmas break where we can enjoy Australia&rsquo;s precious natural environment, our bush and beaches. A standard of health enjoyed by most of the population that ranks with some of the world&rsquo;s best.</p> <p>Global warming threatens all of this. Global warming is already damaging the health and the way of life of ordinary Australians and unless we act those threats will become catastrophic. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation&nbsp;(CSIRO)&nbsp;predicts that under extreme climate change, the kind of bushfires we saw in Victoria on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday_bushfires\">Black Saturday</a> may happen on average once every two years (and we shouldn&rsquo;t forget that more people died from the summer&rsquo;s heatwave than the fires themselves). I drove past world-renowned wineries in southwest WA a few weeks ago, where the Climate Commission says climate change is drying the region, threatening WA&rsquo;s agriculture and biodiversity. The Climate Commission also warns of <a href=\"http://www.globaloceancommission.org/issues/climate-change/\">impacts on our fish stocks</a> as the ocean absorbs CO2 and acidifies.</p> <p>So when Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s tabloids this week start reporting a leaked draft from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggesting 9,000 more Australians will die every year from extreme heat unless we get global warming under control, why doesn&rsquo;t Abbott&rsquo;s inner-Reagan kick in? Sadly, the coalition shows no interest in ensuring that Australians on summer holiday will have less frequent bushfires, healthy oceans to fish in or thousands fewer deaths.</p> <p>While much of the rest of the world is moving forward with action on climate change, including introducing carbon pricing, Abbott is taking us backwards. The OECD might urge action, but Abbott is as deaf to the economics of climate change as he is to the science. Like the Tea Party in the US, he has adopted a radical anti-market position, regardless of the economic consequences, as a political tool to mobilise extreme public opinion. In office he beats the same Tea Party drum, engaging in a new culture war, this time on climate action.</p> <p>It is no surprise that one of his first acts in government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/20/climate-commission-tim-flannery\">was to abolish the body responsible for communicating the warnings of climate science</a>, the Climate Commission. And he will continue to prosecute this culture war as long as he sees the political benefits.</p> <p>Regardless of Abbott&rsquo;s short term opportunism, the reality of climate change will continue to pose a stark reminder of his failure to perform the fundamental responsibility of his high office. When a conservative PM fails even Reagan&rsquo;s first test of good governance, history will judge him harshly. Donning a volunteer <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/tony-abbott-joins-bushfire-fight/story-fncvk70o-1226550553299\">firefighter uniform</a> for the media is a con if you&rsquo;re also helping start fires that put people&rsquo;s lives in danger.</p> <p>If our prime minister truly wants to protect the Australian people, he must help fend off dangerous global warming, the country&rsquo;s biggest ever threat. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll be spending every Christmas holiday worrying about how many people will die.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420089652|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|25e72f04855d9eb1a915155fd18984db4a2e413f -->",

        "body":"<p>It feels strange to sit down and begin writing a rebuttal to the declamation of a musician who I really admire. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world\" title=\"\">David Byrne wrote an article last week for the Guardian</a> in which he states: \"I've pulled as much of my catalogue from Spotify I can.\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/15/thom-yorke-spotify-twitter\" title=\"\">Thom Yorke has made similar remarks</a> and has removed the catalogue of his band Atoms For Peace from Spotify too. In an interview, he said: \"What's happening in the mainstream is the last gasp of the old industry. Once that does finally die, which it will, something else will happen.\" He says this without apparent irony given that \"something else\" is already happening now and he's complaining about it. He also took things a bit further with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/spotify-thom-yorke-dying-corpse\" title=\"\">stronger comment in an interview with Mexican website Sopitas</a>, saying of the music business: \"This is like the last fart, the last desperate fart of a dying corpse.\" OK, then.</p><p>What we have here are two bold statements from two bold-faced musicians who want to save musicians and a so-called dying music industry and yet, for all their best intentions, I believe they are doing music and musicians a disservice. And of course, as the articles are shared far and wide across the apparently much-hated web, they become gospel to those who read them and unfortunately become quasi-religious texts to musicians of all stripes who blame the internet for everything that is wrong with their careers.</p><p>Here's my take on it, which I will try to make as succinct as possible. The internet and Spotify (or any other streaming music service for that matter) are not to blame for musicians' problems. It is hard for me to understand why intelligent people like David Byrne and Thom Yorke do not appear to understand that we are in the midst of new markets being formed. I would also add that many journalists and media commentators don't understand this phenomenon either. It is not about technology; it's about systems and societal shifts. It's also about music business bubbles.</p><p>I have been wrong in my thinking about Spotify in the past. After much debate and a reappraisal of my own stance, I have concluded that we can only look to what internet and mobile users are doing or want to do, and then note how their actions drive technologists to provide platforms for them. Put very simply, that is how markets work.</p><p>I have written often that the internet has brought major change to society, culture and business, so often in fact that I am beginning to sound like a broken record â€“ pun intended. Musicians are the ones apparently complaining the loudest if we are to believe what we read, although those who represent their complaints have never provided real evidence that there are thousands of musicians waiting to storm the supposed barriers of inequality. And yet, when we look to other industries that the internet flattened, it is hard to find many articles written in defence of travel agents who had to adapt to competition from websites like Expedia, or go out of business. And one only has to look at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world#start-of-comments\" title=\"\">comments section of Byrne's article</a> to see how a vast majority of Guardian readers feel about the issues he tells us of (I'll let you read them, it's not pretty).</p><p>So should the recording industry be saved and <a href=\"http://north.com/thinking/who-cares-about-the-future-of-music/\" title=\"\">do musicians need saving</a>? I have no interest in saving the recording industry in its current form, since it was set up to exploit musicians. It pays low royalties to musicians for sales of their work in return for providing money so they can record their work. There are multiple examples of different models within this system â€“ but that is the system as it stands. Along with other musicians, I have often said that we pay back the mortgage but never own the house under this system.</p><p>Byrne rightly points out that musicians get low royalties from plays on streaming music services. This is because they sign binding contracts with labels. Whenever a label licenses their music catalogue to any entity â€“ TV, film, iTunes, Spotify etc â€“ the label keeps 50% and musicians get to split the rest. There are different arrangements: some labels pay the artist whatever the agreed recording royalty is, which is typically 15-25% depending on the deal. Have musicians ever stopped to think that when music fans don't stream their music in these services, they then get less royalties than Taylor Swift who is streamed a lot?</p><p>It is not hyperbole to suggest that this generation's music fans want to rent their music, not own it. Spotify may not have created that shift but they certainly provided a solution to easy-access mobile music streaming. They simply saw a consumer demand, just as any company in any marketplace would. I am certain that Spotify would want every single music fan on its service to pay the monthly subscription, but is it Spotify's fault if we choose not to do that and listen to the ad-supported version instead? This generation's music fans are using streaming services to create their own programming. And how many musicians out there in the world use Spotify? I'd bet there are many.</p><p>Do musicians feel queasy when they listen to FM radio? That is, an ad-supported service that is free to listen to and pays out royalties to music publishers based on radio play â€“ ie, the more artists are played the more they get paid. One thing is certain: when artists remove their music from Spotify they are simply ensuring that they will receive zero royalties from that service. They will also ensure that they are not in a service that provides massive distribution of their work and is not a walled garden like FM radio is.</p><p>As for the question about how musicians should be compensated, what exactly do Byrne and Yorke expect Spotify to do? The company has already paid out in excess of $500m in royalties, a sum that makes up 70% of the company's revenue. Should they be expected to pay even more than 70% in royalties?</p><p>Clay Shirky has written, in response to people who say the internet is destroying print, books, newspapers etc, that it is \"the largest group of people who care about reading and writing ever assembled in history\". Now consider that more people on the planet have more access to music than ever before and that your average music consumer used to buy about six CDs a year. Then consider that Spotify has users who pay $120 a year in subscriptions, of which 70% is paid out to music labels. That is money that might be considered \"found\" money that didn't exist before streaming services kicked in.</p><p>As <a href=\"http://orwell.ru/library/articles/nose/english/e_nose\" title=\"\">George Orwell wrote</a>, \"To see what is in front of one's nose needs a constant struggle\". Whatever has been happening to music has been in front of our noses for the last two decades. Music used to be one of the leading edges of popular culture, but now, as each new generation embraces it, we find that what the artist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt\" title=\"\">Sol LeWitt</a> said many years ago is so evidently true, if not more so: \"Every generation renews itself in its own way; there is always a reaction against whatever is standard.\"</p><p>This debate will continue for some time. At its heart it is about the musician's place in the marketplace. It is about remuneration based on the weak term \"fairness\". Technology created the platforms that musicians must now contend with, and many have come to grips with them and are having great success reaching their audiences. It is not all musicians complaining about this spurious \"unfairness\".</p><p>It is time for influential musicians to openly and transparently convene and produce real solutions that will help musicians understand what is really going on. A debate in online media about online media is a dead end.</p><p>Meanwhile, appearing to be elitist and luddite is not a good way to win over today's music fans to one's cause: let's leave that to be the historical legacy of the recording industry.</p><p></p><p>â€¢ An extended version of this piece appeared at <a href=\"http://north.com/thinking/david-byrne-spotify-stance/\" title=\"\">north.com</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420132860|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|5b2df0f2e6f8f1288ac17ff9631f527d2be18e9a -->",

        "body":"<p>During the lull between an election and the first sitting of parliament it is easy to sink into a kind of political hibernation, but this is no time to hit the snooze button: changes are afoot. The <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/cmfeu-vows-to-fight-tony-abbott8217s-changes-to-industry/story-fni0fiyv-1226739839565\">restoration</a> of the Australian Building and Construction Committee&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/05/10/abbott-unveils-minimalist-ir-policy-but-with-some-traps-for-unions/?wpmp_switcher=mobile&amp;wpmp_tp=0\">draconian powers</a> apparently not being sufficient to mollify it, the business sector is leaning on the new government to &ldquo;reform&rdquo; the industrial relations system.</p> <p>Shortly after the election, Minerals Council chief executive Mitch Hooke <a href=\"http://au.news.yahoo.com/qld/a/18841909/business-urges-workplace-reform/\">stated</a> that there was &ldquo;scope for significant change to the Fair Work Act to boost Australia's productivity and cost competitiveness&rdquo;. More recently, Lend Lease chairman David Crawford <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/business-takes-abbott-to-task-on-ir-20131010-2vbg4.html\">said</a> it was &ldquo;absolute madness&rdquo; to defer reforms until 2016, describing prime minister Tony Abbott&rsquo;s decision to do so &ldquo;extremely disappointing&rdquo;. Reserve Bank board member Heather Ridout also <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/leaders-call-for-action-on-workplace-reform/story-e6frf7jo-1226737070334\">expressed</a> disappointment that the issue was &ldquo;off the agenda for three years when we all want it on the agenda&rdquo;, and blamed the &ldquo;overreach in workplace relations&rdquo; under the Howard government.</p> <p>Indeed, it was the lingering stench of Howard&rsquo;s punitive <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/opinion/trying-to-kill-off-the-ghost-of-workchoices/story-fnh4jt54-1226638642033\">Work Choices</a> policy that forced Abbott to <a href=\"http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2013-05-09/abbott-unveils-coalitions-workplace-relations-policy/1128604\">promise</a> only &ldquo;modest&rdquo; reform in his government&rsquo;s first term, with no changes to unfair dismissal laws or measures to set penalty rates. We now have, effectively, a lobby group pressuring a government to break an election promise in a way which aligns with the lobbyists&rsquo; self-interest, although the above statements are not reported as such. Over the weekend, the Australian Financial&nbsp;Review&rsquo;s front page announced that &ldquo;workplace politics hurt jobs&rdquo;, lamenting that the government was &ldquo;hamstrung by political promises&rdquo;. Given the opprobrium heaped on the Gillard government for, in Abbott&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/tony-abbott-readies-draft-laws-to-repeal-carbon-tax/story-e6frg6xf-1226740283930\">words</a>, its &ldquo;massive breach of faith&rdquo; in introducing a carbon tax, this casual, somewhat resentful attitude to election promises is startling. </p> <p>The language used also merits some analysis. In <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-24/reith-abbott-must-act-before-unemployment-worsens/4975680\">The Drum</a>, former Howard government minister Peter Reith used the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; 13 times in an attempt to convince readers that urgent action was required to &ldquo;move [the&nbsp;economy] up a gear or two&rdquo; without ever stating what he meant by it, other than that &ldquo;Abbott needs to make a start to bring the labour market framework back to the &lsquo;sensible centre&rsquo;&rdquo;. This is as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/23/taxes-northern-territory\">previously</a> noted a meaningless phrase, and &ldquo;reform&rdquo; is similar: it vaguely denotes a self-evident good as unchallengeable as &ldquo;progress&rdquo;, concealing these concepts&rsquo; highly subjective natures. Indeed, arguments for lower wages and watered-down unfair dismissal laws are often uncritically reported as though they can be motivated only by a benevolent concern for the good of the economy. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/27/mandy-rice-davies-quotation-no-correction\">Mandy Rice-Davies-esque</a> response of &ldquo;well, they would say that, wouldn&rsquo;t they&rdquo; rarely appears.</p> <p>Reasons advanced to explain the &ldquo;need&rdquo; for change are also, as Matt Cowgill points out, often <a href=\"http://mattcowgill.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/statistics-at-the-mercy-of-a-slanted-interpretation/#more-1594\">dubious</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/27/australia-australian-welfare\">ever-changing</a>, and John Quiggin recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/03/productivity-zombie-economy\">argued</a> that the longstanding &ldquo;idea of a productivity-based microeconomic reform agenda is a zombie that needs to be killed &hellip; if we are to achieve sustained improvements in living standards for all Australians&rdquo;. Both major parties have been bitten by this zombie, but the government maintains it will keep its promise: treasurer Joe Hockey <a href=\"http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2013/10/12/national-affairs/us-crisis-shows-reform-need-hockey\">states</a> that although he considers there is a &ldquo;need to look at broader structural reform ... we gave commitments during the course of the election and we are not going to renege on those commitments&rdquo;. Abbott <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-07/road-ahead-for-abbott-government/4942822\">reiterates</a> that his will be &ldquo;a government of no surprises&rdquo;.</p> <p>Under ordinary circumstances, it would of course be most unsurprising for this government to crack down on unions and workers&rsquo; rights, for the Liberal party&rsquo;s historical raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre is its opposition to the labour movement. Hobbled by its pre-election stance, the party seems hollow, adrift from its roots and unsure of what it stands for &ndash; a criticism more commonly made of the ALP. Abbott will face pressure from within his own party as well as the commentariat to break his promise.</p> <p>There are also other parties to contend with. South Australian Family First senator-elect Bob Day has <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-03/family-first-senator-elect-bob-day-speaks-out/4995940\">argued</a> that employers should be able to pay less than the minimum wage and that unfair dismissal laws should be relaxed. David Leyonhjelm, the New South Wales Liberal Democrat senator-elect, is known largely for his views on <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-09/nsw-sends-liberal-democrat-to-senate/4945080\">firearms</a>, but his party&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.ldp.org.au/policies/1157-labour-market-regulation\">policies</a> include the abolition of the minimum wage and minimum employment conditions (other than health and safety rules) and the removal of unfair dismissal &ldquo;restrictions&rdquo;. The Palmer United party&rsquo;s industrial relations policies are currently unclear but it is not unheard of for mining magnates to elevate &ldquo;workplace flexibility&rdquo; over employees&rsquo; rights. </p> <p>We need to keep an eye on horse-trading in the Senate, read the newspapers with a critical eye, and be ready to hold our government &ldquo;ferociously to account&rdquo;, as an opposition leader once <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/national/politics/abbott_promises_ferocious_opposition_bfzuWvCZIsoM8nlD5tUwhP\">said</a>. As the old joke goes, be alert: the country needs more Lerts.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420209281|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|ab29bb1aea02a046b5dc20a401fb43cf4375aff9 -->",

        "headline":"The Malaysian 'Allah' ban is about putting minorities in their place",
        "body":"<p>\"Allah\" means God, unless you are a non-Muslim Malaysian, in which case you have to find another word. After a recent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/world/asia/malaysian-court-restricts-use-of-allah-to-muslims.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1381845413-2XknS5uWwO6XhOiCmvgLcQ&amp;\" title=\"\">court ruling</a> in the country, Allah can now be used only to refer to the Muslim God, and non-Muslims (mainly the Malaysian Christian Catholic community and press) have been banned from using it. It is a decision that has inflamed opinion among minority religions and disheartened Muslims. Apart from all the practical implications of this (re-printing Bibles and so on), there are other intangible but more heartfelt grievances. At first glance it looks like a petty scuffle over semantics, but the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8450713.stm\" title=\"\">roots of the dispute</a> go deep into the issue of national identity.</p><p>The ruling was flimsily justified by the \"risk\" of conversion. Announcing the change, the judge said: \"It is my judgment that the possible and most probable threat to Islam, in the context of this country, is the propagation of other religions to the followers of Islam.\" But the ban is less about religion than about <a href=\"http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/christians-not-surprised-at-allah-ban-it-was-umno-trying-to-gain-favour-say\" title=\"\">putting non-Malay minorities in their place</a>, subordinating their status to that of Muslims, the majority population.</p><p>The issue is made more complex by the fact that \"Allah\" is an Arabic loan-word and, when imported into other languages, can come to be thought of as a proper noun. On my first day at a British school, a teacher going around the class and asked us what our respective non-Christian gods were called. When I floundered, she exasperatedly told me that my god was called Allah, and I couldn't quite explain to her why that felt wrong. To me, Allah just meant \"God\" in Arabic. It wasn't a name.</p><p>The <em>shahada</em>, the Muslim declaration of faith, is often translated as \"There is no god but God\" â€“ but the literal and more accurate translation is \"There is no God but the God\". Allah means, simply, God with the definite article in front of it. It is not a name, like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/deities/vishnu.shtml\" title=\"\">Vishnu</a>, or a title, like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/history/history.shtml\" title=\"\">Buddha</a>. It is also pre-Islamic, pre-Abrahamic even, having originated at a time when it referred to a chief god among many.</p><p>There is not much controversy about the usage or interchangeability of the word Allah with other words for God in Arab countries where there is a similar Muslim majority. But that is simply because everyone speaks Arabic, and so there is clearer understanding of the literal meaning of the word, making it harder to imbue with sectarianism. In that context a ban would be as ridiculous as the UK passing a law saying that \"God\" was a Christian designation, and therefore other religions had to find their own words for their own deities.</p><p>The Malaysian ban follows a depressingly familiar pattern of using religion as a pretext for promoting the status of the majority ethnic group and thereby monopolising the national character. The anger expressed by non-Muslims in Malaysia since the ruling and their insistence on being able to continue to use the word Allah do not constitute an aggressive encroachment on some hallowed Muslim space. It is a re-assertion of a pluralistic national identity and of a determination to use a word that is Malay, rather than Muslim.</p><p>The paradox of all this is that to be possessive of the word Allah betrays the sense of unity â€“ <em>tawheed</em> â€“ that the term embodies, and that is at the heart of monotheism. It creates separate gods for separate religions, and directly contradicts the message of the prophet Muhammad. But perhaps that is the point of what must be a cynical, politically motivated ban. This, and not everyone using the same name for God, is the real \"possible and most probable\" threat to Islam.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420139067|2013-10-17T16:29:04Z|a64a0efd6487832ae5c2a95d5d9e8b5c35030c73 -->",
