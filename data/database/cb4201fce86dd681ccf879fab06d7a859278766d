        "headline":"Henry the Fifth – review",
        "body":"<p>Shakespeare's Henry V can be seen as a celebration of heroic patriotism (think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/10/drama.periodandhistorical\" title=\"\">the Laurence Olivier movie from 1944</a>), or as a play which exposes the horrors of war. Ignace Cornellissen's deft and involving response for young audiences does something different and more satiric – presenting it as a playground scrap over a sandcastle in which boys fight over a crown, then cause the deaths of thousands. There are no heroics here, only teenage strops; no crowning victory, just a terrible mess.</p><p>If that sounds dry, <a href=\"https://www.unicorntheatre.com/whatson/3/henry-the-fifth\" title=\"\">Ellen McDougall's production</a>, designed with playfulness and panache by James Button, ensures that it is not. Just as Shakespeare's Chorus reminds of the need to \"piece out our imperfections with your thoughts\", so this version demands a similar call to the audience's imaginations. Beginning on a bare stage on which a golden crown glints enticingly, the action moves to France – a beach on a large, moving table complete with sandcastle – and into the battle of Agincourt, in which the combatants are portrayed by ranks of helium balloons. Their mixture of bobbing confidence and obvious fragility is moving.</p><p><br />Reading on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIDf9HGbwjI\">Click here to see video</a></p><p>The message is that you should think twice before getting into a fight, but the show wears it lightly as it veers off into all sorts of other intriguing areas, including gender politics. In Shakespeare's play, the French princess Katherine is a pretty pawn in the fight between men. Here, she takes the view that if you don't like the story you are in, you should get out of it or try to take it over. There are questions raised about narrative and how a story is told. History, after all, is written by the victors. It's a clever and engaging show, and another triumph for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2012/mar/05/unicorn-theatre-young-at-heart\" title=\"\">Unicorn which, under Purni Morell</a>,  is making a real mark on the theatrical map.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

This week, the Broadway musical will become the first in history to gross more than $1bn.</p><p>As of Monday, when the last set of Broadway box office figures were released, the musical had taken in <a href=\"http://www.playbillvault.com/Grosses/Show/8729/The-Lion-King\" title=\"\">a total of $999.26m</a> since its first preview in October 1997. In recent weeks, the Broadway production has also overtaken the $952m worldwide gross of the original films.</p><p>But The Lion King is still, at 16 years old, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/broadway\" title=\"\">relative newcomer in Broadway terms</a>. It is only the fifth longest-running Broadway show, though is scheduled to overtake <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/feb/20/les-miserables-broadway-2014\" title=\"\">Les Misérables</a> before the end of the year.

It became the theatre district's highest-grossing show of all time last April, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/apr/10/lion-king-broadway-highest-grossing-show\" title=\"\">overtaking The Phantom of the Opera</a>, which is Broadway's longest-running musical.</p><p>The Lion King is also threatening Phantom's record worldwide gross of $5.6bn.

        "body":"<p>Since <a href=\"http://www.brb.org.uk/masque/?act=person&amp;urn=674\" title=\"\">David Bintley became director of BRB</a>, his choreographic output has been dominated by full length, box-office friendly ballets. Yet his one-act ballets are often more revealing of his talent.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.brb.org.uk/db-emc2-diary.html\" title=\"\">E=mc²</a> seemed to come from nowhere in 2009, with <a href=\"http://hindson.com.au/info/\" title=\"\">Matthew Hindson</a>'s score and Bintley's ambitious imagining of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence\" title=\"\">classic Einstein equation</a> in pure dance.</p><p>Its first two sections are especially fine. Energy, the first, is clamorous with activity, its dancers clustered into configurations whose density explodes in one extended starburst of a pas de deux. There's a hypnotic tension between structural rigour and raw energy; and, in the Mass section, that tension stretches into limpid duets and trios, ebbing and flowing across a celestially lit stage.</p><p>On 15 October, the ballet was danced with panache, despite the fact that BRB's rehearsals had been disrupted by two electrical fires, and their performance delayed by half an hour. The cast of Tombeaux, however, were far less secure.</p><p>This 1993 work was Bintley's last before he left London's Royal Ballet and one of the most deliberately poetic of his career. Dressed elegantly by <a href=\"http://www.jasperconran.com/\" title=\"\">Jasper Conran</a>, Bintley's choreography wraps formally classical patterns around a wistful, romantic core. Yet this lovely work was performed with frustratingly little heart or musical intelligence; its dancers, including lead couple Joseph Caley and Momoko Hirata, were too caught up with the work's technical challenges to project its mystery.</p><p>Last on the programme was Bintley's perennially popular <a href=\"http://www.brb.org.uk/masque/index.htm?act=production&amp;urn=12468&amp;srn=12480&amp;showpart=yes\" title=\"\">Still Life at the Penguin Café</a>. The company animate its cast of endangered animal characters with an adroit balance of vaudeville brio and poignancy. Yet this 1988 work is very familiar territory for BRB, and I'd love to see them in a more varied repertory – including more one-acters from Bintley.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

        "body":"<p>When refurbishment finishes next year, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2010/nov/16/national-theatre-name-change-cottesloe-dorfman\">Cottesloe will reopen as the Dorfman</a>, named not after the playwright who wrote<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/14/death-maiden-relevance-play\"> Death and the Maiden</a> but after the philanthropist and National Theatre board member<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_Lloyd-Dorfman_9F3C.html\"> Lloyd Dorfman</a>, who donated £10million to the theatre's development fund. The charitable Jerwood Foundation features in the names of the Royal Court's two auditoria, but I've never heard anyone refer to the Jerwood Theatre Downstairs, even though that's its official name.</p><p>In an age when sponsorship and philanthropy are increasingly being talked up by government (although you only have to look to the US <a href=\"https://philanthropy.com/article/Recession-Hits-Arts-Groups/62975/\">where arts organisations continue to close </a>to see where overreliance on philanthropy gets you), it's not surprising that everything can be bought, even the names of theatres. The commercial Ambassador Theatre Group (<a href=\"http://www.atgtickets.com/about-us/\">ATG</a>) is the <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2013/10/atg-plans-sell-theatre-naming-rights/\">latest to plan to sell off naming rights</a>. But even if the Lyceum does become the Virgin Airlines theatre I rather suspect that people will go on calling it the Lyceum for years to come.</p><p>Of course, in the art world, galleries are often <a href=\"http://www.saatchigallery.com/\">named after those who fund them</a>, and to be honest many theatres have been named after the rich men who founded or paid for them. Theatres also regularly change their name to reflect changes of ownership or in a desire to honour. The Comedy became the <a href=\"http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2011/09/08/harold-pinter-theatre/\">Harold Pinter</a> and the theatre we now call the Gielgud was previously the Globe and before that was the Hicks. When it comes to theatre buildings, a rose by any other name probably does smell as sweet.</p><p>In these cash-strapped times, we probably have to be pragmatic and accept that having a theatre named after you is simply the upscale version of having a theatre seat named after you. On the other hand, if I had a few spare millions lying around I'd definitely put it into work, not bricks and mortar and a sign with my name on in lights. </p><p>But if naming rights to a theatre did unexpectedly fall into my gift, I could think of plenty of artists who would deserve the nod – from<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/behn_aphra.shtml\"> Aphra Behn</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/23/guardianobituaries.arts\">Joan Littlewood</a> . So let's imagine you've just paid millions for naming rights to a theatre but have decided not to put your own name on the facade. Whose name would you like to see attached to a theatre and why? Let's have some fun with this one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420125875|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|babd990e7135dd3fb453295dc12a9c5cc0ad3b17 -->",

        "body":"<p>Under David Thacker's tenure, the Octagon has become the home of heavyweight American drama. Yet you suspect that his productions of Miller, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/apr/04/the-glass-menagerie-review\" title=\"\">Williams</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/sep/27/whos-afraid-virginia-woolf-review\" title=\"\">Albee</a> were merely gateway drugs that would sooner or later lead towards the hard stuff: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/mar/30/eugene-o-neill-master-american-theatre\" title=\"\">Eugene O'Neill</a>'s masterful study of sickness and addiction, which was so closely based on his own family that he forbade any performance until 25 years after his death.</p><p>Set over a single day in summer 1912, O'Neill presents a fleeting moment of togetherness for the Irish American Tyrone family, between rehab spells and sanatorium visits. Mother Mary has just returned from a course of treatment for morphine addiction; youngest son Edmund has tuberculosis and is headed the other way. Father James, a fading theatrical idol, and elder son James Jr, are so wedded to the bottle as to be beyond saving.</p><p>As a combustible combination of hard drugs, hard drink and hard luck stories, O'Neill's drama has everything except brevity. But Thacker's production generates great momentum, partly because the first two acts are paced at quite a lick, but also because he presents the family's theatricalism as a kind of curse.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.brianprotheroe.co.uk/Brian_Protheroe/Brian_Protheroe.html\" title=\"\">Brian Protheroe</a>'s miserly, dictatorial James is full of the corrosive self-loathing of an artist who abandoned Shakespeare in pursuit of a quick buck. <a href=\"http://octagonbolton.co.uk/margot-leicester\" title=\"\">Margot Leicester</a>'s fragile Mary has been undermined by a life spent in second-rate hotel rooms, and cuts to the quick with the accusation that her husband knows how to act everywhere except at home.</p><p>Yet Leicester's heart-rending performance is based on the keen observation that addicts, trapped in an unending cycle of furtiveness and denial, are the greatest actors of all. Mawgan Gyles and Kieran Hill are no less impressive as the dissolute sons. O'Neill's play is a long, sometimes gruelling journey; though without it there would be no Williams, no Albee and far fewer dramatically fruitful trips to Bolton.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

In the dance world that question is, with exceedingly rare exceptions, an irrelevance. Not only do most productions have to consider themselves officially ready for the (full) paying public on opening night, but also ready for review.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.shobanajeyasingh.co.uk/works/strange-blooms/\" title=\"\">Shobana Jeyasingh's new work, Strange Blooms</a>, may be touring a couple of regional dates before it faces the critics in London; some productions may make a second or third show the official press night. But the notorious six-month preview period racked up by the Broadway musical Spider-Man exists in a laughably different world.</p><p>That's true even for the <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/\" title=\"\">highly funded ballet companies, like the Royal</a>. When I recently interviewed <a href=\"http://www.randomdance.org/the_company/collaborators/lucy_carter\" title=\"\">the lighting designer Lucy Carter</a>, she spoke about the extraordinary pressures of getting a new ballet onto the stage at the Opera House. Because of the busy schedules worked by the dancers, and the limited availability of the stage (which sees a performance of ballet or opera nearly every day) a <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/raven-girl-by-wayne-mcgregor\" title=\"\">new work such as Wayne McGregor's Raven Girl</a>, on which Carter worked, gets just three, three-hour stage rehearsals.</p><p>\"You feel as if you're just throwing things at the stage and seeing what sticks,\" Carter told me. In that period there was barely time to adjust the complex video and lighting effects of a work like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/04/raven-girl-flies-onstage\" title=\"\">Raven Girl</a>, let alone to see how they \"read\" from a different parts of the theatre. As it turned out, the deliberately dark lighting she had designed was a real problem for those sitting in the upper levels of the Opera House, but Carter was unable to fix that until halfway through the ballet's brief run.</p><p>She regards it as a kind of heroic magic that any production makes it onto the stage for opening night at Covent Garden. Certainly few go as spectacularly awry as the opening of <a href=\"http://www.brb.org.uk/masque/?act=person&amp;urn=674\" title=\"\">David Bintley</a>'s Planets, when the moving structures of Ralph Koltai's celestial set got jammed for – as far as I remember – almost an hour.</p><p>Yet little glitches – with costumes, sets or props – are not uncommon at a premiere. And another issue with the Royal – as with many other busy ballet companies – is that dancers rarely feel they give their best performances. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/30/lauren-cuthbertson-ballet-manon-interview\" title=\"\">Principal ballerina Lauren Cuthbertson</a> says she \"hates debuts\" and will always ask her family and friends to watch her as late as possible in a ballet's run. Even if she may be step and music-perfect in a new role, on opening night she'll be dealing with the challenges of a still unfamiliar wig, costume, set and so on. And given her busy rehearsal schedule, she won't yet feel she's had time to get \"down and dirty with the choreography\".</p><p>If that's hard, even harder to know they're being reviewed on it. I've heard many dancers express the frustration that critics are routinely invited to the very first night of a ballet; and <a href=\"http://www.viviana-durante.com/\" title=\"\">Viviana Durante</a>, participating in a questionnaire run by the <a href=\"http://www.radenterprises.co.uk/dance-gazette/dance-gazette-single-issue-110dg\" title=\"\">magazine Dance Gazette</a>, asked recently whether critics shouldn't at least take more sympathetic account of first-night hiccups and nerves.</p><p>It's a tricky issue, however. The tradition of the first night review is very strong in ballet – audiences, newspaper editors and readers all seem to want it – and anyone paying for a ticket at the Opera House should surely expect that both performances and production are ready for a professional verdict. On the other hand, if there are problems on stage that are clearly temporary then it would be overly harsh to make them the focus of a review. It's also part of a critic's job to understand the pressures under which new shows are created and to make a judgment call about how they're likely to look once they're settled on the stage.</p><p>And in this internet age, of course, the verdict of newspaper critics no longer stands as the final word. One joy of online blogs, reviews, discussion forums and so on means there's now a reasonable chance that the public discussion of a work continues to evolve, even as it matures on the stage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420108929|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|e22949a11627137ba8e8d92d502dca1c869611f8 -->",

        "headline":"A Lady of Little Sense – review",
        "body":"<p>Laurence Boswell kicks off an ambitious 15-week season of plays from the Spanish Golden Age with this rare 1613 piece from the prolific <a href=\"http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc33.html\" title=\"\">Lope de Vega</a>. It's one of Lope's 400 surviving plays, and ostensibly a romantic comedy; but while it festively celebrates love and marriage, it leaves a faintly acrid aftertaste.</p><p>I was often reminded of The Taming of the Shrew. You have a heavy-handed father, Otavio, with two daughters whom he is anxious to get off his hands. One of them, Nise, is cultivated but arrogant: the other, Finea, is no less beautiful but a bit of a simpleton. The catch is that Finea comes loaded with a handsome dowry. So when two suitors come calling, we see them dithering over the choice of a potential bride. The main fun, however, lies in seeing the way Finea – \"as thick as potato mash\" in the words of David Johnston's sprightly new translation – blossoms into a woman of sense and refinement when pursued by the nakedly fortune-hunting Laurencio. This is a play about the transformative power of love; and Finea's overnight transition is as spectacular as any you will find in world drama.</p><p>Lope is expert at portraying the dilemma faced by women in a patriarchal society where, whether as daughters or wives, they are the victims of male egos: Finea is initially despised for her stupidity, yet, once her intelligence is sharpened by love, an unnerved Laurencio says: \"I&nbsp;was safe in your simplicity.\" In the end, however, this is what makes it a good, rather than a great, comedy. With&nbsp;Shakespeare's Shrew you feel that Petruchio, as well as Kate, learns something about life. Here, there is no mutual maturation process, so the new-flowering Finea winds up with a partner who still believes that \"a woman, like a little lamb, is a golden fleece to her husband\".</p><p>The play gets an immensely lively production from Boswell with a fine central performance from Frances McNamee. Her Finea starts out as a socially disruptive figure, forever doing animal impersonations and spitting into people's drinks, but turns into a woman of inner serenity as well as outward beauty. Katie Lightfoot offers a neat contrast as her controlled but dyspeptic sibling, and there are strong performances from Nick Barber as the cash-driven suitor and William Hoyland as the patronising father. As in so many of his plays, not least the masterly <a href=\"http://spanish-golden-age-plays.wikispaces.com/Synopsis+Fuenteovejuna\" title=\"\">Fuente Ovejuna</a>, Lope pays tribute to female agency and the quickening power of love. But since he here creates such a vivacious heroine in Finea, you wish he had also found a man worthy of her.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

The Britain's Got Talent judge claims she was cornered by the unnamed comic at a public event, during a period when she was patching up her marriage to Les Dennis after an affair with Men Behaving Badly star Neil Morrissey. &quot;[Dennis and I] went to an event together,&quot; Holden writes, &quot;and on my way back from the loo, I was cornered by a famous comedian, who tried to kiss me and put his hands in places they shouldn't have been. I was scared and tried to push him away … but he wasn't put off … My body went limp, and I just stood there as he groped and nuzzled me.&quot; The attack, says Holden, former star of the hairdressing drama Cutting It, left her feeling &quot;cheap and worthless&quot;.</p><p>A series has been commissioned of <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-10-13/james-nesbitt-to-star-in-police-comedy-drama-babylon-from-peep-show-writers-and-danny-boyle\" title=\"\">the new Danny Boyle-directed comedy Babylon</a> – a sitcom about modern policing from the pens of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/peep-show\" title=\"\">Peep Show duo Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain</a>. Speaking at Radio Times event at the Cheltenham literature festival, Bain and Armstrong revealed that the six-part comedy-drama will be set in London, and will &quot;focus on police from all levels of the force and will feature documentary-style elements&quot;.</p><p>&quot;As soon as there's any incident [in real-life policing] now, there's 20 camera phones out,&quot; says Bain, &quot;and the cops are filming the public back, so it's quite a screen- and filming-rich environment out on the streets, and I think that interests [Boyle] to try and convey … We've been writing it for a few years since we had the first meeting. Mainly because of availability. Danny, last year, was doing something in the Olympic Park … he was quite busy.&quot;</p><p>The writers also revealed that the show's cast will <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Nesbitt\" title=\"\">include James Nesbitt</a>, Peep Show's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paterson_Joseph\" title=\"\">Paterson Joseph</a> and the standup (and star of Sky TV's Chickens) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jan/12/jonny-sweet-review\" title=\"\">Jonny Sweet</a>.</p><p>On the subject of Peep Show, the Independent speculates that the new BBC sitcom, Ambassadors, is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/can-new-mitchell--webb-comedy-help-the-foreign-office-improve-its-image-8866984.html\" title=\"\">being used by the Foreign Office to improve its image</a>. The show's writers – which include James Wood, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0178fhq\" title=\"\">the co-creator of Rev</a> – were given access to senior FO officials and spent time with the British ambassador to Kazakhastan. The former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray – who claims the show is based on his experiences – criticises Ambassadors as &quot;pro-government propaganda, a state-sponsored satire&quot;. Murray is critical of the series' sympathetic portrait of British government activity overseas. &quot;It is disgraceful and not based on anything the Foreign Office would do in real life,&quot; he claims. &quot;[In reality], human rights always have a very low priority compared to military considerations.&quot;</p><p>Elsewhere in comedy, <a href=\"http://www.beyondthejoke.co.uk/content/news-jo-brand-defends-lee-mack\" title=\"\">Jo Brand has defended Lee Mack</a> over &quot;unfair&quot; charges that he was dismissive of female comedians on his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/01/lee-mack-comedy-sexism-hello-ladies\" title=\"\">recent Desert Island Discs appearance</a>.

I was booked in to see Robin Ince and Josie Long last Friday night at Stratford Circus. Then my ticket was withdrawn, and I was told critics weren't welcome on this tour. <a href=\"https://robinince.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/i-am-my-own-worst-critic-i-often-walk-out-on-myself/\" title=\"\">Here – according to Ince himself – is why</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Worth a look</h2><p>Two items to catch the eye. The first is an article by Tom Crawshaw, author of a play about the Monty Python star Graham Chapman, <a href=\"http://www.thegayuk.com/#/magazine/4574334751/OPINION-Don%E2%80%99t-Take-It-The-Wrong-Way-Homosexuality-in-Comedy/6742443\" title=\"\">on how 21st-century comedy treats homosexuality</a>. &quot;Isn't laughing at a situation predicated on homosexuality saying, in some way, that to be gay is somehow slightly ridiculous – not wrong or evil – but somehow lesser, not ordinary, not completely sensible? There is a hint,&quot; writes Crawshaw, &quot;of macho culture at work, where the jokes of the playground are rejected but their underlying narrative is accepted and played on.&quot;</p><p>And here – for UK audiences curious to know what Simon Amstell is up to in the US – is the ex-Grandma's House star's <a href=\"http://splitsider.com/2013/10/simon-amstell-did-his-first-us-late-night-spot-on-letterman/\" title=\"\">debut standup set on The Late Show with David Letterman</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Best of our readers' comments</h2><p>Two of the world's most celebrated (and hated) comedians were under discussion this week. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/13/russell-brand-messiah-complex-review\" title=\"\">Stephanie Merritt's Observer review of Russell Brand's Messiah Complex show</a>, <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27901241\" title=\"\">Rickyee369</a> pays Brand a compliment with which it's hard to disagree:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>For a very naughty boy … Brand is very good. People may whine at his wankiness regarding meditation, Hinduism and general good love for fellow humanity, but I find him refreshing in an age where celebrity needs to remain empty to be constant. Much like the Beatles in the 60s, Brand is trying to find the light in a world of sleepwalking, passive night-dwelling insignificants … There is much to take with a shedful of salt, but much to admire in his attempts to educate those who first heard of him after he made an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/sachsgate\" title=\"\">ill-considered call to Manuel</a>.<br /><br />People wish this guy ill at their own risk … Do we really want vacuous and dire entertainers? Or is there room for someone who provokes thought, even if it is against some imagined grain?<br /><br />You'll lament the lanky toerag when he's gone …</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>And on Monday night I reviewed David Brent's debut stage show <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/15/ricky-gervais-david-brent-foregone-conclusion-review\" title=\"\">with his backing band, Foregone Conclusion</a> – and the comments below the line suggest Gervais will have to do better to win (back?) the hearts of Guardian readers. <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27952537\" title=\"\">Petsound</a> had this to say:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>Gervais still has Brent nailed perfectly, but it just isn't the same outside of the context of The Office. I used to really believe I was watching David Brent, whereas now I only see Gervais acting as David Brent. Maybe it's the fact that he's visibly aged, or the fact that at the end of The Office there was at least a glimmer of hope that Brent was evolving and changing, and now we're supposed to believe he's like this, 10 years later? He's not a living character any more, just an animated mummy. Either way, it's a bit like Paul McCartney writing songs that sound like the Beatles – on paper it ticks all the boxes, but it just lacks the magic that was there the first time around.<br /></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>And <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27946247\" title=\"\">Risibilis</a> followed up with this jab to Gervais's ribs:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>Gervais' alter ego has always been a 'rock star'. After establishing a public profile via self-deprecating comic personas he's now relaunching his pop career. In doing this in the guise of it being a comedy turn he's given himself a safety net if the music isn't well-received. He's certainly brash – but brave? I think not so much or he'd not need to perform as a 'character'.</blockquote><p></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420038813|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|339b6fc9d1546f94d6467bbbf0e7d14f07035347 -->",

The charitable Jerwood Foundation features in the names of the Royal Court's two auditoria, but I've never heard anyone refer to the Jerwood Theatre Downstairs, even though that's its official name.</p><p>In an age when sponsorship and philanthropy are increasingly being talked up by government (although you only have to look to the US <a href=\"https://philanthropy.com/article/Recession-Hits-Arts-Groups/62975/\">where arts organisations continue to close </a>to see where overreliance on philanthropy gets you), it's not surprising that everything can be bought, even the names of theatres. The commercial Ambassador Theatre Group (<a href=\"http://www.atgtickets.com/about-us/\">ATG</a>) is the <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2013/10/atg-plans-sell-theatre-naming-rights/\">latest to plan to sell off naming rights</a>. But even if the Lyceum does become the Virgin Airlines theatre I rather suspect that people will go on calling it the Lyceum for years to come.</p><p>Of course, in the art world, galleries are often <a href=\"http://www.saatchigallery.com/\">named after those who fund them</a>, and to be honest many theatres have been named after the rich men who founded or paid for them. Theatres also regularly change their name to reflect changes of ownership or in a desire to honour. The Comedy became the <a href=\"http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2011/09/08/harold-pinter-theatre/\">Harold Pinter</a> and the theatre we now call the Gielgud was previously the Globe and before that was the Hicks. When it comes to theatre buildings, a rose by any other name probably does smell as sweet.</p><p>In these cash-strapped times, we probably have to be pragmatic and accept that having a theatre named after you is simply the upscale version of having a theatre seat named after you. On the other hand, if I had a few spare millions lying around I'd definitely put it into work, not bricks and mortar and a sign with my name on in lights. </p><p>But if naming rights to a theatre did unexpectedly fall into my gift, I could think of plenty of artists who would deserve the nod – from<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/behn_aphra.shtml\"> Aphra Behn</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/23/guardianobituaries.arts\">Joan Littlewood</a> . So let's imagine you've just paid millions for naming rights to a theatre but have decided not to put your own name on the facade. Whose name would you like to see attached to a theatre and why? Let's have some fun with this one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420125875|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|babd990e7135dd3fb453295dc12a9c5cc0ad3b17 -->",

        "body":"<p>My colleague Lyn Gardner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2013/oct/14/west-end-previews-paying-too-much\" title=\"\">has just posted a blog asking whether ticket prices for West End previews are too high</a>, and whether audiences should object to paying for what are essentially full dress rehearsals. In the dance world that question is, with exceedingly rare exceptions, an irrelevance. Not only do most productions have to consider themselves officially ready for the (full) paying public on opening night, but also ready for review.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.shobanajeyasingh.co.uk/works/strange-blooms/\" title=\"\">Shobana Jeyasingh's new work, Strange Blooms</a>, may be touring a couple of regional dates before it faces the critics in London; some productions may make a second or third show the official press night. But the notorious six-month preview period racked up by the Broadway musical Spider-Man exists in a laughably different world.</p><p>That's true even for the <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/\" title=\"\">highly funded ballet companies, like the Royal</a>. When I recently interviewed <a href=\"http://www.randomdance.org/the_company/collaborators/lucy_carter\" title=\"\">the lighting designer Lucy Carter</a>, she spoke about the extraordinary pressures of getting a new ballet onto the stage at the Opera House. Because of the busy schedules worked by the dancers, and the limited availability of the stage (which sees a performance of ballet or opera nearly every day) a <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/raven-girl-by-wayne-mcgregor\" title=\"\">new work such as Wayne McGregor's Raven Girl</a>, on which Carter worked, gets just three, three-hour stage rehearsals.</p><p>\"You feel as if you're just throwing things at the stage and seeing what sticks,\" Carter told me. In that period there was barely time to adjust the complex video and lighting effects of a work like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/04/raven-girl-flies-onstage\" title=\"\">Raven Girl</a>, let alone to see how they \"read\" from a different parts of the theatre. As it turned out, the deliberately dark lighting she had designed was a real problem for those sitting in the upper levels of the Opera House, but Carter was unable to fix that until halfway through the ballet's brief run.</p><p>She regards it as a kind of heroic magic that any production makes it onto the stage for opening night at Covent Garden. Certainly few go as spectacularly awry as the opening of <a href=\"http://www.brb.org.uk/masque/?act=person&amp;urn=674\" title=\"\">David Bintley</a>'s Planets, when the moving structures of Ralph Koltai's celestial set got jammed for – as far as I remember – almost an hour.</p><p>Yet little glitches – with costumes, sets or props – are not uncommon at a premiere. And another issue with the Royal – as with many other busy ballet companies – is that dancers rarely feel they give their best performances. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/30/lauren-cuthbertson-ballet-manon-interview\" title=\"\">Principal ballerina Lauren Cuthbertson</a> says she \"hates debuts\" and will always ask her family and friends to watch her as late as possible in a ballet's run. Even if she may be step and music-perfect in a new role, on opening night she'll be dealing with the challenges of a still unfamiliar wig, costume, set and so on. And given her busy rehearsal schedule, she won't yet feel she's had time to get \"down and dirty with the choreography\".</p><p>If that's hard, even harder to know they're being reviewed on it. I've heard many dancers express the frustration that critics are routinely invited to the very first night of a ballet; and <a href=\"http://www.viviana-durante.com/\" title=\"\">Viviana Durante</a>, participating in a questionnaire run by the <a href=\"http://www.radenterprises.co.uk/dance-gazette/dance-gazette-single-issue-110dg\" title=\"\">magazine Dance Gazette</a>, asked recently whether critics shouldn't at least take more sympathetic account of first-night hiccups and nerves.</p><p>It's a tricky issue, however. The tradition of the first night review is very strong in ballet – audiences, newspaper editors and readers all seem to want it – and anyone paying for a ticket at the Opera House should surely expect that both performances and production are ready for a professional verdict. On the other hand, if there are problems on stage that are clearly temporary then it would be overly harsh to make them the focus of a review. It's also part of a critic's job to understand the pressures under which new shows are created and to make a judgment call about how they're likely to look once they're settled on the stage.</p><p>And in this internet age, of course, the verdict of newspaper critics no longer stands as the final word. One joy of online blogs, reviews, discussion forums and so on means there's now a reasonable chance that the public discussion of a work continues to evolve, even as it matures on the stage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420108929|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|e22949a11627137ba8e8d92d502dca1c869611f8 -->",

Speaking at Radio Times event at the Cheltenham literature festival, Bain and Armstrong revealed that the six-part comedy-drama will be set in London, and will &quot;focus on police from all levels of the force and will feature documentary-style elements&quot;.</p><p>&quot;As soon as there's any incident [in real-life policing] now, there's 20 camera phones out,&quot; says Bain, &quot;and the cops are filming the public back, so it's quite a screen- and filming-rich environment out on the streets, and I think that interests [Boyle] to try and convey … We've been writing it for a few years since we had the first meeting.

The former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray – who claims the show is based on his experiences – criticises Ambassadors as &quot;pro-government propaganda, a state-sponsored satire&quot;. Murray is critical of the series' sympathetic portrait of British government activity overseas. &quot;It is disgraceful and not based on anything the Foreign Office would do in real life,&quot; he claims. &quot;[In reality], human rights always have a very low priority compared to military considerations.&quot;</p><p>Elsewhere in comedy, <a href=\"http://www.beyondthejoke.co.uk/content/news-jo-brand-defends-lee-mack\" title=\"\">Jo Brand has defended Lee Mack</a> over &quot;unfair&quot; charges that he was dismissive of female comedians on his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/01/lee-mack-comedy-sexism-hello-ladies\" title=\"\">recent Desert Island Discs appearance</a>.

There is a hint,&quot; writes Crawshaw, &quot;of macho culture at work, where the jokes of the playground are rejected but their underlying narrative is accepted and played on.&quot;</p><p>And here – for UK audiences curious to know what Simon Amstell is up to in the US – is the ex-Grandma's House star's <a href=\"http://splitsider.com/2013/10/simon-amstell-did-his-first-us-late-night-spot-on-letterman/\" title=\"\">debut standup set on The Late Show with David Letterman</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Best of our readers' comments</h2><p>Two of the world's most celebrated (and hated) comedians were under discussion this week. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/13/russell-brand-messiah-complex-review\" title=\"\">Stephanie Merritt's Observer review of Russell Brand's Messiah Complex show</a>, <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27901241\" title=\"\">Rickyee369</a> pays Brand a compliment with which it's hard to disagree:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>For a very naughty boy … Brand is very good. People may whine at his wankiness regarding meditation, Hinduism and general good love for fellow humanity, but I find him refreshing in an age where celebrity needs to remain empty to be constant. Much like the Beatles in the 60s, Brand is trying to find the light in a world of sleepwalking, passive night-dwelling insignificants … There is much to take with a shedful of salt, but much to admire in his attempts to educate those who first heard of him after he made an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/sachsgate\" title=\"\">ill-considered call to Manuel</a>.<br /><br />People wish this guy ill at their own risk … Do we really want vacuous and dire entertainers? Or is there room for someone who provokes thought, even if it is against some imagined grain?<br /><br />You'll lament the lanky toerag when he's gone …</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>And on Monday night I reviewed David Brent's debut stage show <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/15/ricky-gervais-david-brent-foregone-conclusion-review\" title=\"\">with his backing band, Foregone Conclusion</a> – and the comments below the line suggest Gervais will have to do better to win (back?) the hearts of Guardian readers. <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27952537\" title=\"\">Petsound</a> had this to say:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>Gervais still has Brent nailed perfectly, but it just isn't the same outside of the context of The Office. I used to really believe I was watching David Brent, whereas now I only see Gervais acting as David Brent. Maybe it's the fact that he's visibly aged, or the fact that at the end of The Office there was at least a glimmer of hope that Brent was evolving and changing, and now we're supposed to believe he's like this, 10 years later? He's not a living character any more, just an animated mummy. Either way, it's a bit like Paul McCartney writing songs that sound like the Beatles – on paper it ticks all the boxes, but it just lacks the magic that was there the first time around.<br /></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>And <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27946247\" title=\"\">Risibilis</a> followed up with this jab to Gervais's ribs:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>Gervais' alter ego has always been a 'rock star'. After establishing a public profile via self-deprecating comic personas he's now relaunching his pop career. In doing this in the guise of it being a comedy turn he's given himself a safety net if the music isn't well-received. He's certainly brash – but brave? I think not so much or he'd not need to perform as a 'character'.</blockquote><p></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420038813|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|339b6fc9d1546f94d6467bbbf0e7d14f07035347 -->",
