        "headline":"National theatre's 50th birthday: what were your highlights?",
        "body":"<p>I count myself fortunate to have been part of the audience at Saturday night's celebration of the National theatre's 50th birthday. I don't know how it looked to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03h8qms/Live_from_the_National_Theatre_50_Years_on_Stage/\" title=\"\">viewers on BBC 2 or in cinemas at home and abroad</a>. But, sitting in the Olivier, what we got was a brilliant kaleidoscopic entertainment that not only evoked the National's past but also, through astute recasting, opened up possibilities for the future.<br /><br />Obviously it was moving to see legendary actors, either through archival footage or live performance, repeating past successes. There was a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBBa_8pWlR8\" title=\"\">white-haired Joan Plowright</a>, filmed at the Old Vic only last month, sternly replying to her accusers as Shaw's Saint Joan. There, too, was Maggie Smith â€“ seen one moment on film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pCgux7_cuw\" title=\"\">rolling a wine glass across her forehead as the affectedly sexy Myra in Coward's Hay Fever</a>, the next moment present in the flesh to deliver a speech from Farquhar's The Beaux' Stratagem with unadorned simplicity. And to see Judi Dench moving from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEdI0jwSIxQ&amp;feature=youtube_gdata\" title=\"\">Shakespeare's Cleopatra</a> to Sondheim's Desiree in A Little Night Music was to receive an object lesson in the power of physical stillness and flawless articulation.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pCgux7_cuw\">Reading on mobile? Click here to view</a></p><p>But the especial joy of the evening was that it didn't simply recreate the past: it also reinterpreted it. In Pinter's No Man's Land, after a brief glimpse of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h20gPwTJq8\" title=\"\">Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud playing Hirst and Spooner on film</a>, we were presented with the no less moving sight of an alcoholically slumped Michael Gambon and a shabbily ingratiating Derek Jacobi in the same roles. Without effacing the memory of Anthony Hopkins in David Hare and Howard Brenton's Pravda, Ralph Fiennes also proved it was perfectly appropriate to reinterpret the devouring press-baron Lambert Le Roux: where Hopkins was roaming jungle lion, Fiennes was a more voracious, paper-eating panther. And it was fun to see Alan Bennett, bow-tied and quietly shuffling, playing his own creation Hector in The History Boys, and exasperatedly urging a pupil to \"lie on the bed in the subjunctive\".</p><p>The evening also gave one a sense of how the National, and theatre as a medium, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/10420382/National-Theatre-gala-lets-celebrate-magical-stories.html\" title=\"\">has evolved from the Olivier to the Hytner years</a>. In the 60s, I suspect, we looked chiefly for great performances in great plays. Today, as the extracts from War Horse and London Road suggested, theatre is more about visual and formal innovation. But even that idea was subtly subverted when, with seamless technical finesse, the resonant performances of Adrian Lester and Rory Kinnear in Othello were melded with a sound-recording of Olivier and Frank Finlay in the National's 1964 production. At that moment, past and present effortlessly merged.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h20gPwTJq8\">Reading on mobile? Click here to view</a></p><p>It was <a href=\"http://national-theatre.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">an astonishing evening</a>. But what TV audiences didn't see was the warmup from Nicholas Hytner when he calmly came before the house, welcomed the different segments of the audience, even including the critics (\"Sometimes you've been right\") and told us we were all about to see \"the best actors in the country and therefore in the world\". I can think of one or two names that were missing but, at the end of a two-hour evocation of the National's first half-century, it seemed a justified boast.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421633128|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|f887c3ed138eb22b7a8eaefbc0da646cc930d6d6 -->",

In contrast to the transparent drapes, pastel fittings and twinkling chandeliers of Kenny Miller's 1940s set, Sally Reid's deceased Elvira is a blood-red apparition whose fiery tresses and scarlet robes project the image of a woman with more pulse and passion, dead or not, than any of the delicate human beings she has returned to haunt.</p><p>At least, that's how it nearly works in <a href=\"http://www.horsecross.co.uk/whats-on/blithe-spirit\" title=\"\">Johnny McKnight's production</a>. It would be easier to see Elvira as a life force from beyond the grave if the director hadn't relocated this most English of plays to a Perthshire village. Coward's very particular brand of humour depends on an emotional repression and, crucially, a restraint of expression that translates awkwardly from the home counties to upper-class Scotland. When subjected to the warm conversational delivery we get here, his clipped, performative language, with its heavy irony and aphoristic wit, is not as funny. Only Anne Lacey as the eccentric medium Madame Arcati consistently strikes the right note of brittle indifference. Everyone else is too human â€“ although it's noticeable that the more intense the marital rows, the more convincing they sound.</p><p>As a result, many of the biggest laughs come from the theatrical interventions, whether that be the pratfalls of Scarlett Mack's housemaid or the flamboyant mincing of Billy Mack's Dr Breadman. They can be funny, but they're not really what the play is about.</p><p>Lurking behind the silly story of dead wives and seances is a more thoughtful study of passion, love and commitment. It's one we see too little of. Sure, we get a cheery show that jollies the audience along, but it's a ghost of what it could be.</p><p>â€¢ Did you catch this show â€“ or any other recently?

        "headline":"Why musicals are hard work",
        "body":"<p>Although Fred Ebb â€“ who wrote the lyrics to John Kander's music on shows including Cabaret and Chicago â€“ died in 2004, he had a UK premiere of a new show last week, with the opening of The Scottsboro Boys at the Young Vic in London, three years after its Broadway debut.</p><p></p><p>Even allowing for the period of mourning that Kander understandably allowed himself after the loss of a lifelong collaborator â€“ and the fact that he worked first on another unfinished show with Ebb, Curtains (2007) â€“ the long gestation period of The Scottsboro Boys, a dramatisation of a 1930s racist miscarriage of justice in Alabama, is further testimony to the notorious difficulty of producing a new musical.</p><p></p><p>Other evidence is around. <a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/10-2013/critics-divided-over-the-light-princess_32240.html\" title=\"\">The Light Princess, the Tori Amos-Samuel Adamson show at the National theatre</a>, had five years of delays, revisions and workshops before it reached the stage. And <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/books/nigel-simeone-edits-leonard-bernsteins-letters.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">The Leonard Bernstein Letters</a>, just published, contains pages of agonised correspondence, during the creation of West Side Story in 1957, between composer Bernstein, lyricist Stephen Sondheim, choreographer Jerome Robbins and Arthur Laurents, who provided the \"book\".</p><p></p><p>As the men were working together almost day and night, the rows between them were probably acted out in person rather than committed to foolscap, but Bernstein unloads the horrors of the process to his wife in long letters written during rehearsals and \"out of town tryouts\" in Washington and elsewhere. \"What's the use?\" the composer moans, deep into pre-production. \"The 24-hour schedule goes on â€“ I am tired &amp; nervous &amp; apey â€¦ this is the last show I am going to do.\" Elsewhere, he complains: \"The work is endless: I never sleep. Everything gets rewritten every day â€¦ and imagine, we open two weeks from Monday.\"</p><p></p><p>It is the crazed revision â€“ there are entire albums of Stephen Sondheim songs that were dropped from shows â€“ that is the constant and astonishing factor in accounts of the creation of musicals, regardless of whether they prove to be a hit or a flop. Samuel Adamson told me in an interview that he was startled by the rotating metamorphosis of The Light Princess in comparison with the speech dramas â€“ including Southwark Fair and Mrs Affleck â€“ that he had previously written. And most playwrights who moonlight in song and dance experience this culture shock.</p><p></p><p>Of all the many theatrical mishaps described by <a href=\"http://www.simongray.org.uk/diaries.html\" title=\"\">Simon Gray in his brilliant series of Diaries</a>, one of the most severe was his involvement in an early version of the 1993 Broadway musical The Red Shoes, composed by the then octogenarian Broadway legend Jule Styne, who wrote Gypsy and Funny Girl. Gray was one of many people who left the project during its development, and took his revenge by depicting Styne as a capricious egomaniac surrounded by a chorus of adoring aides. Public taste may also have been a balm for Gray, as The Red Shoes, after belatedly opening, closed after 51 previews (a quantity often indicating a troubled show) and five performances.</p><p></p><p>Possibly corroborating Gray's view, Jack Rosenthal, another British playwright who worked with Styne â€“ on a musical version of the TV play Bar Mitzvah Boy â€“ responded in similar fashion by writing a stage play, <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/31757/smash-\" title=\"\">Smash!</a>, in which a diffident dramatist is bullied and patronised by a lunatically self-regarding Broadway songwriter.</p><p></p><p>So why are musicals so hard to get right? One clue is in the cathartic rage with which Gray and Rosenthal set down their own version of events in a medium â€“ journa; theatre play â€“ over which they had sole control.</p><p></p><p>Whereas a straight play merely demands collaboration between a writer and a director (with producers and actors sometimes also having a say), a musical usually requires co-operation between a minimum of a composer, lyricist, dramatist and choreographer and, given the huge budgets general involved, often several producers. So a big show is lucky to get away with fewer than seven or eight credits, egos and their agents in the room. As at a European Union or United Nations summit, the diversity of rooted interests almost guarantees disagreement.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps the fundamental reason for the prevalence of off-stage drama is that the musical is an inherently artificial form and therefore, as with attempts at non-mechanical flight, most projects are doomed to extreme difficulty and probably failure.</p><p></p><p>Artificiality also applies to spoken drama, but the convention that invented characters are speaking made-up dialogue is rapidly established and accepted. Why does the protagonist make a long speech about his mother in act two? Well, because his mum died in act one, or because someone has just asked how she is. But for a character suddenly to burst into song about his mother is a development of a different order. Can the transition between spoken dialogue and song be achieved without disrupting the narrative flow or breaking the concentration of the audience? And is this \"mummy\" number sufficiently different from all the maternal tribute music written in the past? Perhaps the composer and lyricist could be sent to a hotel all night to knock out an alternative.</p><p></p><p>Because the musical is an inherently illogical form â€“ but with a greater craving for realism than its near-cousin, opera â€“ there will always be someone suggesting a different logic.

        "body":"<p>The island of <a href=\"http://whitleyisland.com/whitleys-famous-noise/\" title=\"\">Whitley</a>, a British crown possession in the south Atlantic, is home to more penguins and sheep than people. It is also, like Prospero's retreat, an island full of noises, as the inhabitants are afflicted by an unexplained, ever-present hum.</p><p>Previous shows by <a href=\"http://www.unlimited.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Unlimited Theatre</a> have made forays into quantum physics and neuroscience, so it seems a natural development for the company to explore the cognitive effects of sound. Even though Whitley's auditory affliction is fictitious, there is a genuine catalogue of mysterious, oceanic noises with names such as <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327246.500-13-more-things-the-bloop.html%C2%A3.UlZ37SjLhIA\" title=\"\">Bloop</a>, Julia and Slowdown, which some scientists believe to be connected to the movement of icebergs.</p><p>In the drama, <a href=\"http://www.unlimited.org.uk/what-is-an-auditory-object/\" title=\"\">jointly scripted by Clare Duffy, Chris Thorpe and director Jon Spooner</a>, the disturbing frequencies intensify when a berg crunches into the island's main harbour. But while the majority of inhabitants are content to block their ears, one 17-year-old girl is determined to trace the source, particularly when an audiologist researching the phenomenon washes up dead on the shore.</p><p>Unlimited's science-fiction thriller looks and sounds stylish thanks to a ominous soundtrack by electronic musician <a href=\"http://minotaurshock.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Minotaur Shock</a>. And the production captures the unnerving insularity of an isolated community whose strange rituals and customs suggest a limited gene-pool similar to that of Summerisle in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/26/the-wicker-man-review\" title=\"\">The Wicker Man</a>.</p><p>The company has undoubtedly done its homework (two cognitive psychologists are credited in consultant roles). Yet as the research supports what turns out to be a fairly generic and somewhat broadly acted murder-mystery, the science behind the show ultimately feels more engaging than the fiction.</p><p>â€¢ Did you catch this show â€“ or any other recently?

But more than a decade earlier, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/jez-butterworth\" title=\"\">Jerusalem's writer, Jez Butterworth</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/about-us/artistic-directors/ian-rickson/\" title=\"\">director, Ian Rickson</a>, had launched another stage phenomenon at the Royal Court.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_%28play%29\" title=\"\">The rock'n'roll thriller Mojo</a>, Butterworth's first play, was set amid the pill-popping frenzy of 1950s Soho where two gangland bosses are locked in a power struggle over the pretty young heartthrob Silver Johnny. The reviews were glowing: this paper's Michael Billington called it \"the most dazzling main-stage debut in years\", while the Telegraph's Charles Spencer said of the first-night audience: \"Everyone knew they were at the birth of something special.\" Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise and Gary Oldman were in the audience, and Cruise sent a congratulatory postcard to the cast. It was the first main-stage debut at that theatre since John Osborne's Look Back in Anger in 1956. Or so the publicity claimed. \"I put that out there,\" Rickson says sheepishly. \"I don't think it was true. But the spirit of it felt right.\"</p><p>That electrifying 1995 production featured several rising stars: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/04/tom-hollander-rev-actor\" title=\"\">Tom Hollander, later to become Rev in the BBC sitcom</a>, played the petulant Baby, a Hamlet-like heir to one of Soho's crime empires; <a href=\"http://www.serkis.com/\" title=\"\">Andy Serkis â€“ who has spent most of the past decade squeezed into a motion-capture blue-suit to play Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films</a> â€“ was Potts, a stooge convinced he can benefit from the teenybopper bandwagon; and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0318821/\" title=\"\">Aidan Gillen, whose work in The Wire and Game of Thrones</a> has now made him one of the guarantors of quality television, played Skinny, whose worship of Baby is his undoing. Seventeen years after its debut in summer 1995, the play is being revived by Rickson with an equally impressive cast: Ben Whishaw as Baby, Daniel Mays as Potts, Brendan Coyle of Downton Abbey as the group's strategist, Mickey, and, making his stage debut, Rupert Grint as Potts's speed-freak sidekick Sweets.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421481453'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/1/1383324851823/Rehearsals-for-the-new-ve-009.jpg' alt='Rehearsals for the new version of Mojo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rehearsals for the new version of Mojo. Photograph: Simon Annand</figcaption></figure><p>When I drop in to the central London rehearsal space on an autumn afternoon, Whishaw is prowling the floor looking vulpine in a black leather jacket and shaggy hair. He's outsmarting the twitchy Mays and Grint, who are trying to distract him from the grisly secrets hidden downstage in a pair of silver dustbins. The room is filled with period props and paraphernalia, from a jukebox to an array of Tommy Steele album covers. A ping-pong table is there purely to allow the actors to let&nbsp;off steam after tackling the coiled dialogue, which itself has the rat-tat-tat rhythms of an Olympic-standard table-tennis match.</p><p>There are any number of reasons to revive Mojo, from the commercial (hitching a ride on the Jerusalem juggernaut) to the topical (the play's backdrop, with powerful showbiz crooks fighting over the flesh of children, has an unsavoury tang of the&nbsp;Saville era, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/dec/01/weekend.jonronson\" title=\"\">Jonathan King and the Walton Hop</a>). For Rickson, the main incentive was to ratify the play's standing. \"I think it's a modern classic,\" he says when I join him and Butterworth during their lunch break. The director is svelte and stubble-headed; the playwright resembles a jolly bear in a flat-cap. \"I just watched them do 20 minutes of act two, and it was so thrilling,\" says Butterworth. \"It's brilliant to see actors get that excited.\"</p><p>As if on cue, the cast members pour back in from their break and rush over to the ping-pong table for some noisy and rambunctious face-offs. \"To enshrine it now as a classic it has to be about the players who are available,\" observes Rickson. Though Whishaw and Grint will be the box-office draws, it is Mays who is the lynchpin of the new production. \"Jez and I have adored Daniel for many years. As far as I'm concerned, there are certain actors who can speak Butterworth. It then became about whether we could build a team around him.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421481454'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/1/1383325004606/Ben-Whishaw-as-Baby-in-Mo-008.jpg' alt='Ben Whishaw as Baby in Mojo.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ben Whishaw as Baby in Mojo. Photograph: Simon Annand</figcaption></figure><p>Whishaw had played Skinny in a production of the play at Rada, and jumped at the chance to graduate to Baby. \"I wanted to do it straight away,\" he says softly. \"We're all still kind of figuring the play out really. Baby is damaged, but then I suppose they're all damaged men.\"</p><p>The new cast members are united in their admiration of the writing. \"It's been quite hard mastering those rhythms,\" says Grint. \"There's lots of bouncing off one another, and it's so fast-paced and charged. But it's a lot of fun.\"</p><p>\"Jez was 24 when he wrote it,\" exclaims Mays incredulously. \"It's got that unapologetic rawness to it: it's someone pouring out their talent. It's&nbsp;fearless.\"</p><p>Butterworth was holed up with his brother and sometime co-writer Tom in a cottage in Pewsey â€“ the Wiltshire village which later became the setting for Jerusalem â€“ while he worked on the play in 1994. He survived for an entire year on the Â£1,500 that the producer AndrÃ© Ptaszynski had paid him to write it. \"It was a wonderful time,\" he sighs. \"And I had such a clear idea of the story â€“ more so than I've ever had of anything since. The fairytale idea I came up with right at the start: two kingdoms, two kings, both of whom are off-stage, and with Silver Johnny like a princess who gets stolen from one by the other. Then there are all the knights fighting over who's going to take over, and you've got the kingdom's rightful son, Baby, who is a bit useless. I wrote the first scene relentlessly for several months because I was trying to get the voice. Once I knew how everyone should sound, the rest came in a burst.\"</p><p>Rickson was part of Stephen Daldry's team at the Royal Court when he received a copy of Mojo. The pressure was on for the theatre to have a summer hit. \"I brought Jez in, we had a read-through with six actors, and we knew straight away we were onto a winner. The dogma of the time dictated that new playwrights went in the theatre upstairs, but Mojo felt constrained there. So Stephen did the bold thing: debut, main stage, bang!\"</p><p>The play was staged dynamically â€“ it's a claustrophobic piece punctuated by blasts of sound, light and violence â€“ with audiences becoming especially tense during a long scene in act two in which Silver Johnny is suspended from his ankles like a carcass in an abattoir. \"We're so prepared now,\" says Rickson. \"This kid Tom [Rhys Harries] has been on a special diet, done hanging practice, had his retinas checked, seen an osteopath.\" When I report this to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0558548/\" title=\"\">Hans Matheson</a>, who at 20 was the original Silver Johnny, he splutters. \"You're kidding? They didn't do any of that for me! I was convinced something was going to go wrong and I'd fall and break my neck.\"</p><p>Mojo was the hit the Royal Court was looking for. When the BBC suggested adapting it for cinema, Butterworth knew he wanted in. \"I was 26 and I'd always wanted to be a film director,\" he says. Matheson recalls visiting the playwright's Soho flat and seeing a book&nbsp;called How to Make a Film. \"It was&nbsp;there on the coffee table,\" he laughs. \"He must have thought, 'I'll get&nbsp;the manual.'\"</p><p>But Butterworth blotted his copybook with two important people. Sam Mendes had desperately wanted Mojo to be his own cinematic debut. \"Sam didn't talk to me for years afterwards,\" Butterworth admits. Then there was a controversial casting decision: for Baby, Butterworth dropped Hollander and promoted Aidan Gillen to the lead. \"I imagine Tom was stung to the core. Looking back, I think it was an unbelievably cold piece of business on my part,\" Butterworth says now.</p><p>Serkis and Matheson were also drafted in from the original production, and there was an important addition: <a href=\"http://www.haroldpinter.org/acting/acting_infilms.shtml\" title=\"\">Harold Pinter in an unforgettable cameo&nbsp;as the vulture-like paedophile gangster Sam Ross</a>, a character feared but never seen in the stage version. \"On set I was always thinking, 'I'm sure this isn't the most exciting thing we could be filming right now,'\" says Butterworth. But the static scene in which Pinter and Matheson are scrunched together on a sofa is taut and terrifying. \"That was the penultimate day of shooting, and it was the first thing that really worked.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421481455'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/1/1383324934541/Hans-Matheson-and-Harold--008.jpg' alt='Hans Matheson and Harold Pinter in the film version of Mojo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hans Matheson and Harold Pinter in the film version of Mojo Photograph: Kobal</figcaption></figure><p>Matheson feels the same. \"The film&nbsp;was okay. Not rubbish-rubbish. But that scene was outrageous and naughty. Jez ruined a few takes from laughing. I just couldn't believe I was doing a scene with Harold Pinter. He wasn't someone who took any shit. I was rehearsing a song when he was in another dressing room and he came in, rolling his sleeves up, and shouted at us: 'Will you keep that bloody noise down?' I thought I was about to be decked by Harold Pinter.\"</p><p>At least the experience of adapting Mojo helped make up Butterworth's mind when the offers to film Jerusalem came in. \"It's not happening,\" he says decisively. Rickson concurs: \"There are two people who won't let it happen. Him and me.\" The men have worked together several times between Mojo and Jerusalem, and Butterworth also has a successful career as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Revisiting Mojo, though, is something they always planned to do. \"I feel there's this demo, the 1995 version,\" explains Rickson. \"And now we're going back&nbsp;and remastering it, trying to make&nbsp;it more itself. I see it now very differently: it's an austere, savage, hilarious ritual about tribes of men under threat.\" Butterworth is even more concise. \"The main reason for doing it â€“ and it's taken me a while to work this out â€“ is that it was a really, really good play. There aren't that many of them around, so it's worth doing one when you can.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421472656|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|65c5dec0bca3ef5bc4ec2fcde52d9a69e08599b8 -->",

The show was being performed at the Aria resort and casino.</p><p>In June, Sarah Guillot-Guyard, a French acrobat, fell 29m to her death during a midair battle scene in the show KA in Las Vegas. After a four-month investigation, the Nevadan authorities fined Cirque du Soleil $25,235 (Â£15,800) for failings related to her death.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421564823'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/3/1383496067008/Sarah-Guillot-Guyard-003.jpg' alt='Sarah Guillot-Guyard' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sarah Guillot-Guyard (AP)</figcaption></figure><p>Guillot-Guyard, 31, died after falling in the final scene of the performance, in which the stage is vertical and performers wear safety harnesses attached to a cable.

        "body":"<p>You're just out of jail. You've changed. But the world has changed, too, and nothing is quite where you expect it to be. Your relatives aren't overjoyed. You wonder what they're really thinking. What if they don't want you to be there? What if they never have?</p><p>For three decades, the <a href=\"http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk/mission\" title=\"\">Clean Break theatre company</a> have paired some of the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/nov/08/clean-break-women-prison-theatre\" title=\"\">exciting female writers</a> around â€“ among them Lucy Kirkwood and Rebecca Lenkiewicz â€“ with women who are in the criminal justice system. Katie Hims' new three-hander, distilled from residencies at HMP Holloway and HMP <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder/askham-grange\" title=\"\">Askham Grange</a>, suggests that, for many who've been released, returning to their old lives and trying to make them new is the biggest trial of all.</p><p>Here, it's Billy who has come home. She's hectic with good intentions (\"My new approach,\" she beams, clutching a pineapple, \"my new, like, positive approach\"), but Ingrid, her mother, is dubious. Besides, Ingrid has other things on her mind: her new man Eddie, who looks like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJWD6_5aQDQ\" title=\"\">Patrick Swayze</a> with a pigtail and earns his living hosting seances. Billy's teenage sister, Amber, has the voice of an angel, but what is she really doing when she claims to be at choir practice? And then there's a wedding, which must be kept secret. Billy herself isn't even allowed inside the house, so it's in front of an elderly caravan parked in the back garden (a finely conceived <a href=\"http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk/productions/billy-girl\" title=\"\">dingy design</a> by Joanna Scotcher) that battle lines are redrawn and old wounds reopened.</p><p>Agonising though this triangle is â€“ and often it's agonisingly funny â€“ Hims' hour-and-a-half play seems somehow trapped in its premise, and, like the caravan, you begin to wish it would roam further. There are heavy hints of what has happened to Billy's stepfather (a Thermos of whose ashes gaze at us balefully throughout), and the final twist is awkward; you often sense the script grazing emotional truth without managing to make sustained contact.</p><p>But there are good things here, not least sprightly performances from Danusia Samal and Naomi Ackie as sisters who discover a skew-whiff complicity with each other. It is the only play in English drama I can think of to explore the confessional uses of a bear costume. And in Christine Entwisle's Ingrid â€“ a study in phosphorescent makeup and hazy self-delusion (\"The dead are with us always,\" she coos, \"that's what Eddie says\") â€“ it has a character who would look at home in a Cumbrian version of Tennessee Williams. Funny though Billy the Girl is, its most lasting insight is a sad one: that you don't have to be in prison to be trapped.</p><p>â€¢ Did you catch this show â€“ or any other recently?

        "headline":"National Dance Company Wales â€“ review",
        "body":"<p>In the late 1980s, when <a href=\"http://www.preljocaj.org/menu.php?lang=en&amp;m=1&amp;a=1\" title=\"\">Angelin Preljocaj</a> first began rewriting the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev\" title=\"\">Diaghilev</a> repertory, his interpretations of those revered classics appeared provocative and strange. A quarter of a century on, <a href=\"http://www.ndcwales.co.uk/en\" title=\"\">NDCW</a>'s revival of Les Noces still has the power to disturb.</p><p>Preljocaj's version is cast for five soon-to-be-married couples. The violence implicit in their relationships, and in the thrilling clamour of Stravinsky's score, is embodied in the hurtling jumps and falls that break through the hard-edged patterns of Preljocaj's choreography. While the bride in the 1923 <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/les-noces-by-bronislava-nijinska\" title=\"\">original</a> feared marriage as a kind of death, here the couples' emotions are a more ambivalent mix of lust, fantasy and fear. Brilliantly, Preljocaj projects all these on to the five bridal mannequins who are tossed in and among the dancers, caressed and manhandled with intensifying hatred and contempt. NDCW serve the choreography well, attentive to every nuance, diving into it fearlessly. For a small company, they're impressive in the ambition of their repertory.</p><p>Virtual Descent, by company member Eleesha Drennan, may feel overwhelmed by its grandiose theme (a future world in which mankind fights to recover its humanity). But the black-clad dancers shifting through golden light look handsome, and the live performance of <a href=\"http://www.markbowden.net/\" title=\"\">Mark Bowden</a>'s percussion concerto is an exceptional and absorbing pleasure.</p><p>Closing the programme is <a href=\"http://stephenpetronio.com/\" title=\"\">Stephen Petronio</a>'s Water Stories. Petronio has developed a close working relationship with the Cardiff company, and for this piece has taken inspiration from the Welsh countryside. Scenes of coastline, rivers and lakes are projected on stage, and the water imagery is embodied in the choreography's eddies and swirls of dance. Costumed in postmodern Greek tunics, the dancers look wonderful, like new age nymphs of the landscape.</p><p>â€¢ Did you catch this show â€“ or any other recently?

        "headline":"National Theatre: Night of the stars celebrates 50 years",
        "body":"<p>One of the greatest crucibles of modern drama, the National Theatre, echoed to applause on Saturday night for one of its greatest performances as a who's who of British acting took to the stage to celebrate its 50th anniversary.</p><p>Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Derek Jacobi, Michael Gambon, Simon Russell Beale â€¦ the cast was a dream for any director. But the audience was also filled with titans of British theatre, with a guest list that seated playwrights Tom Stoppard, Peter Shaffer and David Hare alongside directors Richard Eyre and Peter Hall and actresses Prunella Scales and Juliet Stevenson. Also present was Joan Plowright, widow of Laurence Olivier â€“ the National's first director and one of the last century's greatest actors.</p><p>Also attending the gala occasion were Michael Morpurgo, author of <em>War Horse</em>, Lady Antonia Fraser, the Tate's director Sir Nicholas Serota and the former archbishop of Canterbury, Lord (Rowan) Williams. \"Everyone's here. You're surrounded by famous faces,\" the anniversary show's executive producer, David Sabel, said before the final rehearsal. \"You walk down the hall and you see Jacobi and Gambon. Then Christopher Eccleston, Ralph Fiennes.\"</p><p>The lineup on the main Olivier stage was there for a fully staged two-hour retrospective showcasing the scope and scale of the theatrical powerhouse under the directorship of Nicholas Hytner, who hands over the reins to Rufus Norris next year. The performance, broadcast live on BBC2, featured vignettes of some of the 800 productions staged since the National's creation in 1963.</p><p>On stage, Dench demonstrated why her Egyptian queen in <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em> is still remembered as one of the triumphs of her long career. Smith recaptured her thoughtful performance as the unhappily married Mrs Sullen in George Farquhar's <em>The Beaux' Stratagem</em> and Mirren mesmerised as a murderer in Eugene O'Neill's <em>Mourning Becomes Electra</em>. Other performances saw Gambon and Jacobi deliver a passage from Harold Pinter's <em>No Man's Land</em> â€“ paying tribute to their predecessors Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud, who starred in the original â€“ and Russell Beale reprise a critically acclaimed role as Hamlet.</p><p>\"Everyone who's in the show has been part of the National Theatre company at one point and, in some cases, on many occasions,\" said Sabel. \"But what's unusual is everyone's here at the same time. In the canteen, the green room and corridors. It's incredibly exciting.\"</p><p>Given the pedigree of the scripts and performers, the volume of applause  was hardly unexpected. But prior to the theatre's creation many would have predicted otherwise. The theatre was born out of controversy following decades of debate over whether there was a place for a state-subsidised institution that would foster drama neglected by Britain's commercial stage industry. After it was established at the Old Vic in Waterloo, it was the focus of more arguments as the brutalist architecture of its subsequent home, which Prince Charles likened to a nuclear power station, took shape over London's South Bank.</p><p>Backstage there were also personal tempestuous dramas, including a notorious feud between Peter Hall and Jonathan Miller. Hall succeeded Olivier as head of the National in 1973, prompting Miller, an associate director, to resign within months. Miller dismissed Hall as a \"safari-suited bureaucrat\" and Hall called Miller \"the only director I know who always likes his own work\".</p><p>Miller, a pioneering artistic director for the Old Vic, was conspicuous by his absence, although he had been invited and the programme notes record that the National's fortunes revived in 1972 with his <em>The School for Scandal</em>.</p><p>Miller told the <em>Observer</em>: \"They invited me, but I haven't even bothered to reply. Why on earth should I go somewhere which has never asked me for 35 years? There's no point in my being there.\" Apart from his 2011 staging of Bach's <em>St Matthew Passion</em> â€“ which \"I managed to bully them into allowing me to do\" â€“ he feels that he has been \"conspicuously ignored\".</p><p>Daniel Rosenthal, author of a forthcoming book on the National, said that the institution had succeeded by supporting new writing and recognising potential. \"Wherever you are in the world, every night there's a play that began its life at the National,\" he said. \"Patrick Marber's <em>Closer </em>has been seen in more than 100 cities worldwide. The film version in the UK and US alone was seen by five million.\"</p><p>As if to prove the point, the programme notes record that Stoppard, who has given the National a new play in every decade, was an \"untried writer\" in 1967 when it staged his now-classic <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</em>. An extract was performed.</p><p>That there have been so many classics to emerge from the National was cause for consternation for Hytner, who wrote in the anniversary performance's programme: \"Although we've tried to cover as much as possible â€¦ I'm horrified by how much we've had to leave out.\"</p><p>The enduring relevance of its stand-out works was demonstrated by the  bill, which featured plays that resonated with current debates about media ownership and education, such as <em>Pravda</em>, Hare and Howard Brenton's incisive 1980s play about a newspaper baron â€“ played last night by Fiennes â€“ and Alan Bennett's <em>The History Boys</em>.</p><p>The live performances were interspersed with archival footage including Paul Scofield as Salieri in <em>Amadeus</em>, Shaffer's masterpiece. The night also featured a short film about Olivier, which included recent footage of Plowright reprising her role of St Joan shot at the Old Vic.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421518883|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|d594eff2c9a66d9c6964e951d875a52b6d91f486 -->",

        "headline":"Why musicals are hard work",
        "body":"<p>Although Fred Ebb â€“ who wrote the lyrics to John Kander's music on shows including Cabaret and Chicago â€“ died in 2004, he had a UK premiere of a new show last week, with the opening of The Scottsboro Boys at the Young Vic in London, three years after its Broadway debut.</p><p></p><p>Even allowing for the period of mourning that Kander understandably allowed himself after the loss of a lifelong collaborator â€“ and the fact that he worked first on another unfinished show with Ebb, Curtains (2007) â€“ the long gestation period of The Scottsboro Boys, a dramatisation of a 1930s racist miscarriage of justice in Alabama, is further testimony to the notorious difficulty of producing a new musical.</p><p></p><p>Other evidence is around. <a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/10-2013/critics-divided-over-the-light-princess_32240.html\" title=\"\">The Light Princess, the Tori Amos-Samuel Adamson show at the National theatre</a>, had five years of delays, revisions and workshops before it reached the stage. And <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/books/nigel-simeone-edits-leonard-bernsteins-letters.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">The Leonard Bernstein Letters</a>, just published, contains pages of agonised correspondence, during the creation of West Side Story in 1957, between composer Bernstein, lyricist Stephen Sondheim, choreographer Jerome Robbins and Arthur Laurents, who provided the \"book\".</p><p></p><p>As the men were working together almost day and night, the rows between them were probably acted out in person rather than committed to foolscap, but Bernstein unloads the horrors of the process to his wife in long letters written during rehearsals and \"out of town tryouts\" in Washington and elsewhere. \"What's the use?\" the composer moans, deep into pre-production. \"The 24-hour schedule goes on â€“ I am tired &amp; nervous &amp; apey â€¦ this is the last show I am going to do.\" Elsewhere, he complains: \"The work is endless: I never sleep. Everything gets rewritten every day â€¦ and imagine, we open two weeks from Monday.\"</p><p></p><p>It is the crazed revision â€“ there are entire albums of Stephen Sondheim songs that were dropped from shows â€“ that is the constant and astonishing factor in accounts of the creation of musicals, regardless of whether they prove to be a hit or a flop. Samuel Adamson told me in an interview that he was startled by the rotating metamorphosis of The Light Princess in comparison with the speech dramas â€“ including Southwark Fair and Mrs Affleck â€“ that he had previously written. And most playwrights who moonlight in song and dance experience this culture shock.</p><p></p><p>Of all the many theatrical mishaps described by <a href=\"http://www.simongray.org.uk/diaries.html\" title=\"\">Simon Gray in his brilliant series of Diaries</a>, one of the most severe was his involvement in an early version of the 1993 Broadway musical The Red Shoes, composed by the then octogenarian Broadway legend Jule Styne, who wrote Gypsy and Funny Girl. Gray was one of many people who left the project during its development, and took his revenge by depicting Styne as a capricious egomaniac surrounded by a chorus of adoring aides. Public taste may also have been a balm for Gray, as The Red Shoes, after belatedly opening, closed after 51 previews (a quantity often indicating a troubled show) and five performances.</p><p></p><p>Possibly corroborating Gray's view, Jack Rosenthal, another British playwright who worked with Styne â€“ on a musical version of the TV play Bar Mitzvah Boy â€“ responded in similar fashion by writing a stage play, <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/31757/smash-\" title=\"\">Smash!</a>, in which a diffident dramatist is bullied and patronised by a lunatically self-regarding Broadway songwriter.</p><p></p><p>So why are musicals so hard to get right? One clue is in the cathartic rage with which Gray and Rosenthal set down their own version of events in a medium â€“ journa; theatre play â€“ over which they had sole control.</p><p></p><p>Whereas a straight play merely demands collaboration between a writer and a director (with producers and actors sometimes also having a say), a musical usually requires co-operation between a minimum of a composer, lyricist, dramatist and choreographer and, given the huge budgets general involved, often several producers. So a big show is lucky to get away with fewer than seven or eight credits, egos and their agents in the room. As at a European Union or United Nations summit, the diversity of rooted interests almost guarantees disagreement.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps the fundamental reason for the prevalence of off-stage drama is that the musical is an inherently artificial form and therefore, as with attempts at non-mechanical flight, most projects are doomed to extreme difficulty and probably failure.</p><p></p><p>Artificiality also applies to spoken drama, but the convention that invented characters are speaking made-up dialogue is rapidly established and accepted. Why does the protagonist make a long speech about his mother in act two? Well, because his mum died in act one, or because someone has just asked how she is. But for a character suddenly to burst into song about his mother is a development of a different order. Can the transition between spoken dialogue and song be achieved without disrupting the narrative flow or breaking the concentration of the audience? And is this \"mummy\" number sufficiently different from all the maternal tribute music written in the past? Perhaps the composer and lyricist could be sent to a hotel all night to knock out an alternative.</p><p></p><p>Because the musical is an inherently illogical form â€“ but with a greater craving for realism than its near-cousin, opera â€“ there will always be someone suggesting a different logic. Some writers â€“ for instance, middle-period Lloyd-Webber â€“ tried to solve the speech-song shifts by through-composing shows, but this merely introduces the new artifice of people singing bald exposition (\"I am his brother\") or banality (\"Will you want milk with that?\") at each other.</p><p></p><p>The single consolation of the death of Fred Ebb is that at least â€“ on Curtains and The Scottsboro Boys â€“ he got to leave most of the hell of musical gestation to other people.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421616740|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|4c0718a3d08811d20a2f4552dc6422ac1e6d1f66 -->",

        "body":"<p>Theatrical monster hits of recent years don't come much bigger than <a href=\"http://www.jerusalemtheplay.com/\" title=\"\">Jerusalem</a>, which bounced from the Royal Court to the West End and on to Broadway, scooping awards and prompting all-night camp-outs for tickets. But more than a decade earlier, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/jez-butterworth\" title=\"\">Jerusalem's writer, Jez Butterworth</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/about-us/artistic-directors/ian-rickson/\" title=\"\">director, Ian Rickson</a>, had launched another stage phenomenon at the Royal Court.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojo_%28play%29\" title=\"\">The rock'n'roll thriller Mojo</a>, Butterworth's first play, was set amid the pill-popping frenzy of 1950s Soho where two gangland bosses are locked in a power struggle over the pretty young heartthrob Silver Johnny. The reviews were glowing: this paper's Michael Billington called it \"the most dazzling main-stage debut in years\", while the Telegraph's Charles Spencer said of the first-night audience: \"Everyone knew they were at the birth of something special.\" Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise and Gary Oldman were in the audience, and Cruise sent a congratulatory postcard to the cast. It was the first main-stage debut at that theatre since John Osborne's Look Back in Anger in 1956. Or so the publicity claimed. \"I put that out there,\" Rickson says sheepishly. \"I don't think it was true. But the spirit of it felt right.\"</p><p>That electrifying 1995 production featured several rising stars: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/04/tom-hollander-rev-actor\" title=\"\">Tom Hollander, later to become Rev in the BBC sitcom</a>, played the petulant Baby, a Hamlet-like heir to one of Soho's crime empires; <a href=\"http://www.serkis.com/\" title=\"\">Andy Serkis â€“ who has spent most of the past decade squeezed into a motion-capture blue-suit to play Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films</a> â€“ was Potts, a stooge convinced he can benefit from the teenybopper bandwagon; and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0318821/\" title=\"\">Aidan Gillen, whose work in The Wire and Game of Thrones</a> has now made him one of the guarantors of quality television, played Skinny, whose worship of Baby is his undoing. Seventeen years after its debut in summer 1995, the play is being revived by Rickson with an equally impressive cast: Ben Whishaw as Baby, Daniel Mays as Potts, Brendan Coyle of Downton Abbey as the group's strategist, Mickey, and, making his stage debut, Rupert Grint as Potts's speed-freak sidekick Sweets.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421481453'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/1/1383324851823/Rehearsals-for-the-new-ve-009.jpg' alt='Rehearsals for the new version of Mojo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rehearsals for the new version of Mojo. Photograph: Simon Annand</figcaption></figure><p>When I drop in to the central London rehearsal space on an autumn afternoon, Whishaw is prowling the floor looking vulpine in a black leather jacket and shaggy hair. He's outsmarting the twitchy Mays and Grint, who are trying to distract him from the grisly secrets hidden downstage in a pair of silver dustbins. The room is filled with period props and paraphernalia, from a jukebox to an array of Tommy Steele album covers. A ping-pong table is there purely to allow the actors to let&nbsp;off steam after tackling the coiled dialogue, which itself has the rat-tat-tat rhythms of an Olympic-standard table-tennis match.</p><p>There are any number of reasons to revive Mojo, from the commercial (hitching a ride on the Jerusalem juggernaut) to the topical (the play's backdrop, with powerful showbiz crooks fighting over the flesh of children, has an unsavoury tang of the&nbsp;Saville era, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/dec/01/weekend.jonronson\" title=\"\">Jonathan King and the Walton Hop</a>). For Rickson, the main incentive was to ratify the play's standing. \"I think it's a modern classic,\" he says when I join him and Butterworth during their lunch break. The director is svelte and stubble-headed; the playwright resembles a jolly bear in a flat-cap. \"I just watched them do 20 minutes of act two, and it was so thrilling,\" says Butterworth. \"It's brilliant to see actors get that excited.\"</p><p>As if on cue, the cast members pour back in from their break and rush over to the ping-pong table for some noisy and rambunctious face-offs. \"To enshrine it now as a classic it has to be about the players who are available,\" observes Rickson. Though Whishaw and Grint will be the box-office draws, it is Mays who is the lynchpin of the new production. \"Jez and I have adored Daniel for many years. As far as I'm concerned, there are certain actors who can speak Butterworth. It then became about whether we could build a team around him.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421481454'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/1/1383325004606/Ben-Whishaw-as-Baby-in-Mo-008.jpg' alt='Ben Whishaw as Baby in Mojo.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ben Whishaw as Baby in Mojo. Photograph: Simon Annand</figcaption></figure><p>Whishaw had played Skinny in a production of the play at Rada, and jumped at the chance to graduate to Baby. \"I wanted to do it straight away,\" he says softly. \"We're all still kind of figuring the play out really. Baby is damaged, but then I suppose they're all damaged men.\"</p><p>The new cast members are united in their admiration of the writing. \"It's been quite hard mastering those rhythms,\" says Grint. \"There's lots of bouncing off one another, and it's so fast-paced and charged. But it's a lot of fun.\"</p><p>\"Jez was 24 when he wrote it,\" exclaims Mays incredulously. \"It's got that unapologetic rawness to it: it's someone pouring out their talent. It's&nbsp;fearless.\"</p><p>Butterworth was holed up with his brother and sometime co-writer Tom in a cottage in Pewsey â€“ the Wiltshire village which later became the setting for Jerusalem â€“ while he worked on the play in 1994. He survived for an entire year on the Â£1,500 that the producer AndrÃ© Ptaszynski had paid him to write it. \"It was a wonderful time,\" he sighs. \"And I had such a clear idea of the story â€“ more so than I've ever had of anything since. The fairytale idea I came up with right at the start: two kingdoms, two kings, both of whom are off-stage, and with Silver Johnny like a princess who gets stolen from one by the other. Then there are all the knights fighting over who's going to take over, and you've got the kingdom's rightful son, Baby, who is a bit useless. I wrote the first scene relentlessly for several months because I was trying to get the voice. Once I knew how everyone should sound, the rest came in a burst.\"</p><p>Rickson was part of Stephen Daldry's team at the Royal Court when he received a copy of Mojo. The pressure was on for the theatre to have a summer hit. \"I brought Jez in, we had a read-through with six actors, and we knew straight away we were onto a winner. The dogma of the time dictated that new playwrights went in the theatre upstairs, but Mojo felt constrained there. So Stephen did the bold thing: debut, main stage, bang!\"</p><p>The play was staged dynamically â€“ it's a claustrophobic piece punctuated by blasts of sound, light and violence â€“ with audiences becoming especially tense during a long scene in act two in which Silver Johnny is suspended from his ankles like a carcass in an abattoir. \"We're so prepared now,\" says Rickson. \"This kid Tom [Rhys Harries] has been on a special diet, done hanging practice, had his retinas checked, seen an osteopath.\" When I report this to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0558548/\" title=\"\">Hans Matheson</a>, who at 20 was the original Silver Johnny, he splutters. \"You're kidding? They didn't do any of that for me! I was convinced something was going to go wrong and I'd fall and break my neck.\"</p><p>Mojo was the hit the Royal Court was looking for. When the BBC suggested adapting it for cinema, Butterworth knew he wanted in. \"I was 26 and I'd always wanted to be a film director,\" he says. Matheson recalls visiting the playwright's Soho flat and seeing a book&nbsp;called How to Make a Film. \"It was&nbsp;there on the coffee table,\" he laughs. \"He must have thought, 'I'll get&nbsp;the manual.'\"</p><p>But Butterworth blotted his copybook with two important people. Sam Mendes had desperately wanted Mojo to be his own cinematic debut. \"Sam didn't talk to me for years afterwards,\" Butterworth admits. Then there was a controversial casting decision: for Baby, Butterworth dropped Hollander and promoted Aidan Gillen to the lead. \"I imagine Tom was stung to the core. Looking back, I think it was an unbelievably cold piece of business on my part,\" Butterworth says now.</p><p>Serkis and Matheson were also drafted in from the original production, and there was an important addition: <a href=\"http://www.haroldpinter.org/acting/acting_infilms.shtml\" title=\"\">Harold Pinter in an unforgettable cameo&nbsp;as the vulture-like paedophile gangster Sam Ross</a>, a character feared but never seen in the stage version. \"On set I was always thinking, 'I'm sure this isn't the most exciting thing we could be filming right now,'\" says Butterworth. But the static scene in which Pinter and Matheson are scrunched together on a sofa is taut and terrifying. \"That was the penultimate day of shooting, and it was the first thing that really worked.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421481455'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/1/1383324934541/Hans-Matheson-and-Harold--008.jpg' alt='Hans Matheson and Harold Pinter in the film version of Mojo' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hans Matheson and Harold Pinter in the film version of Mojo Photograph: Kobal</figcaption></figure><p>Matheson feels the same. \"The film&nbsp;was okay. Not rubbish-rubbish. But that scene was outrageous and naughty. Jez ruined a few takes from laughing. I just couldn't believe I was doing a scene with Harold Pinter. He wasn't someone who took any shit. I was rehearsing a song when he was in another dressing room and he came in, rolling his sleeves up, and shouted at us: 'Will you keep that bloody noise down?' I thought I was about to be decked by Harold Pinter.\"</p><p>At least the experience of adapting Mojo helped make up Butterworth's mind when the offers to film Jerusalem came in. \"It's not happening,\" he says decisively. Rickson concurs: \"There are two people who won't let it happen. Him and me.\" The men have worked together several times between Mojo and Jerusalem, and Butterworth also has a successful career as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Revisiting Mojo, though, is something they always planned to do. \"I feel there's this demo, the 1995 version,\" explains Rickson. \"And now we're going back&nbsp;and remastering it, trying to make&nbsp;it more itself. I see it now very differently: it's an austere, savage, hilarious ritual about tribes of men under threat.\" Butterworth is even more concise. \"The main reason for doing it â€“ and it's taken me a while to work this out â€“ is that it was a really, really good play. There aren't that many of them around, so it's worth doing one when you can.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421472656|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|65c5dec0bca3ef5bc4ec2fcde52d9a69e08599b8 -->",

The show was being performed at the Aria resort and casino.</p><p>In June, Sarah Guillot-Guyard, a French acrobat, fell 29m to her death during a midair battle scene in the show KA in Las Vegas.

        "body":"<p>You're just out of jail. You've changed. But the world has changed, too, and nothing is quite where you expect it to be. Your relatives aren't overjoyed. You wonder what they're really thinking. What if they don't want you to be there? What if they never have?</p><p>For three decades, the <a href=\"http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk/mission\" title=\"\">Clean Break theatre company</a> have paired some of the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/nov/08/clean-break-women-prison-theatre\" title=\"\">exciting female writers</a> around â€“ among them Lucy Kirkwood and Rebecca Lenkiewicz â€“ with women who are in the criminal justice system. Katie Hims' new three-hander, distilled from residencies at HMP Holloway and HMP <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder/askham-grange\" title=\"\">Askham Grange</a>, suggests that, for many who've been released, returning to their old lives and trying to make them new is the biggest trial of all.</p><p>Here, it's Billy who has come home. She's hectic with good intentions (\"My new approach,\" she beams, clutching a pineapple, \"my new, like, positive approach\"), but Ingrid, her mother, is dubious. Besides, Ingrid has other things on her mind: her new man Eddie, who looks like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJWD6_5aQDQ\" title=\"\">Patrick Swayze</a> with a pigtail and earns his living hosting seances. Billy's teenage sister, Amber, has the voice of an angel, but what is she really doing when she claims to be at choir practice? And then there's a wedding, which must be kept secret. Billy herself isn't even allowed inside the house, so it's in front of an elderly caravan parked in the back garden (a finely conceived <a href=\"http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk/productions/billy-girl\" title=\"\">dingy design</a> by Joanna Scotcher) that battle lines are redrawn and old wounds reopened.</p><p>Agonising though this triangle is â€“ and often it's agonisingly funny â€“ Hims' hour-and-a-half play seems somehow trapped in its premise, and, like the caravan, you begin to wish it would roam further. There are heavy hints of what has happened to Billy's stepfather (a Thermos of whose ashes gaze at us balefully throughout), and the final twist is awkward; you often sense the script grazing emotional truth without managing to make sustained contact.</p><p>But there are good things here, not least sprightly performances from Danusia Samal and Naomi Ackie as sisters who discover a skew-whiff complicity with each other. It is the only play in English drama I can think of to explore the confessional uses of a bear costume. And in Christine Entwisle's Ingrid â€“ a study in phosphorescent makeup and hazy self-delusion (\"The dead are with us always,\" she coos, \"that's what Eddie says\") â€“ it has a character who would look at home in a Cumbrian version of Tennessee Williams. Funny though Billy the Girl is, its most lasting insight is a sad one: that you don't have to be in prison to be trapped.</p><p>â€¢ Did you catch this show â€“ or any other recently?

Click to view</a></p><p>\"Does that word have a rude origin?\" asks Peep Show star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/03/isy-suttie-peep-show-interview\" title=\"\">Isy Suttie</a>. \"There's a word that comes from the sound of a dick hitting something. Is that blap?\" Channel 4's new comedy boss <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/phil-clarke-named-as-channel-4s-new-head-of-comedy\" title=\"\">Phil Clarke</a> isn't sure either:  \"I was told it was a made-up word, and to 'stop asking questions, old man!'\" Comedian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John-Luke_Roberts\" title=\"\">John Luke-Roberts</a> just thinks it's a \"satisfying word to say\".</p><p>Whatever its origins, it's somewhat clearer what a \"blap\" actually is: today, the Guardian makes exclusively available online a new batch of <a href=\"http://comedyblaps.channel4.com/\" title=\"\">Channel 4's Comedy Blaps</a>. A blap, says Clarke, is \"a pilot for a pilot\", a five- or six-minute shock of comedy, commissioned by the channel to road-test new talent, and broadcast online. Sixteen mini-series of blaps have been created in the last two years, clocking up 2.6m views between them. They've featured talent including Aussie comic <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/69739558\" title=\"\">Claudia O'Doherty</a> and Irish hip-hop hoodlums <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSorEwCM7Fw&amp;list=PL179EDAD1ACB1B501&amp;index=32\" title=\"\">The Rubberbandits</a>, award-winning sexy clown <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfONJQ7DudQ&amp;list=PL179EDAD1ACB1B501&amp;index=13\" title=\"\">Dr Brown</a> and the animators behind scuzzy cartoon <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr3eT3kZz4A&amp;list=PL179EDAD1ACB1B501&amp;index=20\" title=\"\">Modern Toss</a>.</p><p>Today's release features the stars of the <a href=\"http://noblefailure.org/\" title=\"\">Alternative Comedy Memorial Society</a>, a regular night launched in 2011 by John-Luke Roberts and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/aug/28/thom-tuck-review\" title=\"\">Thom Tuck</a> to showcase the best in indie comedy. Rather than transfer that live event directly to the screen, Roberts has written a part-sketch, part-sitcom format, which finds the 10 ACMS comics holding a board meeting in a building that's being consumed by fire. The four webisodes (my apologies for the word) find <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/aug/28/bridget-christie-edinburgh-comedy-award\" title=\"\">Edinburgh comedy award champ Bridget Christie</a> dreaming up hare-brained schemes to escape the flames, <a href=\"http://www.josielong.com/\" title=\"\">Josie Long</a> being executed by the grim reaper, and Suttie largely confined to the inside of a cardboard box.</p><p>They're great fun, and give a glimpse of what this collective of freewheeling comics could do with a full 30 minutes of TV. But will they get that far? So far, several blaps have graduated to pilot, but none to full series â€“ except <a href=\"http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/000001128/\" title=\"\">Nick Helm's Uncle</a>, which was finally turned down by Channel 4, then picked up by the BBC. The danger, as comedy commissioner Clarke is aware, is that the blap format starts to look like a ghetto for innovative new talent, running on parallel tracks to the channel's main output.</p><p>Clarke is adamant that won't happen: \"The blap has always got to be the first step on a ladder.\" What's exciting about the scheme, he says, is that blaps allow more talent in front of the camera. \"We can make so few full pilots here,\" he says: \"between six and 10 every year if we absolutely go hell-for-leather. And that's a bottleneck.\" Blaps are cheaper than pilots, and need less oversight. They widen the gene pool. And they give more talent the chance, not just to pitch their ideas, but to bring them to life. \"The advantage of doing a blap is that [the potential show] is in front of you. You can go back and look at it all the time. A script has to exist in your imagination, and you might imagine something completely different. But a blap is a tangible proposition.\"</p><p>So how does the talent feel? Are blaps another unnecessary hoop to jump through â€“ or a new and improved opportunity to get work on (or near) TV? Both, says John-Luke Roberts â€“ but he's inclined to be positive. \"As a comedian, you're constantly trying out stuff in front of audiences, getting feedback, finding out what works and what doesn't. If you can do that for broadcast too, without it being massively high-stakes, that's a good development.\"</p><p>It's certainly preferable to the old system. \"Most of my work for TV,\" says Roberts, \"has been putting forward an idea, getting somewhere with the idea, working on the idea for a long time, and then people going, 'no, we don't like it,' for no rational reason.\" Suttie agrees: \"Ideas get talked and talked and talked over, and you just want to shoot someone. Whereas,\" she adds, \"the minute you've got a concrete thing you can show people, you're in a much better position.\"</p><p>What blaps do too is democratise the decision-making process, at least a little â€“ in that commissioning editors may find online popularity and Twitter buzz a persuasive reason to take a blap to the next level. There's certainly an audience for this new medium: bite-sized, web-based comedy is a boom phenomenon. The BBC has its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01bhx0w/episodes/guide\" title=\"\">Feed My Funny</a> strand, available on iPlayer. YouTube recently ran its inaugural <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/may/20/youtube-comedy-week-sarah-silverman\" title=\"\">Comedy Week</a>, and this month saw the launch of new online comedy network/production company <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/TheWagonComedy\" title=\"\">The Wagon</a>, which numbers Jack Whitehall among its clients.</p><p>So is the five-minute Comedy Blap really just \"a pilot for a pilot\" â€“ or is it an end in itself? Roberts certainly didn't consider the ACMS blap as a mere dry run. \"If there's one thing you learn in this business, it's that we probably won't get a chance to make this again. So we made it as good as we can for this format and this occasion.\" But he â€“ and Suttie â€“ aren't ready yet for a world in which we all consume our screen comedy in five-minute chunks. (Or to put it another way: they do want a series.) Back at Channel 4, Clarke is more relaxed about the 21st-century format free-for-all. \"These things are changing fast as technology changes,\" he says, cheerfully. \"But there's no reason to panic, because people still want content. As long as it's about how funny or clever or engaging the comedy is, how it's viewed is academic.\"</p><h2><strong>Watch the rest of the episodes here: </strong></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/31/comedy-blap-episode-2\">Episode 2: The Bloody First Floor Is on Fire, Guys!</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/31/alternative-comedy-memorial-society-episode-3\">Episode 3: Well, I'll Be, The Fire's on the Second Floor (Third, if You Are American)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/31/alternative-comedy-memorial-society-episode-4\">Episode 4: Well, Great, the Bloody Third Floor Is on Fire Now</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421304185|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1b590f54e7d8789b716a3d094d9c8f365079fab6 -->",
