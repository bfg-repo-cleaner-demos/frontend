        "headline":"Comedy is a land fraught with pitfalls for politicians",
        "body":"<p>With comedians being encouraged to share their opinions in judge-led inquiries and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2013/oct/31/robert-webb-russell-brand-open-letters\" title=\"\">open letters</a>, we know that they can make an attention-grabbing contribution to political debate. Consider whether, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, it would have been better for them to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt. It's a witty line from the 16th president, but if politics and comedy were to hold an exchange programme, there's little doubt that politicians would flunk it.</p><p>Most politicians know they aren't funny, and that the material they work with isn't going to thrill. President Lyndon Johnson once said: \"Did you ever think that making a speech on economics is a lot like pissing down your leg? It seems hot to you, but it never does to anyone else.\" How Johnson came to have so much experience is unknown, but his self-deprecation has some charm.</p><p>Politicians aren't afforded the same artistic licence that comedians enjoy. A good joke usually requires a victim, and the only safe victims for politicians are their opponents or themselves. That's why, when David Cameron was asked what his favourite joke was he famously replied \"Nick Clegg\". When Tony Blair sent his first text a day after leaving office and the reply came asking who he was, he told chatshow host <a href=\"http://video.sina.com.cn/v/b/57660058-1686525547.html\" title=\"\">David Letterman</a> in mock horror: \"I thought, 'It's only been 24 hours!'.\" Safety is never the hallmark of a great joke. Where Frankie Boyle can say of Gordon Brown, \"He looks like a sad face that someone has drawn on to their scrotum\", no politician can follow him.</p><p>While we allow comedians scope to criticise capitalism and the government, yet keep their millions offshore, politicians remain under a scrutiny that is toxic to jokes. When Sarah Palin mocked Obama during the economic crisis with, \"How's that hopey-changey stuff working out for ya?\", the shtick of her soccer-mom comic persona was undermined by her not knowing the role of the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/13/sarah-palins-most-cringe_n_230502.html?slidenumber=2\" title=\"\">vice-president of the US</a>.</p><p>The most recent attempt at stand-up comedy from politicians came last week during <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2y8x1_0OU8\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband's speech</a> at the Spectator Parliamentarian of the Year awards, in which he read the \"Ed Miliband's Dad Killed My Kitten\" story from the Sunday Sport, including the line, \"only a Belgian communist could have killed a kitten in cold blood like that, the red bastard\". Miliband's is a dry, cautious humour. He read the article – itself an unintended joke – but added no real material of his own. This is despite his office being known to have <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/01/08/ed-milibands-pmqs-joke-writer-advert_n_1192232.html\" title=\"\">advertised for comedians</a> to write jokes for him in the past.</p><p>Politicians tend to be unwittingly amusing. The stupidity and ambition of politicians is a rich source of humour, but rarely one that they can tap themselves. Toronto mayor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/05/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-crack-cocaine\" title=\"\">Rob Ford</a>'s media meltdown has so far included having to admit to smoking crack and making alleged threats to kill when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/nov/08/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-drunken-rant-video\" title=\"\">video footage</a> became public, all while maintaining that he will stand for re-election in 2014. His tragic personal collapse is made amusing by the insistence that he will continue running, much as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/24/anthony-weiner-pressure-latest-revelations\" title=\"\">Anthony Weiner</a> refused to pull out of the New York mayoral elections this year even after a crippling series of news stories about his habit of sexting people who weren't his wife under the pseudonym Carlos Danger.</p><p>Few politicians have ever possessed the skill and ease to pull off a truly funny joke. Few today could compare to Winston Churchill, with lines such as: \"Politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow, next week, next month and next year. And to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didn't happen.\" Perhaps Obama comes close with comments such as: \"The fact is I really do respect the press. I recognise that the press and I have different jobs to do. My job is to be president; your job is to keep me humble. Frankly, I think I'm doing my job better.''</p><p>The cynics will say that few politicians write any of their own material, and that they are all in politics for the money, fame and power. Do we know what percentage of their own material top comedians write? They certainly earn more, and they can command a significantly bigger and more attentive audience. There's little danger that the trend for comedians talking politics will encourage politicians to try and job swap, but maybe the real risk is for comedians who seek to be taken seriously and find themselves swimming in the safe, shallow end of the pool.</p><p><em>• </em>Series two of Rupert Myers' politics and comedy podcast <a href=\"http://www.politicaltakeout.com\" title=\"\">Political Takeout</a>returns on 12 November</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422031738|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|d82bd18b74d09b99d1de864b1bc41b5d061e8bf2 -->",

However inclusive we are, we have standards to maintain.\"</p><p>Setting aside (as the headteacher himself did) any arguments for special religious dispensation, the head's words speak volumes. Sporting a beard is seen as a choice, and making that choice somehow lowers standards.</p><p>Like all beardies, I don't have a beard through choice. It just grew on the front of my face. I choose to have a beard in the same way that I choose to have two legs. Yes, I suppose I could elect to remove either of the offending limbs, but I'm damned if I'm going to.</p><p>The Accrington headteacher isn't alone. Society seems to think that scraping or strimming the hair off your face is an admirable thing to do; that not doing so is odd. Paxman appears on Newsnight – after the watershed – with full, unadulterated facial hair, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/13/jeremy-paxman-beard-tickles-newsnight-twitter\" title=\"\">Twitter erupts</a>.

Nigel Slater <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/22/diary-working-week-nigel-slater\" title=\"\">sprouts some facial fuzz</a> and braces himself for the inevitable flak. Get over it: they're only beards.</p><p>Men who go for the default (bearded) option aren't making some kind of statement; it's those who choose to mow their faces who seem to have something to prove. What's your problem? Afraid to grow up, boys? Ashamed of your masculinity? In <a href=\"http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/much_2_1.html\" title=\"\">Much Ado About Nothing</a>, Beatrice had it right: \"He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man.\"</p><p>The world is outraged when an 18-year-old pop starlet <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4\" title=\"\">dresses as a schoolgirl</a> to sell a few million singles. Yet when fully grown men shave their faces for that prepubescent-schoolboy look, nobody bats an eyelid. It's all seen as perfectly normal. Standards must be maintained.</p><p>Such nonsense was even going on in 19th-century Tierra del Fuego. When Charles Darwin witnessed the meeting of a man known as York Minster, one of the Fuegian natives abducted during the Beagle voyage, with some of his long-lost compatriots, <a href=\"http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/charles_darwin/voyage_of_beagle/Chapter10.html\" title=\"\">he recorded</a>: \"When York Minster afterwards came on shore, they […] told him he ought to shave; yet he had not twenty dwarf hairs on his face, whilst we all wore our untrimmed beards.\" York Minster was letting his hide-clad, stone-age side down in front of the uncouth Europeans, it would seem.</p><p>What about the environment? Have the face-strimmers ever stopped to consider the carbon footprint of their unnatural daily ritual? Figures I've just made up indicate that, were every man in Britain to refrain from shaving, we would be able to close two medium-sized coal-fired power stations. So there you have it: grow a beard and save the planet. Baby-faced George Monbiot ought to hang his head in shame. He of all people should appreciate the enchantment of going feral.</p><p>Not convinced? Carry on scraping your faces, if it makes you happy, chaps. But don't try to pretend for a second that those of us who don't are the ones making the freakish choice.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419697337|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|b8e216b9704ac5635fcddb5453704566b7f261f1 -->",

        "body":"<p>As a lifelong cyclist, I'm usually spared the horrors of public transport. Suitcases (and worse) pressing into my coccyx, Metro horoscopes, vomit, delays and the smell of someone else's sweaty armpits – I happily avoid them.</p><p>But one new public transport phenomenon has recently crashed into my consciousness. Tumblr accounts dedicated to secretly photographing, uploading and then critiquing fellow commuters, have spored like bed bugs on a bus seat. From the <a href=\"http://tubecrush.net/\" title=\"\">apparently flattering</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.sleepycommuters.co.uk/\" title=\"\">supposedly endearing</a> to the <a href=\"http://peopleonthebus.tumblr.com\" title=\"\">allegedly hilarious</a>, there seems to be a blog to capture every kind of commuter.</p><p>British law on photographing people in public places is still quite malleable. While the European convention on human rights codifies everyone's right to private and family life, you do not, legally, have to get permission from those you photograph in the street, on the train or sitting on a bus. Meanwhile, despite a European court of human rights declaration that the stop-and-search powers granted under section 44 of the 2000 Terrorism Act were being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/23/photographers-protest-stop-search-terrorism-police\" title=\"\">wrongfully used to target photographers</a>, the law is still apparently misunderstood even <a href=\"http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/photo-news/538898/photographers-slam-police-over-indecent-photos-update\" title=\"\">by the police themselves</a>.</p><p>Frankly, the whole legal issue is murkier than a dimly lit pub toilet selfie. But while the legal argument is fraught, the moral debate surely is not.</p><p>Every day, blogs like <a href=\"http://mentakingup2muchspaceonthetrain.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Men Taking Up Too Much Space On The Train</a> post clandestine pictures of commuters, under the snide and self-proclaimed mission of public shaming. Frankly, if I had a loose assemblage of bulky, heat-sensitive genitals hanging between my legs, I would probably sit with my knees hip-width apart too. Most of these men are doing absolutely nothing wrong. And yet their image, including their faces, is being uploaded to the internet and they are being judged by thousands of strangers, all without their knowledge.</p><p>Turn that gender picture on its head and perhaps you'll see why this is unacceptable. Were a man to secretly photograph me – a young woman – upload that photo to Tumblr and invite comments from other users, I think my sisters would be throwing up their hands in horror. And rightly so – the Japanese iPhone has a shutter sound that <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/07/pervert-alert-j/\" title=\"\">cannot be turned off</a>, specifically to guard against snap-happy perverts. And yet, I rarely hear the same language being applied to women who upload submissions to <a href=\"http://hotguysonthetrain.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Hot Guys On The Train</a>. Last week I saw a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tonygardner/status/382416561933676545\" title=\"\">man tweet:</a> \"Girl sat opposite on tube tried to take a sneaky photo of me. Her flash went off. She was mortified.\" Mortified she might have been, but was he not also angry?</p><p>There is also, of course, the question of money. If these blogs are sufficiently popular to gain advertising space, then those photos are no longer not-for-profit, amusing, public-realm snaps. They are a commodity. And the people in them, by extension, are no longer just strangers on a train – they are models.</p><p>As with all photographs, context and composition are key. While it is one thing to take an unidentifiable snap of a <a href=\"http://shoesonthetube.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">fellow commuter's footwear</a> it is quite another to upload a <a href=\"http://peopleonthebus.tumblr.com/post/3941888941/here-is-the-picture-of-the-homeless-guy-who\" title=\"\">full portrait of a total stranger</a> accompanied by the comment: \"Here is the picture of the homeless guy who threatened to kill me after I took his picture.\"</p><p>Of course, some photos taken on transport are funny. Who among us didn't snicker at <a href=\"http://redditlurker.com/pics/Post/t3_pv7yk\" title=\"\">Hitler on the bus</a>? But that doesn't make it right. Because that wasn't really Hitler, it was just a man, in Plymouth, who got laughed at by millions, without any hope of recourse.</p><p>Call me a ludicrous old libertarian. But I, for one, just don't think we should shoot strangers in public spaces.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418991273|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|c750d2e85bb133bfab5ac93332e5852f6ba2bc8e -->",

If anecdotal evidence is anything to go by, this year's crop of graduates are sat in their bedrooms, tapping \"recruitment agency\" into Google and trying not to burst into tears while panicking about what they will be doing in a year's time, as further anecdotal evidence suggests they will be jobless and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2327674/Staggering-million-parents-50-grown-children-living-home.html\" title=\"\">still sleeping in their teenage bedrooms</a>.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/417222/Why-young-love-will-no-longer-last-for-a-lifetime\" title=\"\">Co-operative has commissioned a study</a> revealing it's taking young adults a bit longer to become proper grown-ups. According to its research, just one in seven people under 30 are married, and one in nine have children – when their grandparents tended to reach the traditional life milestones much quicker, with four out of five over-60s married by the age of 25, and over half with children at that age.</p><p></p><p>This is causing widespread anxiety – and not just among the retired parents desperate for grandchildren. The emergence of a \"quarter-life crisis\" among those in their mid-20s has been well-documented, with many people in that age bracket saying that their distance from perceived \"life goals\" is making them feel depressed and fearful. The problems are economic as well as emotional. Many in their 20s struggle to find jobs that allow them to earn enough to pay rent. If having a house and a family seem out of reach financially, there's less incentive to start looking for a person to share those things with.</p><p></p><p>The clinical psychologist Meg Jay caused a stir with <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/meg_jay_why_30_is_not_the_new_20.html\" title=\"\">a TED talk recently</a> that warned twentysomethings not to treat that period of their life as a \"throwaway decade\", and urged them to start planning their lives as soon as possible. Much of Jay's advice was focused around finding the right partner as soon as possible, and she implied that people in their 20s aren't moving forward with their lives because they're lazy and indecisive. The reality is that most young people don't have enough structural support in their lives to make plans. It has never been harder to buy a house, or forge a career path – and there's not much that people in their 20s can individually do about that, considering the current economic climate.</p><p></p><p>However, I believe there is an upside to forcibly delaying your future. You may be an adult in the eyes of the law, but you're still maturing. Deciding to share your life with someone shouldn't be an arbitrary goal, to be achieved by a certain point, and being forced to wait to settle down means that when you're able to do it, you'll be better prepared for it emotionally.</p><p></p><p>An enforced life delay gives young people time to better explore their options. Younger people who live and study away from home, or go travelling, or use social networks and online dating sites, have much more choice when it comes to finding the person who's right for them. They don't have to settle when they settle down – and they shouldn't have to. Marrying and starting a family as soon as you can is no guarantee of happiness. Arguably, you're better prepared for a lasting relationship if you've given yourself time to mature as a single adult, instead of starting a family when you're still growing up. You can't hurry love.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413602880|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|48cb7045b5ce867c4a9a1e5741837e23f1fe2d0f -->",

        "body":"<p>With comedians being encouraged to share their opinions in judge-led inquiries and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2013/oct/31/robert-webb-russell-brand-open-letters\" title=\"\">open letters</a>, we know that they can make an attention-grabbing contribution to political debate. Consider whether, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, it would have been better for them to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt. It's a witty line from the 16th president, but if politics and comedy were to hold an exchange programme, there's little doubt that politicians would flunk it.</p><p>Most politicians know they aren't funny, and that the material they work with isn't going to thrill. President Lyndon Johnson once said: \"Did you ever think that making a speech on economics is a lot like pissing down your leg? It seems hot to you, but it never does to anyone else.\" How Johnson came to have so much experience is unknown, but his self-deprecation has some charm.</p><p>Politicians aren't afforded the same artistic licence that comedians enjoy. A good joke usually requires a victim, and the only safe victims for politicians are their opponents or themselves. That's why, when David Cameron was asked what his favourite joke was he famously replied \"Nick Clegg\". When Tony Blair sent his first text a day after leaving office and the reply came asking who he was, he told chatshow host <a href=\"http://video.sina.com.cn/v/b/57660058-1686525547.html\" title=\"\">David Letterman</a> in mock horror: \"I thought, 'It's only been 24 hours!'.\" Safety is never the hallmark of a great joke. Where Frankie Boyle can say of Gordon Brown, \"He looks like a sad face that someone has drawn on to their scrotum\", no politician can follow him.</p><p>While we allow comedians scope to criticise capitalism and the government, yet keep their millions offshore, politicians remain under a scrutiny that is toxic to jokes. When Sarah Palin mocked Obama during the economic crisis with, \"How's that hopey-changey stuff working out for ya?\", the shtick of her soccer-mom comic persona was undermined by her not knowing the role of the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/13/sarah-palins-most-cringe_n_230502.html?slidenumber=2\" title=\"\">vice-president of the US</a>.</p><p>The most recent attempt at stand-up comedy from politicians came last week during <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2y8x1_0OU8\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband's speech</a> at the Spectator Parliamentarian of the Year awards, in which he read the \"Ed Miliband's Dad Killed My Kitten\" story from the Sunday Sport, including the line, \"only a Belgian communist could have killed a kitten in cold blood like that, the red bastard\". Miliband's is a dry, cautious humour. He read the article – itself an unintended joke – but added no real material of his own. This is despite his office being known to have <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/01/08/ed-milibands-pmqs-joke-writer-advert_n_1192232.html\" title=\"\">advertised for comedians</a> to write jokes for him in the past.</p><p>Politicians tend to be unwittingly amusing. The stupidity and ambition of politicians is a rich source of humour, but rarely one that they can tap themselves. Toronto mayor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/05/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-crack-cocaine\" title=\"\">Rob Ford</a>'s media meltdown has so far included having to admit to smoking crack and making alleged threats to kill when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/nov/08/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-drunken-rant-video\" title=\"\">video footage</a> became public, all while maintaining that he will stand for re-election in 2014. His tragic personal collapse is made amusing by the insistence that he will continue running, much as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/24/anthony-weiner-pressure-latest-revelations\" title=\"\">Anthony Weiner</a> refused to pull out of the New York mayoral elections this year even after a crippling series of news stories about his habit of sexting people who weren't his wife under the pseudonym Carlos Danger.</p><p>Few politicians have ever possessed the skill and ease to pull off a truly funny joke. Few today could compare to Winston Churchill, with lines such as: \"Politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow, next week, next month and next year. And to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didn't happen.\" Perhaps Obama comes close with comments such as: \"The fact is I really do respect the press. I recognise that the press and I have different jobs to do. My job is to be president; your job is to keep me humble. Frankly, I think I'm doing my job better.''</p><p>The cynics will say that few politicians write any of their own material, and that they are all in politics for the money, fame and power. Do we know what percentage of their own material top comedians write? They certainly earn more, and they can command a significantly bigger and more attentive audience. There's little danger that the trend for comedians talking politics will encourage politicians to try and job swap, but maybe the real risk is for comedians who seek to be taken seriously and find themselves swimming in the safe, shallow end of the pool.</p><p><em>• </em>Series two of Rupert Myers' politics and comedy podcast <a href=\"http://www.politicaltakeout.com\" title=\"\">Political Takeout</a>returns on 12 November</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422031738|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|d82bd18b74d09b99d1de864b1bc41b5d061e8bf2 -->",

        "headline":"'If you are allergic to black people, don't come in' – at first I balked …",
        "body":"<p>Increasingly in today's Britain, the word racism conjures up two very differing images for white and black people (I use black here in the political sense). When I explain to white friends that certain things that I have had said or done to me are racist, it is more often that not met with incredulity. How can that be racist?</p><p>The truth is the most prevalent forms of racism, which many black people experience today, are the insidious kinds. The sideways looks in predominantly white areas suggesting your presence there is beyond the norm. At work, your position of authority undermined by the all-too-easy questioning of your knowledge and experience. And, in the case of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-23248503\" title=\"\">Martha-Renee Kolleh</a>, the knowledge that the reason your cafe has such a low footfall is because you are black; the sight of your skin and not the menu explains why potential customers won't be dining with you after all. Her reaction? To create a sign warning the following: \"Attention! Everyone be aware, I am a black woman, and always will be. If you are allergic to black people, don't come in!\"</p><p>I initially balked at Kolleh's move. I feared it played into the hands of those who long to dismiss the very real problems she is attempting to highlight. She's would be seen as just another angry black woman. Yet, if so, her anger is justified. Though I cannot speak for all black people, I know, from workshops with the group <a href=\"http://www.blackfeminists.org/\" title=\"\">Black Feminists</a>, that far too many feel the same desperation and desire to speak back to the insidious racists.</p><p>Though born in London, I consider myself a Yorkshire lass. A few weeks ago, a trip to a popular Dales village reminded me of why being in all-white areas is increasingly something I am reluctant to do. I was with a disabled pensioner in his 80s and my 10-month-old. We needed a place to park that would be accessible. Two white, middle-aged male cyclists occupied the available spot. I walked over with a smile and while pointing to the car, a few metres away, asked if it was OK for them to move so that we could use the parking space. They looked at me, then at the car and continued to talk to each other. As I was standing there numbed by their rudeness, a white man in an open-top sports car pulled by and asked them the same question I had seconds earlier. They genially replied \"oh, yes\". It all happened so quickly that onlookers would have been fooled into thinking that they had simply not heard me. I won't even mention the number of stares I got just walking around the village and, no, it had nothing to do with my attractiveness or indeed lack thereof.</p><p>The room for doubt is what makes this subtle form of racism so deeply damaging. It calls into question your understanding of reality and further delegitimises your experiences in the eyes of others and sometimes yourself. Its nebulous nature means that the moment and wounding has, more often than not, come and gone before you are able to articulate your anger and frustration. It is so hard to challenge. If, indeed, you are able to confront the subtle racist, you are told that \"you see racism everywhere\", as if to say, it isn't. Worse still, you are called aggressive and if you are particularly lucky, told that you, in fact, are the racist.</p><p>Kolleh made a necessary and brave choice from a set of limited options. She chose not to remain silent. Not to be labelled as paranoid, or blowing out of proportion what she knows and feels to be true. Not to accept that she is in denial about the quality of her restaurant. Not to be \"objective\" when the umpteenth person walked in and then swiftly out after catching a glimpse of her black face. She chose a much more difficult, yet rewarding option. She chose to remain and confidentially challenge. And in speaking back with defiance, she has opened a space for the little town of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossett\" title=\"\">Ossett</a> to engage in a dialogue. People are now discussing the subtle forms of racism some of its inhabitants enact upon others.</p><p>Let us not, however, pretend that such racism only exists in sleepy northern towns and villages. Buying a birthday card in an upmarket gift shop, on one of the most fashionable high streets of Hackney, \"<a href=\"http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ce-pandc-equality-diversity-861.htm\" title=\"\">one of the most racially diverse areas in the UK</a>\", I was \"unseen\" when a cashier attempted to serve a white customer before me. This despite the fact that I was at the counter, with my wallet in my hands. We are either all too visible or conveniently invisible.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412604773|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|ab44fef90dcc1b6a54c7e6bfc2fbeb99fb0950ad -->",

        "headline":"Breastfeeding won't seem normal until we see more pictures of it",
        "body":"<p>You would have had to have been living in a cave not to have noticed the increased interest in celebrity mums in the media over the last decade. From judgmental and vicious attacks on Nadya Doud-Suleman (more commonly referred to as the \"Octomom\"), to hyperbolic revelry at the Duchess of Cambridge giving birth to Prince George, the insatiable media mill has placed an unprecedented level of scrutiny on mothers.</p><p>Of course it's not a one-way street. Celebrities tweet, Instagram and Facebook their way through their pregnancies. Thinly disguised as sisterly sharing, it often comes across as sanctimonious showing off, and celebrity and audience alike are more aware that the act of becoming a mother can provide valuable exposure.</p><p>However, if you take away the captions and just look at the pictures, what is revealed is a series of old stereotypes: the Madonna motif is repeated, families snuggle together in group hugs and young babies are held up while the mother looks adoringly into their eyes. What's most intriguing about the representation of celebrity mothering in popular culture is what's missing: pictures of breastfeeding and the postpartum body.</p><p>The reaction to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/30/pregnancy-women-bodies-duchess-of-cambridge\" title=\"\">Kate Middleton's weight</a> as she left hospital just days after giving birth revealed that the public is not very good at dealing with realistic pictures of mothering. The fact that so many people were shocked indicates their ignorance that a bump doesn't instantly disappear once a baby has been born. This in itself is not shameful; how can people know this if they have not gone through the experience and have seen no pictures which normalise this?</p><p>Photographers have attempted to address this misconception. Two recent  projects celebrated the postpartum body – Jade Beall's <a href=\"http://www.abeautifulbodyproject.com/\" title=\"\">A Beautiful Body</a> and <a href=\"http://4thtrimesterbodies.com/\" title=\"\">The 4th Trimester Bodies Project</a> by Ashlee Wells Jackson – and went viral on the internet. Shot in a purposefully arty, studio setup in tasteful black and white, they have overtones of Dove's \"empowering\" commercials of real women. However, the poses still repeat the same old tropes, only naked.</p><p>Breasts are even more complicated. Photographic representation of breastfeeding can be read as a shortcut for instant shock value, especially when on pages generally more associated with fashion imagery. In 2006 Steven Klein shot the model Angela Lindvall nursing her son Sebastian for American Vogue, following in the footsteps of Annie Leibovitz, who photographed Jerry Hall breastfeeding her son Gabriel for the cover of the Australian's weekend magazine in 1999. Both of these images have a high level of authority and visual charge that's at odds with the more nurturing and benign Madonna, but they are essentially fashion photographs of models who are well practised at posing.</p><p>Occasionally, one glimpses paparazzi shots of a celebrity shrouding their baby and breast with what is indelicately called a \"hooter hider\" in the US. But there was a huge backlash against the recent Time cover of <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2114427,00.html?pcd=pw-hl\" title=\"\">Jamie Lynne Grumet nursing her three-year-old son</a>, photographed by Martin Schoeller. In this case it was of course not only the exposure of the breast, but the fact that her son was not a newborn that caused indignation. Societal values associated with age and breastfeeding are confused: Britain suggests an arbitrary six months, the US recommends a year and the World Health Organisation advocates at least two.</p><p>Breastfeeding sits in the middle of two very contradictory forces. On one hand it is simply not represented in popular culture; it has yet to be normalised by the sheer repetition of seeing it every day online, on television or in print media. But on the other hand women are shamed if they do not do it. Governmental forces and lobby groups insist it is best, but how can women comfortably do it if it is not accepted visually? The British poet Hollie McNish has written of these overwhelming feelings of shame and being forced to breastfeed in a public toilet, her <a href=\"http://www.closeronline.co.uk/2013/07/british-mum-silences-breastfeeding-critics-with-passionate-poem\" title=\"\">\"baby's first sips are drown-drenched in shite\"</a>.</p><p>Can photography change these attitudes? In 1991, when Leibovitz photographed a heavily pregnant Demi Moore for the cover of Vanity Fair, the western world was shocked. Now the web is awash with pregnant women \"doing a Demi\" and pregnancy has come out of the shadows of subjects that cannot be publicly represented.</p><p>It's up to photographers, photo editors and art directors to be brave enough to commission and publish photos which give new mothers a visual rubric in which to feel comfortable enough to nurse publicly. Facebook needs to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/29/facebook-breastfeeding-photo-policy-confused\" title=\"\">lift its ridiculous nipple ban</a> and nursing pictures should be no big deal on Instagram feeds.</p><p>When images of breastfeeding and postpartum tummies enter our popular culture, they will help to provide a path away from ignorance and embarrassment.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419887950|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|698e24213925dff40bf63b3504e82d35e0917ff8 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"OMG, you have to watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\" title=\"\">Breaking Bad</a>! You simply have to. Stop whatever you're&nbsp;doing and watch it right now. Stop resuscitating that patient, and watch Breaking Bad. Stop flying that plane, crash it into that field and fire up&nbsp;Netflix.\"</p><p>As I understand it, we are now all legally obliged to watch Breaking Bad by&nbsp;the end of 2013. Our prisons are already full to bursting with people who&nbsp;failed to watch The West Wing or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\">The Wire</a> when they were expressly told to. I even saw a woman prosecuted last week for not having read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/20/gillian-flynn-gone-girl-review\" title=\"\">Gone Girl</a>. What was she thinking?</p><p>These days we are told we simply have to watch, to read or just to do, very many things: 100 Things to Do Before You Die; 100 Films You Have to See, 100 Books You Must Read If You Don't Want Everyone at Work to Realise Exactly What a Shallow, Self-Obsessed, X Factor Fan You Really Are.</p><p>Like most Guardian readers, I am very&nbsp;keen to do what I'm told at all times. If I'm told there are 25 Must-Dive Reefs or 30 Loganberry Recipes You&nbsp;Can't Live Without then I take that&nbsp;responsibility very seriously and immediately go out shopping for scuba equipment and soft fruit.</p><p>But, while I can't stress enough that I&nbsp;don't wish to be a troublemaker, there is a slight problem with the maths.</p><p>The average human being will live for&nbsp;701,844 hours. You will be asleep for 233,600 of those hours (more if you're a&nbsp;cricket fan). You will be working for 74,060 hours (fewer if you're Usain Bolt)&nbsp;and you'll be waiting for your children to hurry up and get their shoes&nbsp;on for 11,850.</p><p>Take off another 200,000 hours for miscellaneous activities such as being on hold for broadband customer service, queuing at Costa Coffee, or looking up pictures of your ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend on Facebook.</p><p>You suddenly find yourself with just&nbsp;182,334 useful hours in your life for reading, watching films and baking your signature Loganberry Pecan Flapjacks.</p><p>But it gets worse. Given that you are reading the Guardian you are, let's be honest, at least 40. If you were under 40&nbsp;you'd be reading the cheat codes for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\">Grand Theft Auto V</a> instead (FYI, the dirt-bike code is Circle, X, L1, Circle, Circle, L1, Circle, R1, R2, L2, L1, L1). This means your available hours now stand at 91,167. That's what you have left. Just over 90,000 hours. To do everything.</p><p>So, Breaking Bad should be a breeze: just 61 hours, or 0.000667% of the rest of your life. And – I don't know if you've heard – apparently it's amazing.</p><p>But if you wanted to watch every episode of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/jan/12/guardian-50-television-dramas\" title=\"\">the Guardian's Top 50 TV series of all time</a>, that would take up another 2,080 of your precious hours. Add in two new series a year – every year – that you simply have to watch, and that's a further 4,000 hours. Then add in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off\" title=\"\">The Great British Bake Off</a> and, in&nbsp;all, that's around 6,130 hours of television you simply have to see. That's&nbsp;nearly 7% of your available life</p><p>Watching every film on the BFI's list of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/polls-surveys/greatest-films-all-time\" title=\"\">The Greatest Films of All Time</a> will take you 217 hours (with an extra half-hour if you want to watch the hilarious \"blooper reel\" at the end of Citizen Kane). You will also have to watch at least one new film a month that Charlotte at work keeps banging on about, and one foreign-language film a month because Peter Bradshaw has called it \"a&nbsp;stunning new benchmark for Latvian cinema\". That takes your total for films you simply have to see up to 2,233 hours.</p><p>And now an even bigger problem: books. Let's read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/12/features.fiction\" title=\"\">the Observer's 100 Greatest Novels</a>. Add in one new book a month that Charlotte has recommended (I like Charlotte, but I wasn't absolutely convinced by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/09/james-bowen-bob-cat-addiction-book\" title=\"\">A Street Cat Named Bob</a>) and one new book a month that the Review section has described as Margaret Atwood meets EL James. Sum&nbsp;total of hours spent on books you&nbsp;simply have to read? 6,360.</p><p>Then you also have to find time to swim with dolphins, to watch the sunset&nbsp;over Machu Picchu, to kiteboard in the Andes, and to do any number of other tiresome things you see people doing in their profile pictures on <a href=\"https://soulmates.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\">Guardian Soulmates</a>.</p><p>There are also 50 boutique hotels you must visit, 100 ways to make&nbsp;your garden or your children happy, and 5,000 fonts you can't PowerPoint without.</p><p>And these, of course, are just the things you have to do. The mandatory things. You will still have to find time for the things you actually like doing, such as popping bubble wrap.</p><p>Isn't it time to end this tyranny? In&nbsp;the 1970s we weren't told what we had to do all the time. Mainly because there were only about eight things you actually could do, so everyone simply did all of them as a matter of course. But&nbsp;there are now too many things in the world, too much stuff. None of the old stuff has gone anywhere, and new things are being added all the time. Citizen Kane still exists, but now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/147290/piranha-3dd\" title=\"\">Piranha 3DD </a>does as well.</p><p>Let's end this madness shall we? By&nbsp;all means watch Breaking Bad (I've&nbsp;heard it's good – have you heard it's&nbsp;good?), but the only bit of TV you actually <em>have</em> to see before you die is the&nbsp;episode of Superstars where Kevin Keegan falls off his bike. Use the time I&nbsp;have saved you to watch the TV you&nbsp;actually want to. I recommend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/04/pointless-alexander-armstrong-richard-osman\" title=\"\">Pointless</a>, for example.</p><p>The only films from the BFI's list that&nbsp;you must watch are Some Like It Hot, The Godfather and Singin' in the Rain. You have my permission to never watch FW Murnau's 1927 masterpiece Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hpo5gJK6Jw\" title=\"\">Kenji&nbsp;Mizoguchi's Ugetsu Monogatari</a>. Watch them if you want, but you don't have to. You also don't have to watch the Lord of&nbsp;the Rings trilogy (that's 47&nbsp;hours saved right there).</p><p>Of 100 Greatest Novels, you can happily ignore all of them except <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141187495/scoop-a-novel-about-journalists\" title=\"\">Scoop</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/dec/13/john-crace-miss-jean-brodie-digested-read\" title=\"\">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</a>. I am assuming you've already read To Kill a Mockingbird for O-level. Read Shakespeare if you want to, but you don't have to. (Though if you don't ever&nbsp;read him, you're not allowed to say&nbsp;he's rubbish. Deal?) You should probably read Great Expectations, but feel free to leave <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\" title=\"\">Dickens</a> there. And I&nbsp;think Wuthering Heights is the only&nbsp;Emily Brontë novel worth reading&nbsp;(someone will rise to this, just&nbsp;you wait and see).</p><p>You must never swim with dolphins. If they ever want to swim with you, I'm sure they'll let you know. Forget Machu Picchu; the sunset on the west coast of&nbsp;Scotland is as beautiful as any you'll see in the world, and it's really nearby. And by all means go kiteboarding above the Andes, but that might be the thing you do literally just before you die. And&nbsp;the Guardian would miss your Soulmates subscription.</p><p>In reality there are very few things you actually <em>have</em> to do before you die. They include: ring your mum more often; recycle; watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/24/book-of-mormon-review\" title=\"\">The Book of Mormon</a>.</p><p>Please feel free to leave other suggestions online. The simple things, not the showy things. The things that&nbsp;make the world a better place. I&nbsp;believe, for example, that I've already mentioned popping bubble wrap.</p><p>But before you do that, have you seen Breaking Bad? You must.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418983647|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|4f9a0f4cd299c0f86f3dfab50434f4de5df12fc4 -->",

        "body":"<p>Is it necessary to have your own baby in order to flick on the maternal switch?</p><p>I've always thought so, as mine seems to have been permanently turned off throughout my adult life. Getting married, having babies and craving domestic bliss are not milestones I have ever dreamt of. It would have been easier if I had, because I would have done something about it and not be what I am now – a woman in my 30s, with no baby and neither desperately yearning to reproduce nor vehemently against it. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/16/choice-child-free-admirable-not-selfish\" title=\"\">We're a diseased breed, women like me, viewed with suspicion because we sit on the fence</a>. It isn't normal. I repeat: it isn't normal. Is it?</p><p>Of course, I've thought about having children, but time and circumstance haven't brought them about. I thought for years that I must be missing the broody gene.</p><p>I also worried that I might not measure up if I didn't want motherhood badly enough; I might not have enough love in me if I had a child or adopted one, so I shouldn't bother just for the sake of the supposed life-affirming fulfilment that comes with it.</p><p>Now, no longer with the luxury of time on my side, I've no idea what to do. I have started coming to terms with the fact that I may never have a child, but it's not been without some lamenting. I've tried to ignore the suggestion that I'll never be a \"whole woman\" unless I find myself one day lying exhausted and bruised in a labour ward. I've told myself it wasn't meant to be, and that's OK.</p><p>But now a life-changing event I hadn't foreseen, with consequences I didn't bank on, has intervened.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/15/women-over-age-40-babies\" title=\"\">My 53-year-old mother has just had a baby boy</a> and I am ashamed to admit I spent the nine months of his development dreading his arrival. Her pregnancy was a confusing and emotionally loaded time for me. The pressure to have my own child weighed me down. If anyone was meant to be having a baby, it was me, not her. The natural order of things had been upset.</p><p>I panicked. I've never had a sibling and didn't know what to do with babies, least of all someone else's.</p><p>The fear intensified as my mother's due date inched closer, and I worried that I wouldn't connect with her child.</p><p>But as soon as I met him, my fear evaporated. It kicked in the moment I held my new half-brother, 20 minutes old, for the first time at the hospital.</p><p>As he fell asleep, curled into a ball on my chest, warm and heavy, nuzzling my neck and trusting me to hold on to him and keep him safe, I felt as if he was mine. I wanted to keep him. That moment was unlike anything I've ever felt before. It was the best feeling in the world and I never wanted it to end.</p><p>I looked at my formidable mother in awe and disbelief at what she had just done and thought, \"I love this kid. I actually love him.\"</p><p>It's a wonderful thing, being the adult sibling of a baby. I never believed I had a maternal cell in my body, but something's shifted. It may be what parents I know have tried to convey when they've said: \"It changes you.\" It could be a kind of sibling love that I've always been jealous about among my friends but have never known. Or it could, if we cast genetics aside for a moment, simply be that precious love one feels for a baby because it needs to be cared for.</p><p>Just a week old, so vulnerable and incapable of anything more than biting, sucking, crying or sleeping, he's teaching me what falling in love really is. I'm discovering it is an inescapable longing to be near him, a passionate commitment to look out for and protect him above all else.</p><p>I didn't see it coming and don't feel it leaving me any time soon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420035290|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|0ba4db01f9769e74b58a6a46b04e0a8e66e6ce8b -->",

        "headline":"Word to the west: many Saudi women oppose lifting the driving ban",
        "body":"<p>If you read any western coverage of the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/27/saudia-arabian-women-drivers-campaign-ban\">protest of Saudi Arabia's female driving ban</a>, you probably thought, \"finally, the kingdom is waking up\". But the problem is, that's not what many Saudis think, including Saudi women.</p><p>The Saudi economic newspaper El-Iqtisadiah ran a front-page news story suggesting that women's driving is just a luxury rather than a necessity and that protesters against the ban seek to undermine the kingdom's stability and create sedition.</p><p>That wasn't just propaganda. I conducted a survey of my former Saudi female students at Al-Lith College for Girls (at <a href=\"http://uqu.edu.sa/english\">Um al-Qura University</a>, Mecca). They helped me distribute a large-scale questionnaire to their colleagues from different departments of the college and to their female relatives and friends. It wasn't exactly scientific, but their responses are worth considering. I offered them anonymity in their answers, but even so, some wanted to be recognized.</p><p>To my surprise, 134 (out of 170) respondents said female driving is not a necessity and that it opens the door for sexual harassment and encourages women to not wear the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2013/sep/23/niqab-video-debate\">niqab</a> under the pretext that they cannot see the road when driving. Some also fear that it gives husbands a chance to betray and agree with the assertion that it creates sedition in society.</p><p><strong>Mashaal El-Maliki, a housewife:</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Female driving will destroy family life because it will give husbands a chance to know other women who (as drivers) will be free and without guardians. </p></blockquote><p><strong>Bedoor Elmaliki, a student:</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>In my point of view, female driving is not a necessity because in the country of the two holy mosques every woman is like a queen. There is (someone) who cares about her; and a woman needs nothing as long as there is a man who loves her and meets her needs; as for the current campaigns calling for women's driving, they are not reasonable. Female driving is a matter of fun and amusement, let us be reasonable and thank God so much for the welfare we live in.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Maqbula El-Malawi, a student:</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Honestly, I don't like women to drive. This will create sedition … I agree that there are already different kinds of sedition we see every day, but the right place for a woman is her house; this will really save her from what is happening in the outside world.</p></blockquote><p><strong>A Saudi mother:</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>If they allow women to drive, there will be many negative effects on the whole society (eg, sexual harassment). Furthermore, there will be many things that don't comply with our Islamic principles. This will open the door for women to imitate men in everything, and who knows … there would be calls for banning niqab. This way a woman will lose her femininity; and if a woman goes out without a guardian, she may lose her honor.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Banaader Elmaliki, a 4th year mathematics student:</strong> </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[The driving movement is] just a crazy imitation of America, and doesn't mean more liberation for women. It rather means liquidation of the society and inferiority of its moral values. The biggest evidence on this is the liquidation of American society; we don't want this in our kingdom.</p></blockquote><p>The results of my informal survey were almost identical to those of a questionnaire my former Saudi students conducted. They found 3,209 out of 3,710 Saudi women opposed changing the driving laws, for the same aforementioned reasons. </p><p>Even women who supported driving (about 501) stressed that their support has conditions. Crucially, they stipulated that there must be laws that deter men against sexual harassment and that allow women to drive safely in lanes of their own.</p><p>This stresses that the continuous attempts from the west to impose its values elsewhere are pointless. Western feminism is not only unlikely to take hold in countries like Saudi Arabia, it is not what many women in the kingdom want. Consider what Amany Abdulfadl, member of the Egyptian Centre for Monitoring Women's Priorities, said in a 2007 piece in <a href=\"http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/\">Al-Ahram Weekly</a>: the west's ''definition of equality cannot work in our Arab world because neither will our women find jungles to cut wood in, nor our men ever have breasts to feed babies.''</p><p>People in Saudi Arabia have their own moral views and needs. What works in other societies may not fit in Saudi, and the reverse. In short, instead of launching campaigns to change the driving laws in the kingdom, the west should first ask Saudi women if they really want this or not, and western countries should accept the result, even if it's not to their liking.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421473472|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|dcfaa0b63d2420a6980bf26ee31e99352b3155b2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Two films I watched at the London Film Festival this month jarred with me in an unexpected way. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxuxkQF7Bak\" title=\"\">Drinking Buddies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQpXyke3VC4\" title=\"\">Afternoon Delight</a> are what might be called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/may/19/culture.features\" title=\"\">mumblecore</a> movies – all improvised dialogue and plots that home in on relatively minor events in the emotional lives of their protagonists. I'll spare you my reviews, but an incidental aspect of these self-consciously naturalistic portrayals of contemporary urban life depressed me. Namely, the proliferation of gadgetry in the bedroom, by which I do not mean sex toys.</p><p>In a scene from Drinking Buddies, for example, one half of a couple sits in bed one evening, catching up with her emails on a MacBook, while her boyfriend conducts a text conversation on his smartphone, thus rudely inviting interlopers into their intimate space. Technology similarly seeps into the bedroom in Afternoon Delight, with post-coital stressy business texting rendered as quotidian as brushing your teeth.</p><p>There is nothing unusual about this set-up these days – it's just that these films held a mirror up to a facet of my life that I already didn't really approve of, and projected it on to a giant screen. My bedside table usually has a phone and an iPad lying on it, as well as paper books; sometimes there's even a laptop too, although I do try to put that out for the night with the cat, the tiny pulsating \"sleep mode\" light is just too obviously anathema to actual human sleep.</p><p>Is nowhere sacred? Must the ability to text, tweet or post images be at our fingertips while we're sleeping? The fact that our books, films and alarm clocks often live in the same devices as our various inboxes and social network apps lazily justifies our need to take them to bed with us, but I am not alone in checking my emails, or catching up with current affairs last thing before lights out. I know this is not conducive to proper, satisfying sleep but I do it anyway, and wake up with a headache.</p><p>I'm just as bad when I wake up. The first thing I do in the morning is pick up my phone to check the time. Then I compulsively unlock it to \"check the weather\". But as soon as my eyes fix on the screen, my attention scatters a thousand different ways, taking me down all sorts of rabbit holes until I finally set it back down, with a twitchy brain and still no idea whether it's going to rain because it's the one thing I forgot to check.</p><p>Another justification for taking these devices to bed is that there simply isn't enough time to keep up with the continuous tidal wave of computer-related chores and correspondences, and therefore any quiet moment is fair game for a quick holiday-planning/sock-buying/online-banking session. I wouldn't be surprised to find that, if the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying\" title=\"\">Top five regrets of the dying</a> article (which serially returns to the most-read list on this website) were to be updated in 2033, an item about never allowing yourself a break from screen-based life to daydream or properly rest, even when ill in bed, makes an appearance.</p><p>The actor, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10297448/Rachel-Weisz-and-I-ban-technology-from-our-bedroom-says-Daniel-Craig.html\" title=\"\">Daniel Craig, recently credited banning technology from the bedroom</a> as key to his keeping his marriage to Rachel Weisz a happy one. I see his point. Aside from all of this gadgetry allowing friends, colleagues and chores to gatecrash the marital bed, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12287535\" title=\"\">ill-effects of poor sleep on relationships is well documented</a>. One study, which chimed with me, demonstrating the positive effects of gratitude on overall wellbeing, found that poor sleepers were more selfish and <a href=\"http://www.spsp.org/?Gratitude_PR_19Jan13\" title=\"\">less likely to feel gratitude</a>.</p><p>Poor sleep, of course, has countless other negative effects on health, happiness and productivity. And insomnia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/sep/24/lack-sleep-onset-alzheimers\" title=\"\">may predict Alzheimer's</a>. It is not uncommon for people to tweet or update their Facebook status in the middle of the night when they have insomnia.  Aside from the brain-scrambling stimulation of the internet, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/health/05light.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">there is evidence</a> that staring at backlit screens keeps brains more alert and suppresses melatonin levels (although the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/reality-check/2012/sep/11/can-tablet-screens-disrupt-sleep\" title=\"\">jury's out on whether it scrambles melatonin production enough to disrupt sleep </a>.)</p><p>I read this fact in <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/arianna-huffington-implores-you-stop-taking-bright-devices-into-the-bedroom/277269/\" title=\"\">an article reporting that Arianna Huffington</a>, the doyenne of digital publishing herself, has banned phones and computers from her bedroom in the name of a good night's sleep. This reminded me of how I felt when I read that many senior staff at Silicon Valley behemoths including Apple, eBay and Yahoo <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/technology/at-waldorf-school-in-silicon-valley-technology-can-wait.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;\" title=\"\">send their kids to schools based on the Steiner approach</a>, that ban screens from their classrooms and frown upon their use at home: suckered.

        "body":"<p>Some problems we struggle to solve because the dilemma and solution lie outside our comprehension. Others we understand but do not confront through lack of will. Henceforth we may have to consider the hardy perennial problem of a lack of diversity in parliament as falling into the latter category. Now that the attitudes and practices that cause and exacerbate this democratic deficit have been diagnosed in unprecedented detail; it's perfectly possible to carry on complaining about the disparities, all the while neglecting to pursue the sort of change that might finally address them. But we cannot claim ignorance.</p><p>Because it emerged in a busy news week, the <a href=\"http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Electoral-Conduct-Inquiry-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">report of an all-party committee into racism and discrimination in elections</a> was overshadowed, but therein lies an ugly picture of how prejudice blocks and hinders minority candidates of all descriptions from getting into parliament. We send observers all over the world to ensure that foreign elections are cleanly fought, and yet the evidence suggests that foreign observers might have much to monitor and deprecate here. Election leaflets that tap into racism and religious intolerance and homophobia. Doorstep comments – some direct, some delivered by dog whistle. Laws passed to ensure a level playing field for all candidates – irrespective of race, sexuality, class or religion – routinely ignored. Regulatory authorities that should ensure those elections are cleanly fought, asleep at the wheel.</p><p>Elections are hotly fought affairs and that is right in a lively democratic society. But who can be proud of the incidents listed in the MPs' report; instances that occur because the atmosphere is poisoned and the risks to polluters is small? How Lee Scott, a Tory MP who is Jewish, <a href=\"http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/107849/mp-lee-scott-i-cried-over-death-threa\" title=\"\">needed police protection</a> in the 2010 election following an antisemitic death threat. How Parmjit Dhanda, a Sikh and a former minister in the last Labour government, found a severed pig's head outside his house after his defeat in the same election. Those responsible presumably thought he is Muslim.</p><p>According to the report, Dhanda also told of the insidious stuff. \"Comments on the doorstep about a disabled candidate he had represented as a party agent, to personal barbs from opposition candidates, for example: 'I bet his father wasn't at Dunkirk'. He suggested that comments such as 'outsider' or suggestions black and minority ethnic candidates are 'a bit different' can be commonplace.\"</p><p>The charity Mind raised the issue of the former Tory MP, now Labourite Andrew Pelling, whose <a href=\"http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/8097493.Tories__mental_health__slurs_/\" title=\"\">past mental health difficulties formed part</a> of a Conservative briefing when he decided to run as an independent candidate in south London. Gay rights advocates Stonewall highlighted \"a number of incidents of homophobic behaviour by candidates from many parties\". A Labour candidate labelled her opponent, who was gay, a paedophile. A Lib Dem campaign last year, where the tussle between its candidate and the Tory, who was gay, was characterised as a \"straight fight\". The anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate and anti-Muslim prejudice campaign group Tell Mama cited numerous BNP leaflets that sought to mine votes from inflammatory prejudice. Low blows, sharp practice and much worse.</p><p>And what of those, aside from the police, who should play a role in policing elections; who monitor the rules? Here the report is damning: \"We were particularly concerned that the statutory body with primary responsibility for addressing discrimination, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has neglected its responsibilities and lost some of the good practices carried out under its former guise as the Commission for Racial Equality.\" It stands accused of a \"dereliction of duty.\" In response, it says MPs are confused. And what of the Electoral Commission? It fulfills the basic function of ensuring participants know their legal and moral obligations but without innovation or enthusiasm. \"The Electoral Commission sees these matters as a 'tick box' exercise, taking a passive rather than pro-active approach,\" say MPs. In the void, dark deeds flourish.</p><p>So let's take stock. Minority candidates struggle to thrive in the major parties and struggle to win candidature nominations. And when they do get selected, they are unfairly undermined and traduced by those who corrupt the healthy cut and thrust of elections to gain sordid advantage. And then they find that those who ought to create and preserve the sanctity of fair elections either undercook the response or do nothing on the basis that someone else should intervene.</p><p>And, for all the hand wringing, the status quo remains largely untroubled in parliament. Who's surprised?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421366275|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|e6f28a7bd9403cf1b36df5ef93c3694da5fae257 -->",

        "headline":"A man's perspective on why engagement rings are a joke",
        "body":"<p>Most of us are adult enough to know magic doesn't exist. And yet we're the same species that thinks fat rings are fairy-tale items which somehow \"secure\" another person's love, one step away from a \"happily ever after\". </p><p>They're expensive, useless and, worse, are insulting to <a href=\"http://www.blogher.com/node/10685\">notions of actual love</a>. As anyone who's been in a serious long-term relationship knows, you don't need geology to proclaim (let alone justify) said love.</p><p>Before you take me for a cheapskate who just doesn't want to spend the money on a ring, let me explain a bit more. Many of us, especially men, have strapped our feet to the commercialised notions of what constitutes relationships. We've turned into zombies, hungry for all things red and supposedly lovey dovey. We buy into the baffling displays of romance like the nauseating crimson heart-shaped horror show we call Valentine's Day. Or the flowers and boxed chocolates we're supposed to deliver on anniversaries to celebrate monogamous tolerance and the disbelief you haven't murdered each other.  </p><p>We speed through our finances and morals, enjoying the exhilaration of fitting in to societal expectation, as opposed to reflecting on whether our actions are warranted or justified. And our partners seem all too ready to go along with it.</p><p>Engagement rings – specifically expensive diamond ones – are often prime examples of this unthinking mindset. The problem isn't the rings themselves, but the justifications – or the lack of justifications – behind their acquisition.</p><p>We mustn't confuse engagement rings – given, usually to a woman, when a proposal is accepted – and wedding rings – given on wedding day. (Already, we should recognise how strange it is to need two different kinds of rings.)</p><p>Whatever the long history of engagement items – I've heard claims of it dating from ancient Egypt or Rome, for example – the focus on engagement rings should really start with De Beers, in the 20th century.</p><p>After large diamond mines were discovered here in South Africa<a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1870trollope-southafrica.asp\"> around 1870</a>, the mines' major investors amalgamated their interests to form De Beers Consolidates Mines. They recognised that due to diamonds having l<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp\">ittle intrinsic value</a>, they would need to create demand via (the illusion of) scarcity and pretend worth. So began one of the most successful marketing and public manipulation campaigns of the 20th century, originating from four words: \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/fashion/weddings/how-americans-learned-to-love-diamonds.html?_r=1&amp;\">A diamond is forever</a>\".</p><p>By convincing men their love for their future wife is directly proportional to the expense of the diamond ring, and convincing women to expect love in the form of shiny stone, De Beers and their marketers, NW Ayer, began a tradition so embedded we forget it's a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/opinion/23iht-edepstein.1.20368819.html\">marketing ploy</a>. Genius marketing, to be sure, but marketing nonetheless.</p><p>And guess what? The prices keep going up, as if we are really loving more and deeper these days. According to the <a href=\"http://www.xogroupinc.com/press-releases-home/2011-press-releases/2011-08-30-2011-engagement-and-jewelry-statistics-released.aspx\">XO Group Inc 2011 Engagement Engagement &amp; Jewelry survey</a>, the average engagement ring cost $5,200. If you think that's bad, consider that nearly 12% of US couples spend more than $8,000 for an engagement ring. Of course, we should take such stats with some measure of scepticism, as <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/weddings/2013/06/average_wedding_cost_published_numbers_on_the_price_of_a_wedding_are_totally.html\">Will Oremus highlights</a>. Nonetheless, these are the prices at a time when the average American family earns<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/17/the-typical-american-family-makes-less-than-it-did-in-1989/\"> less than it did in 1989</a>.</p><p>The American bias of these stats shouldn't negate the overall point: diamonds – and therefore diamond rings – are expensive and the demand was created artificially for an item that's only property here is shininess (it decreases in value as soon as you walk out the store).</p><p>Any remotely logical person can see that spending several thousand on actually important items for a new couple like a place to live or putting money in an investment account will serve them far better in the future (and likely help with romantic and/or wedded bliss). </p><p>That engagement ring purchases tend to be for women – not by women – is also insulting to the cause of not viewing women as objects to be acquired. Consider that this is worthy of a headline in a respected US magazine at the beginning of this month: \"<a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/10/women-now-paying-for-their-own-engagement-rings.html\">Women Now Paying for Their Own Engagement Rings</a>\".  </p><p>Many people will say that engagement rings are symbolic of love and devotion. Ignoring that this idea is itself manufactured by the profiting businesses, it also gives an arbitrary definition of \"symbol\": why can't a beautiful home be a symbol? Why can't long-term investments be a symbol? Indeed, would it not be more impressive to show off a house than a finger rock?</p><p>Tradition is another assertion when discussing almost anything to do with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/20/polyamorous-shows-no-traditional-way-live\">monogamy</a> and marriage. But, like nature, tradition is a description not moral justification. Just because we've always done a particular action, doesn't mean it's always (or ever was) justified. Pointing to tradition means pointing to the mistreatment of different races and sexes, human sacrifices, and so on. Longevity, too, doesn't give moral immunity, or automatic goodness, to anything.</p><p>Engagement rings aren't even used to show one is married: they're used before the wedding even occurs. Indeed, even helping avoid awkward social encounters isn't aided, since there are other (and cheaper) ways of showing you're \"in a relationship\" (not to mention just telling people trying to hit on you). </p><p>If you need a ring to prove your love, it's not your lack of a ring that's the problem.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421475218|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|480408710fc21d5d4c85cc4393bfea7338f97b2f -->",

        "headline":"Ladies, don't go restyling your partner – it's rude",
        "body":"<p>One thing I've noticed in life is that a remarkable number of men, sometimes intelligent, accomplished men, can be extraordinarily thick about spotting women who manipulate them.</p><p>One area where this keeps happening is appearance, with some men being coerced into making bizarre decisions all in the name of \"self-improvement\". Shane Warne is a case in point. A cricketing uber-bloke, Shane was spirited away into the dark castle of Liz Hurley, to emerge resembling a Ken doll dipped in golden syrup. La Hurley beamed, while the world recoiled at Warne's newly brightened teeth, highlighted hair, Ronseal-hued skin tone, and hints of (thankfully undisclosed) \"man-scaping\".</p><p>This was Shane Warne, but it was <em>not</em> Shane Warne – his Shane Warneness, his laidback masculine appeal, had been ripped off, quite possibly on a wax strip, and dumped into a beautician's pedal bin with a disgusted moue. Not to mince words, Warne looked like a complete tit. Wow, I thought, maybe Liz Hurley truly is evil?</p><p>Away from celebrityland, it seems that ordinary women also like to \"make over\" their men, preferring to upgrade their appearance, groom them, and transform them into Mr Right, rather than compete in the psychosexual scrum for men who are already deemed Mr Right. Occasionally there are studies about these dogged female-on-male makeovers. An image springs to mind of femalekind as deranged Svengalis, taking barely civilised males, with bad haircuts and chronic dress sense, and buffing/grooming/tanning/waxing and clothes shopping them into a semblance of public acceptability. Basically, transforming Mr Write-Off into Mr Right.</p><p>Well, if true, how rude. I say \"if true', because, frankly, I've noticed far more women actively engaged in sabotaging their partners' looks than the other way around. This can be anything, from telling them they look \"wonderful!\" with their manky food-flecked beards/Village People-style moustaches they grew for Movember/haircuts so awful they verge on the inhumane (delete where appropriate), to over-styling grown men so that they look not only tragic, but also bizarrely sexless (see: what Liz did to Shane).</p><p>At the other end of the scale, there is the dark art of benign neglect, where a man can be encouraged to go to seed to the point where even his health might be adversely affected, as certainly are his straying powers. Men also do this to women – explaining the phenomenon of relationships put under immense strain when one of the couple loses weight, or makes some other bid to climb out of the saboteur's hole.</p><p>Getting back to women under-grooming or over-grooming their mate, the goal appears to be that, in their different ways, these men are \"nobbled\", rendered repulsive to the opposite sex. Which, in evolutionary terms, makes far more sense than genuinely improving a man to the point at which you could lose him.</p><p>One argument could be that, as women have been judged almost exclusively on how they look, putting up with the \"male gaze\" for centuries, where is the harm in redressing the balance, giving men a taste of their own medicine? But isn't this too pat? After all, when a man badgers a woman about her appearance, insisting that she look prettier, glossier, thinner, at its extreme, we call it what it is – rudeness verging on psychological abuse. So why, when it is the woman unduly influencing the man, do we use jokey terms such as \"making him over\", or \"taking him in hand\"?</p><p>Unless there are health or hygiene issues, surely no one&nbsp;should feel they have any right whatsoever to comment upon, criticise, mock or alter another person's appearance. It is at best rude, at worst, an exercise in control freakery. Ladies, truly we are better than this. Gentleman, brace yourself for the revelation that, whatever you've been told, neither \"Ken doll\" nor \"weirdy beardy\" are particularly good looks.</p><h2>Wear a poppy. Wear it with pride</h2><p>With Remembrance Sunday approaching, it must be time for people to clamber on to the anti-poppy bandwagon. This year, a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10409297/Remembrance-Day-minister-refuses-to-wear-poppy-because-it-advocates-war.html\" title=\"\">Methodist minister called Patricia Jackson</a> stated that she plans to wear a white poppy to officiate her remembrance service in Shropshire, because the classic red version \"advocates war\".</p><p>Are there people out there who genuinely believe that the poppy supports and celebrates war? Isn't it rather about remembering and honouring people who have fought and died, as well as raising badly needed funds for ageing or disabled service people and the bereaved they left behind? Far from being a glorification or sanitisation of war, the poppy seems to be quite the opposite – representing the human face of the suffering of war. Not one war, but many wars, meaning that politics doesn't come into it.</p><p>Most of us have noticed that war is a \"bad thing\", but the poppy is not the problem, or even the symbol of the problem. Perhaps that's why those who noisily abhor or subvert it mainly come across as attention-seeking. There appears to be this compulsion to promote and defend their stance.</p><p>All this grandstanding seems a spiritual world away from the quiet poignancy of the Remembrance Day service and the unassuming humanity of people who sell poppies from trays in the street.</p><p>Not for the first time, I can't help but think that such poppy narcissists really need to get over themselves. Publicly refusing to wear a poppy, or attempting to subvert the classic design, means nothing compared to making the decision to wear one. If people must make their stand, then obviously that's fine (ironically, this is a free country). However, perhaps they could consider getting into the remembrance spirit of doing so with quiet dignity.</p><p></p><h2>It seems he didn't pick her up, but he sure put her down</h2><p></p><p>Poor <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24770449\" title=\"\">Katy Perry</a>. She said that Mick Jagger made a move on her when she was an 18-year-old backing singer. Jagger, who rarely makes public announcements, denied it, saying that Perry must be \"mistaken\". Mistaken? With respect, Jagger has a rather distinctive look – a cross between an excitable orangutan, a tribal shrunken head, Methuselah's left testicle and a dashboard gonk. There would be no mistaking Mick Jagger under any circumstances and I say that with love.</p><p>Who to believe? When you're 18, you tend to think everyone fancies you; then again, when you're Katy Perry, it's probable that everyone does. Perry also reveals that she managed to avoid Jagger's amorous advances because she \"sacrificed\" her friend to go home with him instead. Yeah, you heard right: she \"sacrificed\" her friend. Call me easily shocked, but I think some introductory feminist literature might be a nice present for Katy this Christmas.</p><p>In the meantime, how embarrassing for Perry that Jagger was so determined to deny publicly an attraction to her. Going by his Lothario past (possible motto: \"Don't be too choosy!\"), this has to rank among the most devastating of rock-pop slap-downs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421518403|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|a83f617b8e096edcf1b9d7e37023e4c68c509c69 -->",

        "headline":"This is a fleshy, naked emergency – pop stars are too sexy for our kids",
        "body":"<p>The parenting website Netmums has <a href=\"http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/general-coffeehouse-chat-514/news-current-affairs-topical-discussion-12/1017213-why-can-t-we-stop-parents-launch-backlash-against-porn-not-pop-videos.html#post10095001\" title=\"\">polled its members</a> and found that more than 80% of respondents have seen their children <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24836571\" title=\"\">sing or repeat sexual lyrics without realising their meaning</a>. A third also said their child had copied the overtly provocative dance moves they had seen pop stars perform. As someone who appreciates the comedic moment in which a child swears unknowingly in front of an assembled audience of elders as unparalleled in its hilarity, I'm tempted to welcome this result. A younger cousin of mine once asked my dad, in front of everyone, if he \"liked it hard and rough or smooth and tender\", something he must have got from the media, and I still have to take deep breaths when I think about it a decade later. But I realise that for most people, the results of what the Daily Mail calls a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2489640/More-80-parents-caught-young-children-repeating-offensive-lyrics-copying-porn-style-dance-moves-exposed-explicit-pop-music.html\" title=\"\">\"disturbing survey\"</a> means we are now living at the end of times.</p><p>That's not to say that pop stars haven't become too sexy. They have. They're so sexy, in fact, that Britney Spears has been reported as <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/britney-spears-i-am-too-sexualised-by-the-music-industry-8858611.html\" title=\"\">longing for the days</a> when, rather than having to troupe around in thigh-high boots, a metallic bikini and fishnets, she could keep it real like she did in that video for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4\" title=\"\">Baby One More Time</a>, which was \"about the dance\" and nothing at all to do with indulging the older male generation's filthiest schoolgirl fantasies. But at least Britney kept her clothes on. Nowadays you don't exist unless you're maniacally twerking while dry-humping yourself with a foam hand left over from the last time they tried to revive Gladiators. Quick! Get them some of those metallic blankets that they give you when the swimming pool has to be evacuated. Or at least a cardigan. This is a fleshy, naked emergency.</p><p>While the sexualisation of female pop stars is an ongoing saga which will, much like the women who <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2483760/Photos-NAKED-women-Arizona-university-Halloween-parties-viral-Twitter.html\" title=\"\">dressed up on Halloween as a naked person</a>, reach its logical zenith any day now, we must take account of the fact that all this scaremongering wholly buys into the \"devil's music\" narrative of pop being damaging to young people, and, in that sense, this generation is no different to those previous. While my disco-dancing ditty of choice, Destiny's Child's Bootylicious, may be tame by today's standards (and if the thought of a 12-year-old belting out \"I don't think you're ready for this jelly\" fills you with horror, take comfort in the fact that I thought they were referencing an intolerance to the E-numbers in Rowntree's), back then the big worry was nu-metal and goth music, a genre which disturbed my school so much that they sent a letter home to school asking that parents not allow their children to wear hooded tops bearing slogans such as \"deviant\" and \"Cradle of Filth\". I'd like to see Miley Cyrus take on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortiis\" title=\"\">Mortiis</a>, I really would.</p><p>In other words, music has always been held to be a corrupting influence on young people and a threat to the establishment, and it's important that we bear that in mind when we're questioning whether it has now gone too far, as 87% of Netmum parents polled believe it has. And let's not forget, it's not just the girls, either. A quarter of parents said that boys thought women wanted men to be \"into violence and gangsta culture\" – presumably they are just as impressionable as young girls, and are thus taking it upon themselves to rub up against those \"bitches and hos\" in the playground <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/oct/25/robin-thicke-most-dreadful-interview-2013-blurred-lines\" title=\"\">à la Robin Thicke</a>. They certainly seem to be expecting women to have the kind of bodies that rarely exist in real life.</p><p>The solution to the problem is simple: don't let them watch music videos. I didn't know these oiled-up sex robots and their pimping boyfriends even existed until that joyous two-year period when my mum got Sky. And if you must let them watch music videos, while I fully accept they have become much, much worse and are practically porn now, perhaps use it as a chance to discuss what's happening with them in a non-judgmental way? Siobhan Freegard, a founder of Netmums, said in reference to the survey: \"It's toxic to tell young kids that casual sex and violence are something to aspire to,\" and she's not wrong about the violence. But the fact she places it hand in hand with casual sex in terms of toxicity reveals more about our society than Miley and Robin's frottage ever could.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421892461|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|a4b64fa7aa4a75468880b564c1989951da1b6f75 -->",

        "body":"<p>This is an article about angry white men and their galloping sense of aggrieved entitlement. It is at least partly inspired by feminist theory and analysis of structural racial supremacy. Before I've finished my third sentence, I've probably already contributed to a minor epidemic of hypertension among a certain section of Comment is free readers. I can anticipate the comments, the hit-blogs and the hate-mail already: by even mentioning white men, I am the real racist. I am the real sexist. Why doesn't the Guardian take a pop at the angry brown men over here or the angry black women over there instead?</p><p>In my defence, the provocation is not entirely mine. A new book is published this week under the blunt title Angry White Men. Its author, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/24/fathers-share-parenthood-children\" title=\"\">Michael Kimmel</a>, is not unaccustomed to stirring up strong responses. As a liberal sociology professor and perhaps the world's most prominent male feminist, he has dedicated a career to poking the hornets' nest of traditional masculinity. He once wrote that the penis should carry a sticker saying: \"Warning: operating this instrument can be dangerous to yours and others' health.\"</p><p>His latest work strokes a broad, acerbic brush over the white supremacists of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason%E2%80%93Dixon_line\" title=\"\">Mason-Dixon line</a>, the NRA and Tea Party stalwarts of the Bible Belt, the men's rights activists of cyberspace and the high school spree shooters of parental nightmares. The common feature, he argues, is their shared belief that certain degrees of status, privilege and social advantage, perceived to be their natural or god-given rights, have been snatched away by sudden social change. The resulting anger is targeted not at a globalised neoliberal economic system that has declared ordinary people expendable – irrespective of their race, class or gender – but immigration, civil rights and feminism. In a sense Kimmel is describing the irrational emotional fallout of the economic gender revolution detailed in books like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/sep/09/gender.uk2\" title=\"\">Stiffed</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/03/end-of-men-hanna-rosin-review\" title=\"\">The End of Men</a>.</p><p>The thesis can only really be made to work by means of tortuous logic which excludes all expressions of violence and anger from non-whites, non-males or those, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"\">Anders Breivik</a>, who were forged in a very different cultural furnace. Kimmel also glosses over alternative explanations, most notably in his case studies of high school spree shooters, which quite clearly point to aggressive bullying and emotional abuse as the principal cause of the switch being flipped to overload.</p><p>Nonetheless there is more than a jingling ring of truth to his argument. When one looks at the horrific abuse meted out to feminist campaigners such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/caroline-criado-perez\" title=\"\">Caroline Criado-Perez</a> for having the temerity to ask that a woman should feature on British banknotes, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/laura-bates\" title=\"\">Laura Bates</a> for fighting back against street harassment and everyday sexism, or to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/jun/14/women-sexism-games-sarkeesian-tyler\" title=\"\">Anita Sarkeesian</a> for highlighting sexist tropes in video games, it is hard to see it as anything but aggrieved entitlement. The hate campaigns seem firmly rooted in outrage that uppity girls should be intruding upon men's inalienable right to behave how they like, harass who they want, control culture as they wish and shape society in their own image. Like: \"You'll prise Lara Croft's skimpy shorts from my cold, dead hands.\"</p><p>It is easy, and indeed essential, to condemn such misogynistic hate campaigns. However if those attitudes are at least partially stoked by very real and profound economic and social changes that have left some men feeling disempowered, marginalised, maligned and neglected, is it enough to simply demand that they suck it up and deal with it? I'm not sure.</p><p>Our newly egalitarian culture has belatedly accepted (in theory if not always practice) that men do not have a monopoly on power and authority, whether financial, political or physical. The man is no longer the master of his household, but an equal partner in a domestic project.</p><p>The gender script for women has been largely torn up – a young girl has unprecedented freedom to grow into a doctor or a nurse, a soldier or a solicitor and/or a wife and mother while men, to a large extent, are stuck with a script for a role that barely exists. To be a real man, our culture still insists, is to be the protector and provider within a society that no longer guarantees to deliver that opportunity, and where male protector-providers are not entirely necessary. It is not much of a stretch to assume that this causes immense stress and psychological conflict, which is sometimes directed inward in despair and depression, sometimes outward in anger and violence.</p><p>Yes, men need to change and adapt to a rapidly shifting world. So too does the culture in which those angry white men are forged.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421930617|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|cb8364801f58cf3b66288e507e0f23453d7c24e3 -->",

        "headline":"Why I hate being a black man",
        "body":"<p>Every time I sit on a crowded street car, bus, or subway train in Toronto, I know I will have an empty seat next to me. It's like a broken record. Sometimes I don't mind having the extra space, but other times I feel awkward, uncomfortable, and annoyed.</p><p>I know I have good hygiene, I dress appropriately, and I mind my own business. However, recently, I finally became cognizant of why people might fear being around me or in close proximity to me: I am a black male. Although Canadian society presents the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/06/canada-multiculturalism-europe\">façade of multiculturalism</a> the truth is Canada has a serious problem with the issue of race.</p><p>I didn't realize it until my sister said to me: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Orville, people are afraid of you. You are a six foot tall black man with broad shoulders.</p></blockquote><p>My sister is right, people don't sit next to me on the street car, the subway or on the bus because they are afraid.</p><p>The issue of black self-hatred is something I am supposed to pretend does not exist. However, the great French psychiatrist Frantz Fanon wrote about this issue in his ground breaking book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Black-White-Masks-Frantz-Fanon/dp/0802143008\">Black Skin White Masks</a> in a chapter called \"the Lived Experience of the Black Man\". According to Fanon, the black man is viewed in the third person, and he isn't seen as a three-dimensional human being. The black man internalizes the perspectives of white society and its negative thoughts about blackness affect his psyche. In the chapter, Fanon discusses a white child calling him the \"N word\" and how he becomes cognizant of how he is different and viewed as someone people should fear.</p><p>There is also a fear by some black people that discussing the issue of self-hatred is a sign of weakness. There is a discourse that black people engender: that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/22/black-beauty-racism-satoshi-kanazawa\">black is beautiful</a>. But the truth is, the image of blackness is ugly – at least it's perceived that way. There is nothing special or wonderful about being a black male – it is a life of misery and shame. </p><p>The issue of black self-hatred is usually depicted from a female point of view. There are documentaries such as <a href=\"http://www.racialicious.com/2011/05/31/dark-girls-a-review-of-a-preview-culturelicious/\">Dark Girls</a> which aired on Oprah's OWN network earlier this year, in which black women discuss their feelings of self hatred for having dark skin. There are numerous books, articles, documentaries, and essays published by black female writers describing black self-hated. Black women are not afraid to speak out about their self-loathing, yet for some reason, black men are silent about our own contempt for what we are.</p><p>A lot of black men don't want to acknowledge the feelings of disgust we have for ourselves. It is considered emasculating to even admit the existence of such thoughts. I think my own self-hated manifests from the exterior, from the outside world. It is born out of the despair and the unhappiness I see within a lot of young black men.</p><p>I can honestly say I hate being a black male. Although black people like to wax poetic about loving their label I hate \"being black\". I just don't fit into a neat category of the stereotypical views people have of black men. In <a href=\"http://www.theurbanpolitico.com/2011/08/black-images-whats-good.html\">popular culture</a> black men are recognized in three areas: sports, crime, and entertainment. I hate rap music, I hate most sports, and I like listening to rock music such as PJ Harvey, Morrissey, and Tracy Chapman. I have nothing in common with the archetypes about the black male.</p><p>There is so much negativity and criminal suspicion associated with being a black male in Toronto. Yet, I don't have a criminal record, and I certainly don't associate with criminals. In fact, I abhor violence, and I resent being compared to young black males (or young people of any race) who are lazy, not disciplined, or delinquent. Usually, when black male youth are discussed in Toronto, it is about something going wrong.</p><p>Honestly, who would want to be black? Who would want people to be terrified of you and not want to sit next to you on public transportation?</p><p>Who would want to have this dark skin, broad nose, large thick lips, and wake up in the morning being despised by the rest of the world?</p><p>A lot of the time I feel like my skin color is like my personal prison, something that I have no control over, for I am judged just because of the way I look.</p><p>Not discussing the issue doesn't mean it is going to go away. In fact, by ignoring the issue, it simply lurks underneath the surface. I believe a dialogue about self hatred should be brought to the fore in the public sphere, so that some sort of healing and the development of true non-label based pride can occur.</p><p>Of course, I do not want to have these feelings, to have these dark thoughts about being a black man. However, I cannot deny that this is the way I feel. I don't want to be ashamed of being a black man; I just want to be treated as an individual based on the content of my character, and not just based on the colour of my skin.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421953516|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|f4a9cec2a6f71fb8f685b789c317618d38a453c4 -->",
