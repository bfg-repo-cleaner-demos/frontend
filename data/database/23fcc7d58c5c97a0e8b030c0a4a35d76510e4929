        "body":"<p>In the past year, pupils were absent from 5.3% of all school sessions. That is a significant rise since 2011/12 and has put an end to four consecutive years of decline in absenteeism.</p><p>There are two school sessions each day, in the morning and in the afternoon, at the start of which the register is taken. There are around 310 sessions in each school year.</p><p>The figures released today by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/249832/SFR39-2013.pdf\">Department for Education</a> show that the trend is consistent in both primary and secondary schools.<br /><strong></strong></p><p>A significant proportion of pupils (6.5%) in secondary schools are classed as persistent absentees, having missed around 15% of all classes. In total, 310,580 primary and secondary school pupils were persistent absentees. On average, persistent absentees missed one in four of their classes.</p><p>In 2011, the government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/persistent-absence-government-changes-definition-to-deal-with-reality-of-pupil-absenteeism-in-schools\">changed its definition</a> of this \"to deal with the reality of pupil absenteeism in schools\" and reduced the threshold of this classification from 20% to 15%.</p><p><strong>Reasons for absence</strong><br />In 63% of absences, the reason cited was illness, while medical and dental appointments were given as the explanation for a further 6% of pupil absences. The third most likely reason given was \"family holiday\", which was the reason for 8% of absences from primary school and 3% of absences from secondary school.</p><p>A significant number of absences were unauthorised: 21% of those from secondary school and 15% from primary school. The Department for Education defines these as \"absence without permission from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences [and] arriving late for school, after the register has closed.\" Illness, for example, is generally counted as an \"authorised\" absence.</p><p><strong>Pupil characteristics</strong><br />The new data may challenge some assumptions about which pupils tend to be missing from the classroom. Boys and girls have almost identical rates of absenteeism, and younger pupils in primary school tend to take more authorised days away from school than older primary school pupils - although older pupils are much more likely to take unauthorised absences.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Those with special educational needs have only a slightly higher overall absence rate (7.5%) than the average across primary and secondary schools (5.3%). Poverty appears to be a more powerful determinant of absenteeism – pupils who are eligible for free school meals are three times more likely to take an unauthorised absence from school than those who are not eligible.</p><p>Pupils from ethnic minorities have lower absentee rates than the average 5.3% (Chinese 3.1% absenteeism, black 3.8%, Asian 5%), while white pupils' absences were slightly higher than average at 5.4%. Exceptionally high rates were found among travellers of Irish heritage and Gypsy Roma (20.7% and 14.9% respectively) although the Department for Education cautions any over-reliance on interpreting these figures \"due to potential under-reporting for these ethnic classifications\".</p><p>Pupils whose first language isn't English are more likely to be absent in primary school, but less likely to be absent from secondary school (where they miss 4.9% of sessions compared to 6% for pupils whose first language is English).</p><p><strong>Regional trends</strong><br />Average absenteeism also masks some regional trends. At 4.9%, inner and outer London have the lowest pupil absence rates in the country while the north east of England tops the list with 5.6% of pupil absence. At a local authority level, the City of London has the lowest rate with 3.5%, while 6.4% of school sessions on the Isle of Wight were missed by pupils from either primary or secondary school in autumn 2012 or spring 2013.</p><h2>Up, but after an all-time low</h2><p>The Department for Education explained the figures on overall and persistent absence in 2011-12 were affected by extremely low levels of flu-like illness in schools along with the religious festival Eid falling out of term time. That means that this year's rise might be a smaller increase than it first appears. </p><p>For a full breakdown of all the trends see the link below. </p><h2><strong>Get the numbers and get involved</strong></h2><p>• Download <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At6CC4x_yBnMdGxQcktiUHFia2NiYmNSaFNUS3h0R1E&amp;usp=sharing\">the full spreadsheet</a><br />• Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@theguardian.com</a><br />• Follow us <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">on Twitter</a></p><p><em>Mona Chalabi is teaching a Masterclass, Mastering spreadsheets: how to work with data, at the Guardian's London offices on 26-27 October. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/mastering-speadsheets-how-to-work-with-data-mona-chalabi-digital-course?INTCMP=edi_231034\">Learn more and book</a></em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420000479|2013-10-16T10:54:18Z|d64d5c4778385e3910a4401cf5c5b25009c2a121 -->",
