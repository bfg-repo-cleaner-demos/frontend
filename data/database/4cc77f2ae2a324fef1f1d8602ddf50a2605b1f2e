        "headline":"Swallowed by coal: UK profits from Indonesia's destructive mining industry",
        "body":"<p>Just 30 years ago, Samarinda was a sleepy village surrounded by deep equatorial forest and known mostly for its traditionally woven sarongs. Today it is the largest city in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province, with nearly 1 million inhabitants. It is also the centre of the burgeoning coal industry, surrounded by more than 1,000 mines and concessions.</p><p></p><p>The forests have gone, opencast mines circle the city and giant barges pass down the river Mahakam every few minutes taking coal to India, Japan, Korea and beyond. Nearly 70% of the city has been handed to coal companies as concessions. In theory, Samarinda could be swallowed by coal.</p><p></p><p>The city and most of East Kalimantan is unrecognisable to those who left some three decades ago, but now, say Indonesian and British campaigners, coal mining is poised to rip through central Kalimantan, or Borneo, a few hundred miles west of Samarinda. Mining companies such as BHP Billiton are moving in with money raised in London to exploit some of the world's largest deposits in what is being called coal's last frontier. So far, 449 exploration concessions have been awarded, covering 15,313 square miles (39,662 sq km) – about 25% of the area of the whole densely forested province famed for its tribespeople, remoteness and wildlife.</p><p></p><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.wdm.org.uk/climate-change/uk-banks-financing-coal-boom-destroying-borneo-rainforests\" title=\"\">World Development Movement</a> and its partner in Indonesia, the East Kalimantan Mining Advocacy Network, mining and the infrastructure needed to extract and export coal from the heart of Borneo will inevitably ruin vast, heavily forested areas at great cost to people living there and the environment.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the millions of tonnes of carbon that will be emitted from the burning of the coal, massive railway projects are planned, and giant pits and waste dumps will be needed to support the industry. This will lead to pollution of rivers and land-grabbing during the digging of vast open-cast pits each covering several square miles,  as people flock there in search for jobs.</p><p></p><p>The pace of the mining is speeding up in central Kalimantan. More than 8.5m tonnes of coal were dug last year compared with less than 1m tonnes in 2005; and by 2020 companies could be extracting more than 20m tonnes a year. Indo Met, the largest concession in central Kalimantan, owned by BHP Billiton, covers 350,000 hectares and is thought to have coal reserves of more than 774m tonnes.</p><p></p><p>Where mining has started, people complain of air pollution, flooding, and land grabs. \"We receive all the negatives of coal but very little of the benefits. We will receive the full impact of the waste when they start dumping. The forest will be gone and we will lose our rubber trees,\" Erly Aisha, a Dayak leader from Maruwei village, told WDM.</p><p></p><p>Waste from <a href=\"http://www.borneo.co.id\" title=\"\">Borneo Lumbung</a>'s mine has seeped into the local rivers, say other villagers. \"The water is dark and dirty and makes your skin itch. We don't drink it now. The new mine is not operating but the company already has our land. We feel afraid,\" said Yesmaidfa, a mother in Maruwei.</p><p></p><p>According to WDM, the UK financial sector is involved in more than 50 major coal mines worked by 12 large companies in East and others in central Kalimantan.</p><p></p><p>BHP Billiton, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, has recieved millions of pounds of investment from Barclays. Because it is part of the FTSE 100, almost every pension holder in the UK has money invested in it. Borneo Lumbung, which controls the Asmin Koalindo Tuhup mine in central Kalimantan, received a loan of $1bn (£0.6bn) from the UK bank Standard Chartered in 2012. Most of the money, says WDM, was used to buy shares in <a href=\"http://www.bumi-plc.com\" title=\"\">Bumi</a>, the troubled London-listed firm co-founded by financier Nat Rothschild that owns large stakes in some of the biggest mining projects in East Kalimantan.</p><p></p><p>BHP Billiton, which has a 75% share in the giant IndoMet coal project, is estimated by WDM to have used about £110m of money raised in London. Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://www.indonesia-investments.com/doing-business/indonesian-companies/adaro-energy/item191\" title=\"\">Adaro Energy</a>, Indonesia's second-largest producer of thermal coal, received £245m from a coalition of UK banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered.</p><p></p><p>\"With the financial sector shrouded in secrecy, it will be very hard to do anything more than estimate the true extent of involvement that UK financial and investment institutions have in fossil fuel projects in places such as Indonesia,\" said Alex Scrivener, author of the WDM report. \"The sector and its institutions must be held to account for their bankrolling of climate change and environmental destruction.\"</p><p></p><p>Andrew Hickman, from the Indonesian mining watchdog <a href=\"http://www.downtoearth-indonesia.org/story/new-report-and-films-uk-kalimantan-coal-connections\" title=\"\">Down to Earth,</a> said: \"The energy we consume in Britain is dirty, but the profit that UK companies make from Indonesia's coal is dirtier. Local communities facing health problems, pollution and human rights abuses in Indonesia know that this coal is deadly too. BHP Billiton's Borneo coal concessions will be a disaster for local people, the environment and our climate.\"</p><p></p><p>A spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.bhpbilliton.com/home/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">BHP Billiton</a> in London said: \"The IndoMet coal project is a joint venture between BHP Billiton and Adaro. The first stage of development is a small operation called Haju and we are continuing to evaluate the potential for larger scale developments in the region. Any development in central and East Kalimantan will be subject to detailed environmental and social impact assessments, feasibility studies and will require all appropriate permits to be in place before activities commence.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421137997|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|a09b4531ba7706d8fe80ab2b6521526cecd686c7 -->",

        "body":"<p>The art and science industries in Indonesia have combined forces to help educate Indonesia on issues at the heart of social development with the <a href=\"http://www.natural-fiber.com/\" title=\"\">House of Natural Fibers Foundation</a>.</p><p>Honf, based in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta\" title=\"\">Yogyakarta</a>, Java, Indonesia, works as a vessel to bring artists and scientists together to solve some of Indonesia's biggest technology development challenges in sectors such as health and the environment.</p><p>&quot;Indonesia is hindered by inadequate infrastructure and improper use of technology. We want to use art and science to educate people to use technology in better ways,&quot; said Irene Agrivine who along with Vincensius Christiawan and Tommy Surya established the Honf Foundation in 1999 following the fall of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto\" title=\"\">Suharto</a>'s authoritarian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(Indonesia)\" title=\"\">New Order</a> regime, and as the freedom of information and technology era began.</p><p>Honf created the Education Focus Program, a curriculum whose objective is to fill the gaps in technology development through its partnerships with technology institutions in Indonesia such as <a href=\"http://www.ugm.ac.id/en/\" title=\"\">Gadjah Mada University</a>'s microbiology laboratory, Duta Wacana University's informatics laboratory, Institute Sains and Technology, and high school technology groups such as the robotic community of SMPN 5 school.</p><p>Agrivine said that because creativity was central to innovation and problem solving, it includes an artistic element in each of its projects. The EFP also invites all sectors of society to join heads to beat technology challenges at its Open-Community Forums.</p><p>Honf's latest collaboration produced the Micronation | Macronation project, an art installation accompanied by seminars, which present innovative sustainable agriculture practices to the public to combat climate change. The exhibition opened in Honf's laboratory in Yogyakarta in April this year.</p><p>The installation constitutes a model farm that includes a fermentation-distillation machine to process hay from crop fields into <a href=\"http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/fuels/ethanol.html\" title=\"\">ethanol</a> as an alternative energy source to fossil fuel. It has also deployed a system to convert waste products from fields into livestock and fish feed, and advocates collecting manure and urine from cattle farms for fertiliser.</p><p>&quot;The problem with food and energy sustainability is in creativity. We have to be creative in order to discover renewable energy options,&quot; said Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals Association chairman Ilham Habibie of Honf's Micronation piece.</p><p>The model has since caught the interest of farmers in Yogyakarta province, and a few farms have already begun rolling out Honf's proposed techniques.</p><p>Honf also conceptualised bamboo leg prostheses for those who lost limbs after an earthquake hit Yogyakarta in 2006. The group chose bamboo for its strength and affordability, with 33 percent of the country's population living in poverty. <a href=\"http://fablab.waag.org/\" title=\"\">FabLab Amsterdam</a> – fab labs or fabrication laboratories being a type of laboratory that uses digital fabrication or 3D modeling software to create – then developed Honf's idea.</p><p>The project has grown to become an international collaboration between Honf and <a href=\"http://www.fablab.no/\" title=\"\">FabLab</a> Amsterdam based in the Netherlands, with cultural research, innovation and technology center Waag Society, also in the Netherlands, and the Christian foundation for public health, Yakkum Rehabilitation Centre, in Indonesia.</p><p>Together they are researching how developing countries such as Indonesia can become self-sufficient in prostheses and aims to manufacture the bamboo form for a cost price of less than US$50. Next year, Agrivine said, it aims for the model to be available to the public around the world.</p><p>Honf is also contributing to health through a performance-based tutorial on alcohol-awareness as part of its Intelligent Bacteria series called Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which won the <a href=\"http://www.scriptcolor.net/film-festivals/transmedia-international-media-art-festival-6/\" title=\"\">international media art transmediale</a> award – an award recognising technological contributions to society – in Berlin in 2011. The tutorial shows how alcohol can be made in safe ways by fermenting tropical fruits in an entertaining form through using sound artists to make music from the fermentation process.</p><p>The Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, who worked in collaboration with Honf on the tutorial, says the presence of methanol in alcohol is likely caused by non-hygienic practice, such as failing to properly sanitise equipment, in the fermentation process, which causes methanol-producing bacteria. If methanol is consumed within a certain amount of time it can cause vision disorders, blindness or death.</p><p>&quot;Society needs to learn more about correct alcohol processing technology so homemade alcohol can be safe for consumption,&quot; Agrivine said.</p><p>Homemade alcohol has been responsible for a number of deaths in Indonesia, with methanol reported as the lethal ingredient – the Indonesian Police Forensic Laboratory confirmed traces of methanol in the three people who died soon after consuming homemade liquor in Central Java in 2010. Alcohol-related deaths in the country spiked after the government slapped a high excise duty on alcohol, increasing the price of liquor.</p><p>Honf also created an art-based tutorial to address Indonesia's <a href=\"http://www.wepa-db.net/policies/state/indonesia/indonesia.htm\" title=\"\">severely polluted water</a> supply. The installation, titled IB:EC [Intelligent Bacteria: <em>Eschericia coli</em>], The song of the river, and which was recently on display at the New Museum in New York, the US, in March this year, consists of an ecological experiment to provide alternative ways to purify their water.</p><p>The piece is made up of four microscopes connected to projectors that magnify bacterial microorganisms in water samples collected from the river. The water is then purified through a homemade filter with the aim for the people to make this system for themselves.</p><p>Indonesian private collector Natasha Sidharta, who has been working with Honf for a number of years, applauds the group's dedication.</p><p>&quot;From conducting workshops for children in the surrounding community to providing seminars, [it is] a responsible community group that has an important mission – to share knowledge,&quot; Sidharta said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/390838130|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|3bb9efe25e76668c8d45fa18ff4b7b28c5fee86b -->",

        "headline":"How art and science are combining to solve Indonesia's problems",
        "body":"<p>Art and science are joining forces in Indonesia to help educate on issues at the heart of social development through the work of an imaginative foundation called the <a href=\"http://www.natural-fiber.com/\" title=\"\">House of Natural Fibre (Honf)</a>.</p><p>Based in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta\" title=\"\">Yogyakarta</a>, on the island of Java, Honf works as a forum to bring artists and scientists together to solve some of Indonesia's biggest technology development challenges in sectors such as health and the environment.</p><p>&quot;Indonesia is hindered by inadequate infrastructure and improper use of technology. We want to use art and science to educate people to use technology in better ways,&quot; said Irene Agrivine, who, along with Vincentius Christiawan and Tommy Surya, established Honf in 1999.</p><p>Honf created the Education Focus Programme, a curriculum with the objective of filling the gaps in technology development through partnerships. Some of those partnerships include Indonesian education behemoth <a href=\"http://www.ugm.ac.id/en/\" title=\"\">Gadjah Mada University</a>'s microbiology laboratory, and private Catholic university <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duta_Wacana_Christian_University\" title=\"\">Duta Wacana's</a> informatics laboratory.</p><p>Agrivine said that because creativity was central to innovation and problem-solving, Honf includes an artistic element in each of its projects. The education programme also invites all sectors of society to join heads to beat technology challenges at its open-community forums.</p><p>Honf's latest collaboration produced the <a href=\"http://lg-mg230.appspot.com/natural-fiber.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=284:micronationmacronation-2012-the-project&amp;catid=63:latest-projects&amp;Itemid=65\" title=\"\">Micronation/Macronation</a> project, an art installation accompanied by seminars presenting innovative sustainable agriculture practices to the public with the goal of combating climate change. The exhibition opened in Honf's laboratory in Yogyakarta in April this year.</p><p>The installation constitutes a model farm that includes a fermentation-distillation machine to process hay from crop fields into <a href=\"http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/fuels/ethanol.html\" title=\"\">ethanol</a> as an alternative energy source to fossil fuel. It has also deployed a system to convert waste products from fields into livestock and fish feed, and advocates collecting manure and urine from cattle farms for fertiliser.</p><p>&quot;The problem with food and energy sustainability is in creativity. We have to be creative in order to discover renewable energy options,&quot; said Ilham Habibie, former chairman of the Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals Association, commenting on Honf's Micronation/Macronation piece.</p><p>The model has since caught the interest of farmers in Yogyakarta province, and a few farms have already begun rolling out Honf's proposed techniques.</p><p>Honf also conceptualised bamboo leg prostheses for those who lost limbs after an earthquake hit Yogyakarta in 2006. The group chose bamboo for its strength and affordability, bearing in mind that around a third of Indonesia's population lives in poverty. <a href=\"http://fablab.waag.org/\" title=\"\">FabLab Amsterdam</a> (fab labs, or fabrication laboratories, being centres that use digital fabrication or 3D modelling software to create things) then developed the idea.</p><p>The project has grown to become an international collaboration between Honf and <a href=\"http://www.fablab.no/\" title=\"\">FabLab</a> Amsterdam based in the Netherlands, with cultural research, innovation and technology centre Waag Society, also in the Netherlands, and the Yakkum Rehabilitation Centre, a Christian foundation for public health in Indonesia.</p><p>Together they are researching how developing countries such as Indonesia can become self-sufficient in prostheses and aim to manufacture the bamboo forms for a price of less than $50. Next year, Agrivine said, Honf hopes the model will be available to the public around the world.</p><p>Honf is also contributing to health through a performance-based tutorial on alcohol-awareness as part of its Intelligent Bacteria series called Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, which won the <a href=\"http://www.transmediale.de/intelligent-bacteria-saccharomyces-cerevisiae\" title=\"\">Transmediale award</a>, recognising technological contributions to society, in Berlin in 2011. The project is a collaborative art and biotechnology work, observing Indonesia's traditional local distilling cultures, while distributing knowledge of alcohol fermentation methods to teach people to produce alcoholic drinks using tropical fruit in an affordable and safe way.</p><p>Homemade alcohol has been responsible for a number of deaths in Indonesia, as it commonly contains methanol. The Indonesian Police Forensic Laboratory confirmed traces of methanol in three people who died soon after consuming homemade liquor in central Java in 2010. Alcohol-related deaths in the country have spiked after the government slapped a high excise duty on alcohol, increasing the price of liquor.</p><p>Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, which worked in collaboration with Honf on the tutorial, said the presence of methanol in home-brewed Indonesian alcohol is commonly caused by non-hygienic practice, such as the failure to sanitise equipment properly, in the fermentation process. If consumed, methanol can cause vision disorders, blindness or death.</p><p>&quot;Society needs to learn more about correct alcohol processing technology so homemade alcohol can be safe for consumption,&quot; Agrivine said.</p><p>Honf also created an art-based tutorial to address Indonesia's <a href=\"http://www.wepa-db.net/policies/state/indonesia/indonesia.htm\" title=\"\">severely polluted water</a> supply. The installation, titled <a href=\"http://www.newmuseum.org/events/633\" title=\"\">IB:EC [Intelligent Bacteria: <em>Eschericia coli, </em>The song of the river]</a>, and which was recently on display at the New Museum in New York, consists of an ecological experiment to provide alternative ways to purify water.</p><p>The piece is made up of four microscopes connected to projectors that magnify bacterial microorganisms in water samples collected from a river. The water is then purified through a homemade filter, with the objective being to teach people how to make this system for themselves.</p><p>Indonesian private collector Natasha Sidharta, who has been working with Honf for a number of years, applauds the group's dedication.</p><p>&quot;From conducting workshops for children in the surrounding community to providing seminars, [it is] a responsible community group that has an important mission – to share knowledge,&quot; Sidharta said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/390893775|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|8bcb34b12e71dd265a8c8e9ce2810e0c39893ac8 -->",

        "headline":"Swallowed by coal: UK profits from Indonesia's destructive mining industry",
        "body":"<p>Just 30 years ago, Samarinda was a sleepy village surrounded by deep equatorial forest and known mostly for its traditionally woven sarongs. Today it is the largest city in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province, with nearly 1 million inhabitants. It is also the centre of the burgeoning coal industry, surrounded by more than 1,000 mines and concessions.</p><p></p><p>The forests have gone, opencast mines circle the city and giant barges pass down the river Mahakam every few minutes taking coal to India, Japan, Korea and beyond. Nearly 70% of the city has been handed to coal companies as concessions. In theory, Samarinda could be swallowed by coal.</p><p></p><p>The city and most of East Kalimantan is unrecognisable to those who left some three decades ago, but now, say Indonesian and British campaigners, coal mining is poised to rip through central Kalimantan, or Borneo, a few hundred miles west of Samarinda. Mining companies such as BHP Billiton are moving in with money raised in London to exploit some of the world's largest deposits in what is being called coal's last frontier. So far, 449 exploration concessions have been awarded, covering 15,313 square miles (39,662 sq km) – about 25% of the area of the whole densely forested province famed for its tribespeople, remoteness and wildlife.</p><p></p><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.wdm.org.uk/climate-change/uk-banks-financing-coal-boom-destroying-borneo-rainforests\" title=\"\">World Development Movement</a> and its partner in Indonesia, the East Kalimantan Mining Advocacy Network, mining and the infrastructure needed to extract and export coal from the heart of Borneo will inevitably ruin vast, heavily forested areas at great cost to people living there and the environment.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the millions of tonnes of carbon that will be emitted from the burning of the coal, massive railway projects are planned, and giant pits and waste dumps will be needed to support the industry. This will lead to pollution of rivers and land-grabbing during the digging of vast open-cast pits each covering several square miles,  as people flock there in search for jobs.</p><p></p><p>The pace of the mining is speeding up in central Kalimantan. More than 8.5m tonnes of coal were dug last year compared with less than 1m tonnes in 2005; and by 2020 companies could be extracting more than 20m tonnes a year. Indo Met, the largest concession in central Kalimantan, owned by BHP Billiton, covers 350,000 hectares and is thought to have coal reserves of more than 774m tonnes.</p><p></p><p>Where mining has started, people complain of air pollution, flooding, and land grabs. \"We receive all the negatives of coal but very little of the benefits. We will receive the full impact of the waste when they start dumping. The forest will be gone and we will lose our rubber trees,\" Erly Aisha, a Dayak leader from Maruwei village, told WDM.</p><p></p><p>Waste from <a href=\"http://www.borneo.co.id\" title=\"\">Borneo Lumbung</a>'s mine has seeped into the local rivers, say other villagers. \"The water is dark and dirty and makes your skin itch. We don't drink it now. The new mine is not operating but the company already has our land. We feel afraid,\" said Yesmaidfa, a mother in Maruwei.</p><p></p><p>According to WDM, the UK financial sector is involved in more than 50 major coal mines worked by 12 large companies in East and others in central Kalimantan.</p><p></p><p>BHP Billiton, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, has recieved millions of pounds of investment from Barclays. Because it is part of the FTSE 100, almost every pension holder in the UK has money invested in it. Borneo Lumbung, which controls the Asmin Koalindo Tuhup mine in central Kalimantan, received a loan of $1bn (£0.6bn) from the UK bank Standard Chartered in 2012. Most of the money, says WDM, was used to buy shares in <a href=\"http://www.bumi-plc.com\" title=\"\">Bumi</a>, the troubled London-listed firm co-founded by financier Nat Rothschild that owns large stakes in some of the biggest mining projects in East Kalimantan.</p><p></p><p>BHP Billiton, which has a 75% share in the giant IndoMet coal project, is estimated by WDM to have used about £110m of money raised in London. Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://www.indonesia-investments.com/doing-business/indonesian-companies/adaro-energy/item191\" title=\"\">Adaro Energy</a>, Indonesia's second-largest producer of thermal coal, received £245m from a coalition of UK banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered.</p><p></p><p>\"With the financial sector shrouded in secrecy, it will be very hard to do anything more than estimate the true extent of involvement that UK financial and investment institutions have in fossil fuel projects in places such as Indonesia,\" said Alex Scrivener, author of the WDM report. \"The sector and its institutions must be held to account for their bankrolling of climate change and environmental destruction.\"</p><p></p><p>Andrew Hickman, from the Indonesian mining watchdog <a href=\"http://www.downtoearth-indonesia.org/story/new-report-and-films-uk-kalimantan-coal-connections\" title=\"\">Down to Earth,</a> said: \"The energy we consume in Britain is dirty, but the profit that UK companies make from Indonesia's coal is dirtier. Local communities facing health problems, pollution and human rights abuses in Indonesia know that this coal is deadly too. BHP Billiton's Borneo coal concessions will be a disaster for local people, the environment and our climate.\"</p><p></p><p>A spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.bhpbilliton.com/home/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">BHP Billiton</a> in London said: \"The IndoMet coal project is a joint venture between BHP Billiton and Adaro. The first stage of development is a small operation called Haju and we are continuing to evaluate the potential for larger scale developments in the region. Any development in central and East Kalimantan will be subject to detailed environmental and social impact assessments, feasibility studies and will require all appropriate permits to be in place before activities commence.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421137997|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|a09b4531ba7706d8fe80ab2b6521526cecd686c7 -->",
