Matt Duchene and Jan Hejda also scored and Gabriel Landeskog added two assists for the Avalanche. Under first-year coach Patrick Roy, they have won 10 of their 11 games.</p><p>\"That was the first time we came from behind in the third period,\" Stastny said. \"We got chances and we didn't stop. We just kept going.\"</p><p>Blake Wheeler and Bryan Little had a goal and assist each for the Jets. The Avalanche trailed 2-1 entering the third but came out strong at the start of the period. They put nine quick shots on goalie Al Montoya before Hejda equalized with 12:47 left off an assist by Stastny. Stastny netted the winner with 5:28 left to give Colorado its fourth straight victory.</p><p>\"When [Alex Tanguay] brings two guys to him, you know something good is going to happen,\" Stastny said. \"I was just going back door and trying to yell as loud as I can to Landy because he was looking to shoot. He changed his mind at the last second and just gave me a tap-in. He passed it between two sticks. That's something we practice.\"</p><p>The <strong>Los Angeles Kings</strong> and the <strong>Tampa Bay Lightning</strong> had shootout wins on Sunday, while the <strong>Anaheim Ducks</strong> ended the <strong>Columbus Blue Jackets</strong>' three-game winning streak with a 4-3 result at Columbus and the <strong>San Jose Sharks</strong> beat the <strong>Ottawa Senators</strong> 5-2.</p><p>At Los Angeles, Anze Kopitar scored the deciding goal in a shootout as the Kings beat the <strong>Edmonton Oilers</strong> for a seventh victory in nine games. The Kings outshot the Oilers 48-18 in regulation and overtime. Nail Yakupov scored for Edmonton on a power play in the second period and Mike Richards tied it less than 14 minutes later. The Kings are 5-0 in games that have gone past regulation. Jonathan Quick improved to 4-0 in shootouts, having stopped 10 of 11 shots he's faced in tiebreakers. In 2010-11, he led the NHL with 10 shootout wins and had an .818 save percentage.</p><p>Corey Perry scored the clincher for the Ducks with 2:25 remaining, wristing a shot over sprawled goalie Sergei Bobrovsky. The Ducks lost Saku Koivu late in the second period on a hit that resulted in the ejection of Columbus' Brandon Dubinsky.</p><p>The Sharks were outshot for the first time this season but Alex Stalock stopped 38 shots in his first NHL start, helping San Jose to yet another win. The 26-year-old Stalock made 16 saves in the first period and helped the Sharks jump out to a 3-1 lead.</p><p>At Sunrise, Florida, Steven Stamkos and Valtteri Filppula both scored in the shootout to give Tampa Bay a 4-3 win over the <strong>Florida Panthers</strong>. Stamkos made some nice moves and slipped the puck past Jacob Markstrom for the deciding goal.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421122392|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|cf8338e4884e07689af636149380e112ec4feaaa -->",

        "body":"<p>The <strong>Philadelphia Flyers</strong> had six days to stew over having the NHL's worst record, with just two points and one win through eight games. Coming off their longest layoff of the season, it might have been the Flyers' fresh legs that allowed them to finally finish off the slumping <strong>New York Rangers</strong> in the third period.</p><p>Braydon Coburn broke a deadlock early in the final frame, and Steve Mason made the lead stand up in a 2-1 win on Thursday night. Matt Read scored a short-handed goal and added an assist, and Mason made 30 saves for Philadelphia (2-7), which ended a four-game losing streak. The Flyers are still off to their worst start through nine games.</p><p>\"This is a big win against a big rival of ours,\" Mason said. \"Getting the two points here and hopefully being able to build off that is something we need to do and start getting ourselves out of this hole.\"</p><p>In place of injured regular Henrik Lundqvist, New York's Cam Talbot was solid in his NHL debut and made 25 saves. Despite the rookie's strong effort, the Rangers (2-6) lost for the fifth time in six games. New York has one game left on its season-starting, nine-game road trip before its home opener on Monday.</p><p>The <strong>Washington Capitals</strong> beat the <strong>Edmonton Oilers</strong> 4-1 with Alex Ovechkin scoring his NHL-leading 10th goal and adding an assist for Washington. Joel Ward, Jason Chimera and Nicklas Backstrom also scored for the Capitals, who have won four of five. Ovechkin netted his 10th goal in 10 games with 1:47 left in the first period. A faceoff deep in Oilers territory came back to the Washington captain, who put a quick wrist shot up high past goalie Devan Dubnyk.</p><p>At Newark, the Mike Santorelli scored the only goal in the shootout to help the <strong>Vancouver Canucks</strong> edge the <strong>New Jersey Devils</strong> as the Canucks beat the Devils 3-2. David Krejci tipped in a shot with 0.8 seconds left in the third period as Boston beat San Jose 2-1, handing the Sharks their first regulation loss of the season. Jarome Iginla scored his first goal with the Bruins (7-2), and Tuukka Rask made 38 saves.</p><p>The <strong>Tampa Bay Lightning</strong> had a 6-5 win over the <strong>Chicago Blackhawks</strong> in overtime, with Martin St Louis scoring the winner at Tampa, and the <strong>Minnesota Wild</strong> beat the <strong>Carolina Hurricanes</strong> 3-1 with Nino Niederreiter and Zach Parise scoring for Minnesota with the first two shots of the season against Carolina fill-in goalie Justin Peters.

Ryan Garbutt, Brenden Dillon and Shawn Horcoff scored during the final 10 minutes of the first period for Dallas. Jack Campbell made 41 saves in his NHL debut.</p><p>Anaheim goalie Frederik Andersen also made his NHL debut, replacing Jonas Hiller at the start of the second with a 3-1 deficit.

Curtis McElhinney, making his first appearance for the Blue Jackets in place of Vezina Trophy winner Sergei Bobrovsky, had 37 saves.</p><p>At Winnipeg, Carter Hutton made 37 saves for his first NHL win to lead Nashville past the home team. Eric Nystrom, Patric Hornqvist and Matt Cullen scored for Nashville. The 27-year-old Hutton was given his second career start when Predators coach Barry Trotz chose to rest Pekka Rinne after the team's victory Saturday night in Montreal. The Predators had only seven shots in the second period, but made three of them count as they took control of the game.

        "headline":"NHL: 10 things to watch out for in the 2013-14 season",
        "body":"<h2>The divisions</h2><p>Let's start with the most obvious change. At a glance, the 2013-14 NHL looks a bit different now. The league has now been divided into four big divisions – two in each conference. They break down like this: </p><p><strong>The West</strong></p><p><strong>The Pacific Division:</strong> Anaheim Ducks; LA Kings; San Jose Sharks; Vancouver Canucks, Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers; Phoenix Coyotes</p><p><strong>Central Division:</strong> Minnesota Wild; Colorado Avalanche; Dallas Stars; Chicago Blackhawks; Nashville Predators; St Louis Blues; Winnipeg Jets</p><p><strong>The East</strong></p><p><strong>Atlantic Division:</strong> Toronto Maple Leafs; Ottawa Senators; Montreal Canadiens; Boston Bruins; Buffalo Sabres; Detroit Red Wings; Florida Panthers; Tampa Bay Lightning</p><p><strong>Metropolitan Division:</strong> New York Islanders; New York Rangers; New Jersey Devils, Washington Capitals; Philadelphia Flyers; Pittsburgh Penguins, Carolina Hurricanes; Columbus Blue Jackets</p><p>What can we expect from each of these? Apart from my own expectation for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100142/\">post-graduate existentialism in the Metropolitan division</a>, the big takeaway is that the league is encouraging rivalries – either by rekindling old ones (Detroit-Toronto, for example) or arranging things for some new ones to form (perhaps most markedly in the Central division). It also means that every team will make a stop at every other at least once this year, thus marking the end of the tradition held since 1997 that meant fans in, say, Ontario, would rarely see a team like Calgary come visit (just to pick a random, non-personal example).</p><h2>The playoffs</h2><p>The changes to the conferences and divisons also means the road to the playoffs is new, too. <a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=660138&amp;navid=nhl:topheads\">Here's how it was explained at NHL.com – as concise as I've seen it put</a>.</p><p>As everyone noticed immediately after the league announced the changes to the divisions, the Eastern teams each have eight teams, while those in the west each only have seven. That means inter-divisional and inter-conference schedules will break down differently, depending on if a team is in the east or west. NHL.com has a more detailed explanation of exactly how many games each team will play against the others in their division and conference, but put simply, what it means is that teams in the east will each play one more game against their own division and three more games within their own conference than those in the west will. But it also means the eastern teams will play four fewer games against western teams than western teams play eastern ones (confusing, I know). </p><h2>The hits</h2><p>Ah, the hits. The pre-season is always a difficult thing on which to draw too many huge conclusions on the year to come – particularly when players are looking to make a mark in some (perhaps violent) way – but even before the official start to the 2013-14 campaign, borderline hits are a prominent storyline. </p><p>Like <a href=\"http://youtu.be/N4F9ns4JXl4\">this one</a>, for instance. No call for the hit, but Coyotes/Twitter forward <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/coyotes-paul-bissonnette-suspended-10-games-1.1856115\">Paul Bissonnette was given a game misconduct for jumping the boards afterward as he quite literally leapt to his teammate's defence</a>. With that came an automatic 10-game suspension, which he has now appealed. Coincidentally, if the ban holds, Bissonnette would return to the ice against the Kings. Anyway, Klesla was carried off the ice in a stretcher (but conscious).</p><p>Down in Florida a few days later, it was a similar story. In his first game, Tampa Bay's Adam Erne clipped Vladimir Sobotka of the St Louis Blues in the head as he skated up-ice. Here's the Shanaview on that one:</p><p><em></em><br />The same day, <a href=\"http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/embed?playlist=445664\">Detroit's Teemu Pulkkinen managed a fairly flagrant boarding on Chicago's Mike Kostka, flattening him against the end boards</a>. The refs handed Pulkkinen a five-minute major and a game misconduct. The NHL decided to go a bit further later on, tacking on another four games to his suspension.</p><p>Extrapolating anything about how the 2013-14 season from these pre-season instances would probably be rather careless, but nevertheless, we're not off to a great start. Speaking of which ...</p><h2>The fights</h2><p>Oh guys. Already with all the fighting. Here's how bad things are: We're not even at the first game of the season and <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/no-nhl-preseason-fighting-trending-topics-144903216--nhl.html\">someone is already writing a think piece with reference to the moral struggles in Blood Meridian in order to explain how bad things are</a>. And that was before the Maple Leafs and Sabres beat each other silly for … seemingly no reason at all. We'll get to that in a moment.</p><p>The usual excuse you hear after a pre-season fight is that the players involved were only looking to bolster their standing/importance within the team and get the attention of the coaching and management staff. That was certainly the excuse dredged up when the Flames and Senators met in mid-September, there were four fights, one of which featured MATT STAJAN, who had this to say afterward: \"Obviously everybody is trying to make a name for themselves and trying to get a job in the best league in the world,\" which is logical, though also amounts to fairly damning praise of the NHL as a whole. But <a href=\"http://sports.nationalpost.com/2013/09/17/calgary-flames-vs-ottawa-senators-pre-season-game-features-four-fights-as-players-try-to-make-a-name-for-themselves/\">as Stajan reportedly explained it</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>That's hockey.</p></blockquote><p>Most fans accept that explanation. In fact, in a weird way, when you put it like Stajan did, fighting in the pre-season makes way more sense than it does during the regular season. It's arguably more appropriate to punch another person in the face when there's potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars, a permanent job, health insurance, and a bit of fame on the line.</p><p>And perhaps that's what was going on in Toronto, but one suspects it was not, certainly because at least three of the men involved in the brouhaha when the teams met the last week of September have signed long-term deals and, conceivably, if we accept Stajan's logic, have less immediate things to fight about. <a href=\"http://youtu.be/frrFsXdhKZ8\">Here's what happened</a>, in case you missed it:</p><p><em></em></p><p>Yep, that's Phil Kessel slashing away at John Scott and then making with the punchy-punchy. And yes, that's David Clarkson jumping the boards to join the fray for some inexplicably dumb reason. And yeah, that's Jonathan Bernier getting into it with Ryan Miller. Kessel is a $5.5m man, an unrestricted free agent next year, and the man Leafs fans are forever hopeful will be that superstar they've been waiting for. Bernier is worth $2.9m a year on paper, but arguably a lot more than that to the Leafs in non-dollar terms. And Clarkson? He just signed for $5.25m a year through, theoretically, 2020. The Leafs will now tack on another $75,000 to his price tag to make up for the hole he will leave during the 10 regular season games for which he's now been suspended. And for what? So John Scott could prove his worth to the Sabres? Consider it done.</p><p>And this is the pre-season. Get it together, everyone. </p><p>Or don't, and we'll simply have to come up with new ways to have this same conversation for the next eight months.</p><h2>The fashion</h2><p>So far, we know of at least eight teams in the NHL that plan on featuring either a completely new uniform or at least a new third jersey this year, because a year in hockey wouldn't be complete without it. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/pass-fail-detroit-red-wings-toronto-maple-leafs-152354340--nhl.html\">The Maple Leafs and Red Wings will, of course, get their Winter Classic uniforms</a>, both respectable. <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/2013/8/20/4640202/san-jose-sharks-new-jersey\">The San Jose Sharks are removing a black stripe from their uniforms</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=672909\">the Carolina Hurricanes are making a few tweaks</a>, too. And both the Florida Panthers and Anaheim Ducks are planning to showcase throwback jerseys this year, as they've both been in the league for 20 years (!). The Flames are also apparently going to unveil a new third jersey, which hasn't been seen yet, but presumably can't possibly be any worse than <a href=\"http://pics.classicauctions.net/classicauctions/auctions/62/597/source_597_77874.jpg\">their last one</a>. </p><p>If the Flames don't completely mess things up, all of the above options will be, while mostly unnecessary, at least not a complete insult to the fans. People will no doubt still want to wear all the new jerseys we've just talked about. Well done, everyone in the above paragraph.</p><p>Which brings us to Dallas and Buffalo. The Sabres, no strangers to new uniforms (by my count, they will have now introduced eight different uniforms since 1996) are only changing their third jersey this time around. But it's completely hideous. Steve Ott \"scooped\" the team this summer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/otterN9NE/statuses/375290351465951232\">releasing a shot of the new jersey on Twitter</a>. Here it is:</p><p><em></em></p><p>My favourite part of it is that he tagged it #MiseryIsOver. No no, my friend. It has just begun.</p><p>The piece de resistance this year, though, has to go to the Dallas Stars, who are now going to dress in a shade of emerald that would leave them well camouflaged on a golf green, and sporting a stylized \"D\" that's been smashed awkwardly into the more classic five-pointed star. That the logo now sort of looks like someone shot a bullet through the old one may or may not be intentional, but either way it's a disaster. But perhaps that's no serious surprise. Stars VP of production and entertainment, <a href=\"http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=672977&amp;navid=DL|DAL|home\">Jason Walsh explained the logo this way</a>: \"This is who we are. It's a D and a star. We're the Dallas Stars, in Big D.\" Keep in mind, this was the explanation of the finished product, and not the first, totally base, sentence on which to build a concept. Might explain a lot.</p><h2>The new rules</h2><p>It should be mentioned that everyone's jersey – new or otherwise – cannot be partially obscured from now on. Thanks to a new rule for this season, players are no longer allowed to have their jerseys tucked in. The rule stipulates that all protective equipment must be worn underneath the uniform. Call it the Alexander Ovechkin rule. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capitals-insider/wp/2013/09/15/alex-ovechkin-on-nhls-jersey-tuck-rule-we-individuals-its-stupid/\">He, for the record, calls it \"stupid\".</a> Alex Semin probably feels the same way by now: <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/alex-semin-becomes-first-victim-nhl-no-tuck-153835896--nhl.html\">He was the first to be called on the infraction this pre-season, receiving a delay-of-game penalty</a>.</p><p>This is one of those rules that seems to likely make no serious difference to the game itself on the face of things, but seems destined to be the new puck-over-the-glass call that will, at least a handful of times, really screw everything up for someone in an important game. Which is what makes the decision to introduce it strike me as slightly odd. What's the real cost-benefit here? Strange.</p><p>It's not the only change, though. Goalies are being asked to make a change to their equipment, too, in that it will now have to be smaller. <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9538380/how-fix-nhl\">Over at Grantland, the often brilliant Sean McIndoe (Down Goes Brown) figures</a> we ought to make the nets bigger, not just to accommodate for the goalie padding, but for the goalies. You might have noticed they're also getting bigger lately.</p><p>But that's the simple stuff. Depending on how things go in the pre-season, the league may decide to introduce the hybrid icing system in an attempt to curb injuries at the end boards, like the one <a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=682082\">Joni Pitkanen suffered last year</a>, and that will now keep him on the sidelines for this entire year. If you don't remember, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/rycZkVG0Tf4\">here it is</a>. When you read this, that decision may have been made (we'll update you in the comments), but midway through the pre-season, it seemed there were still mixed feelings on the system, which<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports-content/hockey/opinion/2013/09/brophy-jury-still-out-on-hybrid-icing-in-nhl.html\"> allows the ref to whistle dead any play where the defender going back for the puck is clearly going to get to it first</a>. </p><p>One more you'll notice: Players are now to be assessed a two-minute penalty if they take their helmet off before a fight. Their own helmet, mind you. Apparently there's nothing against them taking each other's helmet off, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/CONJgZjVOh8\">as Krys Barch and Brett Gallant found out earlier this month</a>:</p><p><em></em></p><p>Normally, I'd think I'd be against a stunt like this, but I enjoy something about its fraternal cheekiness. </p><h2>Fresh starts</h2><p>Keep your eyes on November 30, when the New York Rangers meet the Vancouver Canucks for the first time since the two teams swapped coaches. It'll be the first time John Tortorella is back at Madison Square Garden since he departed for BC to take over from Alain Vigneault, who went the opposite direction only a short time before. </p><p>Over <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/sports/hockey/with-stepan-signed-rangers-prepare-to-face-tortorella.html?ref=hockey&amp;_r=0\">at the New York Times, Lucas Akroyd previewed the matchup</a>, and everyone seems very congenial and blasé about the whole situation, interesting though they recognize it to be. It's all behind them, everyone's moved on, right? Doubtful. This is where we thank the schedulers for allowing us all to see every team play each other again: it allows for some transcontinental rivalries to brew between all the divisional ones. Canucks fans already hate the Bruins. What's another Metropolitan enemy?</p><p>Meanwhile in Calgary, we await to see whether the Brian Burke Show is just a repeat or if he has some new material – and what does it mean either way? Burke is like the NHL's Ricky Gervais. When he sticks to what he's good at, usually things turn out more or less all right in the end. But as soon as he deviates from that, you can almost be assured it will all go to hell before too long. Can <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/sports/hockey/with-stepan-signed-rangers-prepare-to-face-tortorella.html?ref=hockey&amp;_r=0\">he operate in Jay Feaster's shadow as the president of hockey operations</a>, or will the Flames quickly become a Burke Team? At this point, the latter is likely the preferable option in Calgary, but all Burke really has to do is <a href=\"http://blogs.thescore.com/nhl/2013/03/01/jay-feaster-very-nearly-made-an-epic-gaffe-with-ryan-oreilly-offer-sheet/\">prevent another Feaster-ian near-apocalypse</a>, and he'll be worth whatever else comes.</p><h2>The outdoor games</h2><p>There are like, a million of them (read: five). And one is in California. I don't even know what this is anymore. </p><p>The main event really will be between the Leafs and Red Wings at Michigan Stadium. All the others appear in its shadow, more as pure marketing of nostalgia, rather than actually reconnecting fans to a point in their personal past. Perhaps the Pittsburgh Penguins-Chicago Blackhawks matchup at Soldier Field might come close. In any case, I look forward to both of those – particularly the first – and that sense that yes, despite it all, this is a lovely sport with great fans and there might be some kind of tradition here onto which we can all graft some collective experience and memory. </p><p>The rest, though? It begins to feel like overkill.</p><p>The New York Rangers will play two outdoor games, both at Yankee Stadium – one against the Devils and the other against the New York/Brooklyn Islanders. And the Vancouver Canucks will face off against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place in … March, which ought to prove to be very warm and wet. Speaking of which: Southern California. The LA Kings will meet the Anaheim Ducks at Dodger Stadium March 1, when the average daytime high in that part of the world is around 70F (21.2C) and the average low is still 50F (10C). I mean, this is a joke, right? How is that even going to work? </p><p>I feel the same way about most of these games as I do of Captain Crunch. A little bit is really fun and great. But beyond one or two bites, and you start to realize what you're consuming is not real food, it's just an increasingly dull tasting pile of glossy nothingness in kind of a cool package. And, though you like the traditional morning meal as a concept, it makes you think that perhaps this thing you love hides a fractured underbelly of unbridled, unholy consumerism and high-fructose corn syrup that will eventually kill both you and the idea of breakfast itself. </p><p>One, maybe two outdoor games is enough, I think. </p><h2>The Olympics</h2><p>First thing's first: the politics. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/24/nhl-lgbt-gay-rights-russia-sochi-olympics\">My position on the NHL and NHLPA's involvement in the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics hasn't changed since this summer</a>. In essence, I think the league and players' association should have refused to go, due to its twinned, formal support of the You Can Play initiative earlier this year.</p><p>The counter argument arguments made by Patrick Burke against a boycott of any kind are compelling and valid, and I suggest you check them out if you haven't already. As for me, at the risk of repeating myself too much, I still think that when it comes to hockey specifically, a principled stand is only a principled stand when you actually take a principled stand, and not when you make major allowances. But we'll leave that for now.</p><p>As for the hockey itself, the show on the ice promises to be as good as ever. A quick scan of the potential lineups for <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/canadian_hockey/feature/?id=1131\">Canada</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/52916-Team-USA-releases-preliminary-camp-roster-for-2014-Olympics.html\">USA</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=428183\">Russia</a>, for instance, shows the competition ought to be pretty stiff (on paper, anyway). Those three teams appear at the moment to be the most likely to have something to prove. Canada will hope to repeat its gold, the US will want redemption from their silver, and Russia will be desperate to improve on a limp performance in Vancouver in front of a home crowd. </p><p>In keeping with another theme this year, the Team Canada and Team USA jerseys could be a problem, with the initial (leaked) looks <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/jonathan-toews-not-impressed-team-canada-jerseys-puck-144333268--nhl.html\">failing to bring much excitement, even to the players</a>. And the Americans had better hope their official Olympic photographer is better than the one who snapped them in their new on-ice duds this summer. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/10-most-spectacularly-awkward-u-olympic-glamour-shots-190110715.html\">The gallery, collected over at Puck Daddy</a>, is spectacular. Particularly Phil Kessel, who appears to be channeling his inner angry five-year-old. </p><h2>The rise of the KHL?</h2><p>Then there's the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), now with one more Ilya Kovalchuk than the NHL. Kovalchuk is probably the biggest name to move on to Russia recently, but he didn't leave for nothing. He turned his back on his $77m contract in New Jersey, but it's speculated he might not lose much out of the move. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/ilya-kovalchuk-join-ska-could-earn-20-million-210237775.html\">When the deal was first reported</a>, the thinking was that he would stand to earn in the range of $15-$20m in Russia – and at only a 13% tax rate. </p><p>That's not to suggest there are a thousand of those contracts sitting around, waiting for any old NHL-er to grab at their convenience. The NHL remains the premiere league in the world – <a href=\"http://www.edmontonjournal.com/sports/Belov+passes+riches+shot/8940791/story.html\">there are a lot more Anton Belovs out there</a>, looking to come this way, than there are Kovalchuks looking to go the other. Still, with the focus this winter on the Olympics, the KHL has an opportunity to showcase itself as a more serious competitor to the NHL. It's not as if the concept is strange, thanks to last year's lockout. <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/alex-ovechkin-nhl-lockout-khl/\">Remember Ovechkin's 'threat' to stay in Russia</a> should the league force too drastic a decrease in his salary? You can bet the KHL does. Who will be the next Kovalchuk?</p><p>By the way, for a more formidable read on the KHL and its potential future, I'd recommend <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/nhl/news/20130906/khl-threat-ovechkin/#all\">this Sports Illustrated piece</a>.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/schedulebyseason.htm\">NHL 2013-2014 schedule</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418685332|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|09981951d05978fe6b5ab78f2a136b1dbf04cb5a -->",

        "headline":"Bruins and Blackhawks dominate opening games of conference finals",
        "body":"<p>The Boston Bruins and the Chicago Blackhawks have taken 2-0 series leads over the Pittsburgh Penguins and the LA Kings in the NHL conference finals.</p><h2>What is going on with the Penguins? (Or: Boston starts scoring)</h2><p>Two things have happened so far in the Eastern final: Boston has managed to both knock the Penguins off their game physically, and have also found that scoring touch they've been looking for all postseason. </p><p>This exchange early on in Game One, as both teams headed to their respective dressing rooms for the first intermission has proven to be a fairly prescient one. Even though Egveny Malkin came out on top in the fight (ok, it was against Patrice Bergeron, I know), and even though Sidney Crosby didn't back down from the argument with Zdeno Chara, it showcased the Penguins' frustrations.</p><p><em></em></p><p>And then came Game Two, where both those elements were magnified. The Bruins pushed Penguins' goalie Tomas Vokoun back onto the bench, grabbing three unanswered goals in the first 17 minutes of the first period with only 12 shots. And though Brandon Sutter got one back for the Penguins moments after Marc-Andre Fleury returned between the pipes, the Bruins grabbed the momentum back and scored one more before the period was through.</p><p>They never looked back.</p><p>So now the Pens have to head into Boston down 2-0 in the conference final after being trounced 6-1 Monday night at home. With that fight at centre ice Saturday night, it looked as though perhaps this would be an echo of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/apr/18/penguins-flyers-hossa-torres-nhl-fights\">the Penguins-Flyers 2012 first-round series</a>. The difference so far is that in last year's contest, at least Pittsburgh looked energized and – crucially – engaged. Now, the Bruins are living inside every single brain on that Penguin bench, poking around and dancing a victory jig, sapping their mental strength.</p><p>Most importantly, though, isn't so much that the Bruins are scoring, but who's been doing it. Tuesday night offers a snapshot of what's happened on the Boston side. Here's how the scoring went: Marchand, Horton, Krejci, Marchand, Bergeron, Boychuk. In other words, most of those are exactly the kind of guys Boston was looking to really step up through the first two rounds. If you're Pittsburgh, sitting on goose eggs from guys like Crosby, Malkin and Iginla, that's not going to help the mental game.</p><h2>Jonathan Quick is not a pre-cog</h2><p>Well, it turns out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/30/blackhawks-kings-penguins-bruins-nhl-conference-finals\">Jonathan Quick isn't a pre-cog after all</a>. He's just a regular human who makes mistakes. While Game One of the Western Conference final against the Chicago Blackhawks went generally well for the Kings goalie (he posted a .944 save percentage on the night and only allowed two goals), Sunday evening was a different story. Not only did the Blackhawks manage to score more than three goals on Quick (something nobody else managed in 34 previous consecutive playoff games – Chicago grabbed 4 on the night), they chased him off the ice altogether, as the Kings were forced to replace him with Jonathan Bernier halfway through the second period. The loss put the Kings down two games to none against the Blackhawks as they head back to L.A. for Game Three.</p><p>But how did this happen?</p><p>Part of it, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/statuses/209119902005592064\">as the ESPN Stats &amp; Info account noted Sunday</a> not long after the start of Game Two, is that Quick has a fairly glaring issue. According to the network, fully half of the goals against Quick to that point had been scored on the low stick side.</p><p>Here's Michal Handzus' goal that made it 5-0 in Game 2:</p><p><em></em></p><p>Yep, there it is.</p><p>Two things to note, however, before we start thinking Quick's magic is fully depleted: First, was that series against the San Jose Sharks. Not only was Quick able to stop (by my calculation) 166 shots over that seven-game hard-fought series, but he was outstanding while doing it. Then, he and the Kings had to play back-to-back games against a tough Blackhawks team that likes to crowd the net. </p><p>It seems it was for those reasons that Kings coach Darryl Sutter pulled Quick. At least, that's how he (down)played it when asked after the game. Adam Hoge, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/AdamHoge/statuses/34138856596140032\">reporter for CBS Chicago tweeted Sunday</a> that Sutter said: &quot;We play 5 games in the next 10 days,&quot; when asked about pulling Quick. That's assuming a lot of the rest of this series, but the point stands. Quick is tired. Perhaps it's best to just get him out of there, and have more faith to put him in for Game Three back home where the Kings have gone 7-0 in these playoffs, reenergized and rested.</p><h2>Matt Cooke is still Matt Cooke-ish, everyone</h2><p>Remember <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/michael_farber/03/09/matt-cooke-2.0/index.html\">when Matt Cooke was all 'reformed</a>'? It might be time to re-think that narrative – or at least add a new chapter titled &quot;The Relapse&quot;. Here's his hit-from-behind on Bruins' Adam McQuaid in Game One of the Eastern final:</p><p><em></em></p><p>Cool (read: Not cool). McQuaid came back into the game, and the league decided not to suspend Cooke for the hit, so I suppose the jury's not really out anymore on whether this deserved further discipline, and yet it really seems as though we're starting to see that pattern returning to Cooke's game. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/sports/hockey/with-latest-hit-penguins-matt-cooke-further-injures-his-image.html?_r=0\">Jeff Klein at the New York Times offers a quick recap</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;He was suspended four times between 2008 and 2011 for illegal hits. One hit for which he was not suspended, because it was not illegal at the time, was a blindside check to the head of Bruins forward Marc Savard in March 2010, leaving Savard with a concussion. Savard has not fully recovered and has not played in two years.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>I wonder what's spurred this. If it weren't for the Karlsson incident, it might be arguable that with the Penguins bringing in some fresh firepower and playmaking ability at the trade deadline, Cooke's now seeing less potential to be able to fill either of those roles, and so has simply taken a step back to his old habits in order to still make an impact on the ice. But who knows? Maybe it all started a bit earlier than that.</p><p>But let's quibble with something more tangible: Was the league's decision on this Cooke hit the right one?</p><h2>Corey Crawford: fighter?</h2><p>As <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/magazine/\">Sportsnet magazine</a> points out in its latest issue, Canada ought to be keeping a close eye on Chicago goalie, Corey Crawford: &quot;As the second round of the playoffs began, [Joel Quenneville]'s Blackhawks were the only one of the eight remaining clubs employing a Canadian goaltender as their starter.&quot; Serious stuff for the Canadian program. Now that Crawford and the rest of the Blackhawks have rebounded against the Red Wings and are sitting on a 2-0 lead against the Kings, probably the questions about how Crawford might perform in an intense, high-level tournament have been quietened somewhat. Perhaps now we have to ask ourselves instead whether he should join the wrestling team for 2016, too (quickly – before it's cancelled!).</p><p>Here's why:</p><p><em></em></p><p>In that clip you'll also notice that Crawford and Bernier briefly consider going at it. Bernier would have probably wanted nothing more – a way to further energize his team a bit before going back home. Crawford obviously wasn't having any of it. Smart move. </p><p>So, some questions: Was Crawford justified in protecting his captain? Or should he have just left it alone? What's the protocol for a goalie in that situation?</p><h2>Sing a song of hockey</h2><p>Um...</p><p><em></em></p><p><a href=\"http://assets0.ordienetworks.com/images/GifGuide/michael_scott/The-Office-gifs-the-office-14948948-240-196.gif\">NO.</a></p><p><img src=\"http://assets0.ordienetworks.com/images/GifGuide/michael_scott/The-Office-gifs-the-office-14948948-240-196.gif\" /><em></em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410052521|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d2a1fffe425b2b8e6070cd149a9f0f2cd1cdb530 -->",

        "headline":"Why have so many NHL playoffs gone to overtime in 2013?",
        "body":"<h2>The overtime playoffs</h2><p>The Ottawa Senators are back in the thick of things against the Pittsburgh Penguins, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/20/colin-greening-ot-goal-senators-penguins\">a double-overtime goal from Colin Greening</a>. The overtime loss for Pittsburgh was actually worse than it first appeared. It broke the team's streak for straight road overtime wins in the playoffs – they'd managed seven in a row dating back to 2001. \"Only two other teams in NHL history have recorded seven or more consecutive victories in road overtime games in the Stanley Cup Playoffs: the Canadiens (nine, from 1993 to 1998) and Islanders (eight, from 1977 to 1981),\" <a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=670727\">says NHL.com</a>. So much for that now.</p><p>In case you missed Greening's goal, here it is:</p><p><em></em></p><p>That was the first double-OT we've seen this year in the playoffs, but certainly not the first time we've watched a game go to extra time. The extra frame in Ottawa Monday night was the 20th time a 2013 playoff game has gone to OT – 17 of those came in Round One, outstripping last year's record-breaking total of 16 in the first round. Most of the time, the home team took the win if the game went to overtime in Round One (10 times). The visitors managed seven wins in the extra frame. </p><p>Why so many overtime periods?</p><p>It probably just comes down to parity, and the fact that the NHL these days is a league where really, just about anybody who can make it into the postseason has to be regarded as a Cup contender. \"There is no detectable pattern for success any more. Parity has jumbled all the previously known truths,\" <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/duhatschek-the-perils-of-parity-that-reign-supreme-in-the-nhl/article7449949/#dashboard/follows/\">Eric Duhatschek wrote back in January at the Globe and Mail</a>, just prior to the launch of this shortened season. In the last seven seasons, there have been seven different Cup winning teams, from all corners of the league and all kinds of skill sets.</p><blockquote><p>\"There were teams that won with pure skill (Pittsburgh with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin) and teams that won by leaning on the opposition (Los Angeles and all those heavy bodies they deployed up front). There were teams that won because of superior goaltending (Cam Ward, Tim Thomas and Jonathan Quick all took home Conn Smythe trophies as playoff MVPs) and teams that won with goaltending that was just good enough (see the Red Wings with Chris Osgood and the Blackhawks with Antti Niemi). </p></blockquote><p>That's not to say the dynasty days are necessarily over, but if they don't come back for a while, probably all the better for the league and its reach. If more and more teams are capable of winning the Stanley Cup, the more chance there will be for cities that rarely in the past paid any attention to the local hockey franchise, to take an interest. For seasoned fans, it's equally good news. Nobody wants to sit around watching one team steamroll to a Cup every year. Bring on the competition. </p><p>A tip of the hat to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thePuckBurger\">The Puck Burger</a> for pointing out that <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/opinion/2013/05/stanley-cup-playoffs-2013-overtime-heroes.html\">CBC is keeping a running video tally of all the OT goals this year</a>, in case you want to relive some glory or, depending on who you support, sadness.</p><h2>The bad referee playoffs?</h2><p>Here's what <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9279222/2013-nhl-playoffs-washington-capitals-gm-george-mcphee-agrees-alex-ovechkin-officiating-complaints\">Alex Ovechkin reportedly had to say</a> (in Russian) about the refereeing after the Capitals' first round exit against the New York Rangers: \"The refereeing ... you understand it yourself. How can there be no penalties at all [on one team] during the playoffs?\" Ovechkin told a reporter in Russian. \"I am not saying there was a phone call from [the league], but someone just wanted Game Seven. For the ratings. You know, the lockout, escrow, the league needs to make profit.\" Washington's general manager, George McPhee didn't necessarily disagree with his star, noting that while he didn't think it was a conspiracy, \"Alex wasn't wrong.\"</p><p>Ovechkin isn't the only player complaining about the quality of the referees so far this playoff season. <a href=\"http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/madhouse-enforcer/Toews-Official-Criticisms-A-Lesson-for-Blackhawks-Fans--208011841.html\">Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews said</a> he was upset with the officiating during his team's 4-1 loss in Game Two against the Red Wings, reportedly saying that \"it's just tough to understand sometimes why we get roughing penalties &amp; hooking, whatever it is, and that doesn't go both ways.\" </p><p>I guess he forgot about this:</p><p><em></em></p><p>After the L.A. Kings dropped Game Three against the San Jose Sharks this weekend, Kings' goalie Jonathan Quick verbally berated the referees for calls that put L.A. at a disadvantage to start the overtime period. Probably Quick failed to see the humour in the fact he was then <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-kings-jonathan-quick-conduct-20130519,0,2290.story\">given a game misconduct by those same referees</a>.</p><p>The theme continued Monday night in Ottawa, with a few missed calls and then a few poor ones prompting a 20,000-person sustained chant of \"Ref, you suck.\" If they're nothing else, at least NHL fans are straightforward with their messaging. (I'll happily recall here one chant from the 2004 Flames-Sharks Western final, <a href=\"http://www.theprovince.com/sports/5540015.bin?size=620x400s\">directed at Sharks' forward Mike Ricci</a>. It was this: \"Ricci's ugly!\" Over and over.)</p><p>It seems we probably have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/apr/18/penguins-flyers-hossa-torres-nhl-fights\">this refereeing discussion every year</a>, with roughly the same questions being asked: How bad is the refereeing in the NHL? How much does it ruin the game? Should we install cameras and instant video replay and a challenge function for a bad call on the ice? And the answer to all three of those is usually the same: depends on the night and whether your team is winning at the time.</p><p><a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/learned-complaining-nhl-officiating-time-fine-sore-losers-115517840.html\">Over at Puck Daddy</a>, Ryan Lambert thinks the league should be punishing those who question the officials publicly – at least to the same extent they do the coaches. </p><blockquote><p>\"It would be nice if the league would crack down on these guys so this kind of pointless whining stops before it gets any worse. It's one thing to do it in a game, I understand, and that's why you can almost forgive Jonathan Quick for his misdeeds; but when it's spilling over into postgame scrums, there's no need for it. … It's embarrassing that these otherwise extremely respected players, Toews in particular being routinely painted as this stoic figure who approaches everything in this sport The Right Way, have to resort to this type of petulant whining because their teams didn't win.\" </p></blockquote><h2>The-delay-of-game playoffs</h2><p>Speaking of penalties, here's one which is starting to drive everyone nuts, including one of the league's biggest stars.</p><p>\"I think we all cringe when we see one of those as a player,\" <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/9286627/pittsburgh-penguins-sidney-crosby-favors-video-replay-delay-game-penalties\">Sidney Crosby told reporters on Friday, according to ESPN</a>. He was talking about the delay-of-game infraction, in which a player that lobs the puck over the glass spends some time in the sin bin, even when the intention was likely a simple clearing attempt. The rule states that it must be deliberate, but there's really no room for benefit of the doubt – it has to be clear-cut or not exist at all. Which means that, most of the time, it seems a pretty harsh rule.</p><p>Crosby explained what he sees as a solution:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"So many factors that can go into that happening. The puck rolls on you all of a sudden or a guy kind of gets a piece of you at the last second and changes the way you're shooting it. But I think if anything, maybe they can be reviewable. I think a play like that maybe should be reviewable. It shouldn't take that long. It obviously has a huge importance in a game. Should be able to see it pretty clear on a video review if that did clearly go over or hit a stick. I've seen a couple of those throughout the playoffs.\"</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps he's right.</p><p>As much as Jonathan Quick disliked the calls that led to the San Jose Sharks scoring in overtime in Game Three, just one game prior, the Kings actually benefited from their own power play – one that came on a call for delay-of-game. it gave the Kings a 5-on-3, which they used to go up 3-2 late in the third, effectively putting it all away. Watch:</p><p><em></em></p><p>Should the referees (or Toronto HQ) get the chance to review those calls?</p><h2>The unsung heroes playoffs</h2><p>Not to say the usual suspects haven't been on the scoresheets, but so often this playoff season, it's been the guys who usually don't get all the attention that have been filling in while the big names search for points. </p><p>Boston's 5-2 win over the Rangers Sunday is one example. The game ended with some of the usual suspects notching goals (Lucic and Marchand), but it was some of the unsung heroes who kept them in the game early on against New York. Defenceman Torey Krug put Boston on the board first and Gregory Campbell – a guy who managed only four goals in the regular season – put the Bruins ahead early in the second period. After the Rangers equalized again, it was Johnny Boychuk who scored to keep the Bruins in the lead – and <a href=\"http://youtu.be/U0YFw3sV998\">that one was a beauty wrister</a>.</p><p>It makes you wonder even more where Tyler Seguin and Jaromir Jagr have gone to this playoff season. </p><p>It's been a similar story in Chicago, where a bunch of guys were stepping in to fill the gaps left by Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane, who were unable to score at all in the first round against Minnesota. Patrick Sharp, Marian Hossa and Bryan Bickell stepped in to help out, combining for 11 of the 17 goals the Blackhawks scored against the Wild. So far, that pattern has held in the early going of Round Two. In Chicago's 4-1 win against the Red Wings, it was the same story: Hossa, Oduya, Kruger and Sharp were the scorers. </p><p>Same goes for Ottawa, where guys like Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Mika Zibanejad are making their mark on the franchise by being clutch performers when the first line is shut down. Secondary scoring is always a factor, but particularly in the playoffs. It's something the Rangers have a bit of (Aaron Asham) and something the Red Wings needed a bit more of going into Game 3. Their first goal Monday night? Care of Gustav Nyquist. Their second? Drew Miller. </p><h2>The Raffi-Torres-is-still-here-and-we-still-have-to-talk-about-him playoffs</h2><p>Here in Ottawa, a lot of people tend to hate on Matt Cooke lately, but throughout the rest of the league, surely it's Raffi Torres who has to take home the title for the league's ultimate jerk. Last postseason, he sidelined Marian Hossa with <a href=\"http://youtu.be/W2mX7LqBGo4\">an absolutely ridiculous hit that earned him a 25-game suspension</a>. But, of course, that changed nothing.</p><p>On Tuesday he did <a href=\"http://youtu.be/ei5UkHL0oNM\">this</a>.</p><p>Torres has been suspended for the remainder of the series against the Kings.</p><p>And, of course, it was only then that the silliness started. Thanks to a rule the league put in place earlier this year, Sharks' general manager Doug Wilson got his team fined $100,000 for making comments about the suspension within 48 hours of the league handing down its sentence. Originally, it was supposed to be $25,000, but the NHL slapped a further $75,000 on the team because of the \"inappropriate nature\" of the comments. <a href=\"http://sharks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=671163\">What did Wilson say</a>, you ask? Must have been pretty bad. Surely an f-bomb or two. </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Upon review of the incident, it is abundantly clear that this was a clean hockey hit. As noted by the NHL, Raffi's initial point of contact was a shoulder-to-shoulder hit on an opponent who was playing the puck. He did not leave his feet or elevate, he kept his shoulder tucked and elbow down at his side, and he was gliding - not skating or charging.\"</p></blockquote><p>He went on to say that it appeared the league \"has not only made an inappropriate application of this rule but is trying to make an example out of a player who is being judged on past events, one who has changed his game dramatically this season and taken only six minor penalties in 39 games.\"</p><p>Torres is the sort of player that stalks the NHL seemingly only to find opportunities he can exploit to remind the league of the worst parts of itself. First is his style of play – obnoxious – but second is the way his actions tend to show off other disappointing attributes of the game and its surrounding culture. An easy place to start is with those who tend to defend these kinds of plays with a harken back to the good old days, completely (perhaps intentionally) oblivious to the sort of physical damage those days wrought. Case in point, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2013/05/17/sp-coachs-corner-don-cherry-raffi-torres-suspension.html]\">Mr. Don Cherry, who had this to say</a> on the latest Torres hit: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Twenty years ago, you would've got a medal for doing something like this.\"</p></blockquote><p>Come on. </p><p>Then there's that reaction from the league when a GM speaks his mind. What was that all about? What possible reasoning could it have had to go above and beyond the $25,000 base penalty? And how does the league not see the irony in that? That is, like so many other calls we see these days, tacking on an extra $75,000 for a relatively benign comment like that seems somewhat arbitrary and unjustified.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409214120|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|589db076c703562fffab618d56d1b57311b530be -->",

        "headline":"NHL playoffs: Are the New York Islanders this year's LA Kings?",
        "body":"<h2>Are the Islanders this year's L.A. Kings?</h2><p>Speaking of surprises, the one that probably nobody predicted is that the New York Islanders would make a series of it with the Pittsburgh Penguins. And yet...</p><p>After pounding the Islanders 5-0 in Game 1, and Crosby set to finally return in Game 2, it looked like the Penguins would probably make quick work of the Islanders. The early-going in Game 2 certainly helped that narrative, as Crosby grabbed two goals in the first period to give the Pens a 3-1 lead going into the second. Then, as if by magic (or dogged determinism combined with a peppering of shots on Pens goalie Marc-Andre Fleury), the Iles grabbed two unanswered goals in the second. Then another in the third. And with that, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/04/chicago-beat-minnesota-islanders-pittsburgh\">they won 4-3</a>. Stunning.</p><p>It didn't get much easier for the Penguins in Game 3. They led 3-2 after the first, and added an extra in the second, but gave up two in the third. The whole thing went to overtime, ending with the Pens' Kunitz snapping one past Evgeni Nabokov just after the 8-minute mark. </p><p>The Penguins have been doing some things right, including scoring on the power play. However, they've been unable to hold a lead, no doubt refreshing the memory of last year's first round slugfest against Philadelphia. That series was a bit more out of control, but there again, the Penguins' downfall was due in part to being unable to keep the pucks from going in, no matter how many they scored. They lost that series 4-3. So, is the problem with goaltending? Or is there something else at play? Two years doesn't make a trend, but it's noticeable.</p><p>Or maybe the Penguins are really only half the problem. It's easy to point to Fleury or the Pens' defensive squad and blame them for not fulfilling what most believed would be an easy rout of the Iles. But credit where it's due: The Islanders are playing better hockey than they have all season. Are they capable of an L.A. Kings-like romp through the rest of the playoffs? </p><p>If you said no, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/08/islanders-penguins-nhl-playoffs\">check Tuesday night's score</a>. The two were tied going into the third, and Pittsburgh managed to score quickly to take a 4-3 lead. Then, a few minutes later, things started to fall apart. Mark Streit notched one at 4:30 for New York. Then, almost seven minutes later, John Tavares put another one in. And, with just under two minutes to go, Casey Cizikas (who?) made it 6-4. Then it was all over. The series is tied 2-2. </p><p>Can the Islanders win? It seems so, which would be especially embarrassing for the Penguins, considering <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/sidney-crosby-sports-illustrated-cover-153729706.html\">the latest Sports Illustrated cover</a>.</p><h2>Goodbye, Vancouver</h2><p>Somewhat amazingly, Vancouver's loss on Tuesday night, and quick exit from the playoffs, brings to mind something Don Cherry said recently. </p><p>Just about every conversation about Vancouver going into these playoffs (including here) was that the biggest question mark for the Canucks would be in net. Would it be Luongo or Schneider? After the first three games, after both had a shot at backstopping the Canucks, and neither had managed to pull out a win, that was again a go-to question. But <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockeynightincanada/coachscorner/video/#id=2383335504\">Cherry pointed to another, bigger, problem</a>.</p><blockquote><p>\"Remember the playoffs when they were with Boston? I think they had 8 goals in 7 games. it wasn't Roberto, it was your scorers,\" Cherry said. \"His losses this year, in 8 games – his losses – they've scored 10 goals, and they're not scoring... Vancouver: It's not your goaltenders, it's the guys that lead your league in scoring and aren't scoring.\"</p></blockquote><p>That finally changed Tuesday night in San Jose. Mid-way through the third, the Canucks were down 2-1 with about 10 minutes gone in the frame. Then they finally started scoring. First, on the power play, was Alex Burrows, and then, only a couple minutes later, Alex Edler let go a bomb from the blue line that soared past Antti Niemi's right ear and into the mesh. Not only did it put the 'Nucks ahead, it marked the first time they'd been able to score three goals against the Sharks all season.</p><p>It would have all been great news, if Vancouver had managed to stay out of the penalty box. Three of the four goals the Sharks scored against Vancouver Tuesday came with the man advantage, including both the equalizer and the eventual overtime winner, which came with a bit of controversy.</p><p>Thirteen minutes into the extra frame, Daniel Sedin pushed Shark Tommy Wingels into the boards at the far end of the ice from behind. He was called for boarding. Here's the hit:</p><p><em></em></p><p>The question is: was it a boarding penalty? Arguably, it looks very much shoulder-to-shoulder, but once again, it falls into an ambiguous zone where, as much as it might have been a clean hit, it borders on the kind of thing the league is looking to eliminate. And so, here we are. </p><p>This early exit for the Canucks was (again) a big surprise. Is it already time for a complete rebuild in Vancouver?</p><h2>Was giving up Tuukka Rask the dumbest things the Leafs did?</h2><p>First off: I've probably missed some pretty goals so far in the playoffs, but I'd wager James van Riemsdyk's sleek little back-hand past Tuukka Rask Saturday night in Boston was one of the best.</p><p><em></em></p><p>Arguably, he was a bit fortunate at the very end to get the bounce off Rask's skate, but all the same, that takes nothing away from those hands. </p><p>Second, let's take nothing away from Rask, who has so far been stellar in this series, backstopping the Bruins to a commanding 5-2 win on Monday night to ruin Toronto's playoff homecoming and take a 2-1 series lead. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/tuukka-rask-shining-against-team-040900979--spt.html\">As the Hockey News points out</a>, of all the trades Brian Burke made when he was the Leafs' general manager, it might turn out that letting go of Rask was the worst.</p><blockquote><p>\"People never tire of giving the Leafs and former GM Brian Burke grief over the Phil Kessel trade that delivered Tyler Seguin and Dougie Hamilton to the Bruins. But in the short-term, the organization's decision to go with Pogge over Rask might even be a worse one. To this point it certainly has and in this series, it has, since Seguin has yet to register a point and Hamilton has been a healthy scratch in two of the three games.\" </p></blockquote><p>Was giving up Rask the worst trade the Leafs made recently?</p><p>Also, while this series has proved generally a good one to watch, the off-ice relationship has been marred by a couple of stupid fans on either side. </p><p>First, was <a href=\"http://youtu.be/1RlDuuSOGEQ\">a video of a Leafs fan on the ground</a>, apparently unconscious in Boston that emerged online after Game 2 (which the Leafs won). According to the fan on the ground, Kyle Hay, he was sucker-punched in the back of the head as he walked the concourse after the game. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/leafs-fan-gets-sucker-punched-knocked-birthday-bruins-153140330.html\">According to Puck Daddy</a>, it left him with \"three stitches in the back of his head, a swollen cheek and a concussion.\" Nice.</p><p>Then, there's this guy: A Toronto fan who decided to play on the post-marathon bombing \"Boston Strong\" slogan and came up with the terrific idea to make a sign that said \"Toronto Stronger,\" complete with a blue and white ribbon. <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjkiebus/behold-the-visage-of-the-most-classless-fan-in-sports\">Buzzfeed called him</a> \"the most classless fan in sports.\" Yep.</p><p>The Bruins and Leafs play again Wednesday night in Toronto. </p><h2>The Canadiens and Senators hate each other</h2><p>One of the problems the Senators had for years after the team set up shop in Ottawa in the early 1990s was in building enduring rivalries with its neighbouring teams, the Leafs and the Canadiens. </p><p>Its rivalry with the Leafs took about a decade to really hit a stride, when the two teams met in the playoffs in 1999-2000, 2000-01, 2001-02, and then again in 2003-04. Now, there's real animosity between the two – so much so that <a href=\"http://www.senatorsextra.com/main/senators-ban-fans-from-selling-discount-tickets-to-leafs-habs-supporters\">the Senators recently tried to limit how many tickets Leafs fans could buy</a> for games in Ottawa.</p><p>As for Montreal? It's just not been the same. That's changed now.</p><p>Following <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/03/nhl-playoffs-lars-eller-eric-gryba\">the Eric Gryba hit on Lars Eller in Game 1</a>, there was some back-and-forth jawing between Senators' coach Paul MacLean (who said the Gryba hit was partly the fault of the Habs' Raphael Diaz's bad pass) and Canadiens' enforcer Brandon Prust (who responded <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/nhl/story/ottawa-senators-coach-paul-maclean-called-bug-eyed-fat-walrus-by-montreal-canadiens-rafael-diaz-050313\">by calling MacLean a fat walrus</a>). In other words, the rivalry was heating up well in advance of Sunday's game, which probably now solidified a new Canadian hockey rivalry.</p><p>Watch:</p><p><em></em></p><p>That brawl happened with over half of the third period still left to play, so by the end of the night, the benches for both teams were basically empty. Senators' captain (and forward) Daniel Alfredsson finished the night on defence. </p><p>In light of that, Tuesday night's meeting was surprisingly calm, with both teams keeping emotions in check in favour of having it out on the goal sheet. Montreal looked very strong in the first two periods, keeping the Senators to few shots, finally figuring out Craig Anderson and taking a two goal advantage. The Senators came out completely flat and their top line was almost invisible. Then, with 8 minutes left in the third, Mika Zibanejad grabbed Ottawa's first of the game. Off his skate.</p><p><em></em></p><p>I'm biased in this (I'm rooting for the Habs) but it looked like a kicking motion to me. </p><p>However, the goal stood as called, and proved a crucial turning point for the Sens. A few minutes later, Cory Conacher grabbed the equalizer in a goal crease melee from which Habs goalie Carey Price emerged apparently injured – too injured to start in overtime. Two minutes into the extra frame, Kyle Turris netted the winner on a weird, harmless looking, shot from point that sailed over Hab's backup Peter Budaj's right shoulder. The Senators are now up 3-1, going back to Montreal, where the Habs will have to quickly learn how to hold a lead – possibly in front of their backup. </p><h2>Eugene Melnyk is a nice guy</h2><p>Keila Penner is an Ottawa Senators fan, but she lives in Lachine, Quebec, not far outside of Montreal. Already you see the issue. So did her school, which held a Canadiens jersey day, and then sent her home when she wore her Sens shirt. </p><p>Soon enough, the media got wind of the story and <a href=\"http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/montreal-girl-sent-home-for-wearing-senators-jersey-1.1271510\">Penner was the subject of a few local news stories</a>.</p><p>And soon after that, Melnyk heard about it and decided to order a limo for the family and drive them down to Ottawa for Tuesday night's game and set them up in the owner's box. The team also gave her a new jersey, signed by the entire team. It was a classy move from the Sens. The owners get a bad rep most of the time, especially recently, but it's worth noting when one deserves some kudos. </p><p>One more note on Melnyk: Remember <a href=\"http://www.ottawasun.com/2013/05/07/ottawa-senators-owner-eugene-melnyk-still-investigating-whether-matt-cooke-intentionally-hurt-erik-karlsson\">his efforts to determine, via forensic scientists, that Matt Cooke intentionally injured Sens' star defenceman Erik Karlsson</a>? He's still working on it. I, for one, still can't wait to hear the results.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/408494456|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|dd9c035b6195b094fe3e1aefde21150cfe289e69 -->",

        "headline":"Eric Gryba hit on Lars Eller signals bloody start to NHL playoffs",
        "body":"<p>The NHL playoffs are now in full swing. We look at the main storylines from the first round of games:</p><h2>Lars Eller left bloodied, dazed and confused by Eric Gryba</h2><p>The good news first: As of Thursday evening, Montreal Canadiens forward Lars Eller is going to survive. The bad news? The reason we're even wondering about that in the first place: With about 6:30 left in the second period of Game One against Ottawa Thursday, Eller was totally flattened mid-ice by Ottawa's Eric Gryba. Here's the clip (warning: blood).</p><p><em></em></p><p>Gryba got a five-minute major for the hit, and though the Habs capitalized on it with a goal, they basically completely ran out of gas by a few minutes into the third and ended up losing 4-2. </p><p>Back to Eller. <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/opinion/stanleycup2013/2013/05/did-you-see-that-lars-eller-stretchered-off-ice.html\">He suffered a possible concussion and a broken nose</a> – in that order, no doubt, judging by the video. The question is immediately: Was it a legal hit? </p><p>In the clip, the term \"suicide pass\" is mentioned. Indeed it was, and Eller was essentially completely blind to Gryba's incoming. Gryba does appear to get his shoulder high on Eller, whether intentional or not. It was bound to be a brutal hit, just about any way you slice it. The blood after he fell to the ice sealed the major penalty. Does Gryba deserve a hearing with the league?</p><p>Over <a href=\"http://video.tsn.ca/?dl=pipe42/latest/1/0/918384/clip/0\">at TSN former NHL ref Kerry \"the hair\" Fraser evaluates the call</a> and says it was a \"clean hit with a bad result,\" arguing that Gryba's hip was what made contact with Eller. As for the head contact? \"What happened there was that the secondary contact, was, as he passed through and off the centre line, the head of Eller contacted the back shoulder cap of Gryba.\" </p><p>Frankly, I'm still in the camp that believes the principle point of contact is the head, not Eller's mid-section.</p><p>More pressing for Montreal now, though, is how to recover from this loss – of both the game and one of their best players. The Habs looked very sluggish in the third, as if they weren't prepared to play a high-tempo game for a full 60 minutes. Two things they must do right away: First, be more physical. They are simply not going anywhere in the playoffs without that. And second, Montreal has to start getting bodies in front of Anderson, who was phenomenal Thursday night (he stared down 50 shots). Both will be difficult for a team that's not necessarily built for either assignment. </p><p><strong>Update</strong> (Friday, 4pm ET): <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=422306\">Gryba suspended for two games</a>.</p><h2>Don't discount the backup goalie with MS</h2><p>Minnesota was always expected to have a tough time with the Chicago Blackhawks, but literally nobody on this Earth could have predicted that Wild goalie Niklas Backstrom would have been injured so early in Tuesday night's game that the game hadn't even started yet. </p><p>Here's all we know about what happened (hint: not a lot).</p><p><em></em></p><p>In steps backup goalie Josh Harding, a guy who'd only played one playoff game in his life, and who happens to have been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis just last year. Not that this last fact necessarily would mean he is any worse at his job – in fact, quite the contrary, as it turned out. Though the Wild ultimately fell to the Blackhawks 2-1, he backstopped them to overtime and made 35 saves along the way. </p><p>Blackhawks forward Patrick Sharp <a href=\"http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Minnesota/2013/05/01/20785911.html\">had this to say about Harding</a>: \"You have to tip your hat to what Josh is going through. It's pretty amazing that he's able to play at the level he does, it's an inspiration for a lot of people.\"</p><p>At the moment, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9236727/niklas-backstrom-minnesota-wild-miss-game-2-chicago-blackhawks\">Backstrom is listed day-to-day</a> and is not likely to start Friday, so Harding may get the nod again. Will he be this year's Braden Holtby?</p><h2>The Leafs have obviously not been in the playoffs for a while</h2><p>Perhaps it's unfair to expect the Leafs to be able to take on the Bruins at quite the calibre that's necessary to win a playoff series. After all, this team has virtually no playoff experience. Their captain, Dion Phaneuf does, as does Joffrey Lupul, but really, this is not a team that's very familiar with the pressures of the postseason. The Bruins were shaky down the stretch, but this team has a strong collective memory of winning a Stanley Cup. That showed Wednesday night, as they came together, out-shot (40-20), out-chanced, and straight up out-played the Leafs.</p><p>Over at the National Post, Bruce Arthur breaks it down, noting that Leafs' coach Randy Carlyle is looking to make some changes for Game Two (obviously) but no matter what he does, it might not be enough to overcome what Arthur calls the \"structural demolition\" that was Game One.</p><p>Arthur highlights one man in particular, and it is truly galling.</p><blockquote><p>\"What about matchups? Phil Kessel didn't attempt a shot on goal until the third period and played just 13:51, his second-lowest total of the season. He played just 3:20 in the third period, when the game was out of sight. Of his nearly 12 minutes at even strength, 10 came against Zdeno Chara, and eight came against Patrice Bergeron, two shutdown artists.\" </p></blockquote><p>Carlyle pointed out that being on the road, matchups are tougher. True, but this seems like an extreme. Even if the Leafs were to improve in Game Two (very possible) or Game Three, when they're back in Toronto (even more possible), they would have to rely on the Bruins being worse (much less possible). </p><p>Over at the CBC, Tim Whamsby made note of one thing – perhaps the source of an extra bit of motivation in Boston:</p><blockquote><p>\"A few of the local reporters I talked to remarked afterwards that this was the Bruins best game of the season. The atmosphere in their dressing room was buoyant as players talked about the win next to a Bruins sweater that hung on one wall with Boston 617 Strong stitched on the back, in honour of the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings last month.\"</p></blockquote><h2>Throwing elbows: Andrew Ference gets suspended</h2><p>Speaking of head shots and the Maple Leafs, Toronto fans will probably be happy to hear that Boston defenceman Andrew Ference landed himself a one-game suspension for his elbow on Mikhail Grabovski Wednesday night. In case you missed that hit, here it is:</p><p><em></em></p><p>Yuck. Suspension deserved. Nothing about what Ference is doing down there needed an elbow to be thrown right at Grabovski's head. Brendan Shanahan said as much in his disciplinary video: \"We don't view this check as defensive in nature. Ference is in control of this play, and not merely bracing for contact.\" Translation: This was totally unnecessary. Poor form.</p><h2>The Capitals are legit (maybe)?</h2><p>Either that, or the New York Rangers are just completely not ready for this playoff series. Thursday night, the Rangers let a 1-0 lead at the end of the first completely disappear and dropped Game One of their series against Washington 3-1. </p><p>All of the Caps' goals came in the second, and for anyone (me) doubting Ovechkin's potential, it's worth noting the man to put them back into it was no. 8 (even if it was thanks to a weird rebound off the end boards that Ovie said was \"a lucky bounce\"). The key point, overall, though, was Ovie's goal came on a power play – an area where the Caps happen to be quite dangerous. And the Rangers gave them plenty of chances to prove it, landing in the box six times Thursday night.</p><p>The prettiest goal of the night, however, was the go-ahead Marcus Johansson grabbed with just over five minutes left in the second. Enjoy:</p><p><em></em></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=668207\">NHL playoff schedule</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/408284508|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|b6cb61bc6be689fa72942c03e44fdc032b99a90d -->",

        "body":"<h2>&quot;No homo&quot; says Tyler Seguin</h2><p>Just over a week after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/apr/12/nhl-you-can-play-gay-homophobia\">the NHL signed on officially as a partner with You Can Play</a>, the organization founded to help reduce LGBT stigmatization in sports, Bruins forward Tyler Seguin tweeted about a rap song by Boston artist Slaine, called &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z0UGCKqNAY\">Nothin' But Business</a>&quot;. Seguin told the world (in <a href=\"http://twitter.com/FlandersBreivik/status/326530116488421378/photo/1\">a now deleted tweet</a>): </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>&quot;Just listened to the song in my bed. Gave me goosebumps no homo. My roommate and boy have some skills @freddybender @KnucklesNBS&quot;. </p></blockquote><p>Seguin must have realized his mistake pretty quickly (no doubt a few Twitter users let him know) and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/tylerseguin92/status/326534197915316225\">tweeted an apology</a>: &quot;You know when your half asleep and say or write something without thinking twice or realizing what you said. Apologies on last tweet. Gnight.&quot; </p><p>You Can Play founder Patrick Burke retweeted that message after <a href=\"http://twitter.com/BurkieYCP/status/326532660358959104\">making sure everyone knew what was wrong with it</a>, followed by a call for calm. &quot;Is it the end of the world?&quot; <a href=\"http://twitter.com/BurkieYCP/status/326532986050846721\">he asked Twitter</a>. &quot;No. And I'm sure he's already regretting it. All that's going to happen is some education from us. No discipline.&quot; Then, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/BurkieYCP/status/326533310903906304\">Burke wrote</a>: &quot;Deep breaths on both 'sides' of my twitter feed for be helpful. It's not acceptable for him to say that, but he's not a monster for it.&quot;</p><p><em></em></p><p>Probably Seguin didn't mean much by the comment, but that in itself is part of the problem. Does he deserve any discipline other than a stern reminder from someone that it's not acceptable? I'm betting he got a pretty good one from the Twitterverse on Monday.</p><h2>How the NHL is ruining the outdoor game</h2><p>One of the first fatalities of last fall's lockout was the Winter Classic scheduled between Detroit and Toronto, slated to be played at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbour. Thankfully, that game's been resurrected – to the point where we already know the jerseys the teams will be wearing (which are great). But it looks like perhaps the league is overcompensating a bit. This week <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2013/04/16/sp-nhl-outdoor-games-stadium-series-heritage-classic.html\">it announced</a> there will be five more outdoor games next year. Five. More.</p><p>Or, to put it another way, the NHL discovered a goldmine of ratings, revenues and national attention and, like any the worst kind of greedy, cartoonish cohort of cash-grab artists, saw only dollar signs, and thus set about systematically bleeding that mine to death. </p><p>Granted most of the list is good, apart from one obvious joke. The games will include a meeting between the L.A. Kings and Anaheim Ducks at Dodger Stadium (LOL); the Rangers against both the Islanders and Devils respectively – both at Yankee Stadium; the Penguins meeting the Blackhawks at Soldier Field in Chicago; and the Senators and Canucks facing off at B.C. Place in Vancouver. I've personally never been aware of a storied rivalry of any kind between the 'Nucks and the Sens, (if you have, leave a comment), but fine – they needed another Canadian one for balance. But why not spread these games out over years, rather than a couple of months?</p><p>On the plus side, past Winter Classics have been well-attended and a nice way to mark the new year with a mid-season marquee event right at the time (winter, that is) where it makes the most sense to remember the best elements of the game and its history. And, most importantly, people seem to love them.</p><p>They also make a lot of money. Those aforementioned special jerseys being only the start. <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2013/04/20/sp-nhl-hotstove-outdoor-games-will-generate-big-revenue.html\">Elliotte Friedman noted as much on Hockey Night in Canada</a> this weekend: &quot;These games are worth about $30 million US a piece and the cap is going down next year. I think there's a big concern among players,&quot; he said. &quot;So if it's an extra $180 million, it's $90 million for the league and $90 million for the players, and I think that's a very big factor [that] all of these games are going to happen.&quot;</p><p>And then there are the detractors, who recognize all of those good things and yet rationally question the excess.</p><p>Friedman (via TSN's Darren Dreger) points to another problem with this set of games: They fall soon after the players arrive back from the Olympics, in particular the final two – Pittsburgh vs. Chicago on March 1 and Ottawa vs. Vancouver on March 2. <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/opinion/2013/04/6-outdoor-nhl-games-too-much-for-players.html\">He writes</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;That's six and seven days, respectively, after the conclusion of the Sochi Olympics. Look at the rosters of those four teams. Things can change, but how many players are going to Russia? You could make a good argument for at least 30. It seems overly risky to send those players halfway across the world, bring them back and thrust them into unfamiliar surroundings.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Both <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/nhl-outdoor-stadium-series-why-bad-idea-162250998--nhl.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">Harrison Mooney at Puck Daddy and Eric Duhatschek at the Globe and Mail</a> point to another potential issues: effectively demoting what was once a special event into a mundane oh-this-again happening that everyone just starts to despise.</p><p>&quot;Six outdoor games dilutes the brand by eroding the specialness of the Winter Classic, but not just by flooding the market with similar, less special events to follow it,&quot; Mooney writes. &quot;It's also the way that it underscores the cynical cash-grab aspects of the whole thing.&quot;</p><p>And how important is that money, in the long run?</p><p>&quot;It just makes more sense to keep it as a special event, something you can point to annually on the hockey calendar and say, 'gotta set aside time for that.' The minute it becomes a choice of six, then suddenly, the dilution starts – and who knows where it could end?,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/duhatschek-additional-outdoor-games-are-too-much-of-a-good-thing/article11359730/\">Duhatschek writes</a>. &quot;The NHL just might be killing its golden goose.&quot;</p><p>And how. There's not only a risk of total market saturation to a point of total destruction, but even worse, it feels like a gimmick. And the only thing worse than feeling like you're being asked to pay for a gimmick, is feeling like you're being asked to pay for a gimmick that's disguised as a premium add-on – kind of like those extended warranties at an electronics store. If it's no longer actually special, people won't bother giving it any special attention.</p><p>Even worse than simply mining this concept for all the money and ratings the NHL can pump out of it? Now all the fun will be gone, too. Part of what was so special about the winter games was that they were rare, in amazing places, and everyone was left to speculate on where the next one might be, who might play, and on the possible venues. That was part of what made them fun and something to look forward to all year. Now, with six scheduled for 2014, it looks more and more like, eventually, everyone will get a Winter Classic. Which is fine, but it's just no longer a marquee game. For a league with so few opportunities to grab everyone's attention like that, it seems a waste. Hope the money's worth it.</p><h2>The Oilers are a mess, basically</h2><p>And now, for the inevitable change of management in Edmonton. Or rather, a shuffling of the deckchairs. <a href=\"http://sports.nationalpost.com/2013/04/15/oilers-fire-general-manager-steve-tambellini-report/\">The Oilers announced </a>that general manager Steve Tambellini is out, and the organization is replacing him with... former Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish, the guy Tambellini fired the first day he took the GM job in 2009. Granted, MacTavish was the man who was last coaching the Oilers when they had a legitimate shot at a Cup (2006), but with a talented, but perpetually unproductive team, this is probably not really the kind of change that's likely necessary in Edmonton. </p><p>The whole thing was made even worse by the fact that Kevin Lowe, the team's president of hockey operations, managed to insult fans while announcing the change. He noted that the Oilers have &quot;two types of fans: we have paying customers and we have people that watch the game that we still care about. But certainly the people that go to the games and support we spend a lot of time talking to them, delivering our message.&quot; </p><p>The comment – essentially interpreted as Lowe cutting a line down the middle of the fans, splicing them into two groups based on disposable income – was quickly (and probably rightly) <a href=\"http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Edmonton/2013/04/15/20743461.html\">decried, blown out of proportion, and Twitter-shamed</a>. Lowe issued a video apology:</p><p><em></em></p><p>But as <a href=\"http://sports.nationalpost.com/2013/04/19/anger-at-kevin-lowe-a-sign-oilers-fans-are-growing-impatient/\">Cam Cole pointed out this week at the National Post</a>, Lowe was really only speaking the truth: It's the stadium-goers that really bring home the bacon. He notes that for a family of four to go to a game in Edmonton, &quot;and eat a little and drink a little and park, and maybe buy a ball cap, etc&quot; is C$346.46. The fans that stay at home? They pay for cable. Maybe they buy a jersey from time to time. Lowe didn't say anything outrageous. Instead, it all had to do with timing, Cole argues.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The thing he missed is that the maelstrom of angry responses to his message of the day before was only a little bit about his dividing the Oiler fan base into tiers of importance. It was mostly about the public's general impatience, and its growing exasperation with what it perceives as his get-out-of-jail-free card.</p><p>He could have said anything, if his hockey club was winning.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Yeah. <a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm\">About that...</a></p><h2>Kiprusoff's last dance?</h2><p>This is a weird year for Calgary and its fans. All those changes fans had hoped might take place are indeed happening, but the perhaps is somewhat surprising. After the trade deadline passed and Mikka Kiprusoff stayed in Calgary, it was only a matter of time before he called it quits. But now, with Iginla and now Kiprusoff having just played what was likely his last game at the Saddledome this week, the final remnants of that 2004 glory season are gone. Perhaps not a moment too soon, but there's something a bit bittersweet about the whole thing. </p><p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/FNolVdy_z-k\">The fans in Calgary obliged him with a final standing ovation</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/hockey/calgary-flames/Kipper+realizes+childhood+dream+gets+with/8274683/story.html\">As Puck Daddy noted</a>, most disappointed of all will likely be <a href=\"http://youtu.be/D61TyprHVY8\">&quot;Kipper Kid&quot; (aka Brendan Peters), who for a time was known in Calgary simply as the child who stood behind Kiprusoff during warm-ups dressed in exactly the same gear as the Flames goalie, and mimicked his every move</a>. Peters is now in high school, and has basically moved on with his life. Hopefully, unlike their rivals to the north, the Flames organization is ready to truly do the same.</p><h2>Sharks fan cries, meets Sharks, scolds Sharks</h2><p>Speaking of small children who are obsessed with hockey, a final, quick point about a viral video. When Ryan Clowe was traded to New York, seven-year-old Sharks fan Vincent Savage was overcome with sadness. So profound was his depression, he wandered into his back yard and had a good cry. And, like all parents these days, hoping to capture that precious moment for all the internet to see, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/2Ux84k2XWPE\">his mother recorded it:</a></p><p>To his credit, Savage raises a great, often wrenching, question that sports fans have to deal with all the time. When a favourite player moves on from a favourite team, what happens? Do you automatically become a fan of their new team, even if there was no prior affiliation? How do you still cheer for your preferred squad when there's such an emptiness left by the departed star? Poor Savage. Life never really gets easier, does it?</p><p>In any case, the Sharks saw it (noting, probably, Savage's apparent newfound anger at the club), and tried to make amends: the team invited him to visit the locker room after a pre-game skate. But, <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/sharks/ci_23054546/san-jose-sharks-try-patch-things-up-angry\">according to reports</a>, it might not have actually done much good. Savage reportedly told them all that &quot;I can't believe you haven't won any Stanley Cups.&quot; When he was corrected that, actually, Dan Boyle had, he then replied, &quot;but you haven't won one with the Sharks.&quot; Perpetually unimpressed. I like it.</p><h2>Goals of the week</h2><p><em></em></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm\">NHL standings</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407696915|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|888d9a4fa6f9906219ef66eb1d466e4593970a90 -->",

Pittsburgh went 15-0-0 in March, the first perfect month in league history. The Penguins also won a franchise best 12th straight at home.</p><p>In other key games, a Nazem Kadri hat trick led Toronto over Ottawa, Minnesota got back on the winners' list with a shootout victory over Los Angeles, Montreal moved three points clear atop the Northeast Division by defeating the New York Rangers, Edmonton's Taylor Hall scored three goals in the win over Vancouver, and Philadelphia ended a four-game skid by beating Boston.</p><p>Pittsburgh's goals both came in the third period from Matt Cooke and James Neal.</p><p>Crosby skated off the ice with a towel covering his mouth after a slap shot by teammate Brooks Orpik deflected off a stick and hit the NHL scoring leader in the face just 1:28 into the game. Crosby, who immediately fell to the ice and tossed his stick in the air, did not return.</p><p>Crosby, with 15 goals and 56 points, holds a 10-point lead over Tampa Bay's Steven Stamkos in the NHL scoring race. Another head injury for Crosby has to concern the Penguins. The team captain has missed considerable time the past two years because of concussions.</p><p>Toronto's Joffrey Lupul scored to supplement Kadri's hat trick as the Maple Leafs cruised to a 4-0 win over the Ottawa Senators.</p><p>James Reimer made 31 saves for the Maple Leafs, who led 1-0 after the first period and 2-0 after the second before Kadri scored twice in the opening five minutes of the third period to put the game away.</p><p>Minnesota's Mikko Koivu scored in a shootout as the Wild bounced back for a win after having its seven-game win streak ended, defeating the Los Angeles Kings 4-3.</p><p>Koivu also had two assists in regulation. Matt Cullen and Zach Parise scored in regulation for the Wild.</p><p>Dustin Brown, Jeff Carter and Justin Williams scored for the Kings, who blew a two-goal lead.</p><p>Montreal's Michael Ryder and Tomas Plekanec scored in the first period to set up the Canadiens' 3-0 win over the New York Rangers.</p><p>Carey Price made 34 saves and Brendan Gallagher also scored for the Canadiens, who swept their three games with New York this season.<br />The Rangers, the NHL's lowest-scoring team, again failed to find the net.</p><p>Edmonton's Taylor Hall set an Oilers record for the fastest hat trick to start a game, netting three times inside 7:53 almost five minute quicker than Wayne Gretzky's effort in 1986 in the 4-0 win over the Vancouver Canucks.</p><p>Ladislav Smid also scored for the Oilers, who are in a four-team tie just one point behind eighth seed St. Louis in the Western Conference playoff race.<br />The Canucks had their six-game winning streak ended.</p><p>Philadelphia won its first game in five by beating the Boston Bruins 3-1.</p><p>Mike Knuble and Matt Read scored, Ilya Bryzgalov made 33 saves and Ruslan Fedotenko added an empty-netter for the Flyers, who are last in the Atlantic Division but only four points off the Eastern Conference's last playoff spot.</p><p>Nathan Horton scored for the Bruins, who had won their previous four against the Flyers.</p><p>San Jose's Logan Couture scored the lone goal in the shootout to give the Sharks a fourth straight win, beating the Phoenix Coyotes 3-2.</p><p>Carolina kept its playoff hopes alive with a 3-1 win at the Winnipeg Jets, with Hurricanes goalie Justin Peters making 34 saves.</p><p>Florida's Dmitry Kulikov scored his first goal of the season early in overtime as the Panthers edged the New Jersey Devils 3-2 and won back-to-back home games for the first time this season.</p><p>Washington's Alex Ovechkin scored once in regulation and again in a shootout to help the Capitals rally for a 4-3 win over the Buffalo Sabres.</p><p>Colorado's Tyson Barrie scored at 50 seconds of overtime to give the Avalanche a 1-0 win over the Nashville Predators.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406495338|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|969e1c8a538c1f6077d7a4660bfa4bbc1c85db1b -->",

        "headline":"NHL must crack down on diving, flopping and embellishing",
        "body":"<h2>Are referees the biggest problem in the NHL?</h2><p>We've spent a lot of time lately at this blog talking about the rules – the ones that dictate the on-ice play in the NHL, and whether they're being enforced the right way. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/12/nhl-staged-fights-frazer-mclaren-david-dziurzynsk\">Should fighting be banned?</a> Or should fighting rules simply be enforced more often and more to the letter of the law? Possibly. But is there a flip side to that argument? The kind of thing that might have been at the heart of Claude Julien's complaints earlier this month that the Montreal Canadiens were diving all over the place during their game with the Bruins? That is, is NHL now facing the other side of its enforcement problem? That is, an increasingly strict adherence to the rules actually means players are playing to the refs more than to the other team? <a href=\"http://www.csnne.com/blog/bruins-talk/irate-julien-embarrassed-canadiens-embellishment\">Said Julien</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"This is embarrassing for our game: the embellishing. Right now they've got over 100 power plays [this season] and it's pretty obvious why. We're trying to clean that out of our game, and its got to be done soon.... It's about the game and the embellishment embarrasses our game. We need to be better than that.\"</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, embellishment. The general managers are talking about it this week. It's happening. Whether it's happening more now than at some time in the past is sort of subjective. Probably, if you're in favour of a more self-regulated system, wherein the players look out for one another or for themselves and allow the marketplace of fists to dictate the value of their physical interactions, you'd say the amount of embellishment in the NHL these days is out of control, and the way to stop it is to have the refs make fewer calls in general. Maybe you'd even have examples, like <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Zy0Z-xkIS3U\">Toronto's Phil Kessel feigning the whiplash of a stick to the face against Vancouver</a>. Or maybe that time <a href=\"http://youtu.be/SXNtr5rzWfs\">Maxim Lapierre ducked from what seemed like some kind of phantom incoming McSorely broadside</a>. Or when <a href=\"http://youtu.be/XhQJSo3mGpE\">P.K. Subban took the Nestea plunge</a> – again, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/bK2EJhuHsl0\">against Boston</a>. If each of those players had been forced to answer physically for their acting skills to a player from the other team, it might just put a stop to the behaviour. But then we're back to a conversation about fights.</p><p>If you're the kind of person who doesn't mind the referees playing a bigger part in the game – not to mention its pacing, its speed, and ultimately, possibly the point totals (ugh) – then you're fine with more infractions being called overall, as a way to crack down on anything nefarious going on, generally. But then, we're probably suddenly into a conversation about the true physicality of this game or the possibility of more cheating, and (likely, at some point) some silly digression about the pros and cons of soccer.</p><p>The guys on Hockey Night in Canada aren't fans of embellishment (<a href=\"http://youtu.be/yH3RbiQyZIY\">cue Kevin Weekes on the soccer argument</a>). They wondered aloud this weekend whether there was some embellishment going on with hits from behind. As the league tries to crack down on these dangerous checks, some players are selling the hit a bit more than necessary. So what's the answer? More calls against overt embellishment? Perhaps. Fewer calls for anything at all? Maybe. But since players will always find a way to skirt the rules, no matter what they are, if there are, say, more rules against fighting, there'll probably be an uptick in cheap shots or slashing or tripping. And if there are rules against hitting from behind, some salesmen will suddenly appear for that, too. What we need in every one of these situations is consistency in refereeing. </p><p>What tends to cause a lot of cheap shots, bad hits, angry slashes or down and out brawls on the ice? Often, they're the result of perceived or real missed calls for which players decide to settle the score a bit later in some other way – often a choice from the list in the previous sentence. It might sound crazy to expect some kind of robotic, cyborg referee wandering the ice with a computerized eyeball and a brain full of algorithms that instantly makes the right call, but short of that, we can use something else. </p><p>Players are inclined now to see what they can get away with because there's no bar, no standard that's been set. That sounds like a tough thing to come up with, but how about this: right now, referees can't check a penalty call on the ice against video replay, like they do for goals. The replay – easily seen by everyone else in the stadium – usually shows pretty clearly whether something was a sales job or not. Let the refs look at the tape when there's some confusion. Then adjudicate accordingly. Done. </p><p>Solved?</p><h2>Is Patrick Kane a hologram advert for EA Sports?</h2><p>Here is an insane goal Patrick Kane scored the other night. Sit back, grab some popcorn, and prepare to throw it all over the room in celebration of the magnificent beauty you've been fortunate enough to have been on this planet at this point in its history, at this specific spot in the universe, to see. </p><p><em></em></p><p><a href=\"http://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/patrick-kane-ices-blackhawks-rout-stars-sick-spin-024716394--nhl.html\">Harrison Mooney at Puck Daddy</a> described Kane's goal this way:</p><blockquote><p>\"Sometimes, Kane pulls off difficult moves so effortlessly you'd think you were watching a video game. This is one of those occasions, as he coasts into the Dallas end, spins, and fires a backhand over Richard Bachman's shoulder in one gorgeous, fluid motion. In a video game, this is easy. You hit the spin button, then you hit the shoot button. In real life, it's considerably more difficult. But not for Kane, who effortlessly gives us one of the prettiest goals of the year.\"</p></blockquote><h2>More complicated decisions for the league to make [Or: Should we get rid of the shootout?]</h2><p>It's probably not something that's high on the list for most of the league's general managers when they meet on Wednesday in Toronto, but should it be time to take a second look at the shootout? Has it overstayed its welcome? Over <a href=\"http://www.ottawacitizen.com/hockey/nhlnews/shootouts+yawning+third+periods/8093020/story.html\">at Postmedia, Ben Kuzma seems to think so, writing this week</a> that the shootout can cause third period \"malaise\". \"Teams are elated to escape with a point and take their chances to double up in overtime or the shootout, but there should be more urgency to settle the issue in regulation time,\" he says.</p><p>It's the kind of thing that inevitably brings up the name <a href=\"http://blogs.edmontonjournal.com/2013/03/17/red-wings-gm-ken-holland-no-fan-of-shootouts/\">Ken Holland, the Detroit Red Wings general manager, who since at least a couple of years ago, has been a shootout hater</a>. His alternative is a 3-on-3 scenario following the 4-on-4 overtime. It's still a gimmick, but it might feel more like a hockey game in that case. I personally can't see the point of a 3-on-3 – it's not like this is street hockey. Parity is one argument against the old system, but would it be so horrible if we returned to the days when a win got you two points, one point for a tie and nothing at all if you lost? Some,<a href=\"http://boards.sportslogos.net/topic/86318-eliminating-the-shootout-in-the-nhl/\"> like this guy</a>, feel it should be a three-point system: 3 for a win, 2 for an overtime win, 1 point for an overtime loss, and nothing for a regulation loss. </p><p>Should the NHL be thinking about ditching the shootout?</p><h2>Don't quit the play</h2><p>The scene: Edmonton, St. Patrick's Day. The Nashville Predators are on the power play, and suddenly the Oilers grab a loose puck and head the other way, shorthanded. It doesn't look like much until Andrei Kostitsyn decides to just, y'know, sit down. You'll see him, and how the Preds' bench reacted (hint: angry arm waving) at the bottom of your screens. </p><p><em></em></p><p>Tragic. Hilarious.
