        "body":"<p>Neneh Cherry has teamed up with Four Tet and Robyn for her first solo record in 17 years.</p><p>While Cherry's press release described the as-yet untitled LP as a \"solo album\", it is also apparently \"a collaboration\" with the London-based electronic duo <a href=\"http://www.rn9.co.uk/\" title=\"\">RocketNumberNine</a>. The work that makes up the album was previously <a href=\"http://www.mif.co.uk/event/neneh-cherry\" title=\"\">performed at the Manchester international festival</a> earlier this year. Four Tet's Kieran Hebden, who has <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/four-tet/neneh-cherry-the-thing-dream\" title=\"\">remixed</a> a couple of <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neneh-cherry/neneh-cherry-afrika-baby-bam\" title=\"\">Cherry's recent singles</a>, is the project's official producer, and Cherry's Swedish compatriot, Robyn, puts in a \"guest appearance\".</p><p>This collection was apparently recorded very quickly, with 10 songs laid down in just five days. \"It was a liberating experience, not endlessly trying to fiddle with the music, rerecording hundreds of times,\" Cherry said. \"These days it's easy to create any effect or sound on a computer, it is much harder to get the rawness I think we've achieved.\"</p><p>Almost two decades have passed since Cherry's last solo outing, 1996's Man, which spawned two top 10 singles. She has since released two albums with the group CirKus and put out singles with acts including Peter Gabriel, Gorillaz and Youssou N'Dour. In 2012, she returned with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/22/neneh-cherry\" title=\"\">The Cherry Thing</a>, a celebrated full-length with Stockholm's free-jazz trio the Thing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420276587|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|3f3ba22aadc51fb04072b7051b57dcd9982e3f7b -->",

But as <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/van-halen-sues-drummers-wife-648979\" title=\"\">the Hollywood Reporter revealed</a> on Wednesday, she has never given up the famous double-barrelled surname, which is at the forefront of her new, <a href=\"http://kellyvanhalen.com/\" title=\"\">eponymous design business</a>.</p><p></p><p>\"After many years in the business of creating luxury homes for others, Kelly started to think more about day-to-day comfort, especially for children,\" explains <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KellyVanHalenAccessories/info\" title=\"\">the Facebook page</a> for the Kelly Van Halen company. \"It started with a blanket … and the rest is history.\"</p><p></p><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/176405209/Van-Halen-v-Kelly-Van-Halen\" title=\"\">Van Halen's court documents</a>, Kelly applied on 25 January 2010 for two \"multi-class intent-to-use\" Kelly Van Halen trademarks. These were to be used for a broad range of products, including armoires, pillows, blankets, ponchos, construction management, installation of solar-thermal installations, and interior design services. Although Van Halen is indeed Kelly's surname, the musicians claim her trademark is \"confusingly similar to [Van Halen's] marks in sound, appearance and commercial impression\".</p><p></p><p>Through their intellectual property holding company, ELVH Inc, Van Halen are accusing Kelly of \"an intentional violation of [their] rights\". They claim that Kelly Van Halen products constitute trademark infringement, trademark dilution, false designation, and unfair competition with the band's own merchandise.</p><p></p><p>In addition to asking the courts to ban Kelly from selling products under the Van Halen name, they have asked for all Kelly Van Halen goods to be destroyed, with the group receiving all profits from what has already been sold. Yes, Van Halen want all the money from those <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=279445755529906&amp;set=a.279191965555285.1073741832.218697901604692&amp;type=1\" title=\"\">leopard-spotted, furry baby bath towels</a>.</p><p></p><p>Alex, Eddie and Kelly Van Halen have yet to comment publicly on the lawsuit.

        "body":"<p>Melbourne-via New Zealand’s <strong><a href=\"http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/allabout/artist/31792/Teeth-Tongue\">Teeth &amp; Tongue,</a></strong> aka Jess Cornelius, is hard to pigeonhole. Her most recent full-length album – 2011’s critically acclaimed <em>Tambourine</em> – was a devastating listen. Defined by her soulful vocals and the menacing guitar work of local musician Marc Regueiro-McKelvie, the songwriting was so assured it seemed Cornelius had finally found her niche.</p> <p>And then along comes new single Good Man – a total curve-ball. Gone are the guitars and brooding post-punk rhythms, and in their place fuzzed-out synths and glorious pop harmonies. The track starts simply with Cornelius’ baroque-y vocals before breaking open into layered harmonies, programmed beats and some scintillating synth. It’s part pop song gem, part electro burner. And it’s spot on.</p> <p>As Cornelius explains, the idea for Good Man came to her while trying to develop a solo show for a US tour: “I started humming the tune in my head last year. At the time I was using only a drum machine and a synth, so I went home and tried to make it into a song that would stand alone without any other instruments. I ended up sampling layers of my voice for the rhythmic part, and then triggering the vocals using a foot switch while playing it live. This set-up kind of became a prototype for a lot of the songs I have written recently.”</p> <p>Teeth and Tongue’s third album is due out through Remote Control in early 2014.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/\">More from Faster Louder</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/15/sandunes-feat-siddharth-basrur-good-to-you-new-music-from-india\">• Sandunes feat.

After more than a decade when the project dominated everything, he has started to&nbsp;produce works in a range of genres once again. There's been a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/12/arditti-quartet-review\" title=\"\">new string quartet</a>, a trumpet concerto, and now a song cycle,&nbsp;Time and the Seasons, which the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.oxfordlieder.co.uk\" title=\"\">Oxford Lieder festival</a> commissioned&nbsp;and the <a href=\"http://www.ingpen.co.uk/artist/roderick-williams\" title=\"\">baritone Roderick Williams</a> and&nbsp;pianist Andrew West introduced there.</p><p>The new cycle has a link with The Wandering Jew as well, for Williams&nbsp;sang the main role in that work. But the starting point was a single song set to his own poem that Saxton contributed to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/17/nmc-songbook-review\" title=\"\">NMC Songbook</a>, compiled by the contemporary-music label six years ago. That setting is now the final one in Saxton's seven-part sequence, which moves through the seasons, beginning and ending in winter, with a central \"summer seascape\" for piano alone.</p><p>It's an effective, carefully worked plan. Musically, it suggests some unlikely, surprisingly English comparisons. While many of the vocal lines have the haunting, elegiac quality of <a href=\"http://www.geraldfinzi.org/\" title=\"\">Finzi</a>'s Hardy songs, the hyperactivity&nbsp;of some of the piano writing, often untethered from the voice, recalls <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13In4w3vaMg\" title=\"\">Tippett's song cycle The Heart's Assurance</a>. But it all hangs together well; Saxton's poetry does its evocative job and the music supports and enhances it every step of the way.</p><p>Williams and West prefaced the premiere with a selection of seasonal songs by Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Brahms. They followed it with more Schumann – the cycle Dichterliebe – in which Williams perfectly captured the balance between anger and irony, bittersweet recollection and despair, and made every word, every syllable, matter.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

Galun&nbsp;has collaborated with a wide range of Russian groups, including Moremoney,&nbsp;Monokle,&nbsp;Pakava It', and Elochnye Igrushki. His new album, titled Smithers in English and Osolki in Russian. is published through the excellent Krasnodar label Fuselab.</p> <p>Galun's DIY enterprise began in the distant 1990s; today his voice is mixed and manipulated by producer Ivan Kalashnikov.

        "body":"<p>Katy Perry's fourth studio album arrives heralded by both an online video in which the singer symbolically burns a blue wig – like the one she wore on&nbsp;stage during the world tour during which her brief marriage to Russell Brand collapsed – and <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5740580/katy-perrys-prism-the-billboard-cover-story\" title=\"\">a lengthy cover feature in Billboard magazine</a>, the bible of the US music business. The latter enumerates Perry's impressive commercial achievements. She has had&nbsp;nine US No 1 singles since 2008 – five of them came from her last album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/22/katy-perry-teenage-dream-review\" title=\"\">Teenage Dream</a>, equalling a record set&nbsp;by Michael Jackson's Bad – and somehow contrived to launch three perfumes in as many years, some blessed with names that signify something other than what they were perhaps intended to: \"What's that smell?\" \"It's Katy Perry's Miaow.\"</p><p>And then, the Billboard feature lets fly with a bombshell. Teenage Dream's follow-up was inspired by the work of <a href=\"http://www.eckharttolle.com\" title=\"\">Eckhart Tolle</a>, author of A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose, Stillness Speaks: Whispers of Now, and Guardians of Being: Spiritual Teachings from Our Cats and Dogs. As a result of Tolle's influence, avers Billboard, Prism is \"Katy Perry's most spiritual album to date\", a direction coyly hinted at by the opaquely titled bonus track Spiritual.</p><p>Katy Perry's most spiritual album to date: is it possible to read those words without feeling your buttocks involuntarily clench? For one thing, spirituality has always proved a difficult topic for rock and pop to address. It's certainly inspired a few moments of transcendent wonder, but they're outweighed by yards of runny, new-age philosophising, or worse, self-righteous hectoring: Bob Dylan's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXwKL1iM96g\" title=\"\">Property of Jesus</a>, the smug preachiness of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EEibpkXHRM\" title=\"\">George Harrison's 70s oeuvre</a>. And if the Beatles and Dylan couldn't address man's quest for&nbsp;greater meaning without making you want to throw litter at them, what&nbsp;price the author of Dressing Up (\"You wanna pet my kitty? You're such a dirty doggie\") and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10YmixzFSDw\" title=\"\">Ur So Gay</a>?</p><p>Of course, there are those who would point out that being the most spiritual Katy Perry album to date is a bit like being the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jw7yk8hm_0\" title=\"\">Dimmu Borgir</a> album most suited to use in a Zumba fitness class: it isn't really saying much, given the context. Those people are swiftly proved correct. Perry's description of tabla-heavy Legendary Lovers as a song that \"has a bit of curry in it\" should alert us to the fact that hers is not perhaps a wholehearted immersion in the mysticism of the east, or indeed anywhere else. And so it proves: the lyrics graft a load of new-age buzzwords – third eye, karma, mantra – on to a song about having it off. It sets the lyrical tone for the rest of the album, which seems noticeably less concerned with man's quest for greater meaning than it does with pointing out that (a) Russell Brand is a bit of a rum character – the closing power ballad By the Grace of God claims he dumped Perry via text&nbsp;message, leaving her suicidally depressed – and (b) Perry is now at it non-stop with her current inamorato, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/john-mayer\" title=\"\">John Mayer</a>, a relationship hymned at length in This Moment, Love Me and Double Rainbow. There's doubtless someone out there who's mortally offended by the fact that Katy Perry appears to be wearing spirituality in much the same way as she once wore two giant rotating peppermint swirl sweets over her bosoms – perhaps <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rakhi-kumar/michelle-obama-beyonce_b_3120434.html\" title=\"\">that&nbsp;Huffington Post columnist</a> who gamely tried to encourage fans of the&nbsp;\"demonic\" Beyoncé to abandon her in favour of a lady who performs reggae versions of the Hare Krishna mantra – but for anyone else, it comes as a small mercy.</p><p>And if Prism doesn't tell you much about Katy Perry's spiritual journey, it&nbsp;does tell you something about the pecking order of pop music. So many Scandinavian hit factories were involved in its writing that the credits look like IFK Göteborg's first-team squad: Åhlund, Lidehäll, Hermansen, Gottwald. They're the people who write virtually every major pop album these days, but that doesn't mean they always come up with the same stuff. Nothing on Prism is exactly sonically adventurous – the big idea seems to be mimicking early-90s pop-house, hence the jangling piano riff of Walking on Air, or Birthday, which vaguely resembles a four-to-the-floor remix of a Mariah Carey track – but the melodies are significantly stronger than those a similar cast of writers came up with for, say, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/19/jessie-j-alive-review\" title=\"\">Jessie J's recent album</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8\" title=\"\">The single Roar</a> is ruthlessly efficient in its bid to get the drunk and recently dumped member of the girls' night out party up on the table, using her WKD bottle as a microphone, and the rest of the album follows suit: if the ballads are standard issue, the faintly trap-inspired <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9S-88WxPdE\" title=\"\">Dark Horse</a> sounds like a hit single, as does Birthday and, for better or worse, the new jack swing parody This Is How We Do. When the latter achieves omnipresence on the radio, and its chorus takes up adverse possession of your cerebrum, you can always console yourself with the thought of what Prism might have been like had Katy Perry actually meant all that stuff about Eckhart Tolle.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420159167|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|d5c78a0f7181bc8fae886b684b22aecfa9ade61f -->",

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/22/new-band-day-london-grammar\" title=\"\">London Grammar</a> are a classic case of rose-without-trace. A year ago, the three young Londoners hadn't released a note of music; today, their CV includes a No 2 album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/05/london-grammar-if-you-wait-review\" title=\"\">If You Wait</a>, and the attentions of the <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/72583\" title=\"\">Radio 1 Breakfast Show, which tweeted that singer Hannah Reid was \"fit\".</a> The ensuing Twitter backlash brought them on to the mainstream radar, but they would have got there eventually, DJ Nick Grimshaw or no – this is a group whose woebegone indie shop-window conceals a warehouseful of potential hits.</p><p>Reid, guitarist Dan Rothman and synthist <a href=\"http://entertainment.ie/music/news/Interview-with-Dot-Major-from-London-Grammar/214630.htm\" title=\"\">Dot Major</a> (whose double-take resemblance to Harry Styles of One Direction doesn't go unnoticed by a quartet of partying Brighton females) have just returned from their first US tour, a fortnight apparently so unsettling that Rothman's only comment tonight is: \"We're really glad to be home.\" You can only imagine what happened – one thing American hipsters love is an unfathomable English band, and in London Grammar they had the full brooding-Brit experience.</p><p>At 23, Reid is already capable of transfixing a room: from the first chilly ululations of the opening <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT6zjAMTAXI\" title=\"\">Hey Now</a>, the crowd fall silent. Rothman and Major, her glowering shadows, create patterns of swooshes and drones that morph into Portisheadish trippiness on Stay Awake With Me and – it must be said – Sade-style lounge-rock on Flickers. It's a recipe that works especially well onstage, where blue lighting bumps up the haunted-house feel and illuminates Reid, standing eerily composed and separate from other band members.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-407365799\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2013/4/18brightcove/2013/4/18/130417LondonGrammar-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/4/18/130417LondonGrammar_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/4/18/130417LondonGrammar/130417LondonGrammar.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/4/18/130417LondonGrammar_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/4/18/130417LondonGrammar-720.mp4\"></source>\n      </video><p>Frequently, all this coalesces into oddly hummable tunes that have already been adopted by fans as angsty anthems. Strong and <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/londongrammar/wasting-my-young-years-official-video-music-video/2006128/\" title=\"\">Wasting My Young Years</a> are tonight's tours de force, with the emphasis on \"force\": the crowd relate to these diary-style outpourings of early-20s uncertainty, but even more so because they're driven by Reid's most impassioned delivery. Promising? You could say so.</p><p>• Did you catch this gig – or any other recently?

        "body":"<p>“Do a deer, a female deer, Re a drop of golden sun” etc … is used in the Solf&egrave;ge method to teach pitch, but you all probably knew that.</p> <p>While each note has a homophone, la does not – it is merely a note to follow so. Perhaps, as Douglas Adams wrote, Hammerstein thought he would have another look at it later, but could not come up with anything better; a bit like some of the lyrics listened to this weekend.</p> <p>So, la. How is it used to such good effect in songs?</p> <p>It must be its versatility: an intro, an outro, a euphemism, a rising crescendo, sometimes that’s all there is to the song. More often than not it's the earworm that hooks you and makes the tune unforgettable.</p> <p>Let me take you on a journey through the word's different uses.&nbsp;Cultured las were in use in the early 19th century and are much in evidence in the invigorating-yet-difficult baritone aria <strong>Largo al factotum</strong> from Rossini’s Il Barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville). It doesn’t matter that it’s sung in Italian, it’s memorable, not least for the las.</p> <p>One operatic number in an A-list is probably enough for any Guru, but let’s maintain the energy with <strong>For the Girl</strong>. This lively tune has plenty of las from the outset. Is it about a certain RRer, per chance? She’s into the Stones!</p> <p>That’s got the blood flowing, so <strong>Let's Go Dancing</strong> with Kool and the Gang, oooh la, la, la! As it’s reggae dancing we'll invite Inner Circle along. Bet they'll make us <strong>Sweat</strong>!&nbsp;“I'm looking in your eyes, I'm looking in your big brown eyes.” What is it about all those brown-eyed girls and la songs; unfortunately Van’s was zedded but Roxette's isn’t; she’s got <strong>The Look</strong>!</p> <p>La can be preceded by and often followed by a nonsense word. The Small Faces keep the flow of the story of young love by interspersing each line with a <strong>Sha-la-la-la-lee</strong>, whereas Prefab Sprout’s <strong>King of Rock'N'Roll</strong> hasn’t just got las, there are hot dogs and jumping frogs!</p> <p>Tra-la-la, twiddly-dee-dee imitates a bird's call on<strong> Mockin' Bird Hill</strong>, which is actually based on a Finnish waltz (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AESyqiP8sTI\">Livet i Finnskogarna</a>). I wonder whether that same bird is accompanying Minnie Riperton, who uses las and dos to such wonderful effect on the gorgeous <strong>Lovin' You</strong>.</p> <p>It’s easy to memorise every word of a song when it’s full of las. This old melody from the Carpenters still sounds good to me. It must be <strong>Yesterday Once More</strong>.</p> <p>I’ve heard so many la songs this weekend that I just <strong>can't get them out of my head</strong>&nbsp;– nor the videos. Thanks, Kylie.</p> <p>If you've enjoyed your ride, sing along with me – la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

        "body":"<p> <a href=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F114680132%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-QC2iR\">Reading on mobile? Listen here</a><br />31-year-old Los Angeleno Lawrence Rothman makes twisted R&amp;B, drenched in an unsettling baritone, inspired by everything from the writings of Charles Bukowski to Cindy Sherman photographs to house music. He's also the first signing to music video director and artist Floria Sigismondi's record label, Mamaroma. Given he has directed oddly unsettling videos for the likes of David Bowie, the White Stripes and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypkv0HeUvTc\">Marilyn Manson</a>, it's hardly surprising Sigismondi was drawn to Rothman's music. In fact, she liked his first single Montauk Fling so much she directed its <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjqHYxDuspY#t=73\">creepy video</a>, which features a troupe of glamorous women doing exercises at Chateau Marmont in LA. For his new single, Fatal Attraction – premiered here – Rothman focuses on his voice's higher register, delivering almost wordless wails for the chorus as simple piano lines and chunky drum claps echo around him. \"I wrote and recorded the song on a beat-up piano that apparently was once owned by Harry Houdini, in a friend's studio at like 4am, after being up for a marathon 32 hours dealing with the grind of life,\" he explains. \"When writing the lyrics I was thinking about how everyone if their honest with themselves, are most attracted to the people that treat them like shit. It's encoded in the human design to love what is fatal.\" Thankfully, it's a bit cheerier than all that sounds.<br /><br />Lawrence Rothman plays his first UK show at the Sebright Arms in London on 29 October.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420028881|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|7645eaa9ded96f32d02361161e6ef4527d0913d0 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Hello, Mr Bennett, sir. Tony feels insufficiently reverential. What do people call you? </strong></p><p>Tony.</p><p><strong>How was China? <a href=\"#1\">(1)</a></strong></p><p>Oh, I loved it. It was so different, so educational. In Singapore, for instance, as the plane lands they say: \"If you're coming into this country with any drugs, the penalty is death.\"</p><p><strong>That's a pretty stern warning.</strong></p><p>Well, I think it [legalising of drugs] should be done everywhere. It eliminates the underworld.</p><p><strong>If they had been legal in the 70s, would that have affected your experiences with drugs? <a href=\"#2\">(2)</a></strong></p><p>As a young boy I did a lot of foolish things. I made a lot of mistakes. And you live and learn. I'm very content now. I'm just being a normal human being.</p><p><strong>It's been 50 years since you won your first Grammy, for </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZzEXhlhfg\" title=\"\"><strong>I Left My Heart in San Francisco</strong></a><strong>. Ella Fitzgerald and Ray Charles were there at the ceremony …</strong></p><p>That was one of the first times the Grammys were on – since then I've received 17 Grammys. I love it because it's the only time the music world has a convention, and you meet everyone that you know and love.</p><p><strong>You must have mixed with them all.</strong></p><p>I lived for 15 years in Los Angeles and I still can't believe that the handsomest man in the world, Cary Grant, and the greatest performer in the world, Fred Astaire, and Johnny Carson, one after another – they were all in my home at different times. I celebrated my 50th birthday with them. Unforgettable.</p><p><strong>Did any of them do anything in your home that you've had to keep secret?</strong></p><p>No. But once Dean Martin was in his home, having this mad party, and he was trying to study his lines for a television show so he called up the police and said: \"I'm Dean Martin's neighbour and there's too much noise coming from his house. Have the police come and slow down the party.\" And the police came and broke the party up and he got rid of everybody in the house.</p><p><strong>Someone once wrote: \"Sinatra was hip, but Tony was cool.\"</strong></p><p>I never heard that. I thought he was pretty cool. He was 10 years older than I was and he was my idol, and when he announced that I was his favourite singer, it made all of his fans come and check me out. I've been sold out ever since.</p><p><strong>Were you nervous when you first met him?</strong></p><p>Yeah. I respected him so much. I respected Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. Those were my heroes, and they were 10 years older than I was. To this day, I can't believe I got to meet Ella personally. Nat Cole was a great friend, and Sinatra endorsed me throughout his whole life.</p><p><strong>In terms of the development of 20th-century music: Sinatra or Presley?</strong></p><p>You can't compare them. Presley is country music, white music. Jazz is black music – it was invented by the blacks in New Orleans. And I'm really a jazz singer. I was impressed with Elvis – he was the handsomest guy I ever met in my life, and a very nice person, too. But the music doesn't impress me.</p><p><strong>How does Amy Winehouse <a href=\"#3\">(3)</a> compare to the Ellas and Lena Hornes and Billie Holidays?</strong></p><p>You can't compare, but she was an authentic jazz singer, which is tremendous because jazz has been underrated. There's still so much bigotry.</p><p><strong>You were once invited to go and sing in Harlem with Billie Holiday, but didn't go ... </strong></p><p>It was one night when she asked me to come up and sing with her and I was with a group of people at a table, and they looked at me as if to say: \"Don't go up to Harlem, it's not safe there.\" And it was very bigoted. I regret it to this day that I didn't go.</p><p><strong>Is it true you were so moved by Charlie Parker the first time you saw him play live, you threw up?</strong></p><p>Yeah, I regurgitated. It was so phenomenal, so emphatic … It was more music than I ever heard anyone play at one time. I just couldn't believe how great it was.</p><p><strong>Do you think subsequent generations might have had that response to Jimi Hendrix or Kurt Cobain?</strong></p><p>It's a different thing. You have to understand, Charlie Parker, that music lasts for ever. It's like Louis Armstrong – some of the records he made with different orchestras, the orchestras sound old-fashioned but Louis sounds like today, right now. Classical trumpet players in symphonic orchestras would listen to him and say, \"How did he do that?\" and try to learn how to play like him.</p><p><strong>Who else has had that effect?</strong></p><p>As an entertainer, I think Jimmy Durante <strong> <a href=\"#4\">(4)</a></strong>. He was better than anybody. He tried to make people feel good. I like that. I could have retired 20 years ago, but I didn't because I like to make people feel good.</p><p><strong>For a fun night out, Judy Garland or Lady Gaga?</strong></p><p>Both of them are good. Lady Gaga is the Picasso of the entertainment world. She's very intelligent.</p><p><strong>You're known as a natty dresser. But do you ever pop out in jeans and an old cardie?</strong></p><p>I was honoured last year as the Best Dressed Man in Britain <strong><a href=\"#5\">(5)</a></strong>. It was quite a compliment. I have relaxed clothes, but people don't see me in them. <a href=\"https://tonybennett.com/benedetto_arts.php\" title=\"\">I'm a painter</a>, I have a studio and it can be messy so I wear a smock.</p><p><strong>If you went out for a pint of milk in that smock probably nobody would recognise you.</strong></p><p>I wouldn't do that. People who do that are ridiculous. My mum taught me as a child, even though we were very poor, she said: \"Put on a nice clean white shirt and nice black pants and you'll be OK.\"</p><p><strong>Which would be more painful to give up: singing or painting?</strong></p><p>Both of them. If something happened with me physically, I would still love to spend the rest of my life painting. I've never worked a day in my life. People don't believe that, but it's true. I love what I'm doing because I'm doing the two things I love. I never felt in my whole life like, \"I don't feel like doing that today\". I wake up and I can't wait to paint and I can't wait to learn something about music.</p><p><strong>How many presidents have you met?</strong></p><p>I think about 13. No, 10. I didn't sing for Nixon, I was in Europe at the time and had to pass on the invitation.</p><p><strong>Who was the most impressive?</strong></p><p>President Clinton. You could walk up to him with your hands in your pocket and say,:\"Hi, Bill.\" You don't say \"Mr President\", you don't bow. He's a regular person.</p><p><strong>You once described your experience in the second world war as \"a front seat in hell\".</strong></p><p>It's legalised murder. I'm anti-war. Life is more beautiful than that. Guys who create wars should get their hands slapped.</p><p><strong>Did you have a difficult childhood?</strong></p><p>Yeah, we grew up during the Depression. My mother worked a penny a dress to put food on the table for her three children because my father died when I was very young. It was very tough.</p><p><strong>How do you keep up with your wife, by the way? I've read that she's variously 33 and 40 years younger than you …</strong> <strong><a href=\"#6\">(6)</a></strong></p><p>We get along beautifully. We started schools all over America, we now have 17 where we support the performing arts <strong><a href=\"#7\">(7)</a></strong>. She's a magnificent person and I love everything about her.</p><p><strong>She must keep you young.</strong></p><p>She can't! I'm 87!</p><p><em>Sony Music releases The Classics on 18 November. </em></p><h2>Footnotes</h2><p><a name=\"1\">(1)</a> He has just, age 87, been performing in <a href=\"http://www.shanghaidaily.com/Feature/ideal/Tony-Bennett-to-make-China-debut-in-Shanghai/shdaily.shtml\" title=\"\">Shanghai</a></p><p><a name=\"2\">(2)</a> Bennett <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/262178/Drugs-nearly-killed-me-admits-crooner-Tony-Bennett\" title=\"\">nearly died</a> from drug abuse in the late 70s</p><p><a name=\"3\">(3)</a> Just before Winehouse's death, she and Bennett recorded a duet together</p><p><a name=\"4\">(4)</a> The Schnoz died in January 1980</p><p><a name=\"5\">(5)</a> Bennett was one of GQ's Men of the Year in 2008</p><p><a name=\"6\">(6)</a> Susan Crow was born in 1966, although <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8734663/Young-at-heart-Tony-Bennett-at-85.html\" title=\"\">some sources</a> say she is 53-4</p><p><a name=\"7\">(7)</a> He founded the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in 2001</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420250286|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|210a86f52c2f9eadcc4ed40ff2d6e758a2a7d93e -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Hello, Mr Bennett, sir. Tony feels insufficiently reverential. What do people call you? </strong></p><p>Tony.</p><p><strong>How was China? <a href=\"#1\">(1)</a></strong></p><p>Oh, I loved it. It was so different, so educational. In Singapore, for instance, as the plane lands they say: \"If you're coming into this country with any drugs, the penalty is death.\"</p><p><strong>That's a pretty stern warning.</strong></p><p>Well, I think it [legalising of drugs] should be done everywhere. It eliminates the underworld.</p><p><strong>If they had been legal in the 70s, would that have affected your experiences with drugs? <a href=\"#2\">(2)</a></strong></p><p>As a young boy I did a lot of foolish things. I made a lot of mistakes. And you live and learn. I'm very content now. I'm just being a normal human being.</p><p><strong>It's been 50 years since you won your first Grammy, for </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKZzEXhlhfg\" title=\"\"><strong>I Left My Heart in San Francisco</strong></a><strong>. Ella Fitzgerald and Ray Charles were there at the ceremony …</strong></p><p>That was one of the first times the Grammys were on – since then I've received 17 Grammys. I love it because it's the only time the music world has a convention, and you meet everyone that you know and love.</p><p><strong>You must have mixed with them all.</strong></p><p>I lived for 15 years in Los Angeles and I still can't believe that the handsomest man in the world, Cary Grant, and the greatest performer in the world, Fred Astaire, and Johnny Carson, one after another – they were all in my home at different times. I celebrated my 50th birthday with them. Unforgettable.</p><p><strong>Did any of them do anything in your home that you've had to keep secret?</strong></p><p>No. But once Dean Martin was in his home, having this mad party, and he was trying to study his lines for a television show so he called up the police and said: \"I'm Dean Martin's neighbour and there's too much noise coming from his house. Have the police come and slow down the party.\" And the police came and broke the party up and he got rid of everybody in the house.</p><p><strong>Someone once wrote: \"Sinatra was hip, but Tony was cool.\"</strong></p><p>I never heard that. I thought he was pretty cool. He was 10 years older than I was and he was my idol, and when he announced that I was his favourite singer, it made all of his fans come and check me out. I've been sold out ever since.</p><p><strong>Were you nervous when you first met him?</strong></p><p>Yeah. I respected him so much. I respected Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. Those were my heroes, and they were 10 years older than I was. To this day, I can't believe I got to meet Ella personally. Nat Cole was a great friend, and Sinatra endorsed me throughout his whole life.</p><p><strong>In terms of the development of 20th-century music: Sinatra or Presley?</strong></p><p>You can't compare them. Presley is country music, white music. Jazz is black music – it was invented by the blacks in New Orleans. And I'm really a jazz singer. I was impressed with Elvis – he was the handsomest guy I ever met in my life, and a very nice person, too. But the music doesn't impress me.</p><p><strong>How does Amy Winehouse <a href=\"#3\">(3)</a> compare to the Ellas and Lena Hornes and Billie Holidays?</strong></p><p>You can't compare, but she was an authentic jazz singer, which is tremendous because jazz has been underrated. There's still so much bigotry.</p><p><strong>You were once invited to go and sing in Harlem with Billie Holiday, but didn't go ... </strong></p><p>It was one night when she asked me to come up and sing with her and I was with a group of people at a table, and they looked at me as if to say: \"Don't go up to Harlem, it's not safe there.\" And it was very bigoted. I regret it to this day that I didn't go.</p><p><strong>Is it true you were so moved by Charlie Parker the first time you saw him play live, you threw up?</strong></p><p>Yeah, I regurgitated. It was so phenomenal, so emphatic … It was more music than I ever heard anyone play at one time. I just couldn't believe how great it was.</p><p><strong>Do you think subsequent generations might have had that response to Jimi Hendrix or Kurt Cobain?</strong></p><p>It's a different thing. You have to understand, Charlie Parker, that music lasts for ever. It's like Louis Armstrong – some of the records he made with different orchestras, the orchestras sound old-fashioned but Louis sounds like today, right now. Classical trumpet players in symphonic orchestras would listen to him and say, \"How did he do that?\" and try to learn how to play like him.</p><p><strong>Who else has had that effect?</strong></p><p>As an entertainer, I think Jimmy Durante <strong> <a href=\"#4\">(4)</a></strong>. He was better than anybody. He tried to make people feel good. I like that. I could have retired 20 years ago, but I didn't because I like to make people feel good.</p><p><strong>For a fun night out, Judy Garland or Lady Gaga?</strong></p><p>Both of them are good. Lady Gaga is the Picasso of the entertainment world. She's very intelligent.</p><p><strong>You're known as a natty dresser. But do you ever pop out in jeans and an old cardie?</strong></p><p>I was honoured last year as the Best Dressed Man in Britain <strong><a href=\"#5\">(5)</a></strong>. It was quite a compliment. I have relaxed clothes, but people don't see me in them. <a href=\"https://tonybennett.com/benedetto_arts.php\" title=\"\">I'm a painter</a>, I have a studio and it can be messy so I wear a smock.</p><p><strong>If you went out for a pint of milk in that smock probably nobody would recognise you.</strong></p><p>I wouldn't do that. People who do that are ridiculous. My mum taught me as a child, even though we were very poor, she said: \"Put on a nice clean white shirt and nice black pants and you'll be OK.\"</p><p><strong>Which would be more painful to give up: singing or painting?</strong></p><p>Both of them. If something happened with me physically, I would still love to spend the rest of my life painting. I've never worked a day in my life. People don't believe that, but it's true. I love what I'm doing because I'm doing the two things I love. I never felt in my whole life like, \"I don't feel like doing that today\". I wake up and I can't wait to paint and I can't wait to learn something about music.</p><p><strong>How many presidents have you met?</strong></p><p>I think about 13. No, 10. I didn't sing for Nixon, I was in Europe at the time and had to pass on the invitation.</p><p><strong>Who was the most impressive?</strong></p><p>President Clinton. You could walk up to him with your hands in your pocket and say,:\"Hi, Bill.\" You don't say \"Mr President\", you don't bow. He's a regular person.</p><p><strong>You once described your experience in the second world war as \"a front seat in hell\".</strong></p><p>It's legalised murder. I'm anti-war. Life is more beautiful than that. Guys who create wars should get their hands slapped.</p><p><strong>Did you have a difficult childhood?</strong></p><p>Yeah, we grew up during the Depression. My mother worked a penny a dress to put food on the table for her three children because my father died when I was very young. It was very tough.</p><p><strong>How do you keep up with your wife, by the way? I've read that she's variously 33 and 40 years younger than you …</strong> <strong><a href=\"#6\">(6)</a></strong></p><p>We get along beautifully. We started schools all over America, we now have 17 where we support the performing arts <strong><a href=\"#7\">(7)</a></strong>. She's a magnificent person and I love everything about her.</p><p><strong>She must keep you young.</strong></p><p>She can't!

        "headline":"Katy Perry: Prism – review",
        "body":"<p>Katy Perry's fourth studio album arrives heralded by both an online video in which the singer symbolically burns a blue wig – like the one she wore on&nbsp;stage during the world tour during which her brief marriage to Russell Brand collapsed – and <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5740580/katy-perrys-prism-the-billboard-cover-story\" title=\"\">a lengthy cover feature in Billboard magazine</a>, the bible of the US music business. The latter enumerates Perry's impressive commercial achievements. She has had&nbsp;nine US No 1 singles since 2008 – five of them came from her last album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/22/katy-perry-teenage-dream-review\" title=\"\">Teenage Dream</a>, equalling a record set&nbsp;by Michael Jackson's Bad – and somehow contrived to launch three perfumes in as many years, some blessed with names that signify something other than what they were perhaps intended to: \"What's that smell?\" \"It's Katy Perry's Miaow.\"</p><p>And then, the Billboard feature lets fly with a bombshell. Teenage Dream's follow-up was inspired by the work of <a href=\"http://www.eckharttolle.com\" title=\"\">Eckhart Tolle</a>, author of A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose, Stillness Speaks: Whispers of Now, and Guardians of Being: Spiritual Teachings from Our Cats and Dogs. As a result of Tolle's influence, avers Billboard, Prism is \"Katy Perry's most spiritual album to date\", a direction coyly hinted at by the opaquely titled bonus track Spiritual.</p><p>Katy Perry's most spiritual album to date: is it possible to read those words without feeling your buttocks involuntarily clench? For one thing, spirituality has always proved a difficult topic for rock and pop to address. It's certainly inspired a few moments of transcendent wonder, but they're outweighed by yards of runny, new-age philosophising, or worse, self-righteous hectoring: Bob Dylan's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXwKL1iM96g\" title=\"\">Property of Jesus</a>, the smug preachiness of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EEibpkXHRM\" title=\"\">George Harrison's 70s oeuvre</a>. And if the Beatles and Dylan couldn't address man's quest for&nbsp;greater meaning without making you want to throw litter at them, what&nbsp;price the author of Dressing Up (\"You wanna pet my kitty? You're such a dirty doggie\") and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10YmixzFSDw\" title=\"\">Ur So Gay</a>?</p><p>Of course, there are those who would point out that being the most spiritual Katy Perry album to date is a bit like being the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jw7yk8hm_0\" title=\"\">Dimmu Borgir</a> album most suited to use in a Zumba fitness class: it isn't really saying much, given the context. Those people are swiftly proved correct. Perry's description of tabla-heavy Legendary Lovers as a song that \"has a bit of curry in it\" should alert us to the fact that hers is not perhaps a wholehearted immersion in the mysticism of the east, or indeed anywhere else. And so it proves: the lyrics graft a load of new-age buzzwords – third eye, karma, mantra – on to a song about having it off. It sets the lyrical tone for the rest of the album, which seems noticeably less concerned with man's quest for greater meaning than it does with pointing out that (a) Russell Brand is a bit of a rum character – the closing power ballad By the Grace of God claims he dumped Perry via text&nbsp;message, leaving her suicidally depressed – and (b) Perry is now at it non-stop with her current inamorato, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/john-mayer\" title=\"\">John Mayer</a>, a relationship hymned at length in This Moment, Love Me and Double Rainbow. There's doubtless someone out there who's mortally offended by the fact that Katy Perry appears to be wearing spirituality in much the same way as she once wore two giant rotating peppermint swirl sweets over her bosoms – perhaps <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rakhi-kumar/michelle-obama-beyonce_b_3120434.html\" title=\"\">that&nbsp;Huffington Post columnist</a> who gamely tried to encourage fans of the&nbsp;\"demonic\" Beyoncé to abandon her in favour of a lady who performs reggae versions of the Hare Krishna mantra – but for anyone else, it comes as a small mercy.</p><p>And if Prism doesn't tell you much about Katy Perry's spiritual journey, it&nbsp;does tell you something about the pecking order of pop music. So many Scandinavian hit factories were involved in its writing that the credits look like IFK Göteborg's first-team squad: Åhlund, Lidehäll, Hermansen, Gottwald. They're the people who write virtually every major pop album these days, but that doesn't mean they always come up with the same stuff. Nothing on Prism is exactly sonically adventurous – the big idea seems to be mimicking early-90s pop-house, hence the jangling piano riff of Walking on Air, or Birthday, which vaguely resembles a four-to-the-floor remix of a Mariah Carey track – but the melodies are significantly stronger than those a similar cast of writers came up with for, say, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/19/jessie-j-alive-review\" title=\"\">Jessie J's recent album</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8\" title=\"\">The single Roar</a> is ruthlessly efficient in its bid to get the drunk and recently dumped member of the girls' night out party up on the table, using her WKD bottle as a microphone, and the rest of the album follows suit: if the ballads are standard issue, the faintly trap-inspired <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9S-88WxPdE\" title=\"\">Dark Horse</a> sounds like a hit single, as does Birthday and, for better or worse, the new jack swing parody This Is How We Do. When the latter achieves omnipresence on the radio, and its chorus takes up adverse possession of your cerebrum, you can always console yourself with the thought of what Prism might have been like had Katy Perry actually meant all that stuff about Eckhart Tolle.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420159167|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|d5c78a0f7181bc8fae886b684b22aecfa9ade61f -->",

But not too much – I want to keep the mystery, the enigma,\" he said.</p><p>Lyndsey Wilson and her daughter Jordan Reid had driven through the night from Manchester to take an early flight from Stansted. Lyndsey met Jordan's father at a Smiths gig, and Jordan went to her first concert in the womb.</p><p>\"To be honest we weren't best pleased when we found out he was launching the book here,\" said Lyndsey. \"But if he had done it in Manchester it would have been even more difficult to see him, and cost more money, because there would have been thousands of people, we'd have had to have taken several days off work to queue.\"</p><p>Both were irked at media sniping at Morrissey and Penguin over the book. \"I love how he always pisses people off,\" Jordan said.</p><p>Hugo, 24, a train conductor from Gothenburg, said Morrissey's decision to launch his book in the city was to do with it's lively indie music scene and it's working class, industrial culture - rather like Manchester. \"It's all doom and gloom here,\" he said. \"And rain.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Gothenburg gears up for Morrissey's only European book signing later today <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MorrisseyAutobiography&amp;src=hash\">#MorrisseyAutobiography</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/5iJv060pNt\">pic.twitter.com/5iJv060pNt</a></p><p>&mdash; David Crouch (@davidgcrouch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidgcrouch/statuses/390760111666638848\">October 17, 2013</a></p></blockquote><p>Morrissey fansite <a href=\"http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_131003_01\">True To You</a>, which broke the news that a \"last minute disagreement\" with Penguin had initially delayed publication of the book, announced the signing on Wednesday. </p><p>A statement said: \"No additional book signings are planned.\"</p><p>In the book, Morrissey <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/morrissey-describes-first-relationship\">describes his first serious relationship</a> and claims he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/morrissey-auobiography-10-things-we-learned\">once almost kidnapped</a> in Mexico.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420238676|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|eb15be817bac619a06db3cd0cfa84ef79593b421 -->",

        "headline":"Morrissey: 10 things we learned from Autobiography",
        "body":"<h2>Morrissey was a teenage athlete</h2><p>Although his schooldays were deeply unhappy, the teenage Morrissey found himself an unlikely sportsman. \"By accident I am enlisted to represent the school in track events for the 100 metres and the 400 metres for which, unthinkably, I receive schoolboy medals.\" And so begins a period in which \"I am obliged to feel honoured and to dream of the 14-second dash, or the one-minute 400.\"</p><h2>Morrissey made his first TV appearance in a period drama</h2><p>Stumbling accidentally on to the Coronation Street set as a teenager, Morrissey found himself accosted by a woman bearing a bundle of scripts. On learning that he can, indeed, handle a bicycle well she issues an instruction: \"We need a boy for Saturday. It's a 7am start, no dialogue.\" And so Morrissey makes a brief appearance – \"even if you don't blink at all you will miss me\" – in The Stars Look Down, set in \"the frozen north of 1913\". He is but a spot on the horizon – \"a punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate\".</p><h2><br />Morrissey's first female crush was … a man</h2><p>\"Jerry Nolan on <a href=\"http://superradnow.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/new_york_dolls_-_1973_new_york_dolls.jpg\">the cover of the [New York] Dolls' debut album</a> is the first woman I ever fell in love with; the hussy-slut positioning of the legs is playmate call-girl, and the pink drum kit might be a rock'n'roll first.\"</p><h2>Morrissey and the soaps were made for each other</h2><p>Young and hardly gainfully employed, Morrissey wrote to Granada TV, suggesting he be employed as a writer on Corrie. \"I am invited to submit a script, and I whip off a word-slinger's delight wherein young take on old as a jukebox is tested in the Rovers' Return.\" Sadly, he is told his talents lie elsewhere. Many years later, however, the soaps come for him, when he is offered roles on Emmerdale and EastEnders, as Dot Cotton's \"so far unmentioned\" son. \"I would arrive unexpectedly in Albert Square and cause births, deaths and factory fires every time I opened my mouth\". As Morrissey observes: \"The most fascinating aspect of both offers is that somebody somewhere thought it a good idea.\" And that's without even considering the startling fact he was offered a cameo on Friends during a visit to filming of the sitcom.</p><h2>For all his anger at Mike Joyce, Morrissey praises the Smiths' rhythm section</h2><p>Though the lawsuit brought by Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke forever soured Morrissey's relationship with his former bandmates, he is effusive about their talents as the Smiths honed their craft. \"The Smiths' sound rockets with meteroic progression: bomb-burst drumming, explosive chords, combative basslines, and over it all I am as free as a hawk to paint the canvas as I wish. It is a gift from Jesus.\"</p><h2>Sandie Shaw may have been one Morrissey's idols, but that changed</h2><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bbZLll3Vdo\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p><p>Morrissey was delighted when Sandie Shaw agreed to sing Hand in Glove, less delighted with subsequent events. \"Ugh,\" was his reaction when she told him: \"Twenty-seven in the charts might be great for you, but it's not good enough for me.\" And her failure to treat the band \"to dinner, or even a bottle of stale ale\" is regarded as poor recompense for taking 40% of the cut from her recording of the Smiths' debut single.</p><h2>Nick Kent asked to join the Smiths</h2><p>After Johnny Marr left the band, the remaining three considered recruiting another guitarist. And one who asked to be considered was the veteran rock writer. \"I am not a good self-salesman,\" he wrote to Morrissey, \"but I can confidently boast an encyclopaedic knowledge of the chord structures, dynamics etc of Johnny's contributions to date … Being musically associated with your very good self would signify the very apex of my crusade for immortality.\"</p><h2>After the release of Margaret on the Guillotine, Morrissey was questioned by the police</h2><p>Special Branch summoned Morrissey in the wake of his 1988 album Viva Hate, featuring <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsq3H_6XuFA\">Margaret on the Guillotine</a>, \"so that they might gauge whether or not I pose a security threat to Margaret Thatcher\". The meeting is civil, the singer's autograph is given, and after an hour he is sent away and the matter is ended.</p><h2>The Krays were persecuted</h2><p>Morrissey believes the East End gangster bosses were targeted by the authorities for being \"working class and far too formidable\". Their sin was not running a gangland empire, but that \"their empire promised no financial gain for the government\". They were, he states, \"unfairly locked away for the rest of their lives\".</p><h2>He was the victim of a kidnap attempt</h2><p>Morrissey believes Mexican kidnappers targeted him after a show in Tijuana in September 2007, when his driver veers from the highway down a dark road – 20 minutes after having promised they were four minutes from the US border. He and his security guard, fortunately, are able to leave the car, which leaves them in the middle of nowhere.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420211234|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|ef6f854499c337a85c3d0034500dab9542f9a2c6 -->",

When he met Jake Owen Walters, he writes, \"for the first time in my life the eternal 'I' becomes 'we', as, finally, I can get on with someone\".</p><p>Morrissey writes movingly about the two-year relationship. \"Jake and I neither sought not needed company other than our own for the whirlwind stretch to come,\" he writes. \"Indulgently Jake and I test how far each of us can go before 'being dwelt in' causes cries of intolerable struggle, but our closeness transcends such visitations.\"</p><p>Morrissey never specifies whether they were lovers, but talks of sharing hotel suites, of being photographed with his head \"resting on Jake's exposed belly\", and of Jake bringing him tea in the bath. </p><p>He also recounts an exchange at an airport. \"'Well,' says the woman in the British Airways lounge, 'you're either very close brothers or lovers.' 'Can't brothers be lovers?' I imprudently reply – always ready with the pointlessly pert, whether sensible or not.\"</p><p>The ending of the relationship is described in a way that could hardly be more Morrissey – with a visit to his home by Alan Bennett, who observes the pair and says: \"Now, now. What's going on? Something's happened, hasn't it? … You haven't spoken a word to each other since I arrived.\"</p><p>Although Autobiography never specifically addresses Morrissey's sexuality, he talks about his lack of interest in girls as a teenager. \"Girls remained mysteriously attracted to me,\" he writes, \"and I had no idea why, since although each fumbling foray hit the target, nothing electrifying took place, and I turned a thousand corners without caring … Far more exciting were the array of stylish racing bikes that my father would bring home.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420208795|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|b33b39301882d2fc61de97dbc156708ba109b6ed -->",

        "headline":"Want to get Daft Punk's Get Lucky? Give the vinyl a few more spins on the turntable",
        "body":"<p>Earlier this year, I wrote about trying to make sense of the <a href=\"http://hiddentracks.org/its-not-actually-a-disco-album-per-se-daft-punk-notes-from-a-small-backlash-2013\">early reaction to Daft Punk's Random Access Memories</a> when it became available to stream on iTunes a week ahead of release. After three weeks of living with Get Lucky, the consensus among about two-thirds of the first people who heard it was that, well, it could have done with a few more Get Luckys. What seemed striking was that they didn't seem to consider that some songs might require a bit of application from the listener. And yet, I would say that at least half of my 100 favourite albums revealed their charms gradually, over repeated listens. I bought <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pentangle\">Pentangle</a>'s Sweet Child when I was 17. It sat in my collection for about eight years, receiving only the occasional play, before I suddenly realised that this might be one of my favourite records of all time. It seemed to me that streaming Random Access Memories free and ahead of its official release might have backfired. By making it just another option on an endless try-before-you-buy taster menu, Columbia Records might have done the album a disservice.</p><p>How could this anticlimax have been circumvented? One suggestion I made was releasing the vinyl version one or two weeks ahead of a digital. It prompted a shitstorm of responses, mainly from people who assumed that I think vinyl is superior, and that the people who buy their music on vinyl are superior human beings.  They're not, but on the whole they are different. If you're wedded to a format that sets you back approximately £20 an album, it stands to reason that you'll work harder to justify the purchase. Two weeks of online chatter from people gradually realising that there was actually room in their lives for Wall-E's post-Studio 54 comedown opus would have created far more anticipation than the few hundred people who impulsively tweeted their first impressions on hearing what came out of their laptop speakers.</p><p>As it turned out, enough people heard something in Get Lucky to persuade them that Random Access Memories might be enjoyed most on vinyl. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/uk-vinyl-sales-daft-punk-david-bowie\">Figures released by the music industry organisation BPI</a> revealed a 100% increase in vinyl sales across 2013 so far, with the Daft Punk album topping the list. In the general scheme of things, vinyl is still very much a minority format. A 100% spike in sales only barely nudges total sales past the 500,000 mark. But if you're an artist who happens to do well in vinyl sales – albums by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Boards of Canada were among the 10 best-selling vinyl releases in 2013 – your relatively few sales will almost certainly eclipse several years of Spotify spoils. The upswing in vinyl sales is sometimes put down to the idea that music sounds warmer on vinyl or to the notion that holding a record sleeve and placing its contents on a turntable offers a more well-rounded aesthetic experience than a CD. To be honest, I'm not sure about \"warmth\". But sometimes – if playing, say, an original seven-inch of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8782KIj_rKw\">Let's Hang on by the Four Seasons</a> on a 60s Sanyo portable record player, and hearing how a 45 year-old speaker can barely contain the music's volume – it seems to make it all the more exciting. On the other hand, listening to a CD of John Renbourn singing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9fiaeKGrts\" title=\"\">I Know My Babe</a> by hooking up a set of Harman Kardon speakers to my computer provides a hushed, foetal intimacy that's no less lovely.</p><p>Perhaps arguing for the warmth of vinyl is simply a matter of trying to justify a pleasure that's sometimes hard to articulate. Everything but the Girl musician and sometime Buzzin' Fly label boss <a href=\"http://www.buzzinfly.com/comments/miles-showell-july-2012.html\" title=\"\">Ben Watt interviewed Abbey Road mastering engineer Miles Showell</a> to get an empirical measure of the merits of vinyl and digital formats. Showell contended that vinyl's superior fidelity was only discernible \"if the record was (i) cut well at the mastering stage, (ii) processed and pressed well at the factory, which is the really hard part, (iii) then kept clean and stored in ideal conditions and (iv), finally, played on a decent turntable with a very well-engineered tone arm fitted with a good and correctly aligned cartridge that, in turn, has a clean and undamaged stylus, all of which needs to feed a high quality RIAA vinyl disc pre-amplifier\".</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCBJ8BVy49w&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Reading on mobile?

Neither, I would venture, have most people who prefer to listen to music on vinyl. So what do I prefer? I enjoy going to a record shop when I am not altogether sure what I'm after. I prefer hearing and falling hard for something blasting out of the shop speakers that, on closer listening, turns out to be by an artist I didn't think I liked that much. Last month, in the west London outpost of Rough Trade, that happened to me with the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/15/arctic-monkeys-live-roundhouse\" title=\"\">Arctic Monkeys</a> album. I prefer the anticipation of  judging how it sounds in my kitchen. If it's a record I haven't listened to before I bought it – as happened with music by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/may/02/new-music-lloyd-cole-period-piece\" title=\"\">Lloyd Cole </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/10/parquet-courts-light-up-review\" title=\"\">Parquet Courts</a> on the same visit to Rough Trade – I like that we'll have to make an effort to get along. I can't just dismiss it and go on to the next thing. More than anything, I think that's what these new BPI figures tell us. The resurgence of vinyl is the closest music consumption has come to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/04/slow-food-carlo-petrini\" title=\"\">slow food movement</a>. My misgivings about Spotify aren't entirely predicated on the pittance of money that trickles down to music makers. If it was, I would stop buying second-hand records because their creators wouldn't make a penny from my purchase. Spotify merely formalises on a global scale the decline in how much people are prepared to pay for music.</p><p>We don't like it when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world\" title=\"\">artists such as David Byrne</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/spotify-thom-yorke-dying-corpse\" title=\"\">Thom Yorke</a> talk about the royalties generated by Spotify. It's somehow unbecoming of our favourite artists to discuss money. But, obvious as that may seem, payment is intrinsic to our concept of worth. And that has ramifications for the listener as well as the artist. It stands to reason that you'll work harder to get value out of something for which you paid an appreciable amount of money. That Marc Jacobs coat you paid £300 for? You might try and shed half a stone to fit back into it. But that raincoat from TK Maxx, well, the incentive isn't as great. The growth of vinyl and the rise of streaming are driven by the same forces. Both provide something that the other, by its very nature, simply can't. The pleasure you get from an experience is often proportionate to how much time and effort you expend. The carrier bag on the bus home. The expectation. The way it looks and feels. Even the way it smells. And that's before you even place it on the turntable. As New Radicals put it: \"<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/22717276\" title=\"\">Can't forget/ You only get what you give</a>.\" It's a shame that song never came out on vinyl.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420241396|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|c72f8129df9fdf85e18f2289621a8597cc715cb6 -->",

        "body":"<p>“Do a deer, a female deer, Re a drop of golden sun” etc … is used in the Solf&egrave;ge method to teach pitch, but you all probably knew that.</p> <p>While each note has a homophone, la does not – it is merely a note to follow so. Perhaps, as Douglas Adams wrote, Hammerstein thought he would have another look at it later, but could not come up with anything better; a bit like some of the lyrics listened to this weekend.</p> <p>So, la. How is it used to such good effect in songs?</p> <p>It must be its versatility: an intro, an outro, a euphemism, a rising crescendo, sometimes that’s all there is to the song. More often than not it's the earworm that hooks you and makes the tune unforgettable.</p> <p>Let me take you on a journey through the word's different uses.&nbsp;Cultured las were in use in the early 19th century and are much in evidence in the invigorating-yet-difficult baritone aria <strong>Largo al factotum</strong> from Rossini’s Il Barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville). It doesn’t matter that it’s sung in Italian, it’s memorable, not least for the las.</p> <p>One operatic number in an A-list is probably enough for any Guru, but let’s maintain the energy with <strong>For the Girl</strong>. This lively tune has plenty of las from the outset. Is it about a certain RRer, per chance? She’s into the Stones!</p> <p>That’s got the blood flowing, so <strong>Let's Go Dancing</strong> with Kool and the Gang, oooh la, la, la! As it’s reggae dancing we'll invite Inner Circle along. Bet they'll make us <strong>Sweat</strong>!&nbsp;“I'm looking in your eyes, I'm looking in your big brown eyes.” What is it about all those brown-eyed girls and la songs; unfortunately Van’s was zedded but Roxette's isn’t; she’s got <strong>The Look</strong>!</p> <p>La can be preceded by and often followed by a nonsense word. The Small Faces keep the flow of the story of young love by interspersing each line with a <strong>Sha-la-la-la-lee</strong>, whereas Prefab Sprout’s <strong>King of Rock'N'Roll</strong> hasn’t just got las, there are hot dogs and jumping frogs!</p> <p>Tra-la-la, twiddly-dee-dee imitates a bird's call on<strong> Mockin' Bird Hill</strong>, which is actually based on a Finnish waltz (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AESyqiP8sTI\">Livet i Finnskogarna</a>). I wonder whether that same bird is accompanying Minnie Riperton, who uses las and dos to such wonderful effect on the gorgeous <strong>Lovin' You</strong>.</p> <p>It’s easy to memorise every word of a song when it’s full of las. This old melody from the Carpenters still sounds good to me. It must be <strong>Yesterday Once More</strong>.</p> <p>I’ve heard so many la songs this weekend that I just <strong>can't get them out of my head</strong>&nbsp;– nor the videos. Thanks, Kylie.</p> <p>If you've enjoyed your ride, sing along with me – la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Ooh, we seemed to have picked up an extra <strong>Passenger</strong>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hamKl-su8PE\">Kaiser Chiefs – I Predict a Riot</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxMEWCigy2Q\">Rossini – Largo al factotum</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdRsi8x4hAk\">The Fratellis – For the Girl</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWuoGZAz94c\">Kool and the Gang – Let's Go Dancing (Ooooh la, la,la)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc2UEfWjvo8\">Inner Circle – Sweat (A la, la)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlVI7ZNiFlI\">Roxette – The Look</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swqr5Upm6QA\">Small Faces – Sha la la la lee</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T6e3GJCjow\">Prefab Sprout – King of Rock'N'Roll</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHkVCn1RzBE\">Migil 5 – Mockin' Bird Hill</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE0pwJ5PMDg\">Minnie Riperton – Lovin' You</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfTnf4AiN4Y\">The Carpenters – Yesterday Once More</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c18441Eh_WE\">Kylie Minogue – Can't Get You Out of My Head</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEY6_jcrzI8\">Iggy Pop – Passenger</a></p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjjJcJNDIhapKbnn8wnYpUpB1Vizp4vKy&amp;feature=mh_lolz\"> <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&amp;list=PLjjJcJNDIhapKbnn8wnYpUpB1Vizp4vKy\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLjjJcJNDIhapKbnn8wnYpUpB1Vizp4vKy&amp;v=hamKl-su8PE\">Reading on mobile?
