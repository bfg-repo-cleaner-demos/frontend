        "headline":"Iran ready to deal on nuclear programme at Geneva talks",
        "body":"<p>Iran's negotiators are expected to offer restrictions on its nuclear programme in return for at least a partial lifting of sanctions, at a new round of talks starting in Geneva on Tuesday, diplomats said.</p><p>The complexity of the proposals means a completed deal is unlikely at the end of two days of negotiations, as there will remain significant gaps between the Iranian and western negotiating positions, but diplomats pointed to a new level of engagement not seen for several years.</p><p>The Iranian foreign minister and lead negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, posted a message on his Facebook account saying the Geneva talks were &quot;the start of a difficult and relatively time-consuming way forward&quot;.</p><p>He said: &quot;I am hopeful that by Wednesday we can reach agreement on a road map to find a path towards resolution. But even with the goodwill of the other side, to reach agreement on details and start implementation will likely require another meeting at ministerial level.&quot;</p><p>The Iranian road map for the talks was described in vague terms on Friday by Zarif's deputy, Abbas Araqchi, who said Tehran would negotiate &quot;the form, amount, and various levels of [uranium] enrichment&quot; but would not agree to shipping enriched uranium out of the country.</p><p>Elements of the plan were floated in more detail during a visit to the UN in New York last month by Zarif and the newly-elected president, Hassan Rouhani, the Guardian has learned.</p><p>Iranian officials said Tehran would be prepared to limit its enrichment programme to two facilities, possibility both at Natanz, suggesting a readiness to suspend enrichment at a sensitive underground site at Fordow.</p><p>Iran is also prepared to suspend production of 20%-enriched uranium – another major concern for the international community as it is relatively straightforward to convert it into 90% weapons grade material.</p><p>Tehran will not agree to surrendering its existing stockpile of the 20% medium-enriched uranium, currently about 190kg, but compromises are possible that would make it less of a proliferation concern. It could be kept under international monitoring in a remote corner of the country, or it could be turned into reactor fuel, a form which is harder to enrich further.</p><p>Iran is also prepared to negotiate on the number of centrifuges it uses to make 3.5% enriched uranium, suitable for fuel for nuclear power stations, and on how much each centrifuge makes. Iranian officials have pointed out that, although new model centrifuges, called IR-2M, have been installed, they are not yet being fed with uranium gas for enrichment, and they pointed to that as an example of how the enrichment programme could be calibrated by international agreement.</p><p>Furthermore, the Iranians suggested that work on a heavy-water reactor at Arak, which would produce plutonium when commissioned, had been delayed since Rouhani's election and could be put off further if an interim deal was reached.</p><p>Tehran has also revived a longstanding proposal of forming a consortium with other countries to enrich uranium in Iran, as a means of reassuring the international community it would not be diverted for weapons purposes. In return, Iran would expect significant sanctions relief, and recognition that it had the right in principle to enrich uranium.</p><p>If the elements floated in New York are set out in Zarif's road map, it would represent the most substantive Iranian offer in a decade. However there would still be significant points of difference with the six nations represented at the Geneva talks: the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, chaired by the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton.</p><p>The group has demanded the underground facility at Fordow be closed down entirely as part of a confidence-building deal. Iran is likely to accept suspension of enrichment there but not permanent closure.</p><p>Similarly, western powers had called for the transfer of the total stock of 20% enriched uranium out of the country, and it is unclear whether its conversion to reactor fuel or warehousing inside Iran would satisfy Washington and its allies.</p><p>The US is also reluctant to declare Iran's right to enrich uranium openly as early in the process as Tehran would like, fearing it would set a precedent for many other nations to start building centrifuge plants of their own, multiplying the risk of global nuclear proliferation.</p><p>Lastly, there is a gaping divide between the scale of sanctions relief Iran is demanding, involving the lifting of oil and financial embargoes, and the much more limited concessions offered by the west, covering aircraft parts, gold and petrochemical exports.</p><p>Iran observers, however, are hopeful that creative diplomacy at Geneva can help close some of those gaps.</p><p>&quot;The Iranians are confident. They have a game plan and they are looking to execute that plan,&quot; said Jim Walsh, an expert on the Iranian nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>&quot;They are aware of the political sensitivities in the US. They get it, but they have sensitivities of their own and their clock is ticking for them to produce some results. They are ready for a small deal. Not a grand bargain, but a small deal.</p><p>Our concern on the American side is do we have our act together. I still don't have the answer to that question.&quot;</p><p>The Obama administration's room for negotiation is limited by what Congress would accept which in turn is influenced partly by Israel's position. Israel has warned of the dangers of the P5+1 talks in Geneva producing a &quot;bad agreement&quot; along the lines of those signed with North Korea, which did not prevent Pyongyang developing nuclear weapons.</p><p>As part of the diplomatic and media offensive launched by the Israeli government ahead of this week's talks in Geneva, intelligence and strategic affairs minister Yuval Steinitz told foreign journalists: &quot;We have to learn from history, and the mistakes of history, and be very clear that not every agreement is a genuine political achievement.&quot; He stressed that Israel had not &quot;closed the door to a diplomatic solution&quot; to the Iranian nuclear issue, &quot;on condition that it is a satisfactory solution&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We do hope this process will succeed, that there will be a satisfactory diplomatic solution. We hope that we will not repeat the terrible mistakes of North Korea. This is our hope and we should all do our best to ensure that Geneva 2013 will not become Munich 1938,&quot; he said, referring to the pre-second world war agreement regarded as an act of appeasement by European powers to Nazi Germany.</p><p>In contrast to the agreements made with North Korea, the minister cited Libya as a successful model. &quot;This agreement was about dismantling nuclear capacity, destroying centrifuges and giving up enrichment facilities,&quot; he said.</p><p>In contrast to previous statements made by Israeli leaders, Steinitz played down the necessity of a credible military threat against Iran, instead warning against the premature lifting of economic sanctions. &quot;The economic pressure [on Iran] is very significant. The greater the pressure, the greater the chance of diplomacy to succeed. The Iranians are coming to the table because of severe economic pressure.&quot;</p><p>Sanctions must not be eased before a final satisfactory solution, he added. &quot;A credible military threat would increase the chances of success but maybe you can succeed without that.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;rational and logical&quot; outcome of the Geneva talks was to allow Iran to produce nuclear power for civilian use, using fuel bought from abroad, as Canada, South Africa, Sweden and other countries do, he said. &quot;This is a win-win situation – Iran gets what it says it wants, and the rest of the world is confident they are not producing nuclear weapons.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419944233|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|5db001c73beab025b80b71355803ed155523b2c6 -->",

        "headline":"Iran refuses to ship out uranium stockpiles but hopes rise of breakthrough",
        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>Iran has said  it would not allow any of its enriched uranium stockpile to be shipped abroad, but could sanction other curbs on its nuclear programme  to reassure the international community, it is not interested in building a bomb.</p><p>The statement, the clearest outline of Iran's negotiating position since the election in June of President Hassan Rouhani, was delivered as an Iranian negotiating team prepared to fly out for nuclear talks in Geneva on Tuesday, with hopes of a breakthrough at their highest point in four years. A senior member of the team, the deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, told Iranian state television: \"Of course we will negotiate regarding the form, amount, and various levels of [uranium] enrichment, but the shipping of materials out of the country is our red line.\"</p><p>In earlier rounds of nuclear negotiations, a group of six major powers had suggested a confidence-building measure by which Iran would stop producing 20%-enriched uranium – the main proliferation concern – ship out its stockpile and shut down its underground enrichment plant at Fordow, in exchange for limited sanctions relief, on trade in gold, precious metals and petrochemicals.</p><p>The 20% enriched uranium is seen as a particular worry because it could relatively easily and quickly be turned into weapons-grade uranium (90% enriched and above – the percentages refer to the concentration of the highly fissile isotope, U-235). Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu has said that Iran's accumulation of enough 20% uranium to make a bomb – about 250kg – would trigger a military response. The Iranian stockpile is currently about 190kg.</p><p>However, a refusal to ship this medium-enriched uranium out of the country will not necessarily be a deal-breaker in Geneva. In previous discussions, the option has been floated of keeping it under surveillance by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a remote part of Iran such as the island of Kish. Furthermore, the clear statement from Araqchi that his country was willing to accept curbs on its future enrichment activities will be seen as encouraging by the diplomats arriving in Switzerland from the six-nation group: the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. The group is chaired by the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton.</p><p>After positive talks at the UN general assembly last month, Ashton asked Iran to send its proposals early so a response could be prepared before this week's two-day talks. But the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who will lead the delegation to Geneva, said on his English-language Twitter account on Friday: \"We will present our views, as agreed, in Geneva, not before. No Rush, No Speculations Please (of course if you can help it!!!)\"</p><p>Four years ago in Geneva, Iran struck a tentative agreement to stop 20% enrichment, but the deal was later rejected by conservatives in Tehran and ultimately by the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei.</p><p>However, an Iranian official said President Rouhani was in a much stronger political position in Tehran than his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was locked in a long-running power struggle with Khamenei.</p><p>\"Rouhani has the full backing of the Supreme Leader, but not only that. He is respected as a veteran of the [1980s] war with Iraq, by the military and the Revolutionary Guards,\" the official said. \"People feel that Rouhani has always been with us. With Ahmadinejad they didn't feel that way. They didn't know where he had come from.\"</p><p>The official said that the Rouhani government was confident a deal could be done. When asked whether Iran would be prepared to accept strict curbs on its enrichment programme and more stringent IAEA inspections in return for sanctions relief and the recognition of Iran's right to enrich uranium in principle, the Iranian official nodded. But he added: \"Everything depends on how this is done, the sequencing. Rouhani and Zarif has to be able to show he is gaining something for Iran - that this is not a trick.\"</p><p></p><p>William Luers, a veteran US diplomat who runs the Iran Project advocating reconciliation with Tehran, said: \"I get the impression from talking to both Zarif and Rouhani&nbsp;… that they have made a decision that they want to open up their economy to the world again, and are prepared to do substantial things to make that happen. And they will say: 'We want to know what you will do in terms of sanctions relief.'\"If progress is made at the talks, the impasse between Congress and President Barack Obama could become a significant obstacle as most US sanctions have been imposed by Congress and would require congressional approval to be limited permanently. However, European officials point out that Obama has the power to suspend US sanctions and that the EU could independently lift its oil embargo and financial sanctions if it was thought necessary to maintain momentum towards a comprehensive deal.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419834199|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|2e96056f2885e050af4870df33377dcbe8491a4c -->",

        "body":"<p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said on Sunday the window for diplomacy with Iran over its nuclear programme was \"cracking open\", but added that \"no deal is better than a bad deal\".</p><p>Kerry made the comments in a speech made via satellite from London to a foreign policy conference in California staged by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying organisation in the US. The State Department released excerpts of Kerry's prepared remarks.</p><p>Also on Sunday, Kerry and the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, held talks on Iran, Syria, Egypt, the Middle East peace process and other matters.</p><p>The focus on Iran's nuclear programme comes before the start of negotiations between the Islamic Republic and the five permanent UN security council members and Germany, which are set for Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva.</p><p>Earlier on Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/13/iran-uranium-stockpiles-nuclear-talks\">Iran said it would not allow any of its enriched uranium stockpile to be shipped abroad</a>, but said it could sanction other curbs on its nuclear programme in order to reassure the international community that it is not interested in building a bomb.</p><p>\"Right now, the window for diplomacy is cracking open. But I want you to know that our eyes are open, too,\" Kerry said in his remarks to Aipac. Israel views a nuclear-armed Iran as a threat to its existence. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.</p><p>\"While we seek a peaceful resolution to Iran's nuclear programme, words must be matched with actions,\" said Kerry. \"In any engagement with Iran, we are mindful of Israel's security needs. We are mindful of the need for certainty, transparency, and accountability in the process. And I believe firmly that no deal is better than a bad deal.\"</p><p>International penalties over Iran's nuclear programme have damaged Iran's economy, and Iran wants to ease them in exchange for some concessions. The West contends Iran is trying to make a nuclear weapon. Tehran says its programme is for peaceful purposes.</p><p>Kerry and Ashton also discussed efforts to organise an international peace conference aimed at achieving a political transition in war-torn Syria. The State Department said Kerry's session with Ashton was \"very productive\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419848863|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|940df56848ec5dba7da9ce61c16951c10cc5e4a8 -->",

        "headline":"Iran ready to deal on nuclear programme at Geneva talks",
        "body":"<p>Iran's negotiators are expected to offer restrictions on its nuclear programme in return for at least a partial lifting of sanctions, at a new round of talks starting in Geneva on Tuesday, diplomats said.</p><p>The complexity of the proposals means a completed deal is unlikely at the end of two days of negotiations, as there will remain significant gaps between the Iranian and western negotiating positions, but diplomats pointed to a new level of engagement not seen for several years.</p><p>The Iranian foreign minister and lead negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, posted a message on his Facebook account saying the Geneva talks were &quot;the start of a difficult and relatively time-consuming way forward&quot;.</p><p>He said: &quot;I am hopeful that by Wednesday we can reach agreement on a road map to find a path towards resolution. But even with the goodwill of the other side, to reach agreement on details and start implementation will likely require another meeting at ministerial level.&quot;</p><p>The Iranian road map for the talks was described in vague terms on Friday by Zarif's deputy, Abbas Araqchi, who said Tehran would negotiate &quot;the form, amount, and various levels of [uranium] enrichment&quot; but would not agree to shipping enriched uranium out of the country.</p><p>Elements of the plan were floated in more detail during a visit to the UN in New York last month by Zarif and the newly-elected president, Hassan Rouhani, the Guardian has learned.</p><p>Iranian officials said Tehran would be prepared to limit its enrichment programme to two facilities, possibility both at Natanz, suggesting a readiness to suspend enrichment at a sensitive underground site at Fordow.</p><p>Iran is also prepared to suspend production of 20%-enriched uranium – another major concern for the international community as it is relatively straightforward to convert it into 90% weapons grade material.</p><p>Tehran will not agree to surrendering its existing stockpile of the 20% medium-enriched uranium, currently about 190kg, but compromises are possible that would make it less of a proliferation concern. It could be kept under international monitoring in a remote corner of the country, or it could be turned into reactor fuel, a form which is harder to enrich further.</p><p>Iran is also prepared to negotiate on the number of centrifuges it uses to make 3.5% enriched uranium, suitable for fuel for nuclear power stations, and on how much each centrifuge makes. Iranian officials have pointed out that, although new model centrifuges, called IR-2M, have been installed, they are not yet being fed with uranium gas for enrichment, and they pointed to that as an example of how the enrichment programme could be calibrated by international agreement.</p><p>Furthermore, the Iranians suggested that work on a heavy-water reactor at Arak, which would produce plutonium when commissioned, had been delayed since Rouhani's election and could be put off further if an interim deal was reached.</p><p>Tehran has also revived a longstanding proposal of forming a consortium with other countries to enrich uranium in Iran, as a means of reassuring the international community it would not be diverted for weapons purposes. In return, Iran would expect significant sanctions relief, and recognition that it had the right in principle to enrich uranium.</p><p>If the elements floated in New York are set out in Zarif's road map, it would represent the most substantive Iranian offer in a decade. However there would still be significant points of difference with the six nations represented at the Geneva talks: the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China, chaired by the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton.</p><p>The group has demanded the underground facility at Fordow be closed down entirely as part of a confidence-building deal. Iran is likely to accept suspension of enrichment there but not permanent closure.</p><p>Similarly, western powers had called for the transfer of the total stock of 20% enriched uranium out of the country, and it is unclear whether its conversion to reactor fuel or warehousing inside Iran would satisfy Washington and its allies.</p><p>The US is also reluctant to declare Iran's right to enrich uranium openly as early in the process as Tehran would like, fearing it would set a precedent for many other nations to start building centrifuge plants of their own, multiplying the risk of global nuclear proliferation.</p><p>Lastly, there is a gaping divide between the scale of sanctions relief Iran is demanding, involving the lifting of oil and financial embargoes, and the much more limited concessions offered by the west, covering aircraft parts, gold and petrochemical exports.</p><p>Iran observers, however, are hopeful that creative diplomacy at Geneva can help close some of those gaps.</p><p>&quot;The Iranians are confident. They have a game plan and they are looking to execute that plan,&quot; said Jim Walsh, an expert on the Iranian nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>&quot;They are aware of the political sensitivities in the US. They get it, but they have sensitivities of their own and their clock is ticking for them to produce some results. They are ready for a small deal. Not a grand bargain, but a small deal.</p><p>Our concern on the American side is do we have our act together. I still don't have the answer to that question.&quot;</p><p>The Obama administration's room for negotiation is limited by what Congress would accept which in turn is influenced partly by Israel's position. Israel has warned of the dangers of the P5+1 talks in Geneva producing a &quot;bad agreement&quot; along the lines of those signed with North Korea, which did not prevent Pyongyang developing nuclear weapons.</p><p>As part of the diplomatic and media offensive launched by the Israeli government ahead of this week's talks in Geneva, intelligence and strategic affairs minister Yuval Steinitz told foreign journalists: &quot;We have to learn from history, and the mistakes of history, and be very clear that not every agreement is a genuine political achievement.&quot; He stressed that Israel had not &quot;closed the door to a diplomatic solution&quot; to the Iranian nuclear issue, &quot;on condition that it is a satisfactory solution&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We do hope this process will succeed, that there will be a satisfactory diplomatic solution. We hope that we will not repeat the terrible mistakes of North Korea. This is our hope and we should all do our best to ensure that Geneva 2013 will not become Munich 1938,&quot; he said, referring to the pre-second world war agreement regarded as an act of appeasement by European powers to Nazi Germany.</p><p>In contrast to the agreements made with North Korea, the minister cited Libya as a successful model. &quot;This agreement was about dismantling nuclear capacity, destroying centrifuges and giving up enrichment facilities,&quot; he said.</p><p>In contrast to previous statements made by Israeli leaders, Steinitz played down the necessity of a credible military threat against Iran, instead warning against the premature lifting of economic sanctions. &quot;The economic pressure [on Iran] is very significant. The greater the pressure, the greater the chance of diplomacy to succeed. The Iranians are coming to the table because of severe economic pressure.&quot;</p><p>Sanctions must not be eased before a final satisfactory solution, he added. &quot;A credible military threat would increase the chances of success but maybe you can succeed without that.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;rational and logical&quot; outcome of the Geneva talks was to allow Iran to produce nuclear power for civilian use, using fuel bought from abroad, as Canada, South Africa, Sweden and other countries do, he said. &quot;This is a win-win situation – Iran gets what it says it wants, and the rest of the world is confident they are not producing nuclear weapons.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419944233|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|5db001c73beab025b80b71355803ed155523b2c6 -->",

A new reformist Iranian government under President Hassan Rouhani with a new mandate has sent a delegation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/14/iran-ready-nuclear-programme-geneva-talks\">with a set of concrete proposals</a> on how curbs on the nuclear programme could be exchanged for sanctions relief.</p><p>Mohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister, flew to Geneva despite intense back pain which forced him to spend most of the fligh lying down. Zarif has said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/iran-foreign-minister-hospital-misquote\">hardliner attacks triggered</a> the spasms that have hobbled him since he returned to Tehran from meeting US secretary of state John Kerry at the UN last month. </p><p>This morning, Zarif presented a PowerPoint presentation entitled \"Closing an unnecessary crisis: Opening new horizons\", at the start of a new round of talks - the first substantive nuclear negotiations since Hassan Rouhani's election in June. Zarif's talk was in English, a contrast from his predecessor as chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, who spoke Farsi almost exclusively.  One of the consequences is that the pace of talks, without the need for interpreters, is much faster.  There is less to translate too. Zarif is much more concise speaker.</p><p>The PowerPoint presentation took nearly an hour and then there was another hour of discussion before the first session broke up and the six nation group of negotiators (from the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China), chaired by the EU foreign policy chief, Cathy Ashton, dispersed to study the Iranian proposals.</p><p>Zarif left for his hotel without talking to reporters, saying only: \"I'm really in pain.\"  The twinges in his back were apparently not the only reminder of the pressures back home. According to one Iranian report, the delegation got an urgent phone call from Tehran just before the talks began, demanding a last-minute change to the Iranian presentation. </p><p>Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann, said the talks began with \"cautious optimism and great sense of determination, because we think it is time for tangible results.\"</p><p>A senior US official said that the goal in Geneva was progress towards  confidence-building measures that would slow down the Iranian nuclear programme to buy time for a more enduring solution. The official said:</p><blockquote><p>To get to a comprehensive agreement is very, very difficult with highly technical issues that have to be resolved.  We need to put some time on the clock to rebuild trust...to constrain the programme and even take it back a notch.</p></blockquote><p>The US official pointed out that the American delegation included two financial experts to discuss changes to the sanctions regime, so that a quick deal was feasible. </p><p>\"If they are ready to go, we are ready to go,\" the official said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419988180|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|290e28ad39d61aac84bac4a0f4e541d907c739e3 -->",

        "headline":"We cannot verify and must not trust Iran's promises on nuclear weapons",
        "body":"<p>Tuesday's opening of yet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/14/iran-ready-nuclear-programme-geneva-talks\">another round of negotiations</a> with Iran over its nuclear-weapons program creates enormous risks for America's anti-proliferation efforts. Tehran's extensive propaganda campaign, stressing the \"moderation\" of its new president, Hassan Rouhani, seems to be working, softening up the gullible in the United States and Europe.</p><p>As in previous iterations of the charade now reopening in Geneva, Iran's bargaining position benefits from our own repeated mistakes. The ayatollahs need only take advantage of these unforced errors, and success may well fall into their undeserving hands. Consider the most blatant errors that Iran is eager to exploit.</p><p>First, both <a href=\"http://www.irantracker.org/us-policy/us-policy-toward-irans-nuclear-program\">Presidents Bush and Obama</a> conceded that Iran was entitled to a \"peaceful\" nuclear program, for energy and scientific purposes. Under the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/NPT.shtml\">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> (NPT), however, that view is flatly wrong. By pursuing nuclear weapons for over two decades, Iran has violated key NPT provisions – notably, the obligation it freely undertook to be a non-nuclear weapons state. Tehran is not, therefore, entitled to claim benefits under NPT sections permitting peaceful uses of nuclear power.</p><p>Beyond treaty interpretation, <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2012/05/22/dont-forget-irans-record-of-deception/\">Iran's long record</a> of ignoring its commitments and lying about its nuclear program demonstrates beyond dispute that it cannot be trusted. What conceivable reason exists to believe today's pledge to abstain from nuclear weapons when the ayatollahs have violated so many previous pledges? Only if credibility counts for nothing would Iran's likely upcoming \"commitment\" hold any weight.</p><p>Second, by allowing Iran to possess any uranium enrichment, nuclear reactors, or spent nuclear fuel reprocessing capabilities, the west will both legitimize Iran's nuclear program and ensure that it can move to weaponization at a time entirely of its choosing. President Obama's negotiators <a href=\"http://rt.com/news/iran-uranium-enrichment-compromise-209/\">conceded</a> last year that Iran could enrich uranium to reactor-grade levels, so long as it didn't enrich to higher levels. But reactor-grade enrichment levels already take Iran nearly 70% of the way to weapons-grade enrichment. \"Stopping\" enrichment above standard reactor-grade levels saves, at best, a few weeks of enrichment effort.   By misunderstanding the physics of uranium enrichment, the Obama administration has made a mockery of itself.</p><p>Third, the White House retort that international inspections will prevent Iran from speedily moving to weaponization is a complete fiction. Given the broad, deep <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/exiled-dissidents-claim-iran-building-new-nuclear-site-1.1378783\">nuclear infrastructure Iran is building</a> aggressively, Tehran need merely expel the International Atomic Energy Agency when it chooses to do so, and then move rapidly to weaponization. North Korea expelled the IAEA ten years ago, and Iran will calculate it can do so, too.</p><p>Even with the IAEA in-country, Iran's large territory and mountainous topography will greatly facilitate concealing its ongoing nuclear activities. Mineral \"mines\", for example, can easily hide nuclear-related work; or Iran could build facilities elsewhere, such as North Korea, with which it has co-operated for over 15 years on ballistic-missile programs. </p><p>Fourth, what Iran really wants near-term, and what the west seems poised to give, is relief from international economic sanctions. Although these measures have caused Iran economic pain, there is no evidence they have impeded the nuclear program. Obama's director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, so testified earlier this year, and the IAEA has repeatedly reaffirmed that Iran's <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/28/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSBRE97R0LZ20130828\">nuclear program continues to grow</a> at alarming rates.</p><p>While America and Europe insist they will demand reciprocal concessions for any weakening of the sanctions, Iran (with its backers, Russia and China) is bargaining from a position of strength. The ayatollahs sense from Obama's desperate efforts for a handshake or phone call with Rouhani at September's UN opening that he is hungry for a deal, thus allowing them to extract concession from the west before making even a superficial response.</p><p>Our negotiators are already talking about \"sequencing\" steps by the two sides – meaning, in reality, we will make the first concessions, hoping that Iran will make substantive concession later. In fact, the likely scenario is the exact opposite: Obama will make significant reductions in sanctions that will be very hard to restore subsequently, and Iran will give us blue smoke and mirrors. Even worse, these non-reciprocal episodes could continue at length, giving Tehran another precious resource, time, to continue building its nuclear facilities.</p><p>There is a theoretical case that economic sanctions might, at some point in the past, have been sufficient to bring Iran's nuclear efforts to a halt. Our <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1997/06/a-users-guide-to-economic-sanctions\">historical experience</a>, however, demonstrates that economic restrictions must meet several preconditions before they can achieve any significant geopolitical objective. To be effective, sanctions must be sweeping and comprehensive; swiftly and unhesitatingly applied; and widely complied with or rigorously (that is, militarily) enforced. None of these criteria has met in the case of Iran.</p><p>Sanctions have been applied sporadically, in a piecemeal fashion, have had only intermittent and ineffective enforcement, and often have been flatly disregarded by Iran's champions, including Russia and China. Accordingly, therefore, even if the current sanctions were continued or tightened – highly unlikely in present circumstances – they would prove insufficient.</p><p>We have only two very unpleasant choices: either Iran gets nuclear weapons in the very near future, or pre-emptive military force, fully justified by well-established principles of self-defense, must break Iran's control over the nuclear fuel cycle and prevent (or, at least, substantially delay) weaponization. President Obama has said repeatedly that \"<a href=\"http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/03/20/obama-all-options-are-on-the-table-with-iran/\">all options are on the table</a>\", the standard euphemism for military action. But, especially after Syria, no one believes him, the ayatollahs in Tehran, most notably.</p><p>By default that leaves Israel, which is watching today's negotiations <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/world/middleeast/israel-warns-against-easing-sanctions-on-iran.html?_r=0\">most uneasily</a>.</p><p>The fact is we shouldn't trust and can't verify Iranian promises not to fabricate nuclear weapons. Indeed, even now, Washington really doesn't know how quickly Iran could assemble a small number of nuclear weapons. But a crash program has never really been Tehran's objective. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/iran-wants-the-bomb--and-sanctions-relief/2013/10/11/201f0734-31e7-11e3-9c68-1cf643210300_story.html\">Iran is playing a much longer game that the west</a>, largely because it fears neither our sanctions nor a possible military strike.</p><p>Our inability to see through this strategy has brought us grief time and again. Unfortunately, in Geneva, we may be watching a re-run.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419946619|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|6034a07c408a0266977ee337e01be52898eedc82 -->",

        "headline":"Iran presents 'timetable' to end nuclear talks deadlock",
        "body":"<p>The Iranian delegation to international talks in Geneva has presented proposals which it claims will end the longstanding deadlock over its nuclear programme.</p><p>Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, gave an hour-long PowerPoint presentation of the proposals, entitled \"Closing an unnecessary crisis: Opening new horizons\", to senior diplomats from the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China at the Palace of Nations in Geneva on Tuesday.</p><p>The presentation was not made public, but it is believed to lay out a timetable for a confidence-building deal that would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/29/iran-open-nuclear-negotiations-javad-zarif\" title=\"\">place limits on Iran's nuclear programme</a> in return for relief from sanctions and international recognition of the country's right to enrich uranium.</p><p>The presentation marked the opening gambit in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2013/oct/15/iran-obama-administration\" title=\"\">the first round of negotiations</a> between the new Iranian government of President Hassan Rouhani and the six-nation negotiating group chaired by the EU foreign policy chief, Lady Ashton. All sides have described the talks as the most constructive for years.</p><p>Unlike previous negotiations, the two days of talks are being carried out in English, as Zarif and his deputy, <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/05/12/303033/new-foreign-ministry-spokesman-appointed/\" title=\"\">Abbas Araqchi</a>, are fluent, so they moved at at least twice the speed, without the need for interpreters.</p><p>Speaking to reporters after the presentation, Araqchi said: \"We believe our proposal has the capacity to make a breakthrough.\"</p><p>He said the Iranian plan set out a timeline of six months to get to a deal and that Iran hoped the next step, a new round of talks on the details of a deal, would take place within a month.</p><p>Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann, said: \"We heard a presentation this morning from foreign minister Zarif. It was very useful. Talks are reconvening this afternoon to look at further details.\"</p><p>However, immediately after the morning session of talks, Zarif went straight to his hotel because of a backache, telling reporters he was in too much pain to talk. He has claimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/iran-foreign-minister-hospital-misquote\" title=\"\">the condition</a> was brought on by attacks from the conservative press in Tehran, which he said had misquoted him as saying the recent thaw with the US was a mistake. The continuing twinges forced Zarif to lie down for much of the flight from Tehran, on which he brought a doctor to help keep the pain under control.</p><p>The backache was apparently not the only reminder of the pressures back home. According to one Iranian report, Zarif's delegation received a phone call from Tehran on Tuesday morning with last-minute changes to the Iranian proposal.</p><p>Asked about the foreign minister's condition, Araqchi said: \"He's not alright at all. He is suffering a lot.\" He said Zarif had gone back to the hotel but would not leave Geneva.</p><p>The afternoon session at the Palace of Nations will be led by Araqchi on the Iranian side and the foreign ministry political directors from the six-nation group.</p><p>Speaking before the talks began, a senior US official said the aim was to make progress towards an interim confidence-building deal that would defuse tensions and buy time for a more comprehensive solution to the standoff. The official said that Araqchi's announcement days before Geneva that Iran would not contemplate shipping out enriched uranium as part of a deal was not a critical problem. \"There's a variety of ways of dealing with that,\" she said.</p><p>\"To get to a comprehensive agreement is very, very difficult with highly technical issues that have to be resolved. We are looking for a confidence-building step that will put some time on the clock,\" the official said. \"The aim is to rebuild trust&nbsp;… to constrain the programme and even take it back a notch.\"</p><p>She pointed out that the US delegation included financial experts; evidence that Washington was ready to talk about scaling down sanctions in response to Iranian concessions. \"If they are ready to go, we are ready to go,\" she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel convened its security cabinet on Monday night to discuss how to respond to the diplomacy in Geneva. It issued a statement saying: \"Now is an opportune moment to reach a genuine diplomatic solution that peacefully ends Iran's nuclear weapons programme. However, this opportunity can be realised only if the international community continues to put pressure on Iran and does not ease the sanctions prematurely.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420027829|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|3fbe74dd2c4fc4a6ad94f2303392d6055973d61c -->",
