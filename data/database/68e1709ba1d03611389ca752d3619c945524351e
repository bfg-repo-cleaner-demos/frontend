        "headline":"Cuts to home visits leave older and disabled people in the lurch",
        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>A man aged over 100 left unwashed after a visit by his care worker with no food or drink within his reach. People with dementia put to bed still in their clothes with their front doors unlocked. Another person left in the same chair all day to stare at the walls. These are just some of the shocking stories uncovered in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network\" title=\"\">survey by the Guardian and the Department of Health</a>, which exposes deep misgivings about the way care is delivered to people in their own homes.</p><p>At a time when ever-tightening resources and growing needs are putting unprecedented pressure on the way older and disabled adults are supported at home, the homecare survey published today shows that many paid care workers, and those who need their help feel shortchanged by what is on offer.</p><p>The biggest problem doesn't appear to lie with frontline care workers: some 46% of respondents reported a positive experience with individual care staff, compared with 15% who said their experience was negative. But 39% said their experience of how local authorities assessed their needs and arranged care was poor or very poor, compared with just 17% who thought it was good or very good. Two-thirds said they found it difficult to have any say over when care workers visited and what they do, and more than half (56%) found it tricky to change to a new care worker or care provider if they weren't happy. Time constraints, low pay and lack of training for frontline care staff were all key concerns highlighted by respondents. Almost three-quarters (73%)  singled out a lack of time as the major challenge for care workers tasked with making home visits.</p><p>The 1,440 people across England who participated in the survey between July and August included those who receive care in their home and their relatives as well as care workers, homecare providers, and local authority staff.</p><p>Their views paint a picture that, according to care minister Norman Lamb, \"reinforces very strongly\" the need for change. \"A lot of people clearly have faith in care workers,\" says Lamb. \"But too short visits, the turnover of staff and people not having enough training are clearly big issues.\"</p><p>Lamb, who this summer launched a homecare innovation challenge to improve the way people are cared for in their own homes, says he was particularly struck by the problems that respondents felt they experienced in trying to influence the way services are delivered. Nearly half said it was difficult to find out about the services on offer. \"It's clear that we've got so much further to go in really embedding the principle of giving power to people to make good decisions about care, to find out what's available and make decisions about who calls on them and when,\" he admits.</p><p>Many respondents employed in the sector believe it is the lack of time available for homecare visits that most needs to be addressed. Earlier this month, Leonard Cheshire Disability found that two-thirds of local councils are commissioning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/07/15-minute-care-visits-too-short-charity\" title=\"\">15-minute visits </a>for people with disabilities despite concerns that they deprive them of essential care. It is campaigning for an end to these flying care visits.</p><p>Its chief executive, Clare Pelham, says: \"This survey resonates with our experience, where quite often the feedback is that the individual care worker is lovely but they are under such time pressure that the overall experience for people receiving care is not a positive one. Everyone knows this is happening, everyone agrees that it is not acceptable, but the councils commissioning care and the government are quite consciously looking the other way.\"</p><p>Lamb believes that ending 15-minute visits is too simplistic a solution, as he says sometimes short visits were all that an individual wanted to maintain their independence. But he reveals that the government expects to see a change of approach by councils.</p><p>\"I want to give local authorities a chance to change their commissioning practices to focus on quality, but I then want to use our powers through the CQC  [Care Quality Commisssion] to check whether there has been progress in commissioning for good outcomes or whether they are still just buying short periods of time, which is an unacceptable way to buy homecare.\"</p><p>The survey, conducted to support the government's homecare innovation challenge, also highlights concerns over staff training and pay. More than half of respondents said lack of training of homecare workers was a key challenge. Two-thirds of respondents cited pay and conditions as a major issue. This comes after the  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/22/council-funding-cuts-care-homes-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">Low Pay Commission warned </a>that care providers are increasingly dodging minimum wage legislation by not paying care workers for travel time between care visits.</p><p>Homecare companies say often councils underfund the real cost of providing care. Colin Angel, policy and campaigns director at the <a href=\"http://www.ukhca.co.uk/index.aspx\" title=\"\">UK Homecare Association</a>, which represents providers from the private, voluntary and statutory sectors, says the findings show that there are increasing concerns about care being \"shoehorned\" into the shortest time  possible.</p><p>\"What really matters is that sufficient time is available to provide care by a workforce who are friendly, respectful and caring. Unless the social care system can meet these fundamentals, we should not expect people who use services, or their families, to be satisfied,\" he says.</p><p>According to Sandie Keene, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, the homecare survey underlines the need for local authorities to look hard at the services they are buying, but she adds that the harsh financial climate is having a big impact. By the end of this financial year, £2.7bn will have been axed from English councils' budgets for adult social care in the past three years.</p><p>\"There's sometimes an unreality in people's expectations and the availability of resources,\" says Keene. \"There does need to be some national recognition that you can't keep cutting local authority budgets and expecting the same or better services.\"</p><p>Lamb believes that pooling budgets through the £3.8bn NHS and social care integration fund will help maximise resources. But he says it is unrealistic to expect a big new injection of cash. \"The brutal truth is any government in power would be faced with the same existential challenge on resources. There is no easy answer – it has to be about how we make better use of the money that's available. A relentless focus on quality and results for people can absolutely have an impact.\"</p><p>He may be reassured that 69% of survey participants felt that family and friends had a greater role to play in breaking down the loneliness and isolation that older and disabled people can experience. And 82% want community organisations to be more involved in supporting older and disabled adults over the next five years.</p><p>But for many who took part in the survey, better homecare can't come too soon. As one put it: \"Good homecare should reduce admissions to hospital and residential care as well as reducing the stress on family carers. The most important criterion is that people receiving care trust their services.\"</p><p>• Take part in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2013/oct/30/live-discussion-improving-homecare\">live online debate</a> with social care minister, Norman Lamb, on 5 November</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421153377|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|b506b3fcec8b10afcd63eaacd83799d41c383992 -->",

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22435095\" title=\"\">squeeze on social care budgets</a> and increasing demographic pressures have put the homecare system under strain. A survey exploring attitudes to homecare in England, conducted by the Guardian Social Care Network and the Department of Health, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/30/homecare-cuts-home-visits-older-disabled-people\">uncovered some shocking stories of poor and unacceptable care</a>.</p><p>The survey, of care workers, homecare providers, council workers and service users and their families, revealed that many people receiving care are happy with the individuals who provide support, though more have misgivings about the homecare system as a whole. Time constraints, low pay and lack of training <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2013/oct/30/main-challenges-homecare-survey-findings\" title=\"\">were found to be the main challenges facing frontline care staff</a>. The top three most important factors in offering good homecare were identified as sufficient time for care, friendly, respectful, capable care workers and choice about services.</p><p>The survey asked for ideas about how to make the service better and respondents offered plenty of suggestions. These ranged from an online grocery shop model of booking homecare slots to local care teams in every community so that people know their care workers. Another suggestion was for care workers to have tablet devices to allow more time with the person receiving care and to share information with the family doctor or nurse if appropriate.</p><p>Join us between 12.30 and 2.30pm on Tuesday 5 November when we will discuss these ideas and explore how to improve homecare. Our expert panel will consider the findings of the survey and ask: how can we transform these ideas into practice? How can we spread great homecare across the UK? If you have a question you'd like to ask the panel, you can email it to socialcare@theguardian.com.

        "headline":"Cuts to home visits leave older and disabled people in the lurch",
        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>A man aged over 100 left unwashed after a visit by his care worker with no food or drink within his reach. People with dementia put to bed still in their clothes with their front doors unlocked. Another person left in the same chair all day to stare at the walls. These are just some of the shocking stories uncovered in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network\" title=\"\">survey by the Guardian and the Department of Health</a>, which exposes deep misgivings about the way care is delivered to people in their own homes.</p><p>At a time when ever-tightening resources and growing needs are putting unprecedented pressure on the way older and disabled adults are supported at home, the homecare survey published today shows that many paid care workers, and those who need their help feel shortchanged by what is on offer.</p><p>The biggest problem doesn't appear to lie with frontline care workers: some 46% of respondents reported a positive experience with individual care staff, compared with 15% who said their experience was negative. But 39% said their experience of how local authorities assessed their needs and arranged care was poor or very poor, compared with just 17% who thought it was good or very good. Two-thirds said they found it difficult to have any say over when care workers visited and what they do, and more than half (56%) found it tricky to change to a new care worker or care provider if they weren't happy. Time constraints, low pay and lack of training for frontline care staff were all key concerns highlighted by respondents. Almost three-quarters (73%)  singled out a lack of time as the major challenge for care workers tasked with making home visits.</p><p>The 1,440 people across England who participated in the survey between July and August included those who receive care in their home and their relatives as well as care workers, homecare providers, and local authority staff.</p><p>Their views paint a picture that, according to care minister Norman Lamb, \"reinforces very strongly\" the need for change. \"A lot of people clearly have faith in care workers,\" says Lamb. \"But too short visits, the turnover of staff and people not having enough training are clearly big issues.\"</p><p>Lamb, who this summer launched a homecare innovation challenge to improve the way people are cared for in their own homes, says he was particularly struck by the problems that respondents felt they experienced in trying to influence the way services are delivered. Nearly half said it was difficult to find out about the services on offer. \"It's clear that we've got so much further to go in really embedding the principle of giving power to people to make good decisions about care, to find out what's available and make decisions about who calls on them and when,\" he admits.</p><p>Many respondents employed in the sector believe it is the lack of time available for homecare visits that most needs to be addressed. Earlier this month, Leonard Cheshire Disability found that two-thirds of local councils are commissioning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/07/15-minute-care-visits-too-short-charity\" title=\"\">15-minute visits </a>for people with disabilities despite concerns that they deprive them of essential care. It is campaigning for an end to these flying care visits.</p><p>Its chief executive, Clare Pelham, says: \"This survey resonates with our experience, where quite often the feedback is that the individual care worker is lovely but they are under such time pressure that the overall experience for people receiving care is not a positive one. Everyone knows this is happening, everyone agrees that it is not acceptable, but the councils commissioning care and the government are quite consciously looking the other way.\"</p><p>Lamb believes that ending 15-minute visits is too simplistic a solution, as he says sometimes short visits were all that an individual wanted to maintain their independence. But he reveals that the government expects to see a change of approach by councils.</p><p>\"I want to give local authorities a chance to change their commissioning practices to focus on quality, but I then want to use our powers through the CQC  [Care Quality Commisssion] to check whether there has been progress in commissioning for good outcomes or whether they are still just buying short periods of time, which is an unacceptable way to buy homecare.\"</p><p>The survey, conducted to support the government's homecare innovation challenge, also highlights concerns over staff training and pay. More than half of respondents said lack of training of homecare workers was a key challenge. Two-thirds of respondents cited pay and conditions as a major issue. This comes after the  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/22/council-funding-cuts-care-homes-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">Low Pay Commission warned </a>that care providers are increasingly dodging minimum wage legislation by not paying care workers for travel time between care visits.</p><p>Homecare companies say often councils underfund the real cost of providing care. Colin Angel, policy and campaigns director at the <a href=\"http://www.ukhca.co.uk/index.aspx\" title=\"\">UK Homecare Association</a>, which represents providers from the private, voluntary and statutory sectors, says the findings show that there are increasing concerns about care being \"shoehorned\" into the shortest time  possible.</p><p>\"What really matters is that sufficient time is available to provide care by a workforce who are friendly, respectful and caring. Unless the social care system can meet these fundamentals, we should not expect people who use services, or their families, to be satisfied,\" he says.</p><p>According to Sandie Keene, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, the homecare survey underlines the need for local authorities to look hard at the services they are buying, but she adds that the harsh financial climate is having a big impact. By the end of this financial year, £2.7bn will have been axed from English councils' budgets for adult social care in the past three years.</p><p>\"There's sometimes an unreality in people's expectations and the availability of resources,\" says Keene. \"There does need to be some national recognition that you can't keep cutting local authority budgets and expecting the same or better services.\"</p><p>Lamb believes that pooling budgets through the £3.8bn NHS and social care integration fund will help maximise resources. But he says it is unrealistic to expect a big new injection of cash. \"The brutal truth is any government in power would be faced with the same existential challenge on resources. There is no easy answer – it has to be about how we make better use of the money that's available. A relentless focus on quality and results for people can absolutely have an impact.\"</p><p>He may be reassured that 69% of survey participants felt that family and friends had a greater role to play in breaking down the loneliness and isolation that older and disabled people can experience. And 82% want community organisations to be more involved in supporting older and disabled adults over the next five years.</p><p>But for many who took part in the survey, better homecare can't come too soon. As one put it: \"Good homecare should reduce admissions to hospital and residential care as well as reducing the stress on family carers. The most important criterion is that people receiving care trust their services.\"</p><p>• Take part in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2013/oct/30/live-discussion-improving-homecare\">live online debate</a> with social care minister, Norman Lamb, on 5 November</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421153377|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|b506b3fcec8b10afcd63eaacd83799d41c383992 -->",

        "body":"<p>Time constraints, low pay and lack of training for frontline staff are the key challenges facing care workers in England, according to a <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1383067901570/Homecare-survey-full-result.pdf\" title=\"\">survey on homecare</a>.</p><p>Some 73% of respondents to the survey, conducted by the Guardian Social Care Network and the Department of Health, cited a lack of time as the major challenge for care workers who make home visits, while 67% cited pay and conditions, and 56% said insufficient training.</p><p>More than 1,440 people took part in the survey on attitudes to homecare, including homecare providers, care workers, people who receive homecare and their friends and relatives.</p><p>The survey was carried out following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2013/jul/03/solving-problems-poor-homecare\" title=\"\">the launch of the \"homecare innovation challenge\" this summer</a>. The project aims to tackle the problems of the homecare sector and transform the service.</p><p>The top three most important factors in offering good homecare were identified as sufficient time for care (59%), friendly, respectful, capable care workers (58%) and choice about services (43%). And the main challenges facing organisations that provide care were cited as too few fully trained care workers, council commissioning and a shortage of care workers.</p><p>When asked what would improve homecare, many said improving the recruitment, training and monitoring of new and existing staff. \"Homecare needs to be seen as a skilled career rather than a job that fills the gap,\" said one respondent. Others stressed the importance of the relationship between the care worker and the person receiving homecare. One said: \"Having the same responsible and respectful person deliver the care regularly to ensure that a relationship develops between the parties so that each person values the other.\"</p><p>And another wrote: \"Allow sufficient time for people receiving care to be treated as people, not 'tasks to be done'.\"</p><p>Other suggestions involved making more information about services available. \"The problem I have experienced is that information needed regarding service providers (private, PAs, etc) is not easily accessible for those that need it, ie the clients and their families,\" one person commented.</p><p>Respondents also offered their ideas for improving homecare: \"There needs to be tighter focus on regular reviewing of clients to ensure the care agreed upon is provided,\" one wrote. Another suggested: \"Make it locality based – the smaller the catchment area the more likely to build a reputation and relationship with the local community.\"</p><p>Some 44% of homecare providers who responded to the survey said they didn't think councils worked well with others to arrange good quality homecare.</p><p>When asked about their experiences of homecare, 46% of respondents reported a positive experience with individual care staff, compared with 15% who said their experience was negative. But 39% said their experience of local authorities assessing their needs and arranging care was poor or very poor, compared with just 17% who thought it was good or very good.</p><p><em>Click </em><a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1383067901570/Homecare-survey-full-result.pdf\" title=\"\"><em>here for the full report on the survey's findings</em></a></p><p><strong>Why not join our community?
