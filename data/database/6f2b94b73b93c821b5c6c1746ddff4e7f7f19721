        "body":"<p>The senior Tory David Davis has called for a royal commission into police culture in the wake of the Plebgate row, claiming there is a \"crisis of ethics\" within the service.<br /> <br />Davis, a former shadow home secretary, said the Independent Police Complaints Commission should be beefed up to become a British \"Untouchables\", able to carry out investigations without obstruction.<br /> <br />Davis – a close ally of former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, who resigned in the wake of a row with police at the gates of Downing Street – called for officers to be forced to wear cameras and microphones when on duty to record their actions as part of an effort to address a \"decline in public trust\".</p><p>Davis's intervention comes as three officers accused of trying to discredit  Mitchell after a meeting in October last year are due to be questioned by MPs on Wednesday. </p><p>Police Federation representatives Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones will be questioned at a home affairs select committee inquiry into the row.<br /> <br />Mitchell, the MP for Sutton Coldfield, met the three officers from forces in the Midlands after he was accused of calling police guarding Downing Street \"plebs\" in a foul-mouthed rant as he was asked to cycle through a side gate on 19 September last year.<br /> <br />Writing in the Times, Davis dismissed a call from Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), for a new ombudsman, arguing that the existing regulator should be given more powers.</p><p>\"What we need is not a new regulator, but a tougher regulator. Earlier this year a parliamentary inquiry concluded that the Independent Police Complaints Commission 'has neither the powers nor the resources that it needs to get to the truth when the integrity of the police is in doubt',\" Davis said. </p><p>\"The government should respond by giving the IPCC the powers and resources to outrank and overrule every chief of police in the land – to become a British 'Untouchables'. Never again should a police force be able to delay or frustrate an IPCC investigation.\"<br /> <br />Davis said identifying problems after the event was not enough – the wider \"crisis of ethics\" needed to be addressed by a royal commission.<br /> <br />He claimed the Mitchell case was the \"latest in a long list of police investigations set up to seek the truth but conducted as clumsy cover-ups\".<br /> <br />\"Britain needs root-and-branch reform of policing culture, a feat beyond the powers of even a powerful independent regulator,\" he said.<br /> <br />\"The government should appoint a royal commission to investigate the conduct of the police. The lessons about what behaviour is expected from a British police officer should be instilled from day one.<br /> <br />\"Of course, the commission should not limit its focus to new recruits. In recent days, as the truth about Andrew Mitchell's meeting with Police Federation officials has emerged, it has been senior officers who have responded with a series of implausible denials. The mindset of the whole officer class should not be off limits.\"<br /> <br />Davis said technology such as cameras and microphones could help and their evidence could also offer police officers protection against false complaints. </p><p>\"The police put millions of innocent people under surveillance in order to catch a tiny minority of wrongdoers. Perhaps now it is time to make officers wear a camera and microphone while on duty.<br /> <br />\"When they tried this in California, use of force by police officers dropped by two-thirds in a year. This technology could also help to defend police officers who have vexatious claims made against them.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420711330|2013-10-23T16:01:39Z|14b1ecb5174ecc309545c2b281acd22d6caf0a9c -->",

        "body":"<p>Three police officers involved in the Plebgate saga have issued a limited apology, saying they showed \"poor judgment in talking to the media\" following a meeting they had with Andrew Mitchell as he battled for his political life.</p><p>Mitchell resigned from his cabinet post as chief whip, but while he fought to stay in office last year he met three Police Federation representatives who later told the media he had failed to detail what happened during his Downing Street clash with police.</p><p>Last week the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said a recording Mitchell made of the meeting proved he had in fact been candid with the officers and had admitted swearing at PCs who stopped him pushing his bike through the Downing Street gates, but denied using the word pleb.</p><p>The three officers were accused of trying to damage Mitchell by giving a misleading account, and police forces were criticised after it was decided that none of the officers should face disciplinary action.</p><p>The IPCC said there were issues of \"honesty and integrity\" over the media statements, with officers accused of trying to discredit Mitchell as part of their campaign against government cuts to police funding and reductions in the wages and conditions of some officers.</p><p>On Monday the Police Federation issued a statement on behalf of the three officers – Inspector Ken MacKaill of West Mercia police, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton of Warwickshire police and Sergeant Chris Jones of West Midlands police – in which they said: \"We acknowledge the investigation's criticism relating to our poor judgment in talking to the media following the meeting with Andrew Mitchell, for which we take this opportunity to apologise.</p><p>\"We would like to emphasise (as we did to the investigation) that in no way did any of us ever plan or intend to mislead anyone about what occurred during this meeting or otherwise.\"</p><p>Last week the IPCC said it disagreed with a decision made by the officers' forces that there was no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct.</p><p>Mitchell was forced to resign as chief whip in October last year after an official police log claimed he had called officers \"fucking plebs\" when they declined to allow him to wheel his bike through the Downing Street security gates.</p><p>Accounts from the police were leaked to two newspapers. But then CCTV emerged that appeared to contradict key claims in the police accounts. Mitchell denied calling the officers plebs.</p><p>This month prosecutors said they had received all the evidence they need to assess whether Metropolitan police officers allegedly involved in the original meeting and in leaking the logs to media outlets should face charges.</p><p>The Tory MP David Davis said on Monday: \"The statement from the three police Federation officials is simply not good enough. Their actions have destroyed a career.</p><p>\"The transcript of the meeting which took place in Sutton Coldfield shows that the federation deployed a premeditated line of attack against Mr Mitchell.</p><p>\"This is not a case of misjudgment, it is deliberate misconduct and they should face the consequences of that misconduct.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420565696|2013-10-23T16:01:39Z|06dcd5cf700badb978355551708712b4c738f440 -->",

        "body":"<p>The senior Tory David Davis has called for a royal commission into police culture in the wake of the Plebgate row, claiming there is a \"crisis of ethics\" within the service.<br /> <br />Davis, a former shadow home secretary, said the Independent Police Complaints Commission should be beefed up to become a British \"Untouchables\", able to carry out investigations without obstruction.<br /> <br />Davis – a close ally of former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, who resigned in the wake of a row with police at the gates of Downing Street – called for officers to be forced to wear cameras and microphones when on duty to record their actions as part of an effort to address a \"decline in public trust\".</p><p>Davis's intervention comes as three officers accused of trying to discredit  Mitchell after a meeting in October last year are due to be questioned by MPs on Wednesday. </p><p>Police Federation representatives Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones will be questioned at a home affairs select committee inquiry into the row.<br /> <br />Mitchell, the MP for Sutton Coldfield, met the three officers from forces in the Midlands after he was accused of calling police guarding Downing Street \"plebs\" in a foul-mouthed rant as he was asked to cycle through a side gate on 19 September last year.<br /> <br />Writing in the Times, Davis dismissed a call from Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), for a new ombudsman, arguing that the existing regulator should be given more powers.</p><p>\"What we need is not a new regulator, but a tougher regulator. Earlier this year a parliamentary inquiry concluded that the Independent Police Complaints Commission 'has neither the powers nor the resources that it needs to get to the truth when the integrity of the police is in doubt',\" Davis said. </p><p>\"The government should respond by giving the IPCC the powers and resources to outrank and overrule every chief of police in the land – to become a British 'Untouchables'. Never again should a police force be able to delay or frustrate an IPCC investigation.\"<br /> <br />Davis said identifying problems after the event was not enough – the wider \"crisis of ethics\" needed to be addressed by a royal commission.<br /> <br />He claimed the Mitchell case was the \"latest in a long list of police investigations set up to seek the truth but conducted as clumsy cover-ups\".<br /> <br />\"Britain needs root-and-branch reform of policing culture, a feat beyond the powers of even a powerful independent regulator,\" he said.<br /> <br />\"The government should appoint a royal commission to investigate the conduct of the police. The lessons about what behaviour is expected from a British police officer should be instilled from day one.<br /> <br />\"Of course, the commission should not limit its focus to new recruits. In recent days, as the truth about Andrew Mitchell's meeting with Police Federation officials has emerged, it has been senior officers who have responded with a series of implausible denials. The mindset of the whole officer class should not be off limits.\"<br /> <br />Davis said technology such as cameras and microphones could help and their evidence could also offer police officers protection against false complaints. </p><p>\"The police put millions of innocent people under surveillance in order to catch a tiny minority of wrongdoers. Perhaps now it is time to make officers wear a camera and microphone while on duty.<br /> <br />\"When they tried this in California, use of force by police officers dropped by two-thirds in a year. This technology could also help to defend police officers who have vexatious claims made against them.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420711330|2013-10-23T16:01:39Z|14b1ecb5174ecc309545c2b281acd22d6caf0a9c -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's most senior police officer has admitted the \"plebgate\" row has clouded the public view of Scotland Yard and has taken too long to deal with.</p><p>Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe also revealed  he has not spoken to former chief whip Andrew Mitchell since his confrontation with officers in Downing Street in September last year.</p><p>A row broke out over accusations that Mitchell called officers \"plebs\" during a foul-mouthed rant, something the politician has always denied.</p><p>Speaking to Nick Ferrari on LBC on Wednesday morning, the Metropolitan police commissioner  said: \"During the time this thing has been an issue, the Met has been performing better than ever. We've just got to live with the reality – the newspaper headlines, the fact that you're talking about it, clouds the fact that crime's coming down at its fastest for 30 years. This issue's got to be resolved and we've got to deal with it.\"</p><p>He added: \"We're all eager to see the outcome of this inquiry and that we get back to some kind of normality, because I think it's not good for the police and it's not good for public confidence. I'm determined to get to the bottom of it. We've got a thorough investigation and we really now have to await the outcome of that.\"</p><p>Hogan-Howe said police faced a dilemma over whether to speak to  Mitchell in person.</p><p>\"It's one of the dilemmas we have – if you talk to someone it can be seen as though you're being influenced or trying to influence someone; if you don't it can be seen as ignorant.</p><p>\"You have to be careful how much access we give to a public figure compared to somebody who lives in Croydon or Lewisham.\"</p><p>His comments came ahead of the appearance before MPs of three Police Federation members – Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones – who were accused of trying to discredit  Mitchell after meeting him in October last year in the aftermath of the Downing Street incident.</p><p>Hogan-Howe pledged to apologise if it emerges that officers have done anything wrong.</p><p>\"Of course if we've done anything wrong, I will be the first to say I'm sorry, we're sorry. Of course I would apologise if we've got things wrong.\"</p><p>Hogan-Howe insisted that the Met was trying to tackle corruption, revealing there hasd been a sharp increase in the number of officers sacked since he took the top job at Scotland Yard two years ago, and that the number of internal complaints had gone up by a quarter.</p><p>The commissioner added: \"We've now got to wait until the outcome of this investigation. I think that won't be too long, I hope, I think the file is with the Crown Prosecution Service.</p><p>\"There will then be an independent assessment by the IPCC [Independent Police Complaints Commission] together with the Met, and I think at the end of that then we have to wait and see if it finds anything.</p><p>\"If it finds that officers have either committed a crime or have carried out any misconduct you can be sure that I, as I said at the time as well, will be ruthless in getting to the bottom of it.\"</p><p>The three officers, who were representing the forces of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands, were spared misconduct proceedings by an internal investigation.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420739605|2013-10-23T16:01:39Z|5729f335e40d2ac697785acde42336e48cc0d925 -->",
