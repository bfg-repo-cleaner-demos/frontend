        "body":"<p>The senior Tory David Davis has called for a royal commission into police culture in the wake of the Plebgate row, claiming there is a \"crisis of ethics\" within the service.<br /> <br />Davis, a former shadow home secretary, said the Independent Police Complaints Commission should be beefed up to become a British \"Untouchables\", able to carry out investigations without obstruction.<br /> <br />Davis – a close ally of former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, who resigned in the wake of a row with police at the gates of Downing Street – called for officers to be forced to wear cameras and microphones when on duty to record their actions as part of an effort to address a \"decline in public trust\".</p><p>Davis's intervention comes as three officers accused of trying to discredit  Mitchell after a meeting in October last year are due to be questioned by MPs on Wednesday. </p><p>Police Federation representatives Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones will be questioned at a home affairs select committee inquiry into the row.<br /> <br />Mitchell, the MP for Sutton Coldfield, met the three officers from forces in the Midlands after he was accused of calling police guarding Downing Street \"plebs\" in a foul-mouthed rant as he was asked to cycle through a side gate on 19 September last year.<br /> <br />Writing in the Times, Davis dismissed a call from Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), for a new ombudsman, arguing that the existing regulator should be given more powers.</p><p>\"What we need is not a new regulator, but a tougher regulator. Earlier this year a parliamentary inquiry concluded that the Independent Police Complaints Commission 'has neither the powers nor the resources that it needs to get to the truth when the integrity of the police is in doubt',\" Davis said. </p><p>\"The government should respond by giving the IPCC the powers and resources to outrank and overrule every chief of police in the land – to become a British 'Untouchables'. Never again should a police force be able to delay or frustrate an IPCC investigation.\"<br /> <br />Davis said identifying problems after the event was not enough – the wider \"crisis of ethics\" needed to be addressed by a royal commission.<br /> <br />He claimed the Mitchell case was the \"latest in a long list of police investigations set up to seek the truth but conducted as clumsy cover-ups\".<br /> <br />\"Britain needs root-and-branch reform of policing culture, a feat beyond the powers of even a powerful independent regulator,\" he said.<br /> <br />\"The government should appoint a royal commission to investigate the conduct of the police. The lessons about what behaviour is expected from a British police officer should be instilled from day one.<br /> <br />\"Of course, the commission should not limit its focus to new recruits. In recent days, as the truth about Andrew Mitchell's meeting with Police Federation officials has emerged, it has been senior officers who have responded with a series of implausible denials. The mindset of the whole officer class should not be off limits.\"<br /> <br />Davis said technology such as cameras and microphones could help and their evidence could also offer police officers protection against false complaints. </p><p>\"The police put millions of innocent people under surveillance in order to catch a tiny minority of wrongdoers. Perhaps now it is time to make officers wear a camera and microphone while on duty.<br /> <br />\"When they tried this in California, use of force by police officers dropped by two-thirds in a year. This technology could also help to defend police officers who have vexatious claims made against them.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420711330|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|2c7de8e41217c354e82ee1c77932011e7ea80fe1 -->",

        "body":"<p>Three police officers involved in the Plebgate saga have issued a limited apology, saying they showed \"poor judgment in talking to the media\" following a meeting they had with Andrew Mitchell as he battled for his political life.</p><p>Mitchell resigned from his cabinet post as chief whip, but while he fought to stay in office last year he met three Police Federation representatives who later told the media he had failed to detail what happened during his Downing Street clash with police.</p><p>Last week the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said a recording Mitchell made of the meeting proved he had in fact been candid with the officers and had admitted swearing at PCs who stopped him pushing his bike through the Downing Street gates, but denied using the word pleb.</p><p>The three officers were accused of trying to damage Mitchell by giving a misleading account, and police forces were criticised after it was decided that none of the officers should face disciplinary action.</p><p>The IPCC said there were issues of \"honesty and integrity\" over the media statements, with officers accused of trying to discredit Mitchell as part of their campaign against government cuts to police funding and reductions in the wages and conditions of some officers.</p><p>On Monday the Police Federation issued a statement on behalf of the three officers – Inspector Ken MacKaill of West Mercia police, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton of Warwickshire police and Sergeant Chris Jones of West Midlands police – in which they said: \"We acknowledge the investigation's criticism relating to our poor judgment in talking to the media following the meeting with Andrew Mitchell, for which we take this opportunity to apologise.</p><p>\"We would like to emphasise (as we did to the investigation) that in no way did any of us ever plan or intend to mislead anyone about what occurred during this meeting or otherwise.\"</p><p>Last week the IPCC said it disagreed with a decision made by the officers' forces that there was no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct.</p><p>Mitchell was forced to resign as chief whip in October last year after an official police log claimed he had called officers \"fucking plebs\" when they declined to allow him to wheel his bike through the Downing Street security gates.</p><p>Accounts from the police were leaked to two newspapers. But then CCTV emerged that appeared to contradict key claims in the police accounts. Mitchell denied calling the officers plebs.</p><p>This month prosecutors said they had received all the evidence they need to assess whether Metropolitan police officers allegedly involved in the original meeting and in leaking the logs to media outlets should face charges.</p><p>The Tory MP David Davis said on Monday: \"The statement from the three police Federation officials is simply not good enough. Their actions have destroyed a career.</p><p>\"The transcript of the meeting which took place in Sutton Coldfield shows that the federation deployed a premeditated line of attack against Mr Mitchell.</p><p>\"This is not a case of misjudgment, it is deliberate misconduct and they should face the consequences of that misconduct.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420565696|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|26d1bef55a59ed21cbbf3c3cd7ec7f3d1d1884d7 -->",

        "body":"<p>The senior Tory David Davis has called for a royal commission into police culture in the wake of the Plebgate row, claiming there is a \"crisis of ethics\" within the service.<br /> <br />Davis, a former shadow home secretary, said the Independent Police Complaints Commission should be beefed up to become a British \"Untouchables\", able to carry out investigations without obstruction.<br /> <br />Davis – a close ally of former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, who resigned in the wake of a row with police at the gates of Downing Street – called for officers to be forced to wear cameras and microphones when on duty to record their actions as part of an effort to address a \"decline in public trust\".</p><p>Davis's intervention comes as three officers accused of trying to discredit  Mitchell after a meeting in October last year are due to be questioned by MPs on Wednesday. </p><p>Police Federation representatives Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones will be questioned at a home affairs select committee inquiry into the row.<br /> <br />Mitchell, the MP for Sutton Coldfield, met the three officers from forces in the Midlands after he was accused of calling police guarding Downing Street \"plebs\" in a foul-mouthed rant as he was asked to cycle through a side gate on 19 September last year.<br /> <br />Writing in the Times, Davis dismissed a call from Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), for a new ombudsman, arguing that the existing regulator should be given more powers.</p><p>\"What we need is not a new regulator, but a tougher regulator. Earlier this year a parliamentary inquiry concluded that the Independent Police Complaints Commission 'has neither the powers nor the resources that it needs to get to the truth when the integrity of the police is in doubt',\" Davis said. </p><p>\"The government should respond by giving the IPCC the powers and resources to outrank and overrule every chief of police in the land – to become a British 'Untouchables'. Never again should a police force be able to delay or frustrate an IPCC investigation.\"<br /> <br />Davis said identifying problems after the event was not enough – the wider \"crisis of ethics\" needed to be addressed by a royal commission.<br /> <br />He claimed the Mitchell case was the \"latest in a long list of police investigations set up to seek the truth but conducted as clumsy cover-ups\".<br /> <br />\"Britain needs root-and-branch reform of policing culture, a feat beyond the powers of even a powerful independent regulator,\" he said.<br /> <br />\"The government should appoint a royal commission to investigate the conduct of the police. The lessons about what behaviour is expected from a British police officer should be instilled from day one.<br /> <br />\"Of course, the commission should not limit its focus to new recruits. In recent days, as the truth about Andrew Mitchell's meeting with Police Federation officials has emerged, it has been senior officers who have responded with a series of implausible denials. The mindset of the whole officer class should not be off limits.\"<br /> <br />Davis said technology such as cameras and microphones could help and their evidence could also offer police officers protection against false complaints. </p><p>\"The police put millions of innocent people under surveillance in order to catch a tiny minority of wrongdoers. Perhaps now it is time to make officers wear a camera and microphone while on duty.<br /> <br />\"When they tried this in California, use of force by police officers dropped by two-thirds in a year. This technology could also help to defend police officers who have vexatious claims made against them.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420711330|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|2c7de8e41217c354e82ee1c77932011e7ea80fe1 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's most senior police officer has admitted the \"plebgate\" row has clouded the public view of Scotland Yard and has taken too long to deal with.</p><p>Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe also revealed  he has not spoken to former chief whip Andrew Mitchell since his confrontation with officers in Downing Street in September last year.</p><p>A row broke out over accusations that Mitchell called officers \"plebs\" during a foul-mouthed rant, something the politician has always denied.</p><p>Speaking to Nick Ferrari on LBC on Wednesday morning, the Metropolitan police commissioner  said: \"During the time this thing has been an issue, the Met has been performing better than ever. We've just got to live with the reality – the newspaper headlines, the fact that you're talking about it, clouds the fact that crime's coming down at its fastest for 30 years. This issue's got to be resolved and we've got to deal with it.\"</p><p>He added: \"We're all eager to see the outcome of this inquiry and that we get back to some kind of normality, because I think it's not good for the police and it's not good for public confidence. I'm determined to get to the bottom of it. We've got a thorough investigation and we really now have to await the outcome of that.\"</p><p>Hogan-Howe said police faced a dilemma over whether to speak to  Mitchell in person.</p><p>\"It's one of the dilemmas we have – if you talk to someone it can be seen as though you're being influenced or trying to influence someone; if you don't it can be seen as ignorant.</p><p>\"You have to be careful how much access we give to a public figure compared to somebody who lives in Croydon or Lewisham.\"</p><p>His comments came ahead of the appearance before MPs of three Police Federation members – Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones – who were accused of trying to discredit  Mitchell after meeting him in October last year in the aftermath of the Downing Street incident.</p><p>Hogan-Howe pledged to apologise if it emerges that officers have done anything wrong.</p><p>\"Of course if we've done anything wrong, I will be the first to say I'm sorry, we're sorry. Of course I would apologise if we've got things wrong.\"</p><p>Hogan-Howe insisted that the Met was trying to tackle corruption, revealing there hasd been a sharp increase in the number of officers sacked since he took the top job at Scotland Yard two years ago, and that the number of internal complaints had gone up by a quarter.</p><p>The commissioner added: \"We've now got to wait until the outcome of this investigation. I think that won't be too long, I hope, I think the file is with the Crown Prosecution Service.</p><p>\"There will then be an independent assessment by the IPCC [Independent Police Complaints Commission] together with the Met, and I think at the end of that then we have to wait and see if it finds anything.</p><p>\"If it finds that officers have either committed a crime or have carried out any misconduct you can be sure that I, as I said at the time as well, will be ruthless in getting to the bottom of it.\"</p><p>The three officers, who were representing the forces of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands, were spared misconduct proceedings by an internal investigation.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420739605|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|6599db95ec17ffa749bdf67f17830fbeca9b5aa7 -->",

        "body":"<div id=\"block-52680294e4b09e2af78fa771\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T18:11:10.701+01:00\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Back to the hearing, <strong>Chris Sims</strong>, the West Midlands chief constable, and <strong>Andy Parker</strong>, the Warwickshire chief constable, are both giving evidence now. They are asked if they will apologise to Andrew Mithcell.</p> <p>Sims and Parker do both offer apologies.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5267fffee4b09e2af78fa76d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T18:06:26.678+01:00\">6.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The investigation into the three officers was carried out by two officers. The most senior was Jerry Reakes-Williams, who gave evidence earlier. He was assisted by a Detective Inspector Smith.</p> <p>The first draft of their report contained conflicting recommendations. Smith thought the three did not have a case to answer for misconduct. But Reakes-Williams did.</p> <p>Here is the passage from the section written by Reakes-Williams explaining why he thought they had a case to answer for misconduct.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have read the IO’s report, and understand the conclusions he has reached and his rationale. However, my view is that the officers do have a case to answer for misconduct. Without repeating unnecessarily aspects already covered in detail, I set out below my rationale ...</p> <p>I have already stated that Mr MITCHELL later provided more detail than he did to the Officers at the meeting on 12th October. However, I would make the following comments in support of my view about a case to answer for misconduct, bearing in mind the points from the Standards of Professional Behaviour listed above.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Why, if he was not satisfied that Mr MITCHELL had given a full account, was Sergeant HINTON ready to ‘move on’? (Page 6 of the meeting transcript) This surely implies that he was happy with, or at least accepted, the explanation provided.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why did three experienced police officers not press Mr MITCHELL for the full explanation they wanted during the meeting? He gave an answer, but they do not go on to indicate that they are not satisfied that he has given a full account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sergeant JONES does not challenge Mr MITCHELL when the latter says ‘You asked me in good faith what I said and I told you’ (Page 11).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sergeant HINTON also says ‘....I understand that you are saying what you said now.....’ (page 18) and ‘I appreciate your candour....’ (page 19). These statements are difficult to align with later statements to the press that claim that Mr MITCHELL did not tell them what he had said.</p> </li> <li> <p>I cannot see how the Officers can claim that Mr MITCHELL ‘refused’ to tell them what he said, when, as outlined above, they did not seek clarification from him during the meeting. Indeed, they appear to have accepted that he had given them his account.</p> </li> <li> <p>I think that an ordinary member of the public, listening to the Officers speaking to the media after the meeting, would have interpreted their&nbsp;words as meaning that Mr MITCHELL would not give any account of what occurred in Downing Street on 19th September 2012. This is clearly not the case.</p> <p>7. The Officers have therefore given an account of the meeting to the media that was inaccurate and misleading and contrary to the elements of the Standard of Professional Behaviour listed above.</p> <p>What I do not see from the information gained through the investigation is a malicious attempt to deliberately misrepresent what took place at the meeting. It seems to me that it was more a case of being poorly prepared, badly advised and inexperienced in dealing with such intense media scrutiny. The Officers were somewhat ‘caught in the headlights’, coming straight out of the meeting to face the assembled media without taking any time to discuss what had taken place between themselves and to agree a reasoned, balanced and accurate response.</p> <p>There is an element of recklessness here because it is inconceivable to me that the Officers would not have been aware that the media were gathered and would have wanted an account to go out on the 6 o’clock news.</p> <p>I have considered whether ALL of the officers have a case to answer. Although it was Inspector MacKaill who acted as the main spokesman after the meeting, it is clear that all the Officers spoke to the media either immediately after the meeting or subsequently, and all gave the same message. In interview, they have all stated their agreement with the information given to the media. In my view, this makes them all jointly responsible.</p> <p>By giving a misleading account of what took place at the meeting, I believe the Officers have a case to answer for misconduct and bringing discredit on the Police Service.&nbsp;</p> </li> </ol></blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5267fe30e4b0bfdc4825b30d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T17:53:55.331+01:00\">5.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And in his written evidence to the committee<strong> Chris Sims</strong>, the West Midlands chief constable, implied he would be apologising to Andrew Mitchell.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Finally, and most importantly, I would turn to Mr Mitchell who although not a complainant, is very much at the heart of this incident. I would not wish to use the impersonal medium of a Select Committee to issue an apology, but I fully recognise the personal and professional cost this has had on him and his family. I have today written to Mr Mitchell seeking an early opportunity to meet with him to discuss these issues and to thank him for continuing to work with the local police in his constituency capacity.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>Sims also defended the original decision not to find the officers guilty of misconduct.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5267fd1de4b09e2af78fa768\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T17:48:17.434+01:00\">5.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In his written evidence <strong>Andy Parker</strong>, the Warwickshire chief constable, said he stood by the investigation's conclusion that the officers were not guilty of misconduct.</p> <p>But he said the events were &quot;deeply regrettable&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is deeply regrettable for all involved, that this situation has been reached. It is my view that the role of both the Federation and the media in choosing to significantly and deliberately escalate an incident in Downing Street (where an apology had already been offered and accepted) was badly misjudged and extremely regrettable. I believe there are clear lessons to be learnt for both the police service and, in particular, the Police Federation. Whilst they have every right to campaign on behalf of their members and oppose measures which they believe will be damaging for the police service, the way they exercise that responsibility clearly needs to be subject to close and careful review, and I welcome the fact that the national Federation are currently in the process of doing that.</p> <p>I also regret the significant impact that this incident has undoubtedly had upon Mr Mitchell and his family and the role of a Warwickshire Police officer in adding to the pressure brought to bear upon him at an already very difficult time.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5267fc8fe4b09e2af78fa767\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T17:44:08.904+01:00\">5.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here is the conclusion from <strong>David Shaw</strong>'s written evidence to the committee.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The vast majority of police officers and staff in West Mercia Police conduct themselves with the utmost integrity. As with any Police Force, a very small minority do not live up to the standards that I and the public rightly expect of them. When that occurs, it is a huge disappointment to me and to the public. West Mercia Police is committed to identifying and dealing robustly with misconduct by police officers. We have a very strong track record of doing so.</p> <p>Whether or not the IPCC and others agree with the conclusions reached by the West Mercia Police Investigators and the Appropriate Authority in this case, I am entirely satisfied that those who reached them acted rationally and entirely in good faith.</p> <p>I acknowledge that there have been procedural errors in the context of an extremely complex statutory regime for dealing with police misconduct.

Here's the timetable.</p> <p><em>2.45pm:</em> Dame Anne Owers, chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and Deborah Glass, the IPCC's deputy chair, give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about the “plebgate” controversy. At 3.15pm Chief Inspector Jerry Reakes-Williams, from Professional Standards for Warwickshire and West Mercia Police, gives evidence. At 3.45pm Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton from Warwickshire Police Federation, Sergeant Chris Jones from West Midlands Police Federation and Inspector Ken MacKaill from West Mercia Police Federation give evidence. And at 4.30pm Chief Constable Andy Parker from Warwickshire Police, Chief Constable David Shaw from West Mercia Police and Chief Constable Chris Sims from West Midlands Police give evidence.</p> <p>I say &quot;plebgate&quot;, but the hearing will not really touch on what Andrew Mitchell did or did not say to the police officers at Downing Street when they refused to open the gates for him as he was leaving on his bicycle last year. That has been investigated by the police, and a file is now with the Crown Prosecution Service which will decide whether officers will be charged. Instead this hearing is just about the conduct of the three Police Federation officers who met Mitchell to discuss the case and who then told journalists that he had refused to give a full account of what happened. West Midlands Police, West Mercia Police and Warwickshire Police decided not to discipline them. But the IPCC criticised this decision on the grounds that an investigation seemed to show that they had not told the truth about what Mitchell said.</p> <p>It was a small incident, involving four people. But what the Police Federation officers said that day helped to contribute to Mitchell's decision to resign as chief whip and it has become a story about whether police officers can be trusted, whether the Police Federation behaves responsibly and whether it is right for the police to investigate misconduct allegations against officers itself. (In other circles this is called &quot;marking your own homework&quot;. As we in the press have discovered, this has rather gone out of fashion.)</p> <p>Here is some background reading before the hearing starts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/ipcc-disagrees-findings-west-mercia-investigation-conduct-police-federation-representatives\">• The press statement from Deborah Glass, the Independent Police Complaints Commission deputy chair, last week criticising West Mercia Police for not taking disciplinary action against the three officers and calling for that decision to be reconsidered.</a>&nbsp;Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The investigation by West Mercia Police concluded that although the Police Federation undoubtedly contributed to the pressure on Mr Mitchell and his decision to resign, none of the officers had a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct. The investigating officer concluded that while the federation representatives' comments to the media could be viewed as ambiguous or misleading, there was no deliberate intention to lie.</p> <p>I disagree. In my view, the evidence is such that a panel should determine whether the three officers gave a false account of the meeting in a deliberate attempt to support their MPS colleague and discredit Mr Mitchell, in pursuit of a wider agenda. In my opinion the evidence indicates an issue of honesty and integrity, not merely na&iuml;ve or poor professional judgment.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Documents/investigation_commissioner_reports/West%20Mercia%20Investigation.pdf\">• The full six-page statement from Glass setting out her case in more detail (pdf).</a>&nbsp;This give more details of what happened when Mitchell met the three officers, and why their account of it afterwards was misleading.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is clear from the recording that at the start of the meeting Mr Mitchell makes his apology, and hopes he can “draw a line” under the incident. He answers the question of “what he did say”:&nbsp;“The incident was very brief I complied with the officer and I picked up my bicycle but I did say under my breath but audibly, in frustration, I thought you lot were supposed to f***ing help us and it is for that I apologise and I am grateful to that officer for accepting my apology and I should never have said it and I will never do it again...” ...</p> <p>Immediately after the meeting the West Mercia officer, who did not speak during the meeting, is the principal spokesman when the officers speak to the waiting media ....&nbsp;When asked by a reporter if Mr Mitchell should resign he says:&nbsp;“I think Mr Mitchell now has no option but to resign, he’s continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened, I think his position is untenable.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Immediately following this interview all three officers gave separate interviews along similar lines to various media.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Documents/investigation_commissioner_reports/Transcript%20of%20meeting.pdf\">• The transcript of Mitchell's 45-minute meeting with the three officers on 12 October 2012.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.westmercia.police.uk/news/news-articles/statement-from-warwickshire-west-mercia-and-west-midlands-police.html?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed\">• A joint statement from Warwickshire, West Midlands and West Mercia police responding to the IPCC statement.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite a thorough investigation under the supervision of the IPCC we do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to support the view that the officers concerned should face misconduct proceedings. Our view is that the officers have demonstrated poor judgement in arranging and attending the meeting in the first place. In light of this our position is that management action is a proportionate response.</p> <p>It is important to emphasise these points;</p> <p>i) Mr Mitchell has not made a complaint against police;</p> <p>ii) Had the IPCC decided at any stage during the investigation to treat this as a managed or an independent investigation they had the power to direct the forces to convene misconduct proceedings. They have chosen not to exercise these powers despite being invited to reconsider and reminded of their options as recently as last week.</p> <p>iii) At any stage during a supervised investigation the IPCC can direct further work to be done and they have not done so in this case.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.polfed.org/newsroom/1655.aspx\">• The Police Federation's initial response to the IPCC statement.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Police Federation of England and Wales welcome the conclusions of the IPCC-supervised investigation into the actions of three Police Federation representatives, which found no evidence of misconduct. The IPCC had the choice at the outset of this investigation either to conduct an independent, managed or supervised investigation, and it chose to supervise. The investigation team has reached its conclusion and in accordance with statutory regulations, a decision has been made by the appropriate authority that there is no case to answer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Against this factual background, we are therefore shocked that the IPCC Commissioner, Deborah Glass, would then appoint herself judge and jury by releasing her personal view that she disagrees with the findings and asks the public to decide. This is done with the full knowledge that her status and title will naturally undermine the considered findings of the investigation in the eyes of the public, whereas in fact those investigating and deciding the case are the proper arbiters in this matter.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24615491\">• An account of the partial apology that the three Police Federation officers issued on Monday.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We acknowledge the investigation's criticism relating to our poor judgement in talking to the media following the meeting with Andrew Mitchell, for which we take this opportunity to apologise.</p> <p>We would like to emphasise (as we did to the investigation) that in no way did any of us ever plan or intend to mislead anyone about what occurred during this meeting or otherwise.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5267cc4de4b027bac8ef9a27\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T14:18:47.767+01:00\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here are the main points from the urgent question on Grangemouth. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/23/chinese-banking-fears-markets-minutes-greece-live#block-5267c066e4b0c53fe22c1f08\">I have taken it from Graeme Wearden's business live blog. </a>Graeme has been covering the Grangemouth story in great detail.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>• <strong>The UK government hopes that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant can still be saved, despite its owner Ineos announcing plans today to shut it down.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey told MPs repeatedly that the government wants the <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/23/chinese-banking-fears-markets-minutes-greece-live#block-5267b483e4b0bdde19a21151\">plant to stay open if at all possible</a>. </strong>It would&nbsp;still consider a business case to provide investment to help keep the plant running.&nbsp;</p> <p>Davey also confirmed that detailed contingency plans have been drawn up to protect firms and customers from running out of fuel and chemical supplies.</p> <p>He will meet with MPs at 4.15pm to discuss the issue in more detail.&nbsp;</p> <p>• <strong>Many MPs are very worried about the impact on the Scottish economy, and the knock-on effects on the UK chemicals industry.</strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Moore, Liberal Democrat MP,</strong> called it &quot;An&nbsp;act of industrial vandalism not seen in decades&quot;.</p> <p>• <strong>MPs were critical of both Ineos and the unions, for allowing the dispute to reach this point.</strong></p> <p>Alistair Darling, former chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/23/chinese-banking-fears-markets-minutes-greece-live#block-5267b732e4b027bac8ef9a18\"><strong>said</strong></a> it would be tragic to lose the plant to an industrial dispute reminiscent of the 1970s, while Sir Malcolm Bruce said both sides were guilty of &quot;a degree of intransigence&quot;.

The first review is expected to begin within weeks and report next year, said the prime minister's official spokesman. </p> <p>It will look at issues affecting competition and consumers, ranging from prices and profit levels to barriers to new entrants in the market, as well as how companies engage with customers. </p> <p>&quot;With regard to the charges that are part of people's bills, we are of course looking across the board at what more government can do to help customers and consumers,&quot; said the spokesman. </p> <p>The spokesman declined to give any detail of sanctions which energy companies might face as a result, but said: &quot;It would be wrong at this stage to rule anything out in terms of how we get more competition into the market.&quot; </p> <p>The spokesman said the review was agreed by both Conservative and Liberal Democrat sides of the coalition and insisted that the Government was not giving up its claim to be &quot;the greenest ever&quot;. </p> <p>The prime minister's ambition to &quot;roll back&quot; green levies has also been discussed with Liberal Democrats over recent weeks, and details will be released in Chancellor George Osborne's autumn statement on December 4. </p> <p>Downing Street sources said that, if there was no policy change, green levies could rise from the current &pound;112 to &pound;194 - or 14% of the typical household bill - by 2020. Cameron wants action to reduce the impact of the levies, the source said.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is what Labour are saying. This is from a party source.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister is clearly in a panic over energy prices. He is refusing to take real action to tackle overcharging now.

Half an hour later, it looks even more significant - a big win, that left David Cameron. Wit does not always trump bluster, but it did today. Miliband's opening question was very neat.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime miniser said that anyone who wanted to intervene in energy markets was living in a Marxist universe. Can he tell the House how does he feel now that the red peril has claimed Sir John Major?</p> </blockquote> <p>And Miliband continue to mock Cameron effectively, particularly with his question about someone taking Cameron's advice to switch from British Gas only to be hit with a price increase from npower. Cameron's front-foot aggression seemed misplaced, and his final jibe, about Major being a &quot;good man&quot; and Miliband being a &quot;con man&quot;, was marked by a touch of desperation (although it was also noticeable that he was not going on about Miliband being &quot;weak&quot; as much as usual).</p> <p>However, tone is not particularly relevant. At PMQs even the best debating skills cannot disguise a policy lacuna, and Cameron's real problem was that he did not have an effective response to Miliband's best question: Major proposes recovering money from energy companies via a windfall tax, Labour propose using a price freeze, so how would you recoup that money? Cameron does not have a full answer yet, and that's why he lost.</p> <p>But Cameron did have half an answer. In fact, he made three significant concessions on energy policy.</p> <p><strong>• He said that energy bills had reached a &quot;completely unacceptable level&quot;</strong>. I don't think he has ever said this so bluntly before. This represents a victory for Miliband,who has forced him into this position.</p> <p><strong>• Cameron was clearly than he has every been before about wanting to get rid of the green levies that, according to Cameron, add more than &pound;100 to fuel bills.</strong> &quot;We need to roll back some of the green regulation and charges on our bills,&quot; he said.</p> <p><strong>• He said he would apply a &quot;proper competition test&quot; to the energy market.</strong></p> <p>If Cameron had adopted an air of contrition, and flagged these up as significant concessions, he might have been able to wrong-foot Miliband. As it was, they were rather buried beneath his bluster. But these announcements mark the start of a Conservative fight-back on this agenda, and we are bound to hear more about them in the coming weeks.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T13:14:46.297+01:00\">at 1.14pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5267b499e4b0bdde19a21152\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T12:37:20.313+01:00\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here is some more on what Cameron was saying about green levies on fuel bills.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbcnickrobinson/statuses/392974366163890176\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Sources say that the review of green taxes and regulations will be spelt out in the Autumn statement</p>— Nick Robinson (@bbcnickrobinson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcnickrobinson/statuses/392974366163890176\">October 23, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>And here's is a bit more on the competition test Cameron mentioned.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ToryTreasury/statuses/392974127247933441\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickwintour\">@patrickwintour</a> new annual competition test will involve OFT and new CMA (replacing Competition Commission)</p>— Tory Treasury (@ToryTreasury) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToryTreasury/statuses/392974127247933441\">October 23, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5267b3a7e4b0bdde19a2114f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T12:34:14.420+01:00\">12.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Labour's <strong>Kevin Barron</strong> says he wrote to Cameron about Lynton Crosby's involvement in public house.

Earlier this year a parliamentary inquiry concluded that the Independent Police Complaints Commission “has neither the powers nor the resources that it needs to get to the truth when the integrity of the police is in doubt”. The Government should respond by giving the IPCC the powers and resources to outrank and overrule every chief of police in the land — to become a British “Untouchables”. Never again should a police force be able to delay or frustrate an IPCC investigation.</p> <p>However, while a tougher IPCC would ensure rigorous investigation of police misconduct, identifying such misdemeanours after the event is not enough. Nor is this a problem that can be solved by the Government’s recent Winsor-inspired reforms. The issues are bigger than pay, paperwork and pensions. This is a crisis of ethics.</p> <p>Britain needs root-and-branch reform of policing culture, a feat beyond the powers of even a powerful independent regulator. The Government should appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the conduct of the police. The lessons about what behaviour is expected from a British police officer should be instilled from Day 1.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also says officers should wear cameras and microphones to record their dealings with members of the public.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The police put millions of innocent people under surveillance in order to catch a tiny minority of wrongdoers. Perhaps now it is time to make officers wear a camera and microphone while on duty. When they tried this in California, use of force by police officers dropped by two thirds in a year. This technology could also help to defend police officers who have vexatious claims made against them.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/778b78ee-3b25-11e3-a7ec-00144feab7de.html#ixzz2iXHzDb6K\">• Jim Pickard and Elizabeth Rigby in the Financial Times (subscription) say Ed Miliband has told supporters at a private dinner that he anticipates a &quot;big fight&quot; with Fleet Street.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ed Miliband has put Labour on notice for a “big fight” with Fleet Street ahead of the general election, telling supporters that the newspapers are “less powerful now than they were”.</p> <p>The Labour leader, speaking at a private dinner for Labour donors, said the days in which newspapers and the news media could attack his party “without response” were over ...</p> <p>Recorded at a dinner at the Phoenix Palace, a luxury Chinese restaurant in Marylebone, the Labour leader said [his row with the Daily Mail about his father] was an emblem of how politics was conducted in Britain.</p> <p>“We’ve got to be willing to call these people out,” he said. “They are less powerful than people ever thought and they are less powerful now than they were.”</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/danielfinkelstein/article3901669.ece\">• Daniel Finkelstein in the Times (paywall) says voters will not believe Ed Miliband when he says he can freeze energy bills.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I worked for William Hague back in the late 1990s, we were experimenting with focus group research for the first time. None of us quite appreciated how it worked. We would discover that groups strongly agreed with us on an issue — tax allowances, for instance — and we would try playing back the policy to those voters in the form of a promise.</p> <p>Yet the moment these same voters heard their own favoured policy read back to them by a politician they started to disagree with it.</p> <p>“That will never work,” they would say. Or: “That sounds fine, but they’ll never do it.” Or: “Yeah, but how are they going to pay for it?”</p> <p>They are also much more likely to believe that a politician might bring to an end something they approve of than that they will deliver something nice.

Though this sounds like very futuristic kit, these wearable cameras are quite cheap and easy to use, and it’s not uncommon to see something like these police worn cameras in a local electronics shop. Staffordshire police have been equipping officers with this technology since 2010 and they not only help reduce bureaucracy as officers can avoid writing long statements, they have reduced complaints against officers significantly. Body Worn Cameras will represent great value for money to the Met, so let’s get moving with a full out trial of this tech.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to Evans, in Staffordshire the use of body cameras of this kind has cut the time taken to file incident reports by 22%, given officers an extra 50 minutes of patrol time per day and led to a reduction in disorder and anti-social behaviour. He says that there have been no complaints against officers wearing the cameras and that Staffordshire Police are now buying 530 of them.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52679035e4b0bdde19a2112d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T10:09:29.202+01:00\">10.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, we got happier last year. Only a bit, mind you, but I suppose that's better than getting less happy. The ONS has published <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_328486.pdf\">its personal well-being data for 2012-13 (pdf), </a>and here are the key points from the summary.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>• Personal well-being improved in the UK between 2011/12 and 2012/13. Ratings for life satisfaction and feeling that the things we do in life are worthwhile increased on average, whilst anxiety levels fell.</p> <p>• The proportions rating their personal well-being as very high or very low fell between 2011/12 and 2012/13 in the UK, while the proportion rating their well-being around 7 or 8 out of 10 increased.•&nbsp;Among the countries of the UK, Northern Ireland had the highest average ratings for life satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness in 2012/13. A greater proportion of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness as very high (9 or 10 out of 10) than in any other country.</p> <p>• Among the English regions, the South West and the South East had some of the highest levels of average life satisfaction and worthwhile ratings in 2012/13. The South West also had proportionately more people than any other region rating life satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness as 9 or 10 out of 10</p> </blockquote> <p>Why did people get happier? The ONS says it is not entirely sure. But the Olympics and the Diamond Jubilee may have been a factor.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Reasons for the small improvement in personal well-being between 2011/12 and 2012/13 are not fully understood.</p> <p>Recent ONS analysis on ‘What matters most to personal well-being?’ (ONS, 2013b) found that the factors most associated with personal well-being are health, employment situation and relationship status. Where possible, these factors will be referred to to help contextualise differences in personal well-being across different areas of the UK.</p> <p>At the UK level, improvements in the labour market picture and special events such as the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic games were suggested as factors which could have positively influenced people’s assessment of their personal well-being during the 2012/13 period (ONS, 2013a).&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52678c3be4b027bac8ef99f4\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-23T09:47:38.540+01:00\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Another Conservative MP has had a go at Ron Ball, the Warwickshire police commissioner who complained that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24627319#TWEET931351\">Andrew Mitchell's friends were &quot;baying for blood&quot; over &quot;plebgate&quot;.</a> This is what <strong>David Ruffley</strong> told BBC News.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[We're] certainly not [baying for blood].

And I think the failure of the service collectively to grip this, to demonstrate that they think that officers who give a false account is unacceptable or shouldn't be sanctioned appropriately, I think that is incredibly damaging to public confidence in the police, and it is up to them this afternoon and going forwards to demonstrate they are running the service in a proper manner.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• Herbert said the disciplinary inquiry into the three officers should be re-opened.</strong></p> <p><strong>• He said a suggestion in the Times from David Davis, the Conservative MP and a close friend of Andrew Mitchell's,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/23/plebgate-david-davis-surveillance-police\"> that the police should be fitted with cameras and microphones to record all contact with members of the public </a>was &quot;worth piloting&quot;.</strong></p> <p><strong>• He criticised Ron Ball, the Warwickshire police and crime commissioner, for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24627319#TWEET931351\">saying that Andrew Mitchell's friends have been &quot;baying for blood&quot; over the affair.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that's a spectacularly ill-judged comment given that these findings were made by the Independent Police Complaints Commission ... His job as the elected police and crime commissioner is to hold his force to account.

He may have been an indifferent government minister, and he would win an Olympic medal for vanity, but when it comes to chairing the home affairs select committee, and asserting the committee's right to stick its nose into any matter vaguely home affairs-related, and haul people in at short notice for a grilling, he has been hard to fault. Today we are going to get a classic example because the committee is going to take evidence from<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24629610\"> the three Police Federation officers accused of giving a misleading account of their meeting with Andrew Mitchell about the “plebgate” affair,</a> the officer who investigated whether this amounted to misconduct, the three chief constables who decided not to take disciplinary action against them, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which decided that that decision was a mistake. In other words we're going to get a full inquiry into this controversy, concluded in the course of an afternoon. A few years ago Commons select committees were wary of engaging in this kind of micro-scrutiny, but Vaz and some of today's other select committee chairmen are bolder. It has been a good development for those who like to see parliament asserting its power. And, of course, it makes for great copy.</p> <p>I will write more about the background to the hearing before it starts. Although the session will just focus on what three relatively junior officers said after a meeting with the then Conservative chief whip, the ramifications spread much further, and what happens this afternoon may well affect the reputation of the entire police.</p> <p>Before that, of course, we've got PMQs. Here's the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.20am:</em> Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, gives evidence to the Commons environmental audit committee on biodiversity offsetting.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> David Laws, the schools minister, gives evidence to the Commons education committee on school place.</p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> Christopher Jeffries, the Leveson inquiry witness, gives evidence to the Lords committee on public inquiries.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> David Cameron and Ed Miliband clash at PMQs.</p> <p><em>2.45pm:</em> Dame Anne Owers, chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and Deborah Glass, the IPCC's deputy chair, give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about the “plebgate” controversy. At 3.15pm Chief Inspector Jerry Reakes-Williams, from Professional Standards for Warwickshire and West Mercia Police, gives evidence. At 3.45pm Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton from Warwickshire Police Federation, Sergeant Chris Jones from West Midlands Police Federation and Inspector Ken MacKaill from West Mercia Police Federation give evidence. And at 4.30pm Chief Constable Andy Parker from Warwickshire Police, Chief Constable David Shaw from West Mercia Police and Chief Constable Chris Sims from West Midlands Police give evidence.</p> <p><em>4.30pm:</em> Cameron meets the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Downing Street.</p> <p>As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary after PMQs and another after the home affairs committee hearing.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420725354|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|68299aa64f6ab571f09f2e7a7d7d2213ade4bd96 -->",
