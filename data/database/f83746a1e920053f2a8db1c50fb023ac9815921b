        "body":"<p>Subversion ain't what it used&nbsp;to be. Today it scarcely figures as a significant force. Nation states are threatened by something else. Superversion: an attack from above.</p><p>It takes several forms. One is familiar, but greatly enhanced by new technology: the tendency of spooks and politicians to use the instruments of state to amplify undemocratic powers. We've now learnt that even members of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state\" title=\"\">cabinet and the National Security Council had no idea what GCHQ was up to</a>. No one told them that&nbsp;it was developing the capacity to watch, if it chooses, everything we do online. The real enemies of state (if by state we mean the compact between citizens and those they elect) are people like the head of MI5, and the home secretary, who seem to have failed  to inform cabinet colleagues about these programmes.</p><p>Allied to the old abuses is a newer kind of superversion: the attempts by billionaires and their lieutenants to destroy the functions of the state. Note the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/us-shutdown-explainer-non-americans\" title=\"\">current shutdown</a> – and the debt-ceiling confrontation scheduled for Thursday – in the United States. The Republicans, propelled by a Tea Party movement created by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/25/tea-party-koch-brothers\" title=\"\">the Koch brothers</a> and financed by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/astroturfwars\" title=\"\">a gruesome collection of multimillionaires</a>, have engineered what in other circumstances would be called a general strike. The difference is that the withdrawal of their labour has been imposed on the workers.</p><p>The narrow purpose of the strike is to prevent the distribution of wealth to poorer people, through the <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/opa/affordable-care-act/index.html\" title=\"\">Affordable Care Act</a>. The wider purpose (aside from&nbsp;a refusal to accept the legitimacy of a black president) is to topple the state as an effective instrument of taxation, regulation and social protection. The Koch shock troops in the Republican party seem prepared to inflict almost any damage in pursuit of this insurgency, including – if they hold out on Thursday – a US government default, which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/krugman-rebels-without-a-clue.html\" title=\"\">could trigger a new&nbsp;global financial crisis</a>.</p><p>They do so on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/revolt-of-the-rich/\" title=\"\">a class which has, in effect, seceded</a>. It floats free of tax and the usual bonds of citizenship, jetting from one jurisdiction to another as it seeks the most favourable havens for its wealth. It removes itself so thoroughly from the life of the nation that it scarcely uses even the roads. Yet, through privatisation and outsourcing, it is capturing the public services on which the rest of us depend.</p><p>Using an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/capitalism-bankrolls-politics-pay-price\" title=\"\">unreformed political funding system to devastating effect</a>, this superversive class demands that the state stop regulating, stop protecting, stop intervening. When this abandonment causes financial crisis, the remaining taxpayers are forced to bail out the authors of the disaster, who then stash their bonuses offshore.</p><p>One result is that those who call themselves conservatives and patriots appear to be deeply confused about what they are defending. In his article <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/12/left-daily-mail-paul-dacre\" title=\"\">last week attacking the Guardian for revealing GCHQ's secret surveillance programmes</a>, Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/12/left-daily-mail-paul-dacre\" title=\"\">characterised his readers</a> as possessing an \"over-riding suspicion of the state and the People Who Know Best\". Strangely, this suspicion of the state and the People Who Know Best does not appear to extend to the security services, whose assault on our freedoms Dacre was defending.</p><p>To the rightwing press and the Conservative party, patriotism means standing up to the European Union. But&nbsp;it also means capitulating to the United States. It's an obvious and glaring contradiction, which is almost never acknowledged, let alone explained. In reality the EU and the US have become proxies for something which transcends national boundaries. The EU stands for state control and regulation while the US represents deregulation and atomisation.</p><p>In truth, this distinction is outdated, as the handful of people who have heard of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\" title=\"\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> (TTIP) will appreciate. The European commission calls it <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\" title=\"\">\"the biggest trade deal in the world\"</a>. Its purpose is to create a single transatlantic market, in which all regulatory differences between the US and the EU are gradually removed.</p><p>It has been negotiated largely in secret. This time, they're not just trying to bring down international trade barriers, but, as the commission boasts, \"to tackle barriers behind the customs border – such as differences in technical regulations, standards and approval procedures\". In other words, our own laws, affecting our own people.</p><p>A document published last year by two huge industrial lobby groups – the US Chamber of Commerce and BusinessEurope – <a href=\"http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/businesseurope-uschamber-paper.pdf\" title=\"\">explains the partnership's aims</a>. It will have a \"proactive requirement\", directing governments to change their laws. The partnership should \"put stakeholders at the table with regulators to essentially co-write regulation\". Stakeholder is a euphemism for corporation.</p><p></p><p>They want it; they're getting it. New intellectual property laws that they have long demanded, but which sovereign governments have so far resisted – not least because of the mass mobilisation against the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act in the US – are back on the table, but this time largely inaccessible to public protest.</p><p>So are data protection, public procurement and financial services. You think that getting your own government to regulate bankers is hard enough? Try&nbsp;appealing to a transnational agreement brokered by corporations and&nbsp;justified by the deemed consent of citizens who have been neither informed nor consulted.</p><p>This deal is a direct assault on sovereignty and democracy. So where are the Daily Mail and the Telegraph and the other papers which have campaigned so hard against all transfers of power to the European Union? Where&nbsp;are the Conservative MPs who have fought for an EU referendum? Eerie silence descends. They do not oppose the TTIP because their allegiance lies not with the nation but with&nbsp;the offshored corporate elite.</p><p>These fake patriots proclaim a love for their country, while ensuring that there is nothing left to love. They are loyal to the pageantry – the flags, the coinage, the military parades – but intensely disloyal to the nation these symbols are supposed to represent. The greater the dissonance becomes, the louder the national anthem plays.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a><em> </em></p><p><em>A fully referenced version of this article can be found at </em><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Monbiot.com</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419939916|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|84ead731b46c943bfefed35e664f632839e07a2c -->",

        "headline":"From Obamacare to trade, superversion not subversion is the new and very real threat to the state",
        "body":"<p>Subversion ain't what it used&nbsp;to be. Today it scarcely figures as a significant force. Nation states are threatened by something else. Superversion: an attack from above.</p><p>It takes several forms. One is familiar, but greatly enhanced by new technology: the tendency of spooks and politicians to use the instruments of state to amplify undemocratic powers. We've now learnt that even members of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state\" title=\"\">cabinet and the National Security Council had no idea what GCHQ was up to</a>. No one told them that&nbsp;it was developing the capacity to watch, if it chooses, everything we do online. The real enemies of state (if by state we mean the compact between citizens and those they elect) are people like the head of MI5, and the home secretary, who seem to have failed  to inform cabinet colleagues about these programmes.</p><p>Allied to the old abuses is a newer kind of superversion: the attempts by billionaires and their lieutenants to destroy the functions of the state. Note the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/us-shutdown-explainer-non-americans\" title=\"\">current shutdown</a> – and the debt-ceiling confrontation scheduled for Thursday – in the United States. The Republicans, propelled by a Tea Party movement created by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/25/tea-party-koch-brothers\" title=\"\">the Koch brothers</a> and financed by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/astroturfwars\" title=\"\">a gruesome collection of multimillionaires</a>, have engineered what in other circumstances would be called a general strike. The difference is that the withdrawal of their labour has been imposed on the workers.</p><p>The narrow purpose of the strike is to prevent the distribution of wealth to poorer people, through the <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/opa/affordable-care-act/index.html\" title=\"\">Affordable Care Act</a>. The wider purpose (aside from&nbsp;a refusal to accept the legitimacy of a black president) is to topple the state as an effective instrument of taxation, regulation and social protection. The Koch shock troops in the Republican party seem prepared to inflict almost any damage in pursuit of this insurgency, including – if they hold out on Thursday – a US government default, which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/krugman-rebels-without-a-clue.html\" title=\"\">could trigger a new&nbsp;global financial crisis</a>.</p><p>They do so on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/revolt-of-the-rich/\" title=\"\">a class which has, in effect, seceded</a>. It floats free of tax and the usual bonds of citizenship, jetting from one jurisdiction to another as it seeks the most favourable havens for its wealth. It removes itself so thoroughly from the life of the nation that it scarcely uses even the roads. Yet, through privatisation and outsourcing, it is capturing the public services on which the rest of us depend.</p><p>Using an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/capitalism-bankrolls-politics-pay-price\" title=\"\">unreformed political funding system to devastating effect</a>, this superversive class demands that the state stop regulating, stop protecting, stop intervening. When this abandonment causes financial crisis, the remaining taxpayers are forced to bail out the authors of the disaster, who then stash their bonuses offshore.</p><p>One result is that those who call themselves conservatives and patriots appear to be deeply confused about what they are defending. In his article <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/12/left-daily-mail-paul-dacre\" title=\"\">last week attacking the Guardian for revealing GCHQ's secret surveillance programmes</a>, Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/12/left-daily-mail-paul-dacre\" title=\"\">characterised his readers</a> as possessing an \"over-riding suspicion of the state and the People Who Know Best\". Strangely, this suspicion of the state and the People Who Know Best does not appear to extend to the security services, whose assault on our freedoms Dacre was defending.</p><p>To the rightwing press and the Conservative party, patriotism means standing up to the European Union. But&nbsp;it also means capitulating to the United States. It's an obvious and glaring contradiction, which is almost never acknowledged, let alone explained. In reality the EU and the US have become proxies for something which transcends national boundaries. The EU stands for state control and regulation while the US represents deregulation and atomisation.</p><p>In truth, this distinction is outdated, as the handful of people who have heard of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\" title=\"\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> (TTIP) will appreciate. The European commission calls it <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\" title=\"\">\"the biggest trade deal in the world\"</a>. Its purpose is to create a single transatlantic market, in which all regulatory differences between the US and the EU are gradually removed.</p><p>It has been negotiated largely in secret. This time, they're not just trying to bring down international trade barriers, but, as the commission boasts, \"to tackle barriers behind the customs border – such as differences in technical regulations, standards and approval procedures\". In other words, our own laws, affecting our own people.</p><p>A document published last year by two huge industrial lobby groups – the US Chamber of Commerce and BusinessEurope – <a href=\"http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/businesseurope-uschamber-paper.pdf\" title=\"\">explains the partnership's aims</a>. It will have a \"proactive requirement\", directing governments to change their laws. The partnership should \"put stakeholders at the table with regulators to essentially co-write regulation\". Stakeholder is a euphemism for corporation.</p><p></p><p>They want it; they're getting it. New intellectual property laws that they have long demanded, but which sovereign governments have so far resisted – not least because of the mass mobilisation against the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act in the US – are back on the table, but this time largely inaccessible to public protest.</p><p>So are data protection, public procurement and financial services. You think that getting your own government to regulate bankers is hard enough? Try&nbsp;appealing to a transnational agreement brokered by corporations and&nbsp;justified by the deemed consent of citizens who have been neither informed nor consulted.</p><p>This deal is a direct assault on sovereignty and democracy. So where are the Daily Mail and the Telegraph and the other papers which have campaigned so hard against all transfers of power to the European Union? Where&nbsp;are the Conservative MPs who have fought for an EU referendum? Eerie silence descends. They do not oppose the TTIP because their allegiance lies not with the nation but with&nbsp;the offshored corporate elite.</p><p>These fake patriots proclaim a love for their country, while ensuring that there is nothing left to love. They are loyal to the pageantry – the flags, the coinage, the military parades – but intensely disloyal to the nation these symbols are supposed to represent. The greater the dissonance becomes, the louder the national anthem plays.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a><em> </em></p><p><em>A fully referenced version of this article can be found at </em><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Monbiot.com</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419939916|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|84ead731b46c943bfefed35e664f632839e07a2c -->",

        "body":"<p>Remember that referendum about whether we should create a single market with the United States? You know, the one that asked whether corporations should have the power to strike down our laws? No, I don't either. Mind you, I spent 10 minutes looking for my watch the other day before I realised I was wearing it. Forgetting about the referendum is another sign of ageing. Because there must have been one, mustn't there? After all that agonising over whether or not we should stay in the European Union, the government wouldn't cede our sovereignty to some shadowy, undemocratic body without consulting us. Would it?</p><p>The purpose of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\" title=\"\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> is to remove the regulatory differences between the US and European nations. I mentioned it <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2013/10/14/elite-insurgency/\" title=\"\">a couple of weeks ago</a>. But I left out the most important issue: the remarkable ability it would grant big business to sue the living daylights out of governments which try to defend their citizens. It would allow a secretive panel of corporate lawyers to overrule the will of parliament and destroy our legal protections. Yet the defenders of our sovereignty say nothing.</p><p>The mechanism through which this is achieved is known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor-state_dispute_settlement\" title=\"\">investor-state dispute settlement</a>. It's already being used in many parts of the world to kill regulations protecting people and the living planet.</p><p>The Australian government, after massive debates in and out of parliament, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20559585\" title=\"\">decided that cigarettes should be sold in plain packets</a>, marked only with shocking health warnings. The decision was validated by the Australian supreme court. But, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/philip-morris-australia-cigarette-packets\" title=\"\">using a trade agreement Australia struck with Hong Kong</a>, the tobacco company Philip Morris has asked an offshore tribunal to award it a vast sum in compensation for the loss of what it calls its intellectual property.</p><p>During its financial crisis, and in response to public anger over rocketing charges, Argentina imposed a freeze on people's energy and water bills (does this sound familiar?). It was sued by the international utility companies whose vast bills had prompted the government to act. For this and other such crimes, it has been forced to pay out over a billion dollars in compensation. In El Salvador, local communities managed at great cost (<a href=\"http://www.canadians.org/fr/node/5297\" title=\"\">three campaigners were murdered</a>) to persuade the government to refuse permission for a vast gold mine which threatened to contaminate their water supplies. A victory for democracy? Not for long, perhaps. The Canadian company which sought to dig the mine is now suing El Salvador for $315m – for the loss of its anticipated future profits.</p><p>In Canada, the courts revoked two&nbsp;patents owned by the American drugs firm Eli Lilly, on the grounds that&nbsp;the company had not produced enough evidence that they had the beneficial effects it claimed. Eli Lilly is now <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eli-lilly-files-500m-nafta-suit-against-canada-over-drug-patents-1.1829854\" title=\"\">suing the Canadian government for&nbsp;$500m</a>, and demanding that Canada's patent laws are changed.</p><p>These companies (along with hundreds of others) are using the investor-state dispute rules embedded in trade treaties signed by the countries they are suing. The rules are enforced by panels which have none of the safeguards we expect in our own courts. The hearings are held in secret. The judges are corporate lawyers, many of whom work for companies of the kind whose cases they hear. Citizens and communities affected by their decisions have no legal standing. There is no right&nbsp;of appeal on the merits of the&nbsp;case.&nbsp;Yet they can overthrow the sovereignty of parliaments and the rulings of supreme courts.</p><p>You don't believe it? Here's what one of the judges on these tribunals says about his work. \"When I wake up at night and think about arbitration, it never ceases to amaze me that sovereign&nbsp;states have agreed to investment arbitration at all ... Three private individuals are entrusted with the power to review, without any restriction or appeal procedure, all actions of the government, all decisions of the courts, and all laws and regulations emanating from parliament.\"</p><p>There are no corresponding rights for&nbsp;citizens. We can't use these tribunals to demand better protections from corporate greed. As the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Democracy Centre</a> says, this is \"a privatised justice system for global corporations\".</p><p>Even if these suits don't succeed, they can exert a powerful chilling effect on legislation. One Canadian government official, speaking about the rules introduced by the North American Free Trade Agreement, remarked: \"I've seen the letters from the New York and DC law firms coming up to the Canadian government on virtually every new environmental regulation and proposition in the last five years. They involved dry-cleaning chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, patent law. Virtually all of the new initiatives were targeted and most of them never saw the light of day.\" Democracy, as a meaningful proposition, is impossible under these circumstances.</p><p>This is the system to which we will&nbsp;be&nbsp;subject if the transatlantic treaty&nbsp;goes ahead. The US and the European commission, both of which have been captured by the corporations they are supposed to regulate, are pressing for investor-state dispute resolution to be included in the agreement.</p><p></p><p>The commission justifies this policy by claiming that domestic courts don't offer corporations sufficient protection because they \"might be biased or lack independence\". Which courts is it talking about? Those of the US? Its own member states? It doesn't say. In fact it fails to produce a single concrete example demonstrating the need for a new, extrajudicial system. It is precisely because our courts are generally not biased or lacking independence that the corporations want to bypass them. The EC seeks to replace open, accountable, sovereign courts with a closed, corrupt system riddled with conflicts of interest and arbitrary powers.</p><p>Investor-state rules could be used to smash any attempt to save the NHS from corporate control, to re-regulate the banks, to curb the greed of the energy companies, to renationalise the railways, to leave fossil fuels in the ground. These rules shut down democratic alternatives. They outlaw leftwing politics.</p><p>This is why there has been no attempt by the UK government to inform us about this monstrous assault on democracy, let alone consult us. This is why the Conservatives who huff and puff about sovereignty are silent. Wake up, people we're being shafted.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a>.

        "headline":"Never mind human rights law, EU law is much more powerful",
        "body":"<p>Even though the human rights court in Strasbourg and the convention it enforces are never far from the headlines these days, it is rare to find any mention of another important human rights agreement – the European Union's <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/charter/\" title=\"\">charter of fundamental rights</a>. This is understandable: although the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0389:0403:en:PDF\" title=\"\">charter was \"proclaimed\"</a> by the EU institutions more than 13 years ago, it did not become legally binding until the Lisbon treaty took effect in December 2009.</p><p>Even then, the charter applies only to EU member states when they are implementing EU law. That's stressed in a discussion paper <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/assises-justice-2013/justice_independence_en.htm\" title=\"\">just published</a> by the European Commission ahead of a <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/assises-justice-2013/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">major conference</a> on EU justice policy next month (at which I have been invited by the commission to make a short introductory speech).</p><p>And you could be forgiven for thinking that the charter simply codifies EU case-law and merely re-states the human rights convention: where the charter contains rights that stem from the convention, their meaning and scope are the same.</p><p>Hang on a moment. Decisions by the human rights court do not have direct effect in the UK. Convicted prisoners can't vote, even though the UK's blanket ban on prisoner voting was held to be in breach of their human rights as long ago as 2005. And the Human Rights Act 1998 says only that UK courts must take Strasbourg decisions \"into account\". That does not make them binding.</p><p>Where possible, UK courts must give effect to existing legislation in a way that is compatible with convention rights. But if that proves impossible, the most that a higher court can do is to declare the two laws incompatible and let parliament sort it out.</p><p>But EU law is different. It has direct effect under the European Communities Act 1972. And that means the EU charter can be used to \"disapply\" – effectively, to overturn – an act of parliament. That's the conclusion to be drawn from a recent decision of the employment appeal tribunal, as yet unpublished but available <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/173329607/Janah-v-Libya-Benkharbouche-v-Sudan\" title=\"\">here</a>. The case was won by Paul Luckhurst of Blackstone Chambers. A <a href=\"http://www.blackstonechambers.com/news/cases/janah_v_libya.html\" title=\"\">note on his chambers website</a> says drily that the ruling is \"likely to be of wider significance\". Adam Wagner, the barrister and blogger who alerted me to it, says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamWagner1/status/387256551758917633\" title=\"\">\"this could be big\"</a>. The case involved two Moroccan women who were sacked by diplomatic missions in London. Benkharbouche was a cook at the Sudanese embassy and Janah was on the domestic staff of the Libyan embassy. They complained variously of unfair dismissal, unpaid wages and breaches of the working time regulations.</p><p>Both their claims were dismissed on the basis that foreign states have immunity from the jurisdiction of the UK courts. Although that immunity is not unlimited, section 4 of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/33\" title=\"\">State Immunity Act 1978</a> gives embassies immunity in respect of staff who are foreign nationals and who are not habitually resident in the UK. So the two women were deprived of the right to bring their claims.</p><p>The question for Mr Justice Langstaff, sitting as president of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, was whether there was any way round this statute. Article 6 of the human rights convention gives everyone bringing a civil claim in the UK the right to a fair hearing. But the judge said he could not use the Human Rights Act to change the meaning of the State Immunity Act.</p><p>So Luckhurst, representing the two women, turned to EU law. Article 47 of the EU charter also guarantees a fair hearing and an effective remedy. His clients' claims for unfair dismissal were covered by the working time directive, which is part of EU law, although other parts of their claim were outside its scope. Since the charter has direct effect in national law, the question for the appeal tribunal was whether it could disapply national laws that were contrary to the charter in litigation between private parties, as for these purposes they were.</p><p>Langstaff decided it could, despite what he described as \"the uncomfortable recognition that the domestic legislature took care in the Human Rights Act not to allow the courts to disapply any domestic statute which was in conflict with the European convention on human rights\". He allowed the women's appeals to the extent that they were covered by the working time regulations, as well as claims by Janah for racial discrimination and harassment.</p><p>Recognising that he was opening up a rift between the application of EU law and the use of human rights law, the judge granted the embassies permission to appeal. An appeal would also allow the two women to seek a declaration of incompatibility in respect of their unfair dismissal and minimum wage claims – something his tribunal had no power to grant.</p><p>The ruling demonstrates once again that EU law trumps laws passed by parliament. Despite all the attention paid to human rights law, EU law is much more powerful.</p><p>And it's a decision that may make life more difficult for ministers. The foreign office will have to tell embassies in London that they can't sack their domestic staff without paying the compensation to which those staff are entitled under EU law. But what's wrong with that?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419475133|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|00817d649150e58703466fec23cc6353989bc68f -->",

        "body":"<p>European leaders are under pressure to respond to the controversy over mass digital surveillance after the European parliament moved to toughen data privacy rules and curb data transfers to the US, and following outrage in France at the scale of the intrusion.</p><p>Elysee Palace sources said François Hollande, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/us-french-surveillance-legitimate-questions\" title=\"\">spoke by telephone to Barack Obama on Monday</a>, wanted the issue to be raised at a summit of EU leaders opening on Thursday in Brussels.</p><p>The most senior EU official dealing with the issue, the commissioner for justice, Viviane Reding, said Monday evening's European parliament committee vote on new rules for securing data privacy was a breakthrough and demanded prompt action from national leaders.</p><p>\"The European parliament has thrown down the gauntlet. European leaders must now rise to the challenge. Heads of state and government should make clear that common European data protection rules are very much needed and are needed now,\" she said.</p><p>Following reports that US surveillance of France extended to <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2013/10/21/france-in-the-nsa-s-crosshair-phone-networks-under-surveillance_3499741_651865.html\" title=\"\">monitoring more than 70m phone calls and text messages</a> in less than a month at the turn of the year, Hollande called Obama to complain. He said the alleged practices were \"unacceptable between friends and allies because they infringe on the privacy of French citizens\".</p><p>The French, backed by the Poles and the European commission, are seeking a commitment to fast-track the new rules governing data privacy, while the British and the Scandinavians are stressing that quality take precedence over haste. On Tuesday the German government said the parliament's draft would need to be overhauled.</p><p>The parliament's civil liberties committee overwhelmingly backed draft rules on data privacy in what was the first concrete EU response to revelations about the activities of the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK's General Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).</p><p>The new regime would curb the transfer of personal data to US corporations. It forms a framework for further negotiations with the 28 governments of EU member states. The legislation has been gridlocked for almost two years following US pressure to dilute the package.</p><p>The summit on Thursday and Friday is largely taken up with discussion on how to boost Europe's digital economy, meaning the issue of digital snooping will inevitably intrude. The current draft declaring the outcome of the summit talks says: \"It is important to foster the trust of consumers and businesses in the digital economy through the adoption next year of a strong EU general data protection framework.\"</p><p>Disclosures by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden have changed the political climate on data privacy, lending greater urgency to attempts to frame new EU rules.</p><p>Jan Philipp Albrecht, the German Green MEP steering the legislation through the parliament in Strasbourg, said: \"The vote is a breakthrough for data protection rules in Europe, ensuring that they are up to the challenges of the digital age. This legislation introduces overarching EU rules on data protection, replacing the current patchwork of national laws.\"</p><p>Parts of the draft rules tightly regulating the transfer of data from Europe to America were dropped previously after intense US lobbying but have been reintroduced to proscribe the practice unless explicitly allowed.</p><p>US companies providing data services in Europe but not based there would need to obtain special permission before they could transfer information to and store it in the US, where it may be tapped by the NSA. They would face swingeing fines if found to be in breach.</p><p>The draft supported by MEPs on Monday forms the basis for further negotiation with the 28 EU governments and the European commission, meaning it is likely to be altered substantially before coming into force. The aim is to have the new regime agreed by next spring and in force by 2016, but that looks unlikely. The 28 governments are still trying to reach a common negotiating position.</p><p>Tension between Paris and Washington over claims that the NSA engaged in widespread phone and internet surveillance of French citizens persisted on Tuesday after Le Monde detailed US methods of spying on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN in New York.</p><p>In a second day of stories based on Snowden disclosures, the French daily said NSA internal memos detailed \"the wholesale use of cookies by the NSA to spy on French diplomatic interests at the UN and in Washington\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420671222|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|a2fc4b8ac1f304dd47d2ba1514a59b014acf9d65 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's business lobby group will set out its \"unequivocal\" support for Britain staying in the European Union on Monday, claiming that membership brings each household some £3,000 a year.</p><p>The CBI said a poll of members around the country showed the vast majority wanted to remain part of the EU, subject to important reforms. At its annual conference in London, the group will stress that benefits such as easier access to export markets, both in Europe and further afield, easily outweigh the costs.</p><p>Presenting his \"business vision for a reformed EU\", CBI director general John Cridland countered those calling for a so-called \"Brexit\" by stressing that being outside the world's largest trading bloc would leave the UK isolated and without influence.</p><p>David Cameron has promised to put Britain's EU membership to a vote in 2017. The referendum has caused huge controversy inside the Tory party, which is split between those MPs who are pushing the prime minister for a vote before the 2015 election and a faction led by the former chancellor Ken Clarke, who has described the vote as silly and reckless.</p><p>The CBI's research could strengthen Cameron's hand inside the Tory party, especially as it found that more than three-quarters of small and medium-sized businesses back staying inside the single market. Traditionally, polls have shown large majorities among large businesses for EU membership against a large no vote from smaller enterprises.</p><p>Cridland said: \"We have looked beyond the political rhetoric to examine the pros and cons of EU membership and British business is unequivocal: the single market is fundamental to our future.\"</p><p>The group's conclusions credit membership of the bloc with giving Britain access to European markets of 500 million people, helping cement the UK as the world's leading financial centre and attracting investment from around the world. It says that by aggregating research already available it has come up with a \"conservative\" estimate that the benefits amount to 4-5% of GDP, or as much as £78bn a year, making each household £3,000 better off.</p><p>But the group also outlines a number of frustrations. \"The EU isn't perfect and there is a growing unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. Europe has to become more open, competitive and outward looking if we are to grow and create opportunities and jobs for all our citizens,\" Cridland said.</p><p>\"I am clear that the ever closer union of the eurozone is not for Britain. The big reform issue is to ensure that Britain's membership of the single market and the EU of the 28 does not become damaged or diluted by the eurozone's drive for greater integration.\"</p><p>The group is calling on the EU to fully implement a market for services and to create a digital one, and also to secure trade deals with the US and Japan as part of talks already under way. It also wants a moratorium on legislation where there is a case for decisions to be made at national level, such as employment law.</p><p>Separately, the <a href=\"http://niesr.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">National Institute of Economic and Social Research</a> (NIESR) is calling for more research into the benefits of both staying in and leaving the EU.</p><p>\"So far, while there has been plenty of partisan rhetoric, there has been little serious and comprehensive analysis of the implications for the British economy of an exit from the EU,\" says NIESR's director Jonathan Portes, writing in the group's Economic Review.</p><p>\"It is vital that the UK political debate on EU membership over the next few years is informed by high-quality, objective economic analysis. There will be few decisions that will be so important for our long-term economic future.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421570232|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|32a6d4c760ef8790f6fee21363a5a1a811b60b78 -->",
