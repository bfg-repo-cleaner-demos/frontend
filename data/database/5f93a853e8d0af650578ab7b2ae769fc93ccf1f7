        "headline":"Energy secretary considers criminal sanctions for market manipulation",
        "body":"<p>The government  has set out a wave of reforms for the energy industry including the prospect of criminal sanctions for market manipulation, an Ofgem investigation into companies' profits, and moves to make it possible for consumers to switch suppliers within 24 hours.</p><p>Giving the annual energy statement to MPs on Thursday, the energy secretary, Ed Davey, said: \"The public need to know our reforms will have teeth, that companies that play outside the rules will be penalised and fined.\"</p><p>But the announcements in the Commons were immediately derided by shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint, who said they would let the big energy firms off the hook, and claimed that the government had repeatedly announced reviews of the market that led to nothing.</p><p>Davey said he would \"consult on the introduction of criminal sanctions for anyone found manipulating energy markets and harming the consumer interest\".</p><p>Energy department officials argued it was not clear that existing criminal sanctions on market manipulation applied to the energy industry. Sanctions might  include a jail sentence of as long as seven years.</p><p>Paul Massara, chief executive of RWE npower, one of the \"big six\" energy firms, tweeted in angry response: \"Lots of wild talk about cartels but no evidence and the facts don't support. Where is the evidence? Put up or shut up.\"</p><p>Only four months ago Davey announced that Ofgem, the energy regulator had been given new powers to demand access to information, inspect premises and impose unlimited fines for those who break the law.</p><p>Davey also said that he expected Ofgem to provide a full report by the spring on the financial transparency of the energy companies and ways it could be improved.  Ofgem's own data suggests wholesale prices were almost flat over the past year, rising by just 1.7%.  But the energy companies have criticised Ofgem's approach, saying its method of measuring does not reflect the way they buy gas and electricity.&nbsp;</p><p>Ofgem has repeatedly said it believes the energy firms' profits are broadly transparent, but a fortnight ago conceded to the energy select committee that a further review was worthwhile. Critics claim it is not possible to work out what prices energy generation companies are charging to their retail arms in the wholesale market.</p><p>Davey said there would be an annual review of competition in the market.</p><p>Davey also wants energy firms to allow customers to switch providers more quickly than the current average of five weeks,  which includes a statutory two-week cooling off period before the process of switching can start. The industry says the two-week cooling off period is intended to protect consumers.</p><p>It is estimated that 3 million customers switch each year and firms such as First Utility has said it should be possible to offer a target of 24-hour switching, something Davey would like all firms to match.</p><p>It has been alleged that energy firms overcharge customers that are unlikely to move and offer far cheaper rates to those liable to switch.</p><p>Davey said he feared only \"the smartphone generation and the internet-savvy\" knew how to switch, adding: \"We want to push energy companies to make switching quicker and easier because consumer action can force suppliers to change their ways.\"</p><p>He added that bills were being redesigned to give people the information they needed to make switching easy.</p><p>Davey also announced that his department would work with the Post Office to signpost elderly and vulnerable people to the 500 volunteers being trained by the Big Energy Saving Network to help people find ways to cut their bills.</p><p>In her response to Davey, Flint said: \"Let me ask you how is it possible that social and environmental obligations, which on your own department's figures only make up £113 of people's bills, can account for price rises of £400?\"</p><p>She also pointed out: \"There have been 17 investigations into the energy markets since 2001. If you are today announcing the launch of a new annual review of competition in the energy markets, what on earth has Ofgem been doing all this time? And what do you expect them to find out in the next 10 months which they haven't discovered in the last 10 years?</p><p>\"The last review by Ofgem, which you gave your full backing to, only finished in June,\" she added.</p><p>Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, the industry body, said the timetable for switching was partly laid down in law. \"Switching quickly, yes, it can be done, and there's certainly a lot of work that's under way and we can bring forward some of those changes pretty quickly,\" she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421383916|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|5ec19f44d9637e35fa98396579bde8c0968c5698 -->",

        "body":"<p>When my wife and I set up the energy company Ovo in 2009, we were looking for a challenge – a market that was tough to get into but not impossible and where a company trying to do things differently could make a real impact. I can't say we anticipated everything that has happened since, but our approach to business hasn't changed. If we can't explain something to a customer in a way they will understand, and trust that we are giving them a fair deal, we just don't do it.</p><p>The principles we founded the company on are the same as I applied <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/29/energy-firms-overcharge-accusation\" title=\"\">at Tuesday's parliamentary select committee on energy prices</a>: simplicity, transparency, honesty and fairness. Even knowing the way most people feel about energy companies these days, I am still bowled over by the difference this approach seems to have made.</p><p>Pinpointing what is wrong with the UK energy market isn't easy and it has been made a lot harder by vast amounts of complicated and confusing evidence put out there to the contrary. But the fact is consumers don't need to wade through  piles of confusing data to know something doesn't add up. People can feel instinctively when they're getting a bad deal.</p><p>The facts that I outlined to MPs this week are simple though. The big six didn't win their massive customer bases through competition and running great businesses; they inherited them pre-privatisation. They each rely on the vast majority of their customers never switching, which allows them to operate inefficiently, charging some customers much more than others and offering cut-price deals to attract the ones who do switch. Most importantly, and simplest of all: wholesale prices aren't rising. So whatever reason you are being given for your bills going up, this clearly isn't it.</p><p>I'm not expecting to have made any new friends in the big six after Tuesday's hearing. I knew beforehand that, as a small energy supplier, we were in a strong position to challenge the status quo and I think it is important that the voice of the independent energy suppliers is heard, even if it is not popular with some of my peers in the industry. But this debate around energy prices has its roots in a genuine and serious social problem that, as well as getting ripped off, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/29/british-cant-afford-heat-food-big-six-energy-jack-monroe\" title=\"\">people are choosing between feeding their families and keeping warm</a> which we just can't sit back and let happen. I for one believe change is possible, but the time has come to move beyond the blame game and take some action.</p><p>So what can be done? With more competition, British consumers would be paying less. The more independent companies there are out there to choose from, the more efficient the big six have to be to win and keep your business. Ultimately though, as long as they can predatory price – offering new customers, or those threatening to leave them, significantly better prices than customers that have been loyal to them for years – newer entrants won't be able to compete.</p><p>In a proper market, with real competition, this practice would end. Very simply, suppliers would be prevented from charging either a lot more or a lot less than the actual cost of energy they supply. Customers would know whether they're getting a good deal or not. Small suppliers would spring up and force the incumbents to become more efficient. We can do that - and the effect would be enormous, almost overnight.</p><p>If Tuesday's committee hearing showed anything, it is that among all the confusion and complexity of the energy prices debate, one positive outcome is starting to come through: a belief that we can challenge the accepted status quo where customers have an alternative choice. Energy prices are front page news and will stay there until customers feel they are finally getting a fair deal. It's up to politicians and the regulator to be bold now and to see that this happens.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421318865|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|3fe13582b0af23b7a87999ad05e3803e8f26a807 -->",

        "body":"<p>Politicians are feeling the pain of families suffering from what one pay-day borrower described as the problem of the money running out before the week does. Labour's latest party political broadcast might have taken its script from the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171766_333999.pdf\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics</a>' <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171766_333999.pdf\" title=\"\">monthly economic review</a>, published on Wednesday. Disposable income hasn't grown since 2009. What's even more revealing is the change in where the money goes. Ten years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/30/household-spending-income-fuel-essentials-ons-energy\" title=\"\">essential spending</a> took just under a fifth of disposable income. Now it's more than a quarter. And while the consumer price index has risen by 30%, gas and electricity prices have soared by 120% and 190% respectively. So the share they take of household spending is up too, and for many homes – families with small children, pensioner households – it'll really matter. The recovery has a long way to go before, in Ed Miliband's telling conference metaphor, it lifts the little boats along with the yachts. And now that the pensions minister Steve Webb wants to cap pension fund fees, it's clear the intensifying political contest over energy prices is just the first of what may be many battles that pitches politicians against suppliers of essential services that voters have come to mistrust.</p><p>The danger is that in fixing one thing, another gets broken. The energy market is a good example. The impact of carbon pricing, for example, which is meant simply to ensure the polluter pays, is confused by being applied differentially to gas and electricity and between business and domestic users. Labour allowed vertical integration between energy generation and supply in the belief it could hold down prices, but instead it seems to allow the big six companies to make even more profits. The introduction of an annual competition review, details of which the energy secretary Ed Davey is due to announce in the commons on Thursday, is unlikely to make a difference without a wider reform of the market structure, something Labour now promises would follow after its price freeze. Meanwhile, there's a growing sense that the suppliers have managed to capture the debate, and make it not about their price rises but about the impact of green levies instead. And although Mr Davey promised to \"fight like a tiger\" to defend the levies, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/24/energy-bills-green-levies-taxation-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg</a> suggests the same funding could come out of general taxation; that might be popular, but would sacrifice the power of levies to nudge consumers into cutting back.</p><p>The trust-busting mood of the times finds a more straightforward target in occupational pensions, where – as tough <a href=\"http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/markets-work/pensions/#.UnEuXxnsqAE\" title=\"\">Office of Fair Trading analysis</a> has confirmed – a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/07/pensions-conspiracy-against-public-editorial\" title=\"\">conspiracy against the public</a> has been indulged in for far too long. Just as with energy, vertical integration between different parts of the business – saving, managing investment and annuitisation – obscures the underlying economics to the detriment of the customer. There are no environmental complications here: this is a simpler case of savers getting fleeced.</p><p>Desperate to get his semi-compulsory occupational pensions up and running without operational chaos, Mr Webb had pursued a quiet life with the industry. As recently as January, he likened the idea of capping charges to fixing <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/9821473/Minister-applies-baked-bean-test-to-pension-charges.html\" title=\"\">the price of baked beans</a>. Now, however, he has launched \"a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/30/pension-scheme-charges-cap-ministers-consultation\" title=\"\">full-frontal assault</a>\", publishing calculations showing how innocuous-sounding annual levies of 1.5% can disguise the swiping of a third of a pension pot, and he talks of imposing a comprehensive cap of 0.75% of fund. Bravo. That word \"comprehensive\" is all important: barring the financial services industry from any particular levy is merely to squeeze the balloon. As Labour's Gregg McClymont has pointed out for years, charges such as transaction costs are so hidden that not even the insurers record them. Having neglected to enforce openness, the government could now discover – as the consultants warn – that if you can't measure it, you can't manage it. Scepticism in government about the market is overdue. Part of the answer is better regulation, but that's not going to happen until we have real transparency.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421328862|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|b075ba59431fa7d5219dfc74f630ce3b2cfb3290 -->",

Most consumers do – that's why energy companies are against a price freeze.</p><p>\"You're so on the side the energy companies, we should call them the big seven – the prime minister and the big six energy companies.</p><p>\"In opposition, you said there was a problem in the relationship between wholesale and retail prices and you went on to say the first thing you've got to do is give the regulator the teeth to order those reductions are made. And that is what we would do.</p><p>\"Why, when it comes to the energy companies, has it gone from Rambo to Bambi in four short years?\"</p><p>He also asked: \"Can you explain why when wholesale prices have hardly moved since a year ago, retail prices are rising by about 10%?\"</p><p>Cameron said Miliband had been responsible for changing the competition market in energy with the result that the number of firms had fallen from 20 to 6. He also challenged Labour for voting in the Lords in favour of a decarbonisation target for the energy industry, something that is likely to lead to an increase in prices. \"If you want a price freeze, why have you just voted for a price rise?\" Cameron asked.</p><p>In the noisy exchanges on an issue that has caused Cameron difficulties for nearly six weeks, the prime minister said: \"What we need in the energy market is more competition and lower levies and charges to drive profits and prices down.\"</p><p>He also claimed Miliband had switched his own energy supply to a firm that opposed Labour's proposed 20-month price freeze.</p><p>He rebutted: \"Because we need competition and rolling back the cost of charges. Switching is part of competition.\"</p><p>Miliband pointed out that as recently as January the prime minister had been promoting a green levy that was the \"bigger the better\".</p><p>And he said: \"On competition, here's the problem. You want a review on energy policy but that's exactly what the energy companies want. A long inquiry, kicking the problem into the long grass.</p><p>\"How will a review that reports next summer help people to pay their bills this winter?\"</p><p>Cameron replied: \"We want a competition inquiry that starts straight away.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421295751|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|5c01ad7efc7b5b1734bafa1edaa23bea280fc591 -->",

        "headline":"Big six energy companies 'more socially responsible than supermarkets'",
        "body":"<p>Britain's biggest energy companies are more socially responsible than supermarkets in their treatment of cash-strapped customers, according to the industry's trade body.</p><p>Energy UK said the help offered by its members to pensioners and low-income households was the equivalent of giving shoppers £135 per year. \"If you are food-poor, there is no responsibility on supermarkets to give £130 towards your shop, but the energy companies will give a discount, and there is assistance available if your home is badly insulated,\" said Angela Knight, the chief executive of Energy UK.</p><p>Knight spoke amid warnings from campaigners that some households are being forced to \"heat or eat\" following the announcement of energy price rises of between 8% and 10% by the largest energy firms.<br /><a href=\"http://www.guardianenergycomparison.co.uk/guardian_editorial\"><br />Gas and electricity prices</a> have increased by four times the rate of inflation over the past 10 years, according to analysis by the TUC. Energy costs rose by 152% from September 2003 to September 2013, compared with the RPI rate of inflation of 38% over the same period, and a 43% increase in the cost of food.</p><p>Speaking at an event to promote a helpline offering vulnerable consumers advice on a range of assistance schemes, and the day after energy bosses appeared before MPs to explain the recent round of increases, Knight said rising prices were \"outside the ability of energy companies to fix … There are other costs such as the levies and wholesale gas prices that are rising.\"</p><p>However, suppliers are under pressure to justify price rises after the regulator Ofgem showed that network costs have risen by just £15 since last year, wholesale costs by £10 and green costs by £10. And they are set to come under more scrutiny from the energy secretary, Ed Davey, who is expected to announce an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/30/david-cameron-inquiry-competition-energy-industry\">annual competition review of the industry</a> on Thursday. This review is likely to be conducted by Ofgem, the Office of Fair Trading and the new Competition and Markets Authority, the body that will succeed the current competition commission.</p><p>At the Home Heat Helpline launch, it was announced that more than £300m has been provided by energy companies this year to fund the Warm Homes Discount, which is primarily available to pensioners receiving pensions credit.</p><p>However, Mervyn Kohler, of the charity Age UK, said the money available to help vulnerable people was nowhere near enough: \"There needs to be a more coherent programme with proper energy-efficient improvements in people's homes. Year after year the financial help available is discussed, but the only sensible strategy is a vigorous thermal efficiency drive to improve the efficiency of our old housing stock, as we haven't got this with ECO and the green deal.\"</p><p>As a former chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, Knight has experience of defending large organisations making vast profits. At the BBA she defended bankers' pay by saying it was a world market and high wages had to be offered to attract the best.</p><p>NPower, British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power have all said they will increase electricity and gas prices by between 8% and 10.4%. E.ON and EDF are the only members of the big six that have not followed suit. The increases will take the cost of an average dual-fuel bill to more than £1,400 a year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421336329|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|d04eb89592b244e9dae46bd9ccaad6897f342680 -->",

Energy bills in the 17-nation single currency zone were 1.7% lower in September than they were a year earlier, continuing a downward trend in recent months.</p><p>In the UK, the Office for National Statistics says that the average consumer could expect to pay 8% more for both gas and electricity in September than a year earlier. Fuel makes up only 5% of the average family's weekly spending (rather more for those on lower incomes) but as the ONS pointed out earlier this week, rising gas and electricity bills are having a dampening impact on the economy because households have less left over at the end of the month for discretionary spending.</p><p>So what's going on? When pressed to explain why they are raising domestic energy tariffs by 10%, the Big Six energy companies tend to say either that they are being forced to pass on green levies to their customers, that they are being forced to pay more for fuel on the world's wholesale energy markets or that above-inflation increases are needed for investment in new capacity.</p><p>Stephen Fitzpatrick, managing director of Ovo energy, blew the gaff on the \"it's all down to global forces\" explanation when giving evidence to a parliamentary committee this week, noting that wholesale prices have been going down not up. This is now underlined by the data from Eurostat, which shows that across the Channel these lower wholesale prices are being reflected in lower bills to consumers and falling inflation.</p><p>Green levies, which make up just 9% of the average energy bill, could not possibly explain such a disparity. Nor could movements in the pound, since sterling has moved slightly higher on the foreign exchanges this year. All of which means that the energy companies had better get started on building all the new power plants they have been promising. Before people draw the obvious conclusion: that they are using their market power to rook the customer.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421402824|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|246a08bd1c3f31eac7a251e8a4c9b619f7b284b8 -->",

That's not acceptable. It won't necessarily come down to 24 hours for everyone straight away. This is going to take some time to deliver.\"</p><p>In banking, the average switch time was five days, he said.</p><p>He promised the government \"will be on the backs of the big six until they ensure customers can switch and get the best deals that the market is providing\".</p><p>He said he was worried that it was \"the internet-savvy or the smartphone generation that were getting the best deals. I want markets to help the fuel-poor.\"</p><p>He added he hoped the Big Energy Saving Network – volunteer community activists meeting energy customers face to face – would be trained up to help the most vulnerable on how to reduce their bills, or switch.</p><p>He said he had already changed the electricity wholesale market so independent generators can trade and sell in that market alongside the big six companies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421352034|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|b5865ec18a08f30c479b04c456ffa3df82b43115 -->",

        "body":"<p>Voters in the \"squeezed middle\" are flocking to the Labour party after Ed Miliband pledged to freeze fuel bills for 20 months if he wins the next general election, according to a new poll that shows a dramatic fall in support for the Liberal Democrats.</p><p>As energy prices dominated prime minister's questions for the fourth week in a row on Wednesday, in the wake of Miliband's speech to the Labour conference last month, the YouGov poll shows a 14-point increase in support for Labour among voters classified as members of the \"squeezed middle\". Support for the Liberal Democrats in this group has fallen by 21 points while the Tories have seen their support fall by five points.</p><p>Peter Kellner, the president of YouGov, writes in an article for Progress magazine: \"Ed Miliband has won the battle; his challenge now is to win the war. His attack on Britain's energy companies struck a nerve: they are now hated even more than the banks. His call for a 20-month freeze in gas and electricity prices, pending measures to make the energy market more competitive, left the Conservatives floundering.\"</p><p>Kellner estimates that the \"squeezed middle\" – people in the ABC1 social groups under the age of 60 who feel they are struggling to make ends meet – account for 26% of the electorate.</p><p>Labour has increased its support among this group from 32% at the time of the last election in 2010 to 46% this month – a 14-point increase. The Lib Dems have seen their support among this group fall from 29% to 8% – a 21-point fall. The Tories have seen a five-point fall – from 32% to 27%.</p><p>But the poll also suggests Labour needs to tread with care as it draws up its tax and spending plans for the 2015 election. It found support among the \"squeezed middle\" and \"comfortable middle\" for lower taxes in the next year if public finances improve (40% and 35% respectively for the two groups) when voters are asked what would be best for their family. But support for lower taxes falls (16% and 14% respectively) when they are asked what would be best for Britain.</p><p>The poll found low support for reducing the government's debts (12% and 18% among the two \"middle\" groups) when voters are asked what is best for their families. This rises to 34% and 46% among the two groups when voters are asked what is best for Britain.</p><p>Kellner writes: \"The challenge is to fend off the charges from the Conservatives that are bound to follow: that Labour is taking risks by using any spare cash to do these things rather than paying down the government debt. Labour must also resist the temptation to devote any spare money purely to public services. If all the extra money is used to increase spending and none to easing the strain on voters who do not feel comfortably off, then the party is likely to be punished at the election.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421408684|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|ef09e3e6445afe8dbd5d3250b1df55045a095c71 -->",

        "headline":"UK customers on Economy 7 night-time electricity tariffs face 35% rise in bills",
        "body":"<p>Poorer households that rely on Economy 7 tariffs face some of the steepest rises to energy bills in the coming weeks, with some customers paying 35% more for their night-time electricity than they were 13 months ago.</p><p>In the week that energy bosses appeared in the House of Commons to defend their 8%-10% \"average\" price rises, it has emerged that some SSE customers on the Economy 7 tariff will see part of their bills rise by 17% later this month. The increase comes on top of a 15% increase imposed this time last year.</p><p>SSE's managing director, William Morris, told MPs this week that he profoundly regretted having to put prices up by an average of 8.2%. SSE has 500,000 households on Economy 7 bills.</p><p>Scottish Power and Npower also imposed night-time tariff hikes of around 13% in the eastern region alone when they put up prices last month.</p><p>The increases will particularly affect vulnerable households that rely on electric storage heaters, many of which are installed in social housing.</p><p>Around 10% of UK households are thought to use the Economy 7 tariff, which  offers significantly cheaper electricity for seven hours at night. Users typically heat hot water cylinders and recharge storage heaters at the lower rate, but pay more than standard customers for electricity used during the day.</p><p>One SSE customer who contacted the Guardian this week said he was appalled when he opened a letter from SSE announcing the price increase, which takes effect on 15 November. \"There was no mention of the previous price or the percentage that the Economy 7 rate would go up by. Only when I looked at what I had been paying did the true size of the price increase emerge,\" he said.</p><p>The customer, who wished not to be named, said SSE's Economy 7 tariff night-time rate in his area had increased from 5.98p per unit to 6.92p per unit on 15 October 2012 and is about to increase to 8.11p per unit: a 35.6% increase in 13 months.</p><p>\"This tariff is used especially by people with storage heaters, where it will constitute their major energy cost. I guess that this will include a disproportionate number of both poor people and old people – this is exactly the politically sensitive group whom you might think energy suppliers would try to hit less, not more,\" he said.</p><p>On Thursday, SSE again blamed the steep price increase on government levies, which it said were beyond its control.</p><p>The company added: \"SSE has capped the rate increase, however, to ensure that the Economy 7 tariff remains cheaper than the general domestic tariff wherever off-peak usage accounts for more than 30% of the total.\"</p><p>SSE said it was campaigning against \"the unfair penalisation of electricity-only customers due to the disproportionate way in which the cost of government schemes are levied on electricity usage, [which] often means that customers who can least afford it end up paying the most towards government schemes\".</p><p>Mark Todd of Energyhelpline.com said: \"The price announcements by the energy firms are always averages and invariably disguise some bigger increases, and it looks as though Economy 7 customers are being harder hit than&nbsp;others.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421413864|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|c8c1dc1b23cbfdf0b5f4997dc44c314e68730c6d -->",

        "headline":"Energy secretary considers criminal sanctions for market manipulation",
        "body":"<p>The government  has set out a wave of reforms for the energy industry including the prospect of criminal sanctions for market manipulation, an Ofgem investigation into companies' profits, and moves to make it possible for consumers to switch suppliers within 24 hours.</p><p>Giving the annual energy statement to MPs on Thursday, the energy secretary, Ed Davey, said: \"The public need to know our reforms will have teeth, that companies that play outside the rules will be penalised and fined.\"</p><p>But the announcements in the Commons were immediately derided by shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint, who said they would let the big energy firms off the hook, and claimed that the government had repeatedly announced reviews of the market that led to nothing.</p><p>Davey said he would \"consult on the introduction of criminal sanctions for anyone found manipulating energy markets and harming the consumer interest\".</p><p>Energy department officials argued it was not clear that existing criminal sanctions on market manipulation applied to the energy industry. Sanctions might  include a jail sentence of as long as seven years.</p><p>Paul Massara, chief executive of RWE npower, one of the \"big six\" energy firms, tweeted in angry response: \"Lots of wild talk about cartels but no evidence and the facts don't support. Where is the evidence? Put up or shut up.\"</p><p>Only four months ago Davey announced that Ofgem, the energy regulator had been given new powers to demand access to information, inspect premises and impose unlimited fines for those who break the law.</p><p>Davey also said that he expected Ofgem to provide a full report by the spring on the financial transparency of the energy companies and ways it could be improved.  Ofgem's own data suggests wholesale prices were almost flat over the past year, rising by just 1.7%.  But the energy companies have criticised Ofgem's approach, saying its method of measuring does not reflect the way they buy gas and electricity.&nbsp;</p><p>Ofgem has repeatedly said it believes the energy firms' profits are broadly transparent, but a fortnight ago conceded to the energy select committee that a further review was worthwhile. Critics claim it is not possible to work out what prices energy generation companies are charging to their retail arms in the wholesale market.</p><p>Davey said there would be an annual review of competition in the market.</p><p>Davey also wants energy firms to allow customers to switch providers more quickly than the current average of five weeks,  which includes a statutory two-week cooling off period before the process of switching can start. The industry says the two-week cooling off period is intended to protect consumers.</p><p>It is estimated that 3 million customers switch each year and firms such as First Utility has said it should be possible to offer a target of 24-hour switching, something Davey would like all firms to match.</p><p>It has been alleged that energy firms overcharge customers that are unlikely to move and offer far cheaper rates to those liable to switch.</p><p>Davey said he feared only \"the smartphone generation and the internet-savvy\" knew how to switch, adding: \"We want to push energy companies to make switching quicker and easier because consumer action can force suppliers to change their ways.\"</p><p>He added that bills were being redesigned to give people the information they needed to make switching easy.</p><p>Davey also announced that his department would work with the Post Office to signpost elderly and vulnerable people to the 500 volunteers being trained by the Big Energy Saving Network to help people find ways to cut their bills.</p><p>In her response to Davey, Flint said: \"Let me ask you how is it possible that social and environmental obligations, which on your own department's figures only make up £113 of people's bills, can account for price rises of £400?\"</p><p>She also pointed out: \"There have been 17 investigations into the energy markets since 2001. If you are today announcing the launch of a new annual review of competition in the energy markets, what on earth has Ofgem been doing all this time? And what do you expect them to find out in the next 10 months which they haven't discovered in the last 10 years?</p><p>\"The last review by Ofgem, which you gave your full backing to, only finished in June,\" she added.</p><p>Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, the industry body, said the timetable for switching was partly laid down in law. \"Switching quickly, yes, it can be done, and there's certainly a lot of work that's under way and we can bring forward some of those changes pretty quickly,\" she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421383916|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|5ec19f44d9637e35fa98396579bde8c0968c5698 -->",

        "body":"<p>As the light in the tea-time sky grows less, autumn begins to uncoil itself over the land like an intemperate vagabond. Today, in the air I can smell the scant trail of smoke from the fires lit in the hearths of homes that are trying to keep the cold outdoors – despite the spiralling costs of energy. This inclement weather leads me on cat's paws to a winter that occurred, long ago during the Great Depression when I was a bairn and there was nowt to eat and nowt to heat. It was truly a time of discontent with more than 20 million people mired in enormous economic difficulties. The era was so desperate that I, along with other children from working class stock pinched coal from colliery slag heaps and hoped that those busted shards of fuel would burn the damp out of our dismal terraced houses.</p><p>Today, the living conditions of an average citizen are not as bleak as those that I experienced as a boy. However, for those who must contend with austerity on fixed wages or on a pension, the modern world is a harsh and unforgiving place. Moreover, this government and its support for big business over the ordinary consumer have pushed many economically vulnerable to the edge of the civilised state.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most distressing examples of corporate profit hubris is the increase in heating and electricity bills by four of the big six energy companies. This jump by almost 10% in the cost of heating one's home will cause enormous hardship to the elderly in this country who are for the most part not wealthy and struggle to keep up with the cost of living.</p><p>This may be why the PM's recent remedy to combat the chill of winter with a jumper stung me as much as chilblains did in my boyhood. It clarified to me what I had already suspected, that in Whitehall there are few who have experienced the ordinary trials and tribulations of middle  and working class life. One quarter of this country's population has experienced fuel poverty, which means they have had to economise to keep their homes heated or, even worse, they have gone without food to keep the lights on in their houses. Whether the government wishes to acknowledge it or not this is a real crisis for too many people in this country. Yet MPs are more accustomed to listening to the concerns of corporate lobbyists for the energy industry.</p><p>It is not that our politicians don't have solutions to the escalating cost of energy because each party has offered remedies. Some even make sense – like capping energy prices, taxing these companies or subsidising the cost of heating one's home. The problem is that all of these proposals to cure the outrageous price of energy are for winters in the future. This is why I fear that this coming winter will be unnecessarily harsh on too many vulnerable people because it's impossible to keep warm on promises of relief that can't be burned until 2015.</p><p>Besides, it is not proper or just that a senior citizen, who has contributed to the prosperity of this country, through their taxes, their volunteer work and sometimes even through national service, must spend their golden years worried about whether they should use their pension money to have a proper meal or keep warm. As a pensioner, I have been one of those fortunate few who have not been forced by economic necessity to choose between eating and heating. However, I know I am the exception to the rule because I have visited too many friends who have not been as lucky as me. Sadly, I have witnessed their decline hastened by rising consumer energy prices that have left them financially constrained and in poor health. To me there is no more lonely end, for a well-spent life than to ebb away from existence in one's parlour while huddled near a dim electric fire that sputters out inconsequential heat.</p><p>Warm domiciles and proper nutrition are as essential to the old as they are to the young and no one in this country should be allowed to suffer, to become ill or die because they cannot afford to absorb endless energy price hikes that enrich the few at the expense of many. It doesn't take a degree in medicine to know that if a person can't afford to heat their home and they are old; they are more likely to become ill and to avail themselves of our already overburdened healthcare services.</p><p>Winter is nigh and I am worried that this generation of politicians and business executives are so ignorant or indifferent to history that they are leading this country back to those grim days when fuel was so expensive for ordinary folk that lads like me had to scoff coal to keep warm. Before the deep freeze encases our land in its icy grip, we have to address the hardship that excessive fuel prices will cause working families. But we also need to act immediately to prevent the innumerable tragedies this winter that will befall the elderly and vulnerable who are unable to keep themselves warm and fed because of spiralling energy prices.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421603262|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|70f931cffdb17bffdeb9af2c231e572d666832bf -->",

        "headline":"Energy bills: npower amassed £400m credit from customers",
        "body":"<p>The row over high energy bills was stoked on Sunday, with new figures seen by the Guardian showing that npower, one of the big six suppliers, owed its customers almost £400m at one stage last year.</p><p>The latest controversy around overcharging comes as Sam Laidlaw, the boss of Centrica and the most senior executive in the energy supply sector, breaks his silence to admit at the CBI conference on Monday that public trust in his industry has broken down.</p><p>Npower, which is owned by the German generator RWE, claimed the £400m had been created largely through the direct debit system as householders built up a balance ahead of higher winter fuel consumption.</p><p>But Caroline Flint MP, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said energy prices were high enough without people being charged for gas and electricity they were yet to use.</p><p>\"It is one thing for energy companies to spread the costs of energy evenly throughout winter and summer, but quite another to have millions of customers in credit for the whole year. Energy companies must put an end to this overcharging,\" she said.</p><p>The npower figures, from May 2012, show that 3.7 million customers were owed an average of £106.89 each, while 1.8 million householders owed the company an average of £82.56.</p><p>This means that npower held £395m of customers' money while being owed around £145m, during a period when only 65% of the company's customer base used direct debits to pay their bills.</p><p>The sums involved would have enabled npower to earn substantial amounts of interest, but the company said the practice benefited everyone.</p><p>\"Paying by direct debit allows customers to smooth out the cost of energy over the year, meaning they often build up credit in summer when energy usage is typically lower,\" it said in a statement.</p><p>Npower said that direct debit assessments are undertaken annually and any credit balances above £60 are automatically refunded by direct credit within five days of bills being issued.</p><p>The company pointed out that householders who are still owed money by npower could ask for the balance to be paid back into their bank accounts.</p><p>Npower, which has fewer customers that British Gas or SSE, said it would need time to come up with a more up-to-date calculation on how much it owed customers and vice versa.</p><p>Similar figures for rival power firms are unclear, but a whistleblower from inside British Gas <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/26/british-gas-caroline-flint-credit-windfall\" title=\"\">told the Observer last week that the Centrica subsidiary has amassed a £20m \"credit balance\"</a> in the last financial year's accounts from customers who were in credit but had left their premises or were otherwise uncontactable.</p><p>As controversy over rising fuel costs continue, there is speculation that George Osborne will try to cut £75 a year from bills by switching various green charges into general taxation.</p><p>The chancellor is expected to use the autumn statement on 4 December to unveil plans to transfer the so-called ECO payments to insulate homes from householder to taxpayer.</p><p>Energy companies have been campaigning for this ever since the row over bills became a major political issue when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/24/ed-miliband-labour-freeze-prices-2017\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband promised to implement a 20-month price freeze</a> if Labour is elected in 2015.</p><p>Centrica is convinced that such a move, while popular among customers, would make its own business unviable.</p><p>Laidlaw, however, will give a conciliatory speech to the CBI in which he will acknowledge public disquiet about the energy industry and accept it must concentrate on action rather than words to rebuild trust.</p><p>This contrasts with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/24/energy-firms-declare-war-ed-miliband-fuel-freeze\" title=\"\">aggressive reaction from the industry</a> when Miliband first unveiled his proposal for a price freeze at the Labour party conference, when some senior energy industry figures warned that the lights would go out.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421568587|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1802688d9d950dcd93fdbaa8afd971096862da04 -->",

        "body":"<p>The big six energy companies will on Tuesday be ordered to stop \"sitting on customers' cash\", as the government comes under pressure from Labour to deal with soaring household bills.</p><p>In an assault on overcharging by the utility companies, Greg Barker, a Tory energy minister, will demand to know why gas and electricity firms are hoarding up to £2bn from people who pay by direct debit.</p><p>He will use a meeting with company bosses to ask about reports they are making £36m a year from interest alone because many customers are paying too much when they are automatically charged an estimated amount for their gas and electricity each month.</p><p>A source close to Barker said he will demand the energy companies – British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, EDF, E.ON and npower – declare how much consumer credit they are sitting on and how many of their customers are in credit.</p><p>On Monday night he said it was vital people who paid by direct debt were not \"being unknowingly ripped off\".</p><p>\"The better energy companies will now automatically refund your cash if you build up more money than required to meet your normal bill or will pay you interest if you are in surplus,\" he said. \"However, it looks like some companies aren't doing that and I&nbsp;am determined to get consumers a better deal and call time on the big six sitting on customers' cash.\"</p><p>It comes after the Guardian saw figures showing npower stockpiled £400m at one point last year from customers, while British Gas put £20m in \"credit balances\" into its annual account in one recent financial year.</p><p>Following those revelations, the minister will ask companies to pay interest to customers who are in surplus, following the lead of some small suppliers, including Ovo Energy, which pays 3% interest on credit balances.</p><p>Meanwhile Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, has written to water companies to \"stress the crucial role that the industry can play to bring costs down\" for households.</p><p>He will ask the companies to consider if they need to apply the full price increases allowed by the regulator next year, which are likely to be around £12 on the average £388 annual bill. The companies are also being urged to bring in \"social tariffs\" with discounts for households who are struggling to pay.</p><p>The coalition has been searching for ways to reduce household bills after Ed Miliband attacked the government for its failure to act on the \"cost of living crisis\" and offered to freeze gas and electricity prices if he wins power in 2015.</p><p>However, Labour is likely to criticise the government for asking utility companies to change their ways on a voluntary basis, rather than forcing them with laws to treat their customers better.</p><p>\"More than two million households, over one in 10, now spend more than 5% of their income on water according to the regulator and customers in Britain face some of the highest bills in Europe,\" said Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary. \"Yet David Cameron still refuses to require water companies to introduce a social tariff to help those who are struggling, even though only three companies have introduced such a scheme under the current voluntary arrangement.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421648879|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|cdf9d7ce85f6dedec8fb25bdbb374e1a1b653153 -->",

They generate energy. They are wholesalers and retailers. They sell it to themselves before they sell it to us.\"</p><p></p><p>Flint again promised that during its proposed 20-month price freeze a Labour government would break up the big energy companies and  create a market in which the country could be clearer about the true costs of energy.</p><p></p><p>Labour is to stage debates on its plans for a price freeze in both the House of Commons and Lords on Wednesday. In a speech later on Tuesday at Battersea power station, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/05/ed-miliband-tax-living-wage\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband will put his proposals for an energy freeze in the context of his wider cost of living agenda</a>. The party is aware that it has to broaden the cost of living agenda to include economic competence and a future vision of the economy.</p><p></p><p>But Labour is also delighted  it has forced the government on to its chosen battleground of living standards, as opposed to the causes for the return of growth.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680469|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|adcc39389f4af6e35d60a1c973b3b7330fe943ab -->",
