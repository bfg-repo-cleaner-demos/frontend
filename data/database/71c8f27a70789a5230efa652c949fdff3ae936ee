        "body":"<p>In 2003-4, over two million people experienced artist Olafur Eliasson&rsquo;s now iconic installation at Tate Modern, The Weather Project &ndash; the giant sun that bathed visitors in orange light. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, Eliasson wants you to share your local sunrises and sunsets and take part in his project, Share Your Sun.</p> <p>Share Your Sun celebrates the sun as something that belongs to all of us. Wherever we live, we are aware of its warming presence, its ever-changing light and its absence on rainy days.</p> <p>You can be part of this project. Simply capture a video or take a photograph of the sun &ndash; rising, setting, or at any time of day and send it to us via our GuardianWitness smartphone app or by clicking the blue button on this page.</p> <p>All the photos and films will be hosted on <a href=\"http://www.shareyoursun.com\">www.shareyoursun.com.</a> Taken together, the films and images will show not only the movement of the sun but our shared revolution around it.</p> <p>The project runs from 16 October 2013 until 16 March 2014. You can post your sun video or photo at any point over this time, and as well as appearing on Eliasson&rsquo;s site, we&rsquo;ll feature our favourites on the Guardian art and design site.</p> <h2>Terms and conditions:</h2> <p>Only photographs or videos of the sun will be posted.</p> <p>This site may be visited by children and family groups, and will also feature on Olafur Eliasson's website, so only suitable content should be posted. Anyone posting takes full responsibility for the content of the photos and videos.</p> <p>Anyone posting a photo or video here agrees to have their work featured on Olafur Eliasson's website as well as for press and marketing purposes, in the context of the Share Your Sun project.</p> <p>Work submitted will be featured on Olafur Eliasson&rsquo;s website <a href=\"http://www.shareyoursun.com\">www.shareyoursun.com</a> from 16 October 2013 to 16 March 2014.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420040463|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|f7c1b43258973e76421dc15f1833c4d2d2fd5066 -->",

        "headline":"Frieze 2013: the flashest photography",
        "body":"<p>At the time, they were written off as duds. What was the point in having photographs and footage of rocket launches if the rockets were nowhere to be seen? Because of poor timing and bad luck, the photographers and cameramen captured only billowing arcs of smoke. The images were of little use to the small group of undergraduate students and their pioneering lecturer who, in early 1960s Lebanon, were radically attempting to explore new frontiers at the height of the international space race. </p><p>But to <a href=\"http://hadjithomasjoreige.com/\">Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige</a>, film-makers and artists who have spent 13 years uncovering the incredible story of the <a href=\"http://hadjithomasjoreige.com/wide_posts/the-lebanese-rocket-society/\">Lebanese Rocket Society</a>, the images were invaluable. Using the original rolls of film as the foundation for their latest work, the duo have created Dust in the Wind, four curious and beautiful images that stand out at this year's Frieze London. </p><p>\"Most of the photographs didn't capture the take-off because there was no countdown,\" Joreige explains. \"The photographers saw them as missed images, but we don't. They're poetic, a trace of a trace.\" The story of the Lebanese Rocket Society was forgotten for decades; even the duo found it unbelievable at first. Lebanon had only a tiny budget, and yet, with salvaged materials and their own ingenuity, somehow launched 12 rockets – one of which reached the thermosphere. Fascinated by the \"missed images\", Hadjithomas and Joreige used 3D modelling software to precisely calculate and sculpt each plume of smoke. They then laid these transparent plexiglass sculptures over the original images, giving, as Joreige puts it, \"a physicality to what is missing\". The results add a sense of tangibility to a surreal tale.</p><p>Of the other 960 artworks on show at this year's fair, there are a further 148 photographic pieces on display. It scarcely feels like it; hunting them out is a time-consuming affair. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420247005'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1381998611704/Alex_Prager.jpg' alt='Crowd Scene by Alex Prager in situ at Frieze London' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Crowd Scene by Alex Prager at Frieze London. Photograph: Jonny Weeks</figcaption></figure><p>Among the major names exhibited, Thomas Ruff's stands out – his large-scale photograms are spectacular. Created in a digital darkroom, they are sinuous, futuristic and bold. They are not strictly photograms (a fact he acknowledges in labelling them with the abbreviation PHG), though they owe much to the creations of <a href=\"http://www.photograms.org/chapter03.html\">Christian Schad and László Moholy-Nagy</a>, which predate them by almost a century. Ruff's work is neatly juxtaposed by <a href=\"http://www.raphaelhefti.ch/\">Rafael Hefti</a>'s seemingly apocalyptic photograms from his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/09/artist-of-week-raphael-hefti\">Lycopodium</a> series, which are named after the moss he burned on top of the photographic paper to create them.</p><p>Traditional photography can be found at Frieze, too. New images in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/wolfgang-tillmans\">Wolfgang Tillmans</a>' Neue Welt series see him focusing in intimate, obsessive detail on his lover, while a pair of black-and-white <a href=\"http://www.mapplethorpe.org/\">Robert Mapplethorpe</a> prints sit in striking proximity – one of the <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/lotfinderimages/D54210/robert_mapplethorpe_veronica_vera_1982_d5421026h.jpg\">porn actress Veronica Vera, bare-buttocked</a>, and the other, of Mapplethorpe's sometime-boyfriend Jack Walls in formal attire. Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://ryanmcginley.com/photographs/#\">Ryan McGinley</a>'s shocking collage of female nudes feels juvenile next to his thoughtful print of a redhead male entering a wooded swamp (William, Green Swamp). Alex Prager's Crowd Scene is a humorously staged tableaux: the cramped beach, with a bronzed middle-aged man surrounded by characters of all ages and descriptions, contains scenes within scenes. It is a seemingly endless spectacle, like Frieze itself.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420247006'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1381998256963/Aneta_Grzeszykowska_-_Negative_Book_47.jpg' alt='Aneta Grzeszykowska - Negative Book 47' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Negative Book 47. Photograph: Aneta Grzeszykowska</figcaption></figure><p>Aneta Grzeszykowska's Negative Book is the most engrossing of the more experimental works on show. Her large monochrome images – self-portraits with her family – appear peculiar at first glance, and require real contemplation before they can be fully appreciated. Intrigued by the notion of finding a place for herself between the real world and the photographic realm, Grzeszykowska has created a series of images that render herself positive within negative photographs. It's a beguiling effect that uses a simple technique: she paints her skin with black paint, to oppose her surroundings and fellow subjects. Used as creatively as this, photography can arrest your focus entirely – even amid the hoopla of Frieze.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://friezelondon.com/\">Frieze London 2013</a> runs from 17-20 October in London's Regent's Park. The Lebanese Rocket Society film is released in cinemas on 18 October.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420226859|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|18ce74b914847692b8f2d11c73c360028501fecb -->",

It could be one of the many thousands of posters issued by the Chinese Communist Party's Propaganda Department in the 1950s, of rosy-cheeked comrades brimming with vim and vigour. But something's not quite right.</p> <p>In the centre of this vision of optimism, where once might have beamed the <a href=\"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2012/11/09/01_posters_slide-f0f2ec5dd1b8ebd6728c4b47bce3054b673211b0-s6-c30.jpg\">cheerful face of Mao</a>, stands the twisted loop of the <a href=\"http://oma.eu/projects/2002/cctv-%E2%80%93-headquarters\">China Central Television (CCTV) headquarters</a>, radiating a lilac sheen. Framed by the vapour trail of a trio of jet-planes performing a victory flypast into the sunset, the building stands like a triumphal gateway to some promised land of <a href=\"http://maoist.wikia.com/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics\">Socialism with Chinese characteristics</a>.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8b52c4c4-77b4-450f-9c4b-5994f8b5ecfe\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938175770/67151242-ed21-4672-ae82-53dab521578b-307x420.jpeg\" alt=\"'CCTV Tower With Bountiful Harvest'\" width=\"307\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'CCTV Tower With Bountiful Harvest' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>The image could well be the mischievous work of its own architects, the Rotterdam-based practice OMA, which has made its own <a href=\"http://places.designobserver.com/media/images/dunham-jones-koolhaas-2_525.jpg\">collage&nbsp;of the building</a> alongside Kim Jong-il, George W Bush, Saddam Hussein and Jesus for a book cover, as well as an image of it <a href=\"http://file.u148.net/attachments/image/2009/08/cctvav/1.jpg\">bursting into flames</a> behind a spread-legged porn-star. But it is in fact the product of artists from a North Korean painting unit – the very same that used to produce such propaganda images for the Kim regime, but now find themselves designing food packaging in Pyongyang.</p> <p><a href=\"http://koryogroup.com/blog/?p=2087\">The Beautiful Future</a>, which comprises six such paintings to date, is the brainchild of British ex-pat duo Nick Bonner and Dominic Johnson-Hill, who both arrived in the Chinese capital 20 years ago and caught the Beijing bug. Bonner runs <a href=\"http://www.koryogroup.com/\">Koryo Tours</a>, a travel company specialising in trips to the DPRK, while Johnson-Hill presides over a street-wear empire, <a href=\"http://www.plasteredtshirts.com/\">Plastered</a>, producing T-shirts emblazoned with Maoist kitsch. The paintings, on show earlier this month as part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/oct/02/beijing-design-week-china-hutongs-preservation\">Beijing Design Week</a>, are the inevitable result of their mutual obsessions.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9511325e-c111-4475-8a59-f609b6b6fc1e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938299492/09154ddf-4166-426a-afc6-8989c83d820f-460x333.jpeg\" alt=\"'Bird's Nest, Home of the People'\" width=\"460\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'Bird's Nest, Home of the People' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>“North Korean artists are the best people at delivering a message without slogans,” says Bonner, who collects North Korean art and has produced documentaries exploring life in the DPRK – as well as what he describes as “North Korea's first feature-length rom-com” last year, <a href=\"http://www.comradekimgoesflying.com/\">Comrade Kim Goes Flying</a>. “We wanted to show contemporary China as it could have been, if it had continued with Maoist ideology.”</p> <p>One painting shows a line of excited comrades, obediently dressed in Mao suits, filing towards Herzog and de Meuron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/11/architecture.chinaarts2008\">Bird's Nest stadium</a>.

An office scene shows people working at networked computer terminals – painted by artists who in all likelihood have no experience of the internet.</p> <p>“The artists are in a situation where they are painting things they've never seen before,” says Bonner, “which gives the images an even more unreal, dreamlike quality.”</p> <p>An ongoing process since the pre-Olympic frenzy, the paintings are the result of Bonner and Hill sending detailed sketches to the North Korean artists, along with renderings of the buildings in question – as neither CCTV nor the Olympic venues existed at that stage. The artists were then left to fill in the blanks as they wished. The results give an intriguing insight into their vision of what Chinese modernity might be like in a land they will never know.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-53b98afb-9dde-4f21-8c5e-c89b9741ae44\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938601343/7c3c5f1c-29fc-4cb3-8bb5-464486fe9fc3-460x331.jpeg\" alt=\"'Water Cube for Clean Air and Healthy Life'\" width=\"460\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'Water Cube for Clean Air and Healthy Life' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>Thrusting China's contemporary icons into the aesthetic landscape of early Communist propaganda provides a striking image of quite how far the country has come since Deng Xiaoping began his policy of Reform and Opening in 1978. With the (historically disputed) motto “to get rich is glorious,” he catapulted the Middle Kingdom from grey uniformity to technicolour bling, the next 30 years seeing city skylines of chimneys replaced by glitzy baubles of the boom.</p> <p>But just as the billboards of Mao's Great Leap Forward, featuring hoards of <a href=\"http://i1195.photobucket.com/albums/aa383/reverserainbowstar/Vintage%20Ads/Great%20Leap%20Forward%20Propaganda%20Posters/Unknown/CCPIdealSociety.png\">grinning labourers in rude health</a>, masked the reality of work camps and mass starvation, so the glare of these state-sponsored mega-projects happily obscures the human rights abuses and migrant labour conditions that fuel their construction. The super-saturated, unadulterated joy shining out from the canvases is a stark reminder of exactly what is missing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420164584|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|94cb4af72f06860e39234ff1f19e345ff5c4f856 -->",

        "body":"<p>This was taken in the California desert in 1970. At the time, a lot of <a href=\"http://www.oocities.org/tcartz/sacrifice.htm\" title=\"\">monks in Vietnam had set fire to themselves</a> to protest against the war and its expansion into Cambodia. I called the shot Immolation IV. I'd been doing a lot of research into women's history and the practice of <em>sati</em> in India, where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(practice)\" title=\"\">widows are forced to throw themselves into the flames of a funeral fire</a>. So I was interested in the whole practice of immolation, forced and chosen. After all, one could say up to that point women's art and women's history had been immolated.</p><p>I had started exploring the idea of openly female-centred art in 1968, with a&nbsp;series of pieces called <a href=\"http://pacificstandardtimefestival.org/events/a-butterfly-for-pomona-by-judy-chicago-2/\" title=\"\">Atmospheres</a>. These used fireworks and coloured smoke in the landscape. Before that, I had made paintings and sculptures intending to convey emotion through colour. But with my Atmospheres, the smoke provided a liberation from formal structure, while its colour was intended to feminise and soften the environment.</p><p>In 1970, having instituted the <a href=\"http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/\" title=\"\">first feminist art programme at California State University</a>, I began to do a series of Atmospheres called Women and Smoke. My students would get involved: I'd paint their bodies to match or contrast with the colours of the smoke. This one, from that series,  features a woman called <a href=\"http://faithwilding.refugia.net/\" title=\"\">Faith Wilding</a>, now a well-known cyberartist.</p><p>I stopped doing fireworks pieces in 1974. I'd been training to be a pyrotechnician through an apprenticeship at a firework company in California, but&nbsp;the owner was sexually harassing me. I simply could not continue. Another reason why I stopped was that this was a very different time: artists could just go out into the environment and do things without a permit. I'd just tell my friends where we were going, and everyone would turn up and participate by lighting flares, bringing food or taking pictures.</p><p>Only very recently has there been interest in my Atmospheres – for a very&nbsp;long time, nobody knew anything about them. I think this image still resonates in terms of women's experience in the world, their self-sacrifice, their sacrifice in culture. Just look at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/malala-yousafzai\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai</a>, the girl in Pakistan who was attacked for wanting to go to school. It's tragic, but my image still has something to say.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420161812|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|6c62585d13f33eafb5cc098b36ccab2cbd584f88 -->",

I have tracked a pool of ink across nice grey floors, and almost been splatted by paintballs. I have eyed up a dangling noose, but it looks like someone else has already tried E<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/18/elmgreen-dragset-v-a-through-the-keyhole\" title=\"\">lmgreen &amp; Dragset</a>'s gibbet (the frayed rope lies useless on the floor). That was when I climbed back into the womb to try to escape, only to be pounced on by a gang of paparazzi. All this, and I've only been at Frieze for two hours. I do so love an art fair.</p><p>Once more into the killing fields! The artists represented by London's <a href=\"http://www.limoncellogallery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Limoncello gallery</a> hang around its stand, waiting for someone to chat them up, or possibly buy them. People are so much more fun than art – and by and large self-cleaning. Nearby, at <a href=\"http://www.fluxiagallery.com/\" title=\"\">Fluxia</a> (over from Milan), puddles of black goo sit on the floor, with decorative bits of binbag and weeds mired in the stickiness. What would one do with these cowpat-sized objects? Or with the giant black foil rock that hangs from the ceiling of a Berlin stand? I guess you could position yourself under it, so it looks like a \"thinks\" bubble, to signal your bad mood.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420250852'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381944427887/Adrian-Searle-inside-Judi-010.jpg' alt='Adrian Searle inside Judith Rubell’s Portrait of the Artist, 2013' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Don’t ask … Adrian Searle inside Jennifer Rubell’s Portrait of the Artist, 2013. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=\"http://www.sadiecoles.com/\" title=\"\">Sadie Coles</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ursfischer.com/images\" title=\"\">Urs Fischer</a>'s giant fried egg lies on the carpet, perfectly cooked, but out of scale to any but the most gargantuan appetite (and everybody knows collectors only peck at things, their appetites reserved only for beefed-up art).</p><p>Art fairs may be all the same, filled with schlock, shiny things, grim things,&nbsp;and things that make you wonder why galleries across the globe bothered to drag them all the way here, but there's always something to brighten your day as you wander the aisles. The 11th incarnation of Frieze is&nbsp;more manageable than most, with better lighting, wider aisles and a bigger spread of behemoth mega-galleries and startup spaces, young galleries and old lags. Not that the art&nbsp;is&nbsp;necessarily better, though the galleries seem to be trying harder this&nbsp;year.</p><p>Now for a nice lie down. In the <a href=\"http://friezelondon.com/news/frieze-projects-2013-participating-artists/\" title=\"\">Project Space</a>, a fountain in the middle of a bed spouts black ink on to the white sheets, and on to the book being read aloud by Lili Reynaud-Dewar, nestling on the plumped-up pillows. It's a dirty book anyway, In My Room by Guillaume Dustan, and as she reads the line, \"I was lying on the bed jerking off, smoking a joint\" in a delicate voice, the artist starts getting spattered, too. More ink leaks from the pump beneath the bed and oozes over my shoes. I like to get up close and personal at fairs. It's the only way to focus.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420250854'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381943963026/Dunno-by-Urs-Fischer-008.jpg' alt='Dunno, by Urs Fischer' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Dunno, by Urs Fischer, 2012. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than the usual collection of cash-cow artists, Lisson shows a single work, a huge spiral Plexiglas corridor by veteran American artist <a href=\"http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/dan-graham/\" title=\"\">Dan Graham</a>. You wander in to the middle, view the passing crowds through the curving walls, then walk out again, refreshed. It is an oasis. Nearby, at Gavin Brown, two lovely nocturnal cityscapes by <a href=\"http://www.alexkatz.com/\" title=\"\">Alex Katz</a>, with lit windows on a dark New York night, look over Rob Pruitt's mad, humanoid fluorescent orange traffic cones. This is fun. Round the corner is another big Katz, of buildings in a blizzard. It is magical.</p><p>Finding things that stop you in your tracks here is easy, but mostly for the wrong reasons. You tend to gawp, incredulous. There are a great many overblown stupidities here, the sort that only seem to come out at art fairs. You could count <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/koons\" title=\"\">Jeff Koons</a>'s huge wrapped bouquet and his cute pussy-in-a-sock sculpture among these, though there are many who see his work as a Duchampian critique of excess.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.warhol.christies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SLIDE-6-Portrait-of-the-Artist-840x560.jpg\" title=\"\">Jennifer Rubell's giant, reclining, all-white Portrait of the Artist</a> has a large sculpted hollow for a womb. You can climb in and curl up, in full view of the passing trade. As a serious art critic, I felt it my duty to get on board. What would you do with a thing like this? Where would anyone keep it? Why? Do&nbsp;not ask.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420250855'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381944042035/Cat-on-a-Clothes-Line-Yel-008.jpg' alt='Cat on a Clothes Line (Yellow), by Jeff Koons' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Cat on a Clothes Line (Yellow), by Jeff Koons, 1994-2001.

How these people keep themselves amused all day every day at Frieze is a mystery. Are they naked under there?</p><p>On Juana de Aizpuru's stand, Tania Bruguera has reproduced the infamous Nazi \"Arbeit macht frei\" sign from Auschwitz concentration camp. The original was stolen in 2009 (it has since been recovered). Bruguera's copy leans in a corner, surrounded by metal-cutting tools. The artist wishes, apparently, to reference historical memory.</p><p>Never a great context for looking at anything, fairs are more and more the places where collectors congregate and buy. In an unfortunate juxtaposition, a drawing of a lemon by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/01/mike-kelley-american-artist-dies\" title=\"\">Mike Kelley</a> hangs over the sign referencing the song by Led Zeppelin about squeezing my lemon till the juice runs down my leg. For some reason, all this upset me, but only for&nbsp;a moment. After a bit, you just stop caring.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420250856'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381943879877/Le-Monde-en-Miniature-et--010.jpg' alt='Le Monde en Miniature et la Mode en Miniature, by Meschac Gaba' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Le Monde en Miniature et la Mode en Miniature, by Meschac Gaba, 2008.\n Photograph: S/arah Lee for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>What is the right context for Bruguera's sign? Everything becomes a hostage to fortune here. You&nbsp;have to be open to the absurd. At Stevenson, from South Africa, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/01/tate-modern-africa-ibrahim-el-salahi-meschac-gaba\" title=\"\">Meschac Gaba</a> shows an array of children's clothes, all embroidered with volatile French words: Kalachnikov. Inceste. Pédophilie. Prison. Slavery. Sida (Aids). Terroriste. In part, this is a play on shop displays, and the kinds of signage kids all over the world wear on their clothing. But this is more about the signs people don't wear. These words are labels that float about and sometimes stick.</p><p>You have to keep moving, stay a moving target. Swivel-eyed dealers wait to pounce. Here's a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gerhard-richter\" title=\"\">Gerhard Richter</a>, there's a room of shouty Julian Schnabel paintings, now a sculpture of a squatting woman delivering a very small poo, by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/21/david-shrigley-q-and-a-interview\" title=\"\">David Shrigley</a>. And over there, a thing that looks like art but probably isn't. This time next year, it will be forgotten, probably in a collector's warehouse somewhere. At Laura Bartlett Gallery, gigantic currency notes lie framed on the floor. Mmmm, smell that money – but watch out for the cowpats.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420179925|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|c8435f38feaf835b5257647bab2a684f405e1834 -->",

        "headline":"Frieze Art Fair: Buyer choice expands from porn and puddles to a Brueghel",
        "body":"<p>It is chucking it down in Regent's Park, cars are splashing pedestrians, expensive frocks and suits are getting drenched. And, once you are inside the UK's biggest commercial art fair, you can add to the experience by buying your own dirty black puddle.</p><p>Each one of Marlie Mul's resin and sand hyperreal puddles would cost you €4,000 (£3,400)from the <a href=\"http://friezelondon.com\" title=\"\">Frieze</a> stand belonging to <a href=\"http://www.fluxiagallery.com\" title=\"\">Fluxia</a>, a young gallery based in Milan.</p><p>If you are not interested in splashing out on a puddle, then there are a further 151 contemporary art galleries displaying works in the vast tent that has appeared in the London park for the past 10 years.</p><p>As thousands descend on the fair – some buying, an awful lot more wishing they had the money to buy – hundreds of other galleries and museums open shows and have parties all over the capital. It is an art equivalent of the Japanese cherry blossom.</p><p>This year's Frieze is as dizzying and as diverse as ever. You can see astonishingly expensive works by Jeff Koons (\"We don't release prices to the press,\" a Gagosian gallerist sniffed); and you can see far, far more affordable works by the possible next generation – for example post-graduate Goldsmiths students Sam Keogh and Joseph Noonan-Ganley, on display at <a href=\"http://www.kerlin.ie\" title=\"\">Kerlin Gallery</a>'s stand.</p><p>And you can see porn. There are content warning notices but it is very easy to stumble into a screening of Omer Fast's Everything That Rises Must Converge, a four-channel film exploring the everyday and often ordinary lives of four hardcore porn film performers. It is being seen for the first time and does not spare viewers the graphic detail \"although one of the things we found very compelling is the banality of the day at work\", said Euridice Arratia of Berlin gallery <a href=\"http://www.arratiabeer.com\" title=\"\">Arratia Beer</a>. \"They are very regular people, there is an unexpected normality.\"</p><p>Arratia conceded it is a difficult work to sell – you would need €65,000 – but she hopes people will come and sit down and watch it.</p><p>A rather less in your face film is on display at Kate MacGarry's gallery stall. Marcus Coates – one of the artists shortlisted to be next up on London's Fourth Plinth – has made a film about hospice patient Alex.</p><p>Although the view is only from his window, the story is an epic one in that Alex told Coates he had always wanted to go the Amazon but obviously could not now – so could the artist go, which he did.</p><p>\"It is a very moving film,\" said MacGarry. \"It is a very strong work which says a lot about Marcus's wider practice.\"</p><p>Also on display are National Geographic-style photographs Coates has made of birds and animals and then screwed up and let unravel. Each are in an edition of three and would cost you £4,500.</p><p>Should visitors need a break from the crowds and intensity of Frieze, a good place could be a curvy glass pavilion installed as the only exhibit for the <a href=\"http://www.lissongallery.com\" title=\"\">Lisson Gallery</a>. Called Groovy Spiral, visitors are encouraged to walk into it.</p><p>Lisson's Ossian Ward said the work was a \"people-watching experience. You feel like you're in the calm in the middle of the storm and you're on show as well. It is a nice place to be.\"</p><p>It is a meditative work, on Wednesday still for sale for $600,000 (£375,000). Ward said: \"You don't get many moments for reflection at an art fair generally, a lot of what you see gets immediately forgotten, so it's nice to have that one moment. Frieze has matured so galleries should mature with the fair and feel confident to do big and bold statements and not feel they just have to chase after the money.\"</p><p>Frieze gets criticised because it is a place for conspicuous wealth and there may well will be oligarchs and hedge funders walking the aisles idly wondering what best to spend their millions on.</p><p>Matthew Slotover, fair co-founder, believes some of the criticisms are unfair.\"Some of the prices can get very high and if you don't like that then this is probably not the place for you,\" he said. \"For me it is a wonderful thing that private collectors and museums buy art and support living artists so they can carry on making their work.</p><p>\"Also commercial galleries all over the world offer hundreds of free shows every month.\"</p><p>With 2,000 artists at the fair it is also \"an amazing opportunity to see a lot of what is going on\".</p><p>He said a lot more big collectors were present this year, helped by the successful debut last year of a parallel fair for historical art called Frieze Masters, 15 minutes walk away in the park's north-west corner.</p><p>Here 130 galleries are selling their wares. For €22,000 you might be tempted by a Polynesian toggle, or for $1.5m an insanely kitsch example of Victorian narrative art, John Anster Fitzgerald's painting of Shakespeare's Bottom surrounded by fairies.</p><p>Or even a beautiful Brueghel winter scene, called The Census at Bethlehem, which, remarkably, was unknown and unrecorded until it was unveiled this week. The painting has been in the same family since it was bought direct from the artist's studio in 1611 and for the past 60 years has been in east Africa. \"When we took it off the wall a mummified gecko fell off the stretcher,\" said <a href=\"http://www.johnnyvanhaeften.com\" title=\"\">Johnny Van Haeften, the Old Master dealer</a> selling it.</p><p>It is Van Haeften's first Frieze – \"I saw all my clients here last year and thought I'd better come\" – and he is encouraged. \"People who collect modern art are now beginning to look back at Old Masters which are so much cheaper by comparison. This is a great masterpiece by Brueghel and it is £6m – what does that buy you in contemporary art?\"</p><p>• <em>Fairs open to the public 17-20 October.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420179078|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|cd9e04facbc3873a9acf31df843cb0f873c2b5c3 -->",

        "headline":"Bag a Brueghel: Frieze Masters 2013",
        "body":"<p>I'd been at the <a href=\"http://friezemasters.com\" title=\"\">Frieze Masters</a> art fair for about an hour when&nbsp;I started spotting fakes. Every museum, every big art collection has a few things of&nbsp;dubious authenticity skulking in shameful corners. An expert at one of our top galleries once told me: \"We know what our fakes are.\" And that's at&nbsp;a deeply responsible museum.</p><p>Frieze Masters is not a museum, with a museum's caution – it's just an&nbsp;art and antiques fair, under the ultra-cool veneer. Dealers are pushing&nbsp;merchandise that ranges from <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/shunga.aspx\" title=\"\">Japanese erotica</a> to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/427e81e4-3145-11e3-b478-00144feab7de.html)\" title=\"\">David Hockney</a> paintings. What are the chances that among all these beautiful things for sale there are&nbsp;no dodgy goods?</p><p>I can't review Frieze Masters as if it&nbsp;were an exhibition for the general public. It's not that. The public are allowed in (<a href=\"(http://friezelondon.com/visitors/tickets/\" title=\"\">for £50, to see both this and&nbsp;its sister fair</a>), but are essentially spectators of the fair's real business, which is serious art selling. This is a market. It's a shop. As a critic, have I really got any business being here? With its bijoux restaurants artfully breaking up the mega-malls (fancy a quick lunch at <a href=\"http://friezemasters.com/news/restaurants-announced-for-2013/\" title=\"\">Locatelli</a>, love, before we decide on that Picasso?), it's like reviewing <a href=\"http://www.selfridges.com/\" title=\"\">Selfridges</a>.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420178632'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381939238983/Frieze-Masters-010.jpg' alt='Frieze Masters' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Frieze Masters in full swing. Photograph: Joe Clark </figcaption></figure><p>The only way I can really engage with it is by fantasising. What if I did have a few million in the bank, what would I be putting a \"reserve\" on? I&nbsp;pick up this lingo while eavesdropping on a salesman's patter in front of a painting by <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/20ac37e8-30da-11e3-b991-00144feab7de.html#axzz2hss2HpML\" title=\"\">Pieter Brueghel the Younger</a>. The painting is a copy by this&nbsp;minor artist of a masterpiece by his&nbsp;much more gifted father. This is important, so pay attention: there is only one member of the Bruegel (or Brueghel) family from Antwerp who is&nbsp;a truly great artist. That is Pieter Bruegel the Elder, the father of the clan, who died in 1569. <a href=\"http://uploads1.wikipaintings.org/images/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/census-at-bethlehem-1566.jpg\" title=\"\">The Census at&nbsp;Bethlehem</a> is one of his most powerful visions of peasant life.</p><p>The version of it on sale at Frieze Masters is, to my eyes, a loose, pale&nbsp;mockup of this great work. Still,&nbsp;it's interesting. \"It's reserved at the moment,\" the dealer's telling the aristocratic pair. Chap came in this morning and ran over to the stand to&nbsp;say he wanted it – but what about this other Brueghel? The potential buyers are interested. They appear to have absolutely no idea that there were two Pieter Brueghels.</p><p>Wandering to the next stand I find …&nbsp;more Brueghels! These, too, are imitations of the great man's style by his less great son. One looks as if it has&nbsp;been botched by an incompetent restorer: not even Brueghel the Younger would give peasants such mad, staring eyes, surely.</p><p>When I say there are fakes at Frieze Masters, I don't mean there's a guy round the back of the tent knocking up Brueghels. For the record (and the lawyers) I do not believe a single gallery here is knowingly selling forgeries – though history shows anyone can be taken in, even art dealers. No. What I mean is that old paintings that lasted a long time in private collections have inevitably been through all kinds of restorations and remakes and dubious transformations to become the commodities on sale at Frieze. Looking at the old masters and wondering what I might buy if I had that ultraplutonium credit card, I start getting a queasy sense of caveat emptor. Buyer beware.</p><p>Why are there so many 16th- and 17th-century Dutch paintings by minor masters that look as though they&nbsp;are made of shiny plastic? Old paintings are often dirty and dark. These have all been cleaned to perfection, polished up like mahogany furniture. Presumably that's so they will go with the target clientele's mahogany furniture. Seriously: once you've seen 30 baroque paintings all buffed up to the same bright sheen, the&nbsp;stomach starts to churn.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420178633'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381939320562/Pieter-Brueghel-the-Young-004.jpg' alt='Pieter Brueghel the Younger's copy of The Census at Bethlehem' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pieter Brueghel the Younger's copy of The Census at Bethlehem.\nPhotograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Absurdly bright lighting adds to the&nbsp;growing sense of inauthenticity. Hey, this is Frieze. It is orgasmically glamorous. The art here can't look like it's old and dull. So every painting has&nbsp;a spotlight on it. Everything becomes shiny. That adds to the overcooked look of some of these expensive bits of history.</p><p>The light reveals some rubbish. There's a medieval painting (<a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/giotto\" title=\"\">studio of&nbsp;Giotto</a>, no less) with grossly painted hands. There's a sculpture by the Renaissance artist Andrea della Robbia&nbsp;with the face of a Victorian clergyman and an ugliness a million miles from the charm the <a href=\"http://www.wga.hu/html_m/r/robbia/index.html\" title=\"\">Della Robbia clan</a> usually brought to their painted ceramics. Well, I suppose he was having an off-day.</p><p>If I were buying art at Frieze Masters, I would give most of the older works a wide berth. Leave them for museums who can weed out the really worthwhile and repair the bad restorations. Go for the moderns. At the Dickinson stand, there's a fantastic <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/claude-monet\" title=\"\">Monet </a>of a church beside a dazzling sea, and I believe every brushstroke is&nbsp;by Monet. I also believe Matisse drew&nbsp;every line in an exhibition of works by him at <a href=\"http://www.thomasgibsonfineart.com/\" title=\"\">Thomas Gibson Fine Art</a>. <a href=\"http://www.annelyjudafineart.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Annely Juda</a> has beguiling sketches by the Russian abstract visionary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimir_Malevich\" title=\"\">Malevich</a> – who'd have thought this severe artist had so much fun drawing?</p><p>Wait, isn't that a <a href=\"http://www.toulouse-lautrec-foundation.org/\" title=\"\">Toulouse-Lautrec</a>? The truth is that, for all my suspicions, there is beauty in bucketloads at this art fair. And it's all for sale. Why can't I&nbsp;enjoy that more? I feel tantalised. I also feel stupid. I kid myself that art is some great universal human possession when in reality it is a luxury good for the super-rich. Frieze is the temple to what art has become in our age: a millionaire's toy.</p><p>I thought the first Frieze Masters last year was an improvement on the vacuity of the original fair – but now I realise it's far worse, because it takes the entire history of art and turns it into an elitist shopping mall. This place&nbsp;disgusts me. It makes art into congealed money. Old paintings have never before looked dead in my eyes; they have always lived and breathed for me, until now. Here they are mummified by the market. Just stuff to trade, basically.</p><p>It's like seeing your parents having sex: innocence is over. I leave through the darkened park, brooding on how an art fair has just taken everything I love and exposed it as shining trash sold by posh hucksters to rich idiots.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420177124|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|f594ff55db4f3a350b1bc000945c653eb7673cee -->",

The Bristol-born artist is <a href=\"http://www.banksy.co.uk/\" title=\"\">currently \"in residence\" in New York</a>, and not a day passes without a story about his exploits in the Big Apple. The latest is that Banksy has carved a statue of Ronald McDonald, mascot of the renowned fast food chain, and is moving it from one McDonald's to another in the New York area together with a – living – boy giving the corporate clown a shoeshine.</p><p>Look, it's a bit pointless mocking American capitalism, Banksy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/us-shutdown-imf-christine-lagarde-appeals-stability\" title=\"\">Congress has already done that for you</a>. How the world laughed when Republican extremists brought the \"world's most powerful nation\" to the brink of debt default. How it shrugged when this lunatic crisis was resolved at the last minute. What's America going to do next to make itself a living joke?</p><p>By comparison, Banksy's stunts are light entertainment for complacent liberals and Leftists. Being a bit of both, I can totally get behind his tilt at McDonald's. I am pretty sure it stands for everything that is wrong with the world. I can't quite remember the details but yeah, McDonald's, it's got to be bad. Go for it.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-419901931\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/14/131014banksysells-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/14/131014banksysells_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/14/131014banksysells_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/14/131014banksysells/131014banksysells.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>This <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sting/englishmaninnewyork.html\" title=\"\">Englishman in New York</a> is clearly generating impressive interest and a lot of headlines.

Vandalise that ...</p><p>Yet all this reporting of Banksy's art and its fate reveals the massive intellectual lacunae in our current understanding of art. On the one hand, Banksy is a street artist, having a laugh defying the authorities. On the other hand, his works are now regarded as financially valuable so when they get defaced it is seen as an attack on some kind of cultural monument. It's just street art! Lighten up! It does not need to survive and people who pay big money for it are silly.</p><p>To his credit, Mr Banksy seems to know that. Hence the cheap art sale to those lucky tourists.

I have tracked a pool of ink across nice grey floors, and almost been splatted by paintballs. I have eyed up a dangling noose, but it looks like someone else has already tried E<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/18/elmgreen-dragset-v-a-through-the-keyhole\" title=\"\">lmgreen &amp; Dragset</a>'s gibbet (the frayed rope lies useless on the floor). That was when I climbed back into the womb to try to escape, only to be pounced on by a gang of paparazzi. All this, and I've only been at Frieze for two hours. I do so love an art fair.</p><p>Once more into the killing fields! The artists represented by London's <a href=\"http://www.limoncellogallery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Limoncello gallery</a> hang around its stand, waiting for someone to chat them up, or possibly buy them. People are so much more fun than art – and by and large self-cleaning. Nearby, at <a href=\"http://www.fluxiagallery.com/\" title=\"\">Fluxia</a> (over from Milan), puddles of black goo sit on the floor, with decorative bits of binbag and weeds mired in the stickiness. What would one do with these cowpat-sized objects? Or with the giant black foil rock that hangs from the ceiling of a Berlin stand? I guess you could position yourself under it, so it looks like a \"thinks\" bubble, to signal your bad mood.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420250852'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381944427887/Adrian-Searle-inside-Judi-010.jpg' alt='Adrian Searle inside Judith Rubell’s Portrait of the Artist, 2013' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Don’t ask … Adrian Searle inside Jennifer Rubell’s Portrait of the Artist, 2013.

The 11th incarnation of Frieze is&nbsp;more manageable than most, with better lighting, wider aisles and a bigger spread of behemoth mega-galleries and startup spaces, young galleries and old lags. Not that the art&nbsp;is&nbsp;necessarily better, though the galleries seem to be trying harder this&nbsp;year.</p><p>Now for a nice lie down. In the <a href=\"http://friezelondon.com/news/frieze-projects-2013-participating-artists/\" title=\"\">Project Space</a>, a fountain in the middle of a bed spouts black ink on to the white sheets, and on to the book being read aloud by Lili Reynaud-Dewar, nestling on the plumped-up pillows. It's a dirty book anyway, In My Room by Guillaume Dustan, and as she reads the line, \"I was lying on the bed jerking off, smoking a joint\" in a delicate voice, the artist starts getting spattered, too. More ink leaks from the pump beneath the bed and oozes over my shoes. I like to get up close and personal at fairs. It's the only way to focus.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420250854'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381943963026/Dunno-by-Urs-Fischer-008.jpg' alt='Dunno, by Urs Fischer' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Dunno, by Urs Fischer, 2012.

You wander in to the middle, view the passing crowds through the curving walls, then walk out again, refreshed. It is an oasis. Nearby, at Gavin Brown, two lovely nocturnal cityscapes by <a href=\"http://www.alexkatz.com/\" title=\"\">Alex Katz</a>, with lit windows on a dark New York night, look over Rob Pruitt's mad, humanoid fluorescent orange traffic cones. This is fun. Round the corner is another big Katz, of buildings in a blizzard. It is magical.</p><p>Finding things that stop you in your tracks here is easy, but mostly for the wrong reasons. You tend to gawp, incredulous. There are a great many overblown stupidities here, the sort that only seem to come out at art fairs. You could count <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/koons\" title=\"\">Jeff Koons</a>'s huge wrapped bouquet and his cute pussy-in-a-sock sculpture among these, though there are many who see his work as a Duchampian critique of excess.</p><p><a href=\"http://cdn.warhol.christies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SLIDE-6-Portrait-of-the-Artist-840x560.jpg\" title=\"\">Jennifer Rubell's giant, reclining, all-white Portrait of the Artist</a> has a large sculpted hollow for a womb. You can climb in and curl up, in full view of the passing trade. As a serious art critic, I felt it my duty to get on board. What would you do with a thing like this? Where would anyone keep it? Why? Do&nbsp;not ask.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420250855'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381944042035/Cat-on-a-Clothes-Line-Yel-008.jpg' alt='Cat on a Clothes Line (Yellow), by Jeff Koons' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Cat on a Clothes Line (Yellow), by Jeff Koons, 1994-2001.

The original was stolen in 2009 (it has since been recovered). Bruguera's copy leans in a corner, surrounded by metal-cutting tools. The artist wishes, apparently, to reference historical memory.</p><p>Never a great context for looking at anything, fairs are more and more the places where collectors congregate and buy. In an unfortunate juxtaposition, a drawing of a lemon by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/01/mike-kelley-american-artist-dies\" title=\"\">Mike Kelley</a> hangs over the sign referencing the song by Led Zeppelin about squeezing my lemon till the juice runs down my leg.

Everything becomes a hostage to fortune here. You&nbsp;have to be open to the absurd. At Stevenson, from South Africa, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/01/tate-modern-africa-ibrahim-el-salahi-meschac-gaba\" title=\"\">Meschac Gaba</a> shows an array of children's clothes, all embroidered with volatile French words: Kalachnikov. Inceste. Pédophilie. Prison. Slavery. Sida (Aids). Terroriste. In part, this is a play on shop displays, and the kinds of signage kids all over the world wear on their clothing. But this is more about the signs people don't wear. These words are labels that float about and sometimes stick.</p><p>You have to keep moving, stay a moving target. Swivel-eyed dealers wait to pounce. Here's a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gerhard-richter\" title=\"\">Gerhard Richter</a>, there's a room of shouty Julian Schnabel paintings, now a sculpture of a squatting woman delivering a very small poo, by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/21/david-shrigley-q-and-a-interview\" title=\"\">David Shrigley</a>. And over there, a thing that looks like art but probably isn't. This time next year, it will be forgotten, probably in a collector's warehouse somewhere. At Laura Bartlett Gallery, gigantic currency notes lie framed on the floor. Mmmm, smell that money – but watch out for the cowpats.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420179925|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|c8435f38feaf835b5257647bab2a684f405e1834 -->",

Framed by the vapour trail of a trio of jet-planes performing a victory flypast into the sunset, the building stands like a triumphal gateway to some promised land of <a href=\"http://maoist.wikia.com/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics\">Socialism with Chinese characteristics</a>.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8b52c4c4-77b4-450f-9c4b-5994f8b5ecfe\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938175770/67151242-ed21-4672-ae82-53dab521578b-307x420.jpeg\" alt=\"'CCTV Tower With Bountiful Harvest'\" width=\"307\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'CCTV Tower With Bountiful Harvest' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>The image could well be the mischievous work of its own architects, the Rotterdam-based practice OMA, which has made its own <a href=\"http://places.designobserver.com/media/images/dunham-jones-koolhaas-2_525.jpg\">collage&nbsp;of the building</a> alongside Kim Jong-il, George W Bush, Saddam Hussein and Jesus for a book cover, as well as an image of it <a href=\"http://file.u148.net/attachments/image/2009/08/cctvav/1.jpg\">bursting into flames</a> behind a spread-legged porn-star. But it is in fact the product of artists from a North Korean painting unit – the very same that used to produce such propaganda images for the Kim regime, but now find themselves designing food packaging in Pyongyang.</p> <p><a href=\"http://koryogroup.com/blog/?p=2087\">The Beautiful Future</a>, which comprises six such paintings to date, is the brainchild of British ex-pat duo Nick Bonner and Dominic Johnson-Hill, who both arrived in the Chinese capital 20 years ago and caught the Beijing bug. Bonner runs <a href=\"http://www.koryogroup.com/\">Koryo Tours</a>, a travel company specialising in trips to the DPRK, while Johnson-Hill presides over a street-wear empire, <a href=\"http://www.plasteredtshirts.com/\">Plastered</a>, producing T-shirts emblazoned with Maoist kitsch. The paintings, on show earlier this month as part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/oct/02/beijing-design-week-china-hutongs-preservation\">Beijing Design Week</a>, are the inevitable result of their mutual obsessions.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9511325e-c111-4475-8a59-f609b6b6fc1e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938299492/09154ddf-4166-426a-afc6-8989c83d820f-460x333.jpeg\" alt=\"'Bird's Nest, Home of the People'\" width=\"460\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'Bird's Nest, Home of the People' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>“North Korean artists are the best people at delivering a message without slogans,” says Bonner, who collects North Korean art and has produced documentaries exploring life in the DPRK – as well as what he describes as “North Korea's first feature-length rom-com” last year, <a href=\"http://www.comradekimgoesflying.com/\">Comrade Kim Goes Flying</a>. “We wanted to show contemporary China as it could have been, if it had continued with Maoist ideology.”</p> <p>One painting shows a line of excited comrades, obediently dressed in Mao suits, filing towards Herzog and de Meuron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/11/architecture.chinaarts2008\">Bird's Nest stadium</a>. The skyline is proudly choked with glassy skyscrapers on one side and a thicket of cooling towers on the other, belching smoke productively into the pink skies. An elderly tourist and his granddaughter look on in awe at the spirited scene.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b4e2afd7-15cf-4752-b7d2-fc89d4fe8074\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938435800/245eba41-2cb0-417b-860d-94604a41124d-460x328.jpeg\" alt=\"'KTV Gives Us a Voice'\" width=\"460\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'KTV Gives Us a Voice' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>Elsewhere workers are seen liberated from their collective drudgery, disco-dancing in nightclubs and singing in gaudy karaoke parlours. An office scene shows people working at networked computer terminals – painted by artists who in all likelihood have no experience of the internet.</p> <p>“The artists are in a situation where they are painting things they've never seen before,” says Bonner, “which gives the images an even more unreal, dreamlike quality.”</p> <p>An ongoing process since the pre-Olympic frenzy, the paintings are the result of Bonner and Hill sending detailed sketches to the North Korean artists, along with renderings of the buildings in question – as neither CCTV nor the Olympic venues existed at that stage. The artists were then left to fill in the blanks as they wished. The results give an intriguing insight into their vision of what Chinese modernity might be like in a land they will never know.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-53b98afb-9dde-4f21-8c5e-c89b9741ae44\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381938601343/7c3c5f1c-29fc-4cb3-8bb5-464486fe9fc3-460x331.jpeg\" alt=\"'Water Cube for Clean Air and Healthy Life'\" width=\"460\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>'Water Cube for Clean Air and Healthy Life' Image: The Beautiful Future</figcaption> </figure> <p>Thrusting China's contemporary icons into the aesthetic landscape of early Communist propaganda provides a striking image of quite how far the country has come since Deng Xiaoping began his policy of Reform and Opening in 1978. With the (historically disputed) motto “to get rich is glorious,” he catapulted the Middle Kingdom from grey uniformity to technicolour bling, the next 30 years seeing city skylines of chimneys replaced by glitzy baubles of the boom.</p> <p>But just as the billboards of Mao's Great Leap Forward, featuring hoards of <a href=\"http://i1195.photobucket.com/albums/aa383/reverserainbowstar/Vintage%20Ads/Great%20Leap%20Forward%20Propaganda%20Posters/Unknown/CCPIdealSociety.png\">grinning labourers in rude health</a>, masked the reality of work camps and mass starvation, so the glare of these state-sponsored mega-projects happily obscures the human rights abuses and migrant labour conditions that fuel their construction. The super-saturated, unadulterated joy shining out from the canvases is a stark reminder of exactly what is missing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420164584|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|94cb4af72f06860e39234ff1f19e345ff5c4f856 -->",

        "body":"<p>I'd been at the <a href=\"http://friezemasters.com\" title=\"\">Frieze Masters</a> art fair for about an hour when&nbsp;I started spotting fakes. Every museum, every big art collection has a few things of&nbsp;dubious authenticity skulking in shameful corners. An expert at one of our top galleries once told me: \"We know what our fakes are.\" And that's at&nbsp;a deeply responsible museum.</p><p>Frieze Masters is not a museum, with a museum's caution – it's just an&nbsp;art and antiques fair, under the ultra-cool veneer. Dealers are pushing&nbsp;merchandise that ranges from <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/shunga.aspx\" title=\"\">Japanese erotica</a> to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/427e81e4-3145-11e3-b478-00144feab7de.html)\" title=\"\">David Hockney</a> paintings. What are the chances that among all these beautiful things for sale there are&nbsp;no dodgy goods?</p><p>I can't review Frieze Masters as if it&nbsp;were an exhibition for the general public. It's not that. The public are allowed in (<a href=\"(http://friezelondon.com/visitors/tickets/\" title=\"\">for £50, to see both this and&nbsp;its sister fair</a>), but are essentially spectators of the fair's real business, which is serious art selling. This is a market. It's a shop. As a critic, have I really got any business being here? With its bijoux restaurants artfully breaking up the mega-malls (fancy a quick lunch at <a href=\"http://friezemasters.com/news/restaurants-announced-for-2013/\" title=\"\">Locatelli</a>, love, before we decide on that Picasso?), it's like reviewing <a href=\"http://www.selfridges.com/\" title=\"\">Selfridges</a>.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420178632'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381939238983/Frieze-Masters-010.jpg' alt='Frieze Masters' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Frieze Masters in full swing. Photograph: Joe Clark </figcaption></figure><p>The only way I can really engage with it is by fantasising. What if I did have a few million in the bank, what would I be putting a \"reserve\" on? I&nbsp;pick up this lingo while eavesdropping on a salesman's patter in front of a painting by <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/20ac37e8-30da-11e3-b991-00144feab7de.html#axzz2hss2HpML\" title=\"\">Pieter Brueghel the Younger</a>. The painting is a copy by this&nbsp;minor artist of a masterpiece by his&nbsp;much more gifted father. This is important, so pay attention: there is only one member of the Bruegel (or Brueghel) family from Antwerp who is&nbsp;a truly great artist. That is Pieter Bruegel the Elder, the father of the clan, who died in 1569. <a href=\"http://uploads1.wikipaintings.org/images/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/census-at-bethlehem-1566.jpg\" title=\"\">The Census at&nbsp;Bethlehem</a> is one of his most powerful visions of peasant life.</p><p>The version of it on sale at Frieze Masters is, to my eyes, a loose, pale&nbsp;mockup of this great work. Still,&nbsp;it's interesting. \"It's reserved at the moment,\" the dealer's telling the aristocratic pair. Chap came in this morning and ran over to the stand to&nbsp;say he wanted it – but what about this other Brueghel? The potential buyers are interested. They appear to have absolutely no idea that there were two Pieter Brueghels.</p><p>Wandering to the next stand I find …&nbsp;more Brueghels! These, too, are imitations of the great man's style by his less great son. One looks as if it has&nbsp;been botched by an incompetent restorer: not even Brueghel the Younger would give peasants such mad, staring eyes, surely.</p><p>When I say there are fakes at Frieze Masters, I don't mean there's a guy round the back of the tent knocking up Brueghels. For the record (and the lawyers) I do not believe a single gallery here is knowingly selling forgeries – though history shows anyone can be taken in, even art dealers. No. What I mean is that old paintings that lasted a long time in private collections have inevitably been through all kinds of restorations and remakes and dubious transformations to become the commodities on sale at Frieze. Looking at the old masters and wondering what I might buy if I had that ultraplutonium credit card, I start getting a queasy sense of caveat emptor. Buyer beware.</p><p>Why are there so many 16th- and 17th-century Dutch paintings by minor masters that look as though they&nbsp;are made of shiny plastic? Old paintings are often dirty and dark. These have all been cleaned to perfection, polished up like mahogany furniture. Presumably that's so they will go with the target clientele's mahogany furniture. Seriously: once you've seen 30 baroque paintings all buffed up to the same bright sheen, the&nbsp;stomach starts to churn.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420178633'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381939320562/Pieter-Brueghel-the-Young-004.jpg' alt='Pieter Brueghel the Younger's copy of The Census at Bethlehem' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pieter Brueghel the Younger's copy of The Census at Bethlehem.\nPhotograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Absurdly bright lighting adds to the&nbsp;growing sense of inauthenticity. Hey, this is Frieze. It is orgasmically glamorous. The art here can't look like it's old and dull. So every painting has&nbsp;a spotlight on it. Everything becomes shiny. That adds to the overcooked look of some of these expensive bits of history.</p><p>The light reveals some rubbish. There's a medieval painting (<a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/giotto\" title=\"\">studio of&nbsp;Giotto</a>, no less) with grossly painted hands. There's a sculpture by the Renaissance artist Andrea della Robbia&nbsp;with the face of a Victorian clergyman and an ugliness a million miles from the charm the <a href=\"http://www.wga.hu/html_m/r/robbia/index.html\" title=\"\">Della Robbia clan</a> usually brought to their painted ceramics. Well, I suppose he was having an off-day.</p><p>If I were buying art at Frieze Masters, I would give most of the older works a wide berth. Leave them for museums who can weed out the really worthwhile and repair the bad restorations. Go for the moderns. At the Dickinson stand, there's a fantastic <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/claude-monet\" title=\"\">Monet </a>of a church beside a dazzling sea, and I believe every brushstroke is&nbsp;by Monet. I also believe Matisse drew&nbsp;every line in an exhibition of works by him at <a href=\"http://www.thomasgibsonfineart.com/\" title=\"\">Thomas Gibson Fine Art</a>. <a href=\"http://www.annelyjudafineart.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Annely Juda</a> has beguiling sketches by the Russian abstract visionary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimir_Malevich\" title=\"\">Malevich</a> – who'd have thought this severe artist had so much fun drawing?</p><p>Wait, isn't that a <a href=\"http://www.toulouse-lautrec-foundation.org/\" title=\"\">Toulouse-Lautrec</a>? The truth is that, for all my suspicions, there is beauty in bucketloads at this art fair. And it's all for sale. Why can't I&nbsp;enjoy that more? I feel tantalised. I also feel stupid. I kid myself that art is some great universal human possession when in reality it is a luxury good for the super-rich. Frieze is the temple to what art has become in our age: a millionaire's toy.</p><p>I thought the first Frieze Masters last year was an improvement on the vacuity of the original fair – but now I realise it's far worse, because it takes the entire history of art and turns it into an elitist shopping mall. This place&nbsp;disgusts me. It makes art into congealed money. Old paintings have never before looked dead in my eyes; they have always lived and breathed for me, until now. Here they are mummified by the market. Just stuff to trade, basically.</p><p>It's like seeing your parents having sex: innocence is over. I leave through the darkened park, brooding on how an art fair has just taken everything I love and exposed it as shining trash sold by posh hucksters to rich idiots.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420177124|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|f594ff55db4f3a350b1bc000945c653eb7673cee -->",

        "body":"<p>This was taken in the California desert in 1970. At the time, a lot of <a href=\"http://www.oocities.org/tcartz/sacrifice.htm\" title=\"\">monks in Vietnam had set fire to themselves</a> to protest against the war and its expansion into Cambodia. I called the shot Immolation IV. I'd been doing a lot of research into women's history and the practice of <em>sati</em> in India, where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(practice)\" title=\"\">widows are forced to throw themselves into the flames of a funeral fire</a>. So I was interested in the whole practice of immolation, forced and chosen. After all, one could say up to that point women's art and women's history had been immolated.</p><p>I had started exploring the idea of openly female-centred art in 1968, with a&nbsp;series of pieces called <a href=\"http://pacificstandardtimefestival.org/events/a-butterfly-for-pomona-by-judy-chicago-2/\" title=\"\">Atmospheres</a>. These used fireworks and coloured smoke in the landscape. Before that, I had made paintings and sculptures intending to convey emotion through colour. But with my Atmospheres, the smoke provided a liberation from formal structure, while its colour was intended to feminise and soften the environment.</p><p>In 1970, having instituted the <a href=\"http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/\" title=\"\">first feminist art programme at California State University</a>, I began to do a series of Atmospheres called Women and Smoke. My students would get involved: I'd paint their bodies to match or contrast with the colours of the smoke. This one, from that series,  features a woman called <a href=\"http://faithwilding.refugia.net/\" title=\"\">Faith Wilding</a>, now a well-known cyberartist.</p><p>I stopped doing fireworks pieces in 1974. I'd been training to be a pyrotechnician through an apprenticeship at a firework company in California, but&nbsp;the owner was sexually harassing me. I simply could not continue. Another reason why I stopped was that this was a very different time: artists could just go out into the environment and do things without a permit. I'd just tell my friends where we were going, and everyone would turn up and participate by lighting flares, bringing food or taking pictures.</p><p>Only very recently has there been interest in my Atmospheres – for a very&nbsp;long time, nobody knew anything about them. I think this image still resonates in terms of women's experience in the world, their self-sacrifice, their sacrifice in culture. Just look at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/malala-yousafzai\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai</a>, the girl in Pakistan who was attacked for wanting to go to school. It's tragic, but my image still has something to say.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420161812|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|6c62585d13f33eafb5cc098b36ccab2cbd584f88 -->",

        "body":"<p>This is one of the worst exhibitions about a great artist I have ever seen. Dürer will survive it, but people who <a href=\"http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/exhibitions/2013/durer/\" title=\"\">come to the Courtauld</a> hoping for an introduction to his genius are likely to go away unsatisfied, and fail to fall in love with one of art's most intense minds. That is a crying shame.</p><p>The general public doesn't seem to be the audience the curator has in mind. The Courtauld Gallery is attached to one of Britain's <a href=\"http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/institute/index.shtml\" title=\"\">leading centres for the higher study of art history</a>, and this show seems cursed by that connection. Its academic introspection combines with snobbish connoisseurship to smother a titan of the Renaissance.</p><p>You thought Albrecht Dürer was a visionary who gave the world the <a href=\"http://www.mfa.org/sites/default/files/images/Albrecht%20Durer-Four%20Horsemen%20Apocalypse.jpg\" title=\"\">Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a>, his <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Duerer01.jpg\" title=\"\">Christ-like self-portrait</a> and such eerie images as his  <a href=\"http://www.wisdomportal.com/PeterMilton/KnightDeathDevil(1461x1884).jpg\" title=\"\">knight riding side by side with Death and the Devil</a>? Think again. Dürer's very artistic personality disintegrates under this pedantic scrutiny.</p><p>Only a specialist would be thrilled by an exhibition that focuses minutely on his four years as a young journeyman touring the art cities of Germany. The show reveals, ad nauseam, the works of every artist he learned from in these years. And it gets worse. Only the institution itself could be interested in an in-depth exegesis of the sources of <a href=\"http://www.london.diplo.de/contentblob/3940924/Inhaltsbild/3389700/Duerer2.jpg\" title=\"\">Dürer's ink drawing of a Wise Virgin</a>, whose main importance appears to be that the Courtauld owns it.</p><p>It's absurd to make Dürer's A Wise Virgin the focus of the show. It is not especially charismatic by his standards. Yet it is presented here as the summa of his early career, among a tedious proliferation of images that, it is claimed, influenced it. Why? How does this add to anyone's encounter with Dürer? In one room, I counted, there are five works by Dürer out of 15 on view – the other 10 being supposed influences on his sodding Wise Virgin. Who cares? Worse, the connoisseurship is not revelatory. We get a lot of prints by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Schongauer\" title=\"\">Martin Schongauer</a>, as if it were a surprise that Dürer admired this gothic master. Their relationship is in fact bleedin' obvious.</p><p>A connected exhibition brings together pictures used as slides to illustrate a <a href=\"http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/gallery/exhibitions/2013/durer/AntiquityUnleashed.shtml\" title=\"\">lecture about Dürer given in 1905 by the art historian Aby Warburg</a>. What has that got to offer anyone not doing a PhD on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aby_Warburg\" title=\"\">Warburg</a>? Something, it turns out. Warburg knew his stuff and Dürer's drawing of the poet Orpheus being beaten with tree branches is a sublime image. For a moment the Renaissance flickers to life through a fog of pedantry.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420137405|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|98df266b0ef85529ece26a8fd331b833b6d0d5cd -->",

        "headline":"A Picasso for £85: why the artist's grandson is raffling a masterpiece",
        "body":"<p>'I'm a Gemini,\" says Olivier Widmaier Picasso when we get on to the subject of his love life, \"and I really think we're not programmed to be with the same person all our lives.\" A few years ago, for instance, Olivier, grandson of the great Pablo, was engaged to Alice Evans – the English actor famed for playing Glenn Close's probation officer in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/86899/102.dalmatians\" title=\"\">102 Dalmatians</a> a decade or so ago. \"I drove her to Pinewood Studios for the final test for that film,\" he recalls. \"And I introduced her to <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/ioan-gruffudd-9542343\" title=\"\">Ioan Gruffudd</a> when we got there. So I introduced her to the man who is now her husband.\"</p><p>Not that the 52-year-old Frenchman is rueful. Geminis don't roll that way, apparently. He soon took another lover. \"You could say I have moved from my blue period to my pink period,\" <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3583888/Picasso-was-not-such-a-bad-man.html\" title=\"\">he said at the time</a>. What period is he in now? Olivier – torso of a bull, eyes soulful brown, nose fascinatingly undulating, and altogether a dead ringer for grandad except with more hair – fixes me with those eyes. \"I'm not married. But I do OK. You say that? I do OK?\"</p><p>There's more than a hint of the international playboy about Olivier, who's in London to oversee the British leg of a charity sale of one of his illustrious ancestor's works. Pablo's 1914 cubist gouache drawing <a href=\"http://www.1picasso100euros.com/?lang=en\" title=\"\">L'Homme au Gibus, or Man with Opera Hat</a>, goes on show this week at <a href=\"http://www.pad-fairs.com/london/en\" title=\"\">the Pavilion for Art and Design (PAD)</a> in Berkeley Square, London, as part of a global tour. The drawing is being raffled to raise money for the <a href=\"http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100052787\" title=\"\">International Association to Save Tyre</a>, which funds projects for the war-ravaged Phoenician city in Lebanon, a Unesco world heritage site. The gouache was bought from a New York gallery by the IAST and 50,000 tickets, each costing €100 (£85), are to be sold. By the time of the draw in December, the charity hopes to have raised €5m – and have presented one lucky person with a Picasso worth €750,000 to hang in their loo.</p><p>For Olivier, this fundraiser is the latest twist in a life lived, prosperously and contentedly, in the shadow of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. Olivier has written books and made documentaries defending Picasso from suggestions that his womanising was the sign of a closeted homosexual, or that he was a monster who destroyed those around him for the sake of that cliche: his most demanding mistress – art. He's also responsible for brokering the deal that, in 1998, led to Picasso's signature appearing on those Citroën cars. \"The other day,\" he says, \"I was getting my car back from the carwash. 'Name?' asked the lady. 'Picasso,' I replied. She looked for the keys. 'We don't have any Citroën Picassos,' she said. 'No,' I replied, 'my car is a Mercedes.'\"</p><p>His cousin Marina said the deal sullied Picasso's name. What does he think? \"We discovered there were something like 700 illegal uses of his name for various products,\" he says. They needed a partner with the clout to go after them. \"Citroën provided that. Our hope was that it was a good car – and it was. Now there is a C4 Picasso, the third generation of the series.\" Did the deal make him rich? \"Yes, but not just me. All of us in the family. Well, we were rich already. Not jetset rich, but rich.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420058333'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381859799403/Pablo-Picasso-001.jpg' alt='Pablo Picasso' width='200' height='285' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pablo Picasso in Antibes, France, 1946. Photograph: Michel Sima/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Is he like Picasso? \"No,\" says Olivier, who is a lawyer as well as a TV and music producer. \"I found out, early and painfully in art class at school, that I have no talent.\" No similarities at all? \"I have inherited that artistic thing of putting people together.\" A sort of human collagist? \"Exactly. That&nbsp;is the talent, if you can call it that, I bring to my work, and my life, too, perhaps.\" Among his non-Picasso claims to fame is the fact that he produced <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkppOBTQhl4\" title=\"\">French tennis player Yannick Noah's reggae album</a>.</p><p>I was thinking more of parallels between their romantic lives. Woody Allen felt as he does about mating for life – <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079522/quotes\" title=\"\">he believed it was only for pigeons and Catholics</a>. Presumably, his grandfather was of the same mindset. \"Yes, he would look at a woman and imagine her in paint – and, of course, imagine what she was like in the bedroom.\" He laughs. \"He loved women.\"</p><p>That's not what Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington argued. In her 1988 book <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1988/06/picasso-creator-and-destroyer/305715/\" title=\"\">Picasso: Creator and Destroyer</a>, she suggested that the Spaniard's lifelong pursuit of women was a foil – he was really gay. \"Nonsense!\" says Olivier. \"Who could have devoted so much energy to women if they really loved men? He was deeply, sexually and artistically interested in women. That was how he saw my grandmother: muse and lover all in one.\" This was Marie-Thérèse Walter, the woman depicted in the 1932 painting <a href=\"http://www.pablopicasso.org/images/paintings/the-dream.jpg\" title=\"\">Le Rêve</a>, or The Dream. She was 22 at the time, he 50. In it, her head is tilted in slumber and her left eye has become an erect penis, presumably symbolising Picasso's own.</p><p>Olivier remembers his grandmother late in life, when she was no longer muse or lover, but was still financially supported by the artist. \"I have a very clear image of her – a kind of unreal mix of craziness and beauty that must have been captivating once, but was pathological when she was trying to be in 1973 how she was in 1927.\" In 1977, four years after Picasso's death, Marie-Thérèse hanged herself. \"He supported her even after the relationship ended, but after his death the money stopped coming. She loved only him and life was pointless without him.\"</p><p>What was his grandfather like? \"I&nbsp;never met him.\" Does he regret that? \"Not really. I was too young to get anything from having met him. I'm not sure a man of 90 would have helped me to understand things.\" He was 12 when <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/8/newsid_2523000/2523469.stm\" title=\"\">Picasso died – but that day, 8 April 1973</a>, proved a watershed. \"Before that, I&nbsp;wasn't sure who my grandfather was. My father didn't want to be known as Picasso's son-in-law and my mother wanted us to have an ordinary life.\" So Maya, his mother, concealed the cheques that came from her father and that made the childhoods of Olivier and his sister, art historian <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297504578579824284030506.html\" title=\"\">Diana Widmaier Picasso</a> comfortable – first in Marseille, then in the Paris apartment whose walls were lined with Picassos, a few of which his parents have given to him.</p><p>\"After his death, it was impossible to conceal the truth. I read the newspapers and watched the television and found answers to questions I had never even imagined.\" Schoolmates told the teenage Olivier he was not really Picasso's grandson because his mother was born out of wedlock. Not true: in 1972, a new French law allowed married men to recognise such children. \"That was great in one way, but terrible in another. It meant there were tribunals to [recognise] Picasso children. The media made it look as if these were lawsuits pressed by children who wanted their share of the inheritance he had denied them. The reality was not this: he was not a cruel, mean man. The opposite.\" The family's legal entanglements, though, were what led Olivier to study law.</p><p>His family life was very much the opposite of Pablo Picasso's. \"My parents were faithful to each other for life, as a reaction perhaps to my grandfather. But my mother is an artistic type – impetuous, dreamy. My father [a ship's captain from Marseille] is from the real world. He is rational, she is not. He is 'Why?' and she is 'Why not?' I have inherited both.\"</p><p>In 1986, Olivier added \"Picasso\" to his name. Why? \"To honour him and to express solidarity. I have made my own money in my life, but my life would be unthinkable without his help. I have a duty to him.\"</p><p>A sense of duty prompted him to write, in 2004, a 344-page book called <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3965135.stm\" title=\"\">Picasso: The Real Family Story</a>, based on his mother's remembrances and his own research. He looked through chequebooks, for instance, finding that the artist was more generous in making payments to discarded lovers than the image of him as work-fixated exploiter of women might suggest. Picasso emerges as a larger-than-life, flawed but kind man.</p><p>Olivier is not yet done with Picasso. A new book, Intimate Picasso, will be published later this year. He describes it as a coffeetable book with pictures of his grandfather's art and photos of the extended family. \"In the past 10 years, I have learned about his art, just as in the previous 10 years I learned about his life. It was time for me to finish the Picasso puzzle – a very complicated cubist puzzle.\" He has also recently co-written and co-produced two documentaries on the artist. Is your life dominated by Picasso? \"90% of my life is my own and 10% duty to Picasso. Us descendants could not live without him.\"</p><p>We wander through PAD's galleries to the front of the marquee, where L'Homme au Gibus has been installed. Why should I buy a raffle ticket? \"Because it's beautiful. And it's an example of the synthetic cubist period from the year before he met <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/jeancocteau\" title=\"\">Jean Cocteau</a> – after which his art moved into the new period, when he designed the costumes and curtain for <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/WATQDqjAOUc\" title=\"\">Cocteau, Satie and Diaghilev's ballet Parade</a> and Apollinaire used the term surrealist for the first time.\" It's a good answer.</p><p>A photographer appears. \"Shoot that side,\" says Olivier, offering his right profile as he poses before the drawing. \"That's the Picasso side.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420041027|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|ae4173b66de3c0c53022a61b83af327f057450f0 -->",

        "headline":"Bright side of the Bronx: portraits of locals on New York's 'hood beach'",
        "body":"<p>\"Yo, that's the hood beach,\" photographer <a href=\"http://waynelawrenceonline.com/\" title=\"\">Wayne Lawrence</a> was warned when he found out about Orchard Beach, a waterside strip in the Bronx in New York City. Like much of the South Bronx, it has a notoriously bad reputation.</p><p>Lawrence was undeterred; he relegated such warnings to the propagation of preconceived discrimination. Over six summers, he took the subway to Pelham Bay Park, the end of the line, to catalogue this diverse community. \"And from the first day I visited Orchard, I knew the stigma attached to it was unjustified,\" he says in the introduction to his new photobook <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.de/book/Orchard-Beach-The-Bronx-Riviera/e443381.rhd?pub=58500\" title=\"\">Orchard Beach: The Bronx Riviera</a>. He reminisces: \"I'd spend hours, almost daily, walking along that waveless tide.\"</p><p>The Bronx's only public beach was called \"The Riviera of New York\" when it was created in the 1930s – though as Lawrence notes, the 1.1 mile-long stretch is now considered \"one of the worst beaches in New York\" (by those who even know it exists – the carnival appeal of the Coney Island boardwalk drastically overshadows it).</p><p>The Bronx Riviera book lists each subject's first name and the year under their portrait, as  a yearbook might. Its pages reveal a staggering array of triangle-top bikinis, outlandish tattoos, Christian iconography, six-packs, cellulite, fake nails, protruding belly buttons, beads, gold bangles and studded belts. The tats especially show off Bronxian mantras: \"Do what you love to do\" runs along Monique's upper thigh, \"Loyalty\" cuts across Stephanie's abdomen, \"The Real Shit\" parades across Michael's belly, and a thorn-crowned Jesus is a diptych above each of Sonny's nipples.</p><p>Lawrence is \"attracted to individuals who are really sure of themselves, alpha types\" – personalities he detects from \"gut instinct\" who need little coaxing to feel comfortable in front of the camera. He introduces himself, explains what he's working on, and asks if the subject would be interested \"in being a part of the story\". He shoots on average 3-5 frames per subject. Of those he approached, 80% were willing to participate.</p><p>He was often surprised by interactions on the beach. He remembers one subject, a Mexican man visiting from California – \"a gang member with an incredibly hard exterior\" – who was there with his three-year-old daughter. \"He's a father, and as a father myself it was important to represent them, not just to have the image of absent fathers in this community,\" he says. \"And he was so open, and genuine, and easy to talk to.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419921734'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381756927069/Wayne-Lawrence-001.jpg' alt='Wayne Lawrence' width='460' height='545' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jae, Lindy and Jaelin, 2008. Photograph: Wayne Lawrence/Wayne Lawrence/INSTITUTE</figcaption></figure><p>Lawrence's work reinforces the fact that striking, honest images can change people's expectations. Framed in a spare, frontal manner, there's rare raw emotional cadence here, and each portrait is a wilful look at vulnerability. \"My aim is always to create dignified portraits of the people I meet\", says Lawrence, \"and an honest portrayal of the community as a whole.\"</p><p>In that, the body of work is faintly reminiscent of iconic photographers from August Sander to Diane Arbus, showing riveting individuals as part of a greater communal portrait. There's a sense of almost sociological declension – of Bronx life in all its tough glory.</p><p>Lawrence aims to disperse any prejudices that arise solely from appearances: his pictures make the significance of social trappings fade. He lost a brother early on – he was murdered while still in his 20s. \"I know about wasted potential, but people never got to see what I saw in him. I want to give people a chance to see what they wouldn't see otherwise.\"</p><p>Born in St Kitts in 1974, Lawrence regards himself as \"an immigrant artist\". When he first moved to the US, he worked as a carpenter in southern California. Discovering American photographer Gordon Parks's autobiography, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/A-Choice-Weapons-Gordon-Parks/dp/0873517695\" title=\"\">A Choice of Weapons</a>, reoriented him towards the field of photography. Parks, who was a staff photographer for Life magazine, is legendary for addressing racial discrimination in mid-20th century America. \"Searching for my place in American society, I immediately identified with Parks's life story,\" he said. \"For the first time I was faced with imagery that dealt with the human condition, and I committed myself to using photography as a tool to confront long-standing ideas about race and class.\" He enrolled in community college in California, then later moved to New York with his family.</p><p>\"I'm most interested in documenting communities of the African diaspora,\" he says of the work he plans to pursue in the future. But for now, he's in New York, showing off the <a href=\"http://flagartfoundation.org/exhibitions/images-of-venus-from-wayne-lawrences-orchard-beach-the-bronx-riviera/\" title=\"\">Bronx Riviera at the Flag Art Foundation</a> in Manhattan and the <a href=\"http://www.bronxmuseum.org/exhibitions/orchard-beach-the-bronx-riviera\" title=\"\">Bronx Museum of the Arts</a>, and making the locals proud.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419907928|2013-10-17T12:53:03Z|9d76c9768f285765a1c53938e15e0ec8605d84ab -->",
