        "body":"<p>An art haul confiscated from a Munich flat includes previously unknown works by Marc Chagall and Otto Dix, and original pieces by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, Bavarian authorities have revealed.</p><p>At a press conference in Augsburg, the art historian who has been studying the collection since its discovery gave a first glimpse of the trove, which includes modernist works as well as older pieces dating back as far as the 16th century.</p><p>The whereabouts of the 80-year-old owner of the flat, Austrian Cornelius Gurlitt, is not known.</p><p>Treasures found in Gurlitt's flat include works by Franz Marc, Oskar Kokoschka, Toulouse Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Liebermann, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Beckmann, a Canaletto sketch of Padua, a Carl Spitzweg etching of a couple playing music, and a Gustave Courbet painting of a girl with a goat.</p><p>But art historian Meike Hoffmann of Berlin's Free University said the art world would be particularly excited about the discovery of a Matisse painting from around 1920 and works that were previously unknown or unseen: an Otto Dix self portrait dated around 1919, and a Marc Chagall <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouache\" title=\"\">guache</a> painting of a metaphorical scene. Hoffmann said it had been \"an incredible feeling of joy\" to discover these paintings in good conditions.</p><p>Customs officials also used the press conference to correct a number of initial press reports. They said the flat had been raided in March 2012, not in early 2011 as Focus magazine reported on Sunday.</p><p>Gurlitt had sold a Max Beckmann painting to a Cologne auction house in September 2011, inviting speculation that he had another stash of artworks hidden in another location. This, said Munich customs official Siegfried Klöble, was \"not likely\".</p><p>Gurlitt's current location or wellbeing is not known. When asked by one journalist if Gurlitt was still alive, Augsburg chief prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz said he could not comment.</p><p>Authorities said the total number of artworks found was 1,406 – 121 of them framed, the rest unframed – and that they had been stored professionally and were in a good condition.</p><p>There were currently no plans to put the pieces online, as this may not be in the interest of the rightful owners. Instead, the customs officials were hoping that people with a claim to ownership would contact the authorities directly.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421689447|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|e3559fe14c4f8fb692233a2e22089d86227cef44 -->",

It's coming from the camel-hair brush of Peter Bowers, master gilder at <a href=\"http://www.hare-humphreys.co.uk/\">Hare &amp; Humphreys</a>, who is busy dabbing at a flower-shaped moulding at the top of the 150-year-old structure – unveiled this week after a £2m refurbishment.</p><p>Bowers has been gilding for more than 20 years, working on everything from palaces in Oman to London's St Pancras station. In the autumn sun, flecks of golden dandruff glimmer on his shoulders and scraps of gilt sparkle across his chin, giving the impression he might actually be shedding gold himself.</p><p>\"I get some funny looks on the train,\" he says, explaining how his facial sparkle results not from a penchant for glitter makeup, but from dabbing the brush against his face to gain static, and a bit of grease, to pick up the gold leaf. He offers me a turn, handing over the squirrel-hair gilders tip – a wide, thin brush used to apply the leaf, before the camel-hair mop is used to stipple it in place – and a thin sheet of gold on a small square of paper.</p><p>The leaf is only 0.5 microns thick, 200 times thinner than a human hair. Before I get near my target, it catches the wind and folds up on itself like a disobedient sheet of cling-film. Dabbing it over the cast-iron petals, already prepared with a quick-drying size adhesive, half of it seems to want to take flight and float away on the breeze. Bowers and his colleagues aren't called master gilders for nothing.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421684645'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383604282206/flowers_andrewBuckingham.gif' alt='Master gilder … Peter Bowers at work.

Freshly gilded, the scales of the City dragons and the wings of the knight's helmet gleam with startling brightness – to the extent that, on a recent visit, the site manager thought his workers had left a spotlight on during the day.</p><p>\"We wanted maximum bling,\" says City conservation officer Paul Robertshaw, explaining how the bridge has been through a number of paint jobs in its life – 14 according to <a href=\"http://patrickbaty.co.uk/2012/02/01/holborn-viaduct/\">paintwork analysis</a> – in varying levels of gaudiness. \"When it was opened in 1869, it was painted with a riot of green and red and brown and gold, but this didn't last long – it was considered too much even for Victorian tastes.\"</p><p>WB Yeats recounted William Morris's violent reaction to the eyeful of coloured mouldings when he met him on the bridge, soon after the opening: \"[Morris] began to praise it with the words, 'This is my kind of poetry', and promised to write about it, and would have said I do not know how much more,\" writes Yeats, \"if he had not suddenly caught sight of one of those decorated lamp posts, and waving his umbrella at the post, raged at the Corporation.\"</p><p>Today, passers-by stop and stare, not to rage, but to remark on how lustrous the viaduct is looking, its details newly exposed after the entire bridge was shot-blasted to remove years of encrusted paint. \"People have been stopping in their tracks asking how it can be quite so shiny,\" says Hare &amp; Humphreys' project manager, Chris Britain. \"They're so used to seeing just gold paint, rather than the real thing.\"</p><p>His team was also responsible for <a href=\"http://www.hare-humphreys.co.uk/projects/the-monument-to-the-great-fire-london\">re-gilding the flaming orb</a> at the top of the Monument to the Great Fire of London in 2008. Glaring in 24-carat lustre, it looks like it could put the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/06/walkie-talkie-architect-predicted-reflection-sun-rays\">Walkie-Scorchie's</a> singeing powers to shame.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421684646'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383604810251/monument.gif' alt='Flaming orb … the top of the Monument to the Great Fire of London.

There is the chubby little <a href=\"http://hidden-london.com/the-guide/golden-boy-of-pye-corner/\">Golden Boy of Pye Corner</a>, blushing in shame at the point where the Great Fire stopped. \"The fire was ascribed to the sin of gluttony,\" reads the accompanying sign, \"and the boy was made prodigiously fat to enforce the moral.\"</p><p>There is the <a href=\"http://hidden-london.com/nuggets/ariel-at-tivoli-corner/\">leaping Ariel</a> atop the Bank of England, carrying gilt-edged credit and trust around the world, and <a href=\"http://www.artofthestate.co.uk/london_photos/statue_of_justice.htm\">Lady Justice</a> on top of the Old Bailey, stalwartly holding her golden sword and scales in outstretched arms for the last hundred years. There is the <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Golden_Ball_and_Cross_on_Dome_of_St_Paul's_Cathedral,_London_EC2_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1089422.jpg\">vast golden cross</a> on the dome of St Paul's, presiding over countless other church spire finials, including <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Dragon_atop_St_Mary-le-Bow_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1304674.jpg\">St Mary-le-Bow's fearsome dragon</a> in full flight. Behind closed doors there are untold orgies of gilding, from the inner chambers of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/london/content/image_galleries/mansion_house_gallery.shtml?1\">Mansion House</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.guildhall.cityoflondon.gov.uk/\">Guildhall</a>, and as you might expect, the interior of <a href=\"http://londonhistorians.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dsc05211c.jpg\">Goldsmiths Hall</a> looks like the glitzy lair of Midas himself.</p><p>But since the Victorian frenzy of gilded glamour, there has been little use of gold leaf on our buildings. Instead, there has been an alarming fad for gold-coloured cladding, which more often than not ends up looking like the building has been dipped in a vat of metallic mustard. From Rafael Viñoly's <a href=\"http://www.firstsite.uk.net/page/rafael-vinoly-firstsite-architect\">Firstsite</a> in Colchester to the scaly hulk of the <a href=\"http://egretwest.com/projects/homes/the-fold-sidcup/\">Fold apartment block</a> in Sidcup, by Egret West, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tecu_consulting_uk/sets/72157625206054650/detail/\">TECU Gold</a> and its imitators have a lot to answer for.</p><p>More recently, younger practices have been showing there might be renewed hope for the gilder's tip yet, beyond the rarefied realms of conservation. East London office <a href=\"http://www.studioweave.com/\">Studio Weave</a> added an extra decorative dimension to their <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2012/07/27/paleys-upon-pilers-by-studio-weave/\">Paleys Upon Pilers</a> folly in Aldgate, by screen-printing a patterned layer of adhesive on to the timber columns and gilding them by hand.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421684647'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383604918309/studioweave.gif' alt='Chaucerian gilt … preparing decorative columns for Studio Weave's Paleys Upon Pilers folly.

The practice has since used gold leaf on its <a href=\"http://www.theaoc.co.uk/docs/royal_armouries/royal_armouries_2.html\">renovation of the Royal Armouries</a> in Leeds, decorating the concrete walls with a heraldic pattern – which, at £477, proved cheaper than just covering them with paint.</p><p>\"That's the beauty of gold leaf,\" says Britain. \"It can be the most cost-effective solution, as its lifespan outlasts even the most durable paint – the Monument gilding will last for 50 years or more.\" So next time architects have pretensions of designing for Auric Goldfinger, let's hope they ditch the gold-effect cladding and opt for the real thing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421654648|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|f389d02fe3d694ea3453ab83348a24e3c9e66715 -->",

        "body":"<p>A few years ago, I decided to walk on the foreshore of the Thames from Battersea Park as far to the east as I could. I had observed over the years that, at especially low tides, quite large areas of hardened mud were exposed; these were either studded with pebbles and flints, or gave way to chunks of concrete slipway, or elided into true shingle. Naturally, being the sort of man I am, I hadn't made a comprehensive survey of either the littoral or the tide table, so I soon found myself wading thigh-high in the obscuring mocha of the waters, and feeling the thick silt ooze between my sandals and my soles. Impulsiveness has at least this virtue: it impels you.</p><p>I've lived in Stockwell, about half a mile south of the Thames, for the past 17 years. At best, it has provided me with amazement: like the time when I was cycling over Vauxhall Bridge, saw a small crowd gathered by the parapet, and dismounted to see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/10/london-whale-plaque-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">a poor whale who, scrambled up by sonar, had made his way upriver to die</a>. And at worst, it allows me some sense of the physical landscape that underlies London's portentous human geography: its hulking blocks and loitering street furniture set along elongated and repetitive arterial roads. To feel the city's location as topographically (rather than financially) determined, it's necessary to either gain sufficient height to see the lazy S-bends uncoiling along the floor of the valley, or go down to that river itself.</p><p>On pewter-grey and claustrophobic days, I'll walk for 10 minutes to the riverbank and, despite the oppressive sense of the city as a coagulation of human futility, my blues will be diluted by the Thames itself – because it doesn't care. Its great glaucous surge will continue, regardless, as its embanked pharynx sucks in the sea and spurts it out again. On the evening I walked along the foreshore from Battersea Park, I ended up wading at least half the distance to the strange rusty old freighter that's been tied up permanently beside Albert Embankment. It's been converted into a bar bistro called, suitably enough, <a href=\"http://www.tdock.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tamesis</a>. When I wasn't wading, I was marvelling at the&nbsp;strata the low tide had exposed: the old and oily piles, the weedy sections of wall, the slipways to and from nowhere. In the lee of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/jul/21/whicharetheworldsugliestbuildings\" title=\"\">the ghastly St George's Wharf development</a>, there's an info-board that tells the idle stroller she is within a few yards of the oldest Thames crossings – a neolithic bridge, or pontoon, that stretched out&nbsp;across the waters when they were still ungirded.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421642692'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/4/1383585891032/Thames-Frost-2010-by-Kurt-001.jpg' alt='Thames Frost, 2010, by Kurt Jackson' width='460' height='436' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Thames Frost, 2010, by Kurt Jackson</figcaption></figure><p>But really, you've only to take the ramp beside <a href=\"http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/sismi6-headquarters-vauxhall-cross-london-uk\" title=\"\">the MI6 building</a> in order to acquire a direct apprehension of the river as an artery wending through the ages. When I reached Tamesis, I was waist-deep in this lifeblood, and although it was perfectly clear to me that were I to push on towards the irrelevance of Westminster – a reef sustaining but a meagre and worsted biodiversity – I would soon be sucked under, to be found days or months later at Gravesend, with eels exiting from my eyes. Yet I longed to go on, for the Thames remains the source of the epiphany I had 30 years ago, one that sent me spiralling into a new relationship with my natal city.</p><p>Standing on a sunlit Mayfair street, aged 25 with time to kill and no money to spend, it flowed into me – from the oceanic and collective consciousness perhaps – that although I'd been born within 100 yards of its banks, I had never seen the mouth of the Thames, nor, for&nbsp;that matter, had I much conception of what it might be like. It struck me almost simultaneously that, were you to encounter some benighted peon 30-odd miles from the mouth of the Amazon and ask him what it was like where the great river meets the sea, and he were to say that he had absolutely no idea, you'd think him a very benighted peon indeed. Driving east through Erith and Dartmouth, and then on to Gravesend, I was that peon. But I was about to be freed – and it was the Thames that freed me, as it spread out&nbsp;between the Grain and Canvey, a&nbsp;great electrolyte bath in which, over&nbsp;the next quarter-century, my imagination would be silvered.</p><p>In the intervening time, since I stood at the mouth of the Thames and&nbsp;watched the container ships struggle out to sea like multi-storey blocks in full flood from Thatcher's privatisation, I've been up and down the length of the river a fair amount. I've rowed on it and swam in it, but mostly I've walked beside it – sometimes fanatically – in search of that rare&nbsp;combination of the transcendent and the haptic that only the work of a serious artist can achieve. Looking at&nbsp;Kurt Jackson's canvases, which manage this feat so triumphantly for the Thames, it occurs to me that I might as well have stayed at home, waiting for them to come into being.</p><p>• This is an edited extract from Will Self's catalogue essay on Kurt Jackson.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421635063|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|824ce8de70c1eb18173665f422071af1088d68e0 -->",

        "headline":"Does the Munich hoard turn the story of art and the Nazis on its head?",
        "body":"<p>It is one of the most shuddered-at chapters in the story of art. In July 1937, Nazi officials turned up in full uniform alongside evening-suited cultural eminences of the Third Reich at an art gallery in Munich for the opening of the Exhibition of Degenerate Art. They came not to praise modern art, but to laugh at it.</p><p>Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Georg Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner – the masters of modernism, including giants of Germany's own avant garde, were shown in this exhibition as deviant, decadent practitioners of so-called Degenerate Art – \"<em>Entartete Kunst\"</em>. Sections of the show had titles such as&nbsp;\"Total Madness\", \"The Prostitute Raised to a Moral Ideal\", \"The Negroisation of Art\". Modern art was interpreted in the catalogue as a conspiracy by Russian Bolsheviks and Jewish dealers to destroy European culture. The admiration for African carvings that had so fired Picasso and other artists was taken as proof of modern art's racial degeneracy.</p><p>Vile stuff – but the Nazi attitude to modern art may have been radically misunderstood. An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police\" title=\"\">amazing discovery in 21st-century Munich</a> turns the story of art and the Nazis on its head.</p><p>Cornelius Gurlitt's flat looks meagre in photographs. It is located in an apartment block in Munich that, from the outside, appears to have seen better days. Yet in that flat lay secrets of the Third Reich only now accidentally uncovered. Intrigued by Gurlitt's lack of German identity documents and odd behaviour while crossing the border on a trip to Switzerland, police raided his home and found a hoard of more than 1,500 works of art including pieces by Picasso, Matisse, Renoir, Paul Klee, Emil Nolde, Franz Marc, Otto Dix and Oskar Kokoschka. The understandably reclusive Gurlitt turned out to be the son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer who played a key role in the Nazi roundup of \"degenerate art\". Although half-Jewish, and the cousin of the \"degenerate\" composer Manfred Gurlitt, the Nazis considered him a useful expert. This is not just any haul of stolen goods: it may turn out to be one the most important recoveries of lost art ever. For it takes us to the heart of the cultural policies and crimes of the Third Reich.</p><p>It raises massive questions about the fate of art in and after the second world war. As the allies entered Germany in the last phase of the war they took with them experts, nicknamed the \"monuments men\", whose job was to find out where the Nazis had stashed looted works of art. For it was not just modern art the Nazis abused. All over Europe, they seized the best masterpieces from the&nbsp;finest museums. Many of these, including such treasures as <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Titian_-_Danae_(Hermitage_Version).jpg\" title=\"\">Titian's Danae</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/open-altarpiece.jpg\" title=\"\">Van Eyck's Ghent altarpiece</a>, were found stashed in mountain tunnels and mines. Others, including many of the works of art shown in the Degenerate Art exhibit, are believed lost for ever. Paintings such as <a href=\"http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/374/Painter-on-His-Way-to-Work,-The.html\" title=\"\">Van Gogh's The&nbsp;Painter on his Way to Work</a> and 14&nbsp;masterpieces by Gustav Klimt are written off as destroyed. But is it possible a Nazi network preserved a secret world of stolen art after 1945? Is&nbsp;it even possible such art was used to fund neo-Nazi activities or maintain war criminals in quiet comfort?</p><p>To put it another way: were Hildebrand Gurlitt and his son unique, or is the find in Munich a clue to some larger network of Nazi art hoarders sitting on secret treasures all this time in postwar Europe, living off occasional covert sales of the Picassos that they keep among the canned foods in their anonymous flats?</p><p>One thing is certain: this story comes from the dark heart of Nazi Europe. Munich was Hitler's art capital. As a young man, famously, he wanted to be an artist. He wasted an inheritance trying to get an art education in Vienna. While Klimt was creating modern art there, Hitler was going to the opera to&nbsp;hear Wagner (conducted by the modernist Gustav Mahler), and soon eking a living painting drab topographic scenes. Eventually he left for Munich, where he survived as a hack painter of typical German scenery until the first world war gave him a new life as a soldier. Hitler loved Munich, and when he came to power lavished money on its art scene. The city's expressionist painters were in trouble. But while Degenerate Art pilloried them, in 1938 Hitler opened a huge exhibition of \"proper\" German art at the newly built House of German Art, a grand neo-classical temple to the art of a new, fascist Europe. Where the year before thousands had flocked to see the art they were told to hate, far fewer went to see Nazi-favoured art.</p><p>This is where the cliches start. It is conventional to contrast the avant-garde art the Nazis maligned with the traditionalism and conservatism of the art they admired. But the National Socialist nightmare was not \"conservative\". It was, in its own way, horribly modern – it imagined a different, perverted vision of modernity. The House of German Art still survives in Munich. Today it is used as an <a href=\"http://www.hausderkunst.de\" title=\"\">alternative arts centre</a>. Video and installation look subversively great in its grand icy halls. You wouldn't call these rooms old-fashioned. Rather they have a chilly neo-classical hauteur that speaks of sublime ambition. <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/M%C3%BCnchen_Haus_der_Kunst_2009.jpg\" title=\"\">This is the neo-classical modern art of Nazism</a> that can&nbsp;still be seen in Leni Riefenstahl's terrifying films – some of the most disturbingly beautiful ever made – and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpY22uSAPAA\" title=\"\">designs of Hitler's architects Paul Troost</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/feb/01/architecture.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Albert Speer</a>.</p><p>Hitler did not hate art – he loved it. Other leading Nazis just saw it as money. Goering, greedy and corrupt, amassed art because it symbolised wealth and power. Munich was at the centre of the regime's cultural pretensions. The Gurlitt hoard is a survival of&nbsp;the Nazis' strange and ambivalent attitude to art, from Hitler's aesthetic New Order to the simple philistine greed that probably motivated most of&nbsp;their art theft.</p><p>Gurlitt's cache reveals that many assumptions about the Nazis and art are simply untrue. The Degenerate Art exhibition was real enough – but did it really mean the Nazis hated modern art? It is because we take this for granted that no one has been searching for lost \"degenerate\" works such as those in the flat in Munich. Some works from the Entartete Kunst exhibition, many seized from once-progressive German museums, were sold abroad afterwards. Others have vanished. As the war began and Nazi racial policies became ever more explicit, more modern and pre-modern works were seized or bought for a pittance from Jewish owners. Much was destroyed. Or was it?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421649944'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/4/1383591133414/Goerings-art-collection-009.jpg' alt='Goering's art collection' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>An American soldier examines part of Herman Goering's personal collection of looted art, recovered as the allies invaded Germany in 1945. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most suspicious cases is that of Klimt's lost works. Fourteen paintings by this Austrian visionary of dreams and desire were stored in an Austrian castle during the war. In 1945, an SS battalion reportedly held an orgy there before setting the castle alight. The Klimts are presumed lost, but there were rumours that some might have been spirited away. Now, surely, such stories need to be re-examined. The 1,500 works hidden by the Gurlitts, father and son, were also presumed lost.</p><p>The allies tend to blame themselves for art lost in Germany in the 1940s. Almost every major German city was bombed by Britain and the US during the second world war. Firestorms ravaged museums and art stores as well as killing thousands of civilians. \"Bomber\" Harris, Britain's Bomber Command mastermind who insisted this was the way to win the war, was apparently responsible for burning paintings such as Van Gogh's Painter on the Way to Work and Caravaggio's first version of St Matthew, as well as his portrait of a courtesan.</p><p>Perhaps the single most significant fact that has so far come out about Hildebrand Gurlitt is that he claimed his collection of looted art was destroyed in the bombing of Dresden. So it was the allies who burned it. If he lied so easily about that, what about other Nazi-owned art that supposedly vanished in wartime air raids?</p><p>The massive destruction the Nazis brought down on Germany created chaos in 1945. As the \"monuments men\" were seeking out stolen art treasures in Alpine mines, it seems Gurlitt was carefully and quietly preserving his personal hoard.</p><p>The reason he got away with it is that he had grabbed so many modernist works. Ever since 1937, it has been assumed that \"degenerate art\" was either sold abroad or destroyed. The \"monuments men\" went searching for Titians, not Picassos. But the Munich hoard proves the naivety of this assumption. Even in the mind of Hitler, modern art was bizarrely fascinating. You do not put on an exhibition of something you do not want to look at. In some strange way the Nazis needed modern art, as a demonic image of their nightmares. The Degenerate Art exhibition is, after all, the biggest backhanded compliment ever paid to the avant garde. Many people think art has no influence on the world. Hitler knew&nbsp;it did. The old saw that he hated modernism is just too simple. He loved to hate it. What you love to hate, you want to keep, somewhere, if only as a freakshow curiosity.</p><p>Other Nazis simply went along with&nbsp;Hitler's taste in public but did not really know what the would-be artist in him was talking about. In Mussolini's Italy, the Futurist movement was cosy with fascism. There was no reason – Italy proved – that fascists needed to spurn modernism. Some German modern artists, notably Nolde, were themselves sympathetic to the far&nbsp;right.</p><p>Then there was greed. In the end, the National Socialists were thugs, criminals and murderers. The idea that&nbsp;most of them believed deeply in ideological discriminations about art is not that plausible. For men like Gurlitt, modern art made a good stash. He and his son sat on the hoard while his claim that it was lost in a firestorm was taken at face value.</p><p>Now the books on Nazi loot need to be reopened. It seems only too possible that other Gurlitts hid away other art treasures in the chaos of defeat.</p><p>In one of the last photographs ever taken of Adolf Hitler he is in the bunker in Berlin <a href=\"http://carolynyeager.net/images/TBR_Farewell%20Berlin_html_m47768c16.jpg\" title=\"\">contemplating Albert Speer's design for a new art capital to be built at Linz</a>. Much as he loved Munich, this city was closer to his childhood home. Its massive new museum was to have contained all the art treasures of conquered Europe.</p><p>While Hitler doted on his cultural fantasies, paintings were vanishing into fruit cellars and attics. It was so easy to write them off in the Führer's Götterdämmerung.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/04/missing-in-action-artworks-destroyed-war\"><br />Read Jonathan Jones on the masterpieces that are missing in action</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421646342|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|956e2ffec571b519ee0b54df17dde425b5f99873 -->",

You look at his pictures and you feel that he <em>had</em> to make them. For him, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/may/28/art3\" title=\"\">photography is an obsession as well as an art form</a>.\"</p><p>Now the two Scandinavian photographers have created a book together. It is called <a href=\"http://www.dewilewispublishing.com/GENERAL/NEW&amp;RECENT.html\" title=\"\">Veins</a> and is a work of two distinct halves: a selection of Petersen's work culled from his extensive archive, followed by newer work by Sobol. But had the images been mixed, it would have been hard to identify which photograph was taken by whom. Both favour grainy tones, raw subject matter and high-contrast black and white. A close-up photograph of a couple embracing by Petersen is echoed later by another couple staring into each other's eyes: both capture the blemishes and shadows of the human face with an unforgiving eye. Petersen is drawn to doubles: bleach blonde twins in short skirts; two almost identical sisters in matching tiaras and white lace. Sobol often captures a pair of bodies in graphic closeup, drawing the viewer's eye to hair, skin and scars. Both are drawn to the relentless traces of age and encroaching mortality. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421642005'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/4/1383568943703/Untitled-by-Anders-Peters-001.jpg' alt='Untitled by Anders Petersen' width='460' height='700' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Untitled by Anders Petersen. Photograph: Anders Petersen</figcaption></figure><p>Though Petersen is from Sweden and Sobol from Denmark, they share a definable Nordic sensibility – what Petersen once called a \"poetical sadness\". That sensibility can be traced back to the work of the late <a href=\"http://www.stromholm.com/\" title=\"\">Christer Stromholm</a>, whose pioneering Fotoskolan (Photoschool) Petersen attended in 1966.</p><p>Over 30 years later, in 1998, a young Sobol enrolled at the Danish School of Photography, where Stromholm was the guiding spirit and Petersen the most well-known teacher. You can draw a line of direct influence from Stromholm's seminal photobook <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/02/amies-place-blanche-christer-stromholm-review\" title=\"\">Les Amies de Place Blanche</a>, about a transvestite community in Pigalle, through <a href=\"http://www.photoeye.com/bookstore/citation.cfm?catalog=SM248\" title=\"\">Petersen's dark classic Cafe Lehmitz</a>, set among the demi-monde of Hamburg's red-light district Reeperbahn, to Sobel's startling first book, <a href=\"http://www.auesobol.dk/work/index.php?Sabine?image=0\" title=\"\">Sabine, about his intense relationship with a young Inuit girl in eastern Greenland</a>.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421642006'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/4/1383569261814/Untitled-by-Jacob-Aue-Sob-001.jpg' alt='Untitled by Jacob Aue Sobol' width='460' height='700' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Untitled by Jacob Aue Sobol.  Photograph: Jacob Aue Sobol/Magnum</figcaption></figure><p> Like Stromholm before him, Petersen has become a guiding spirit for a younger generation of Scandinavian photographers. Veins, as the title suggests, is often overt in its bid to get under the skin of its marginalised subjects – to the point where the casual viewer may find it voyeuristic. Both photographers seem drawn to seediness, and there is nudity, blood and human strangeness aplenty here, but also tender moments of quiet intimacy.</p><p>It is difficult to single out individual photographs, as there is a cumulative power to both series. But as Petersen ages, one senses a creeping tenderness in his work, best illustrated by some beautiful snatched portraits: a naked woman peering over a window ledge is echoed by another of a woman walking though some shutters clutching a towel or sheet. In each scene, their nudity, seen from behind, is almost incidental to the mystery of the moment. One wonders how Petersen gains access to these private scenarios.</p><p>Sobol also includes a beautifully grainy shot of an arched female back as well as a striking portrait of a woman, her long hair falling over her breasts and her eyes and lips as dark as sin. But, elsewhere, his pitiless gaze is drawn to wrinkled skin and jutting bones – the creases, folds and scars of age and experience.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421642007'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/4/1383568886703/Untitled-by-Jacob-Aue-Sob-001.jpg' alt='Untitled by Jacob Aue Sobol ' width='460' height='700' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Untitled by Jacob Aue Sobol.  Photograph: Jacob Aue Sobol </figcaption></figure><p>Both like grimy places, and both are drawn to the extremes of beauty and decay, darkness and light. If both Petersen and Sobol are relentless in their depiction of the raw and gritty, I nevertheless kept thinking, as I flicked though Veins, of Leonard Cohen's song, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ma5tF6TJpA\" title=\"\">Anthem</a>, and specifically the lines: \"There is a crack in everything/That's how the light gets in.\" As Veins shows, a strange beauty is illuminated as a result.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421618621|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|2c65494621b54043e859dd1e9c4f5538c33529d6 -->",

        "headline":"Does the Munich hoard turn the story of art and the Nazis on its head?",
        "body":"<p>It is one of the most shuddered-at chapters in the story of art. In July 1937, Nazi officials turned up in full uniform alongside evening-suited cultural eminences of the Third Reich at an art gallery in Munich for the opening of the Exhibition of Degenerate Art. They came not to praise modern art, but to laugh at it.</p><p>Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Georg Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner – the masters of modernism, including giants of Germany's own avant garde, were shown in this exhibition as deviant, decadent practitioners of so-called Degenerate Art – \"<em>Entartete Kunst\"</em>. Sections of the show had titles such as&nbsp;\"Total Madness\", \"The Prostitute Raised to a Moral Ideal\", \"The Negroisation of Art\". Modern art was interpreted in the catalogue as a conspiracy by Russian Bolsheviks and Jewish dealers to destroy European culture. The admiration for African carvings that had so fired Picasso and other artists was taken as proof of modern art's racial degeneracy.</p><p>Vile stuff – but the Nazi attitude to modern art may have been radically misunderstood. An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police\" title=\"\">amazing discovery in 21st-century Munich</a> turns the story of art and the Nazis on its head.</p><p>Cornelius Gurlitt's flat looks meagre in photographs. It is located in an apartment block in Munich that, from the outside, appears to have seen better days. Yet in that flat lay secrets of the Third Reich only now accidentally uncovered. Intrigued by Gurlitt's lack of German identity documents and odd behaviour while crossing the border on a trip to Switzerland, police raided his home and found a hoard of more than 1,500 works of art including pieces by Picasso, Matisse, Renoir, Paul Klee, Emil Nolde, Franz Marc, Otto Dix and Oskar Kokoschka. The understandably reclusive Gurlitt turned out to be the son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer who played a key role in the Nazi roundup of \"degenerate art\". Although half-Jewish, and the cousin of the \"degenerate\" composer Manfred Gurlitt, the Nazis considered him a useful expert. This is not just any haul of stolen goods: it may turn out to be one the most important recoveries of lost art ever. For it takes us to the heart of the cultural policies and crimes of the Third Reich.</p><p>It raises massive questions about the fate of art in and after the second world war. As the allies entered Germany in the last phase of the war they took with them experts, nicknamed the \"monuments men\", whose job was to find out where the Nazis had stashed looted works of art. For it was not just modern art the Nazis abused. All over Europe, they seized the best masterpieces from the&nbsp;finest museums. Many of these, including such treasures as <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Titian_-_Danae_(Hermitage_Version).jpg\" title=\"\">Titian's Danae</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/open-altarpiece.jpg\" title=\"\">Van Eyck's Ghent altarpiece</a>, were found stashed in mountain tunnels and mines. Others, including many of the works of art shown in the Degenerate Art exhibit, are believed lost for ever. Paintings such as <a href=\"http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/374/Painter-on-His-Way-to-Work,-The.html\" title=\"\">Van Gogh's The&nbsp;Painter on his Way to Work</a> and 14&nbsp;masterpieces by Gustav Klimt are written off as destroyed. But is it possible a Nazi network preserved a secret world of stolen art after 1945? Is&nbsp;it even possible such art was used to fund neo-Nazi activities or maintain war criminals in quiet comfort?</p><p>To put it another way: were Hildebrand Gurlitt and his son unique, or is the find in Munich a clue to some larger network of Nazi art hoarders sitting on secret treasures all this time in postwar Europe, living off occasional covert sales of the Picassos that they keep among the canned foods in their anonymous flats?</p><p>One thing is certain: this story comes from the dark heart of Nazi Europe. Munich was Hitler's art capital. As a young man, famously, he wanted to be an artist. He wasted an inheritance trying to get an art education in Vienna. While Klimt was creating modern art there, Hitler was going to the opera to&nbsp;hear Wagner (conducted by the modernist Gustav Mahler), and soon eking a living painting drab topographic scenes. Eventually he left for Munich, where he survived as a hack painter of typical German scenery until the first world war gave him a new life as a soldier. Hitler loved Munich, and when he came to power lavished money on its art scene. The city's expressionist painters were in trouble. But while Degenerate Art pilloried them, in 1938 Hitler opened a huge exhibition of \"proper\" German art at the newly built House of German Art, a grand neo-classical temple to the art of a new, fascist Europe. Where the year before thousands had flocked to see the art they were told to hate, far fewer went to see Nazi-favoured art.</p><p>This is where the cliches start. It is conventional to contrast the avant-garde art the Nazis maligned with the traditionalism and conservatism of the art they admired. But the National Socialist nightmare was not \"conservative\". It was, in its own way, horribly modern – it imagined a different, perverted vision of modernity. The House of German Art still survives in Munich. Today it is used as an <a href=\"http://www.hausderkunst.de\" title=\"\">alternative arts centre</a>. Video and installation look subversively great in its grand icy halls. You wouldn't call these rooms old-fashioned. Rather they have a chilly neo-classical hauteur that speaks of sublime ambition. <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/M%C3%BCnchen_Haus_der_Kunst_2009.jpg\" title=\"\">This is the neo-classical modern art of Nazism</a> that can&nbsp;still be seen in Leni Riefenstahl's terrifying films – some of the most disturbingly beautiful ever made – and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpY22uSAPAA\" title=\"\">designs of Hitler's architects Paul Troost</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/feb/01/architecture.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Albert Speer</a>.</p><p>Hitler did not hate art – he loved it. Other leading Nazis just saw it as money. Goering, greedy and corrupt, amassed art because it symbolised wealth and power. Munich was at the centre of the regime's cultural pretensions. The Gurlitt hoard is a survival of&nbsp;the Nazis' strange and ambivalent attitude to art, from Hitler's aesthetic New Order to the simple philistine greed that probably motivated most of&nbsp;their art theft.</p><p>Gurlitt's cache reveals that many assumptions about the Nazis and art are simply untrue. The Degenerate Art exhibition was real enough – but did it really mean the Nazis hated modern art? It is because we take this for granted that no one has been searching for lost \"degenerate\" works such as those in the flat in Munich. Some works from the Entartete Kunst exhibition, many seized from once-progressive German museums, were sold abroad afterwards. Others have vanished. As the war began and Nazi racial policies became ever more explicit, more modern and pre-modern works were seized or bought for a pittance from Jewish owners. Much was destroyed. Or was it?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421649944'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/4/1383591133414/Goerings-art-collection-009.jpg' alt='Goering's art collection' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>An American soldier examines part of Herman Goering's personal collection of looted art, recovered as the allies invaded Germany in 1945. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most suspicious cases is that of Klimt's lost works. Fourteen paintings by this Austrian visionary of dreams and desire were stored in an Austrian castle during the war. In 1945, an SS battalion reportedly held an orgy there before setting the castle alight. The Klimts are presumed lost, but there were rumours that some might have been spirited away. Now, surely, such stories need to be re-examined. The 1,500 works hidden by the Gurlitts, father and son, were also presumed lost.</p><p>The allies tend to blame themselves for art lost in Germany in the 1940s. Almost every major German city was bombed by Britain and the US during the second world war. Firestorms ravaged museums and art stores as well as killing thousands of civilians. \"Bomber\" Harris, Britain's Bomber Command mastermind who insisted this was the way to win the war, was apparently responsible for burning paintings such as Van Gogh's Painter on the Way to Work and Caravaggio's first version of St Matthew, as well as his portrait of a courtesan.</p><p>Perhaps the single most significant fact that has so far come out about Hildebrand Gurlitt is that he claimed his collection of looted art was destroyed in the bombing of Dresden. So it was the allies who burned it. If he lied so easily about that, what about other Nazi-owned art that supposedly vanished in wartime air raids?</p><p>The massive destruction the Nazis brought down on Germany created chaos in 1945. As the \"monuments men\" were seeking out stolen art treasures in Alpine mines, it seems Gurlitt was carefully and quietly preserving his personal hoard.</p><p>The reason he got away with it is that he had grabbed so many modernist works. Ever since 1937, it has been assumed that \"degenerate art\" was either sold abroad or destroyed. The \"monuments men\" went searching for Titians, not Picassos. But the Munich hoard proves the naivety of this assumption. Even in the mind of Hitler, modern art was bizarrely fascinating. You do not put on an exhibition of something you do not want to look at. In some strange way the Nazis needed modern art, as a demonic image of their nightmares. The Degenerate Art exhibition is, after all, the biggest backhanded compliment ever paid to the avant garde. Many people think art has no influence on the world. Hitler knew&nbsp;it did. The old saw that he hated modernism is just too simple. He loved to hate it. What you love to hate, you want to keep, somewhere, if only as a freakshow curiosity.</p><p>Other Nazis simply went along with&nbsp;Hitler's taste in public but did not really know what the would-be artist in him was talking about. In Mussolini's Italy, the Futurist movement was cosy with fascism. There was no reason – Italy proved – that fascists needed to spurn modernism. Some German modern artists, notably Nolde, were themselves sympathetic to the far&nbsp;right.</p><p>Then there was greed. In the end, the National Socialists were thugs, criminals and murderers. The idea that&nbsp;most of them believed deeply in ideological discriminations about art is not that plausible. For men like Gurlitt, modern art made a good stash. He and his son sat on the hoard while his claim that it was lost in a firestorm was taken at face value.</p><p>Now the books on Nazi loot need to be reopened. It seems only too possible that other Gurlitts hid away other art treasures in the chaos of defeat.</p><p>In one of the last photographs ever taken of Adolf Hitler he is in the bunker in Berlin <a href=\"http://carolynyeager.net/images/TBR_Farewell%20Berlin_html_m47768c16.jpg\" title=\"\">contemplating Albert Speer's design for a new art capital to be built at Linz</a>. Much as he loved Munich, this city was closer to his childhood home. Its massive new museum was to have contained all the art treasures of conquered Europe.</p><p>While Hitler doted on his cultural fantasies, paintings were vanishing into fruit cellars and attics. It was so easy to write them off in the Führer's Götterdämmerung.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/04/missing-in-action-artworks-destroyed-war\"><br />Read Jonathan Jones on the masterpieces that are missing in action</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421646342|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|956e2ffec571b519ee0b54df17dde425b5f99873 -->",

        "body":"<p>A shower of fine gold dust floats in the air below the <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/haywood/1.html\">Holborn Viaduct</a> in the City of London, swirling around the outstretched claws of dragons and through curling fronds of cast-iron foliage. It's coming from the camel-hair brush of Peter Bowers, master gilder at <a href=\"http://www.hare-humphreys.co.uk/\">Hare &amp; Humphreys</a>, who is busy dabbing at a flower-shaped moulding at the top of the 150-year-old structure – unveiled this week after a £2m refurbishment.</p><p>Bowers has been gilding for more than 20 years, working on everything from palaces in Oman to London's St Pancras station. In the autumn sun, flecks of golden dandruff glimmer on his shoulders and scraps of gilt sparkle across his chin, giving the impression he might actually be shedding gold himself.</p><p>\"I get some funny looks on the train,\" he says, explaining how his facial sparkle results not from a penchant for glitter makeup, but from dabbing the brush against his face to gain static, and a bit of grease, to pick up the gold leaf. He offers me a turn, handing over the squirrel-hair gilders tip – a wide, thin brush used to apply the leaf, before the camel-hair mop is used to stipple it in place – and a thin sheet of gold on a small square of paper.</p><p>The leaf is only 0.5 microns thick, 200 times thinner than a human hair. Before I get near my target, it catches the wind and folds up on itself like a disobedient sheet of cling-film. Dabbing it over the cast-iron petals, already prepared with a quick-drying size adhesive, half of it seems to want to take flight and float away on the breeze. Bowers and his colleagues aren't called master gilders for nothing.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421684645'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383604282206/flowers_andrewBuckingham.gif' alt='Master gilder … Peter Bowers at work.

Photograph: Andrew Buckingham</figcaption></figure><p>Over the past few months they have used over 25,000 sheets of gold leaf (equating to around 350 grams of gold) to bring this triumph of Victorian engineering back to its former glory. Freshly gilded, the scales of the City dragons and the wings of the knight's helmet gleam with startling brightness – to the extent that, on a recent visit, the site manager thought his workers had left a spotlight on during the day.</p><p>\"We wanted maximum bling,\" says City conservation officer Paul Robertshaw, explaining how the bridge has been through a number of paint jobs in its life – 14 according to <a href=\"http://patrickbaty.co.uk/2012/02/01/holborn-viaduct/\">paintwork analysis</a> – in varying levels of gaudiness. \"When it was opened in 1869, it was painted with a riot of green and red and brown and gold, but this didn't last long – it was considered too much even for Victorian tastes.\"</p><p>WB Yeats recounted William Morris's violent reaction to the eyeful of coloured mouldings when he met him on the bridge, soon after the opening: \"[Morris] began to praise it with the words, 'This is my kind of poetry', and promised to write about it, and would have said I do not know how much more,\" writes Yeats, \"if he had not suddenly caught sight of one of those decorated lamp posts, and waving his umbrella at the post, raged at the Corporation.\"</p><p>Today, passers-by stop and stare, not to rage, but to remark on how lustrous the viaduct is looking, its details newly exposed after the entire bridge was shot-blasted to remove years of encrusted paint. \"People have been stopping in their tracks asking how it can be quite so shiny,\" says Hare &amp; Humphreys' project manager, Chris Britain. \"They're so used to seeing just gold paint, rather than the real thing.\"</p><p>His team was also responsible for <a href=\"http://www.hare-humphreys.co.uk/projects/the-monument-to-the-great-fire-london\">re-gilding the flaming orb</a> at the top of the Monument to the Great Fire of London in 2008. Glaring in 24-carat lustre, it looks like it could put the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/06/walkie-talkie-architect-predicted-reflection-sun-rays\">Walkie-Scorchie's</a> singeing powers to shame.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421684646'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383604810251/monument.gif' alt='Flaming orb … the top of the Monument to the Great Fire of London.

There is the chubby little <a href=\"http://hidden-london.com/the-guide/golden-boy-of-pye-corner/\">Golden Boy of Pye Corner</a>, blushing in shame at the point where the Great Fire stopped. \"The fire was ascribed to the sin of gluttony,\" reads the accompanying sign, \"and the boy was made prodigiously fat to enforce the moral.\"</p><p>There is the <a href=\"http://hidden-london.com/nuggets/ariel-at-tivoli-corner/\">leaping Ariel</a> atop the Bank of England, carrying gilt-edged credit and trust around the world, and <a href=\"http://www.artofthestate.co.uk/london_photos/statue_of_justice.htm\">Lady Justice</a> on top of the Old Bailey, stalwartly holding her golden sword and scales in outstretched arms for the last hundred years. There is the <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Golden_Ball_and_Cross_on_Dome_of_St_Paul's_Cathedral,_London_EC2_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1089422.jpg\">vast golden cross</a> on the dome of St Paul's, presiding over countless other church spire finials, including <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Dragon_atop_St_Mary-le-Bow_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1304674.jpg\">St Mary-le-Bow's fearsome dragon</a> in full flight. Behind closed doors there are untold orgies of gilding, from the inner chambers of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/london/content/image_galleries/mansion_house_gallery.shtml?1\">Mansion House</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.guildhall.cityoflondon.gov.uk/\">Guildhall</a>, and as you might expect, the interior of <a href=\"http://londonhistorians.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dsc05211c.jpg\">Goldsmiths Hall</a> looks like the glitzy lair of Midas himself.</p><p>But since the Victorian frenzy of gilded glamour, there has been little use of gold leaf on our buildings. Instead, there has been an alarming fad for gold-coloured cladding, which more often than not ends up looking like the building has been dipped in a vat of metallic mustard. From Rafael Viñoly's <a href=\"http://www.firstsite.uk.net/page/rafael-vinoly-firstsite-architect\">Firstsite</a> in Colchester to the scaly hulk of the <a href=\"http://egretwest.com/projects/homes/the-fold-sidcup/\">Fold apartment block</a> in Sidcup, by Egret West, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tecu_consulting_uk/sets/72157625206054650/detail/\">TECU Gold</a> and its imitators have a lot to answer for.</p><p>More recently, younger practices have been showing there might be renewed hope for the gilder's tip yet, beyond the rarefied realms of conservation. East London office <a href=\"http://www.studioweave.com/\">Studio Weave</a> added an extra decorative dimension to their <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2012/07/27/paleys-upon-pilers-by-studio-weave/\">Paleys Upon Pilers</a> folly in Aldgate, by screen-printing a patterned layer of adhesive on to the timber columns and gilding them by hand.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421684647'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383604918309/studioweave.gif' alt='Chaucerian gilt … preparing decorative columns for Studio Weave's Paleys Upon Pilers folly.

The practice has since used gold leaf on its <a href=\"http://www.theaoc.co.uk/docs/royal_armouries/royal_armouries_2.html\">renovation of the Royal Armouries</a> in Leeds, decorating the concrete walls with a heraldic pattern – which, at £477, proved cheaper than just covering them with paint.</p><p>\"That's the beauty of gold leaf,\" says Britain. \"It can be the most cost-effective solution, as its lifespan outlasts even the most durable paint – the Monument gilding will last for 50 years or more.\" So next time architects have pretensions of designing for Auric Goldfinger, let's hope they ditch the gold-effect cladding and opt for the real thing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421654648|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|25a553723a045f7e60dd8a6fbaf378937d784387 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"<a href=\"http://www.anderspetersen.se/\" title=\"\">Anders Petersen</a> showed me that photography is a way of life in itself,\" <a href=\"http://www.auesobol.dk/\" title=\"\">Jacob Aue Sobol</a> once told me. \"Just the way he immerses himself in the subject. You look at his pictures and you feel that he <em>had</em> to make them. For him, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/may/28/art3\" title=\"\">photography is an obsession as well as an art form</a>.\"</p><p>Now the two Scandinavian photographers have created a book together. It is called <a href=\"http://www.dewilewispublishing.com/GENERAL/NEW&amp;RECENT.html\" title=\"\">Veins</a> and is a work of two distinct halves: a selection of Petersen's work culled from his extensive archive, followed by newer work by Sobol. But had the images been mixed, it would have been hard to identify which photograph was taken by whom. Both favour grainy tones, raw subject matter and high-contrast black and white. A close-up photograph of a couple embracing by Petersen is echoed later by another couple staring into each other's eyes: both capture the blemishes and shadows of the human face with an unforgiving eye. Petersen is drawn to doubles: bleach blonde twins in short skirts; two almost identical sisters in matching tiaras and white lace. Sobol often captures a pair of bodies in graphic closeup, drawing the viewer's eye to hair, skin and scars. Both are drawn to the relentless traces of age and encroaching mortality. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421642005'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/4/1383568943703/Untitled-by-Anders-Peters-001.jpg' alt='Untitled by Anders Petersen' width='460' height='700' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Untitled by Anders Petersen. Photograph: Anders Petersen</figcaption></figure><p>Though Petersen is from Sweden and Sobol from Denmark, they share a definable Nordic sensibility – what Petersen once called a \"poetical sadness\". That sensibility can be traced back to the work of the late <a href=\"http://www.stromholm.com/\" title=\"\">Christer Stromholm</a>, whose pioneering Fotoskolan (Photoschool) Petersen attended in 1966.</p><p>Over 30 years later, in 1998, a young Sobol enrolled at the Danish School of Photography, where Stromholm was the guiding spirit and Petersen the most well-known teacher. You can draw a line of direct influence from Stromholm's seminal photobook <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/02/amies-place-blanche-christer-stromholm-review\" title=\"\">Les Amies de Place Blanche</a>, about a transvestite community in Pigalle, through <a href=\"http://www.photoeye.com/bookstore/citation.cfm?catalog=SM248\" title=\"\">Petersen's dark classic Cafe Lehmitz</a>, set among the demi-monde of Hamburg's red-light district Reeperbahn, to Sobel's startling first book, <a href=\"http://www.auesobol.dk/work/index.php?Sabine?image=0\" title=\"\">Sabine, about his intense relationship with a young Inuit girl in eastern Greenland</a>.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421642006'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/4/1383569261814/Untitled-by-Jacob-Aue-Sob-001.jpg' alt='Untitled by Jacob Aue Sobol' width='460' height='700' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Untitled by Jacob Aue Sobol.  Photograph: Jacob Aue Sobol/Magnum</figcaption></figure><p> Like Stromholm before him, Petersen has become a guiding spirit for a younger generation of Scandinavian photographers. Veins, as the title suggests, is often overt in its bid to get under the skin of its marginalised subjects – to the point where the casual viewer may find it voyeuristic. Both photographers seem drawn to seediness, and there is nudity, blood and human strangeness aplenty here, but also tender moments of quiet intimacy.</p><p>It is difficult to single out individual photographs, as there is a cumulative power to both series. But as Petersen ages, one senses a creeping tenderness in his work, best illustrated by some beautiful snatched portraits: a naked woman peering over a window ledge is echoed by another of a woman walking though some shutters clutching a towel or sheet. In each scene, their nudity, seen from behind, is almost incidental to the mystery of the moment. One wonders how Petersen gains access to these private scenarios.</p><p>Sobol also includes a beautifully grainy shot of an arched female back as well as a striking portrait of a woman, her long hair falling over her breasts and her eyes and lips as dark as sin. But, elsewhere, his pitiless gaze is drawn to wrinkled skin and jutting bones – the creases, folds and scars of age and experience.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421642007'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/11/4/1383568886703/Untitled-by-Jacob-Aue-Sob-001.jpg' alt='Untitled by Jacob Aue Sobol ' width='460' height='700' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Untitled by Jacob Aue Sobol.  Photograph: Jacob Aue Sobol </figcaption></figure><p>Both like grimy places, and both are drawn to the extremes of beauty and decay, darkness and light. If both Petersen and Sobol are relentless in their depiction of the raw and gritty, I nevertheless kept thinking, as I flicked though Veins, of Leonard Cohen's song, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ma5tF6TJpA\" title=\"\">Anthem</a>, and specifically the lines: \"There is a crack in everything/That's how the light gets in.\" As Veins shows, a strange beauty is illuminated as a result.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421618621|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|2c65494621b54043e859dd1e9c4f5538c33529d6 -->",

If anything, the recognition of it increases.  </p><p>VE (Victory in Europe) Day happened on 8 May 1945. Sixty-eight years on, some of the military defences that lined the coasts of northern Europe – Allied countries' last line of defence from German attacks – still stand.</p><p>Photographer Marc Wilson has spent the past three years photographing these structures at 110 locations in Britain, the Channel Islands, France, Denmark and Norway. He's travelled over 11,000 miles in the process.</p><p>Each structure is as poignant and emblematic as the next, it is surely only a matter of time before they are afforded protected heritage status. One of Wilson's subjects at Wissant, Nord Pas de Calais in France has been dismantled by the French government since he took the photograph. Why? </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421503825'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/31/1383236544574/Wissant-I-by-Marc-Wilson-009.jpg' alt='Wissant I by Marc Wilson' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Wissant I</figcaption></figure><p>These are heritage pieces, war archaeology. The second world war happened as long ago now as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War\">Franco-Prussian war</a> happened before it. But its legacy will remain longer than any other war. And the ruined structure in Wissant only vindicates Wilson's efforts, showing photography's vitality in record keeping. </p><p>This visual documentation of second world war relics shows them not as anachronisms but still extremely modern. The war brought giant technological leaps forward in many fields, including design and architecture. There was license for engineering experiments with sometimes spectacular results. </p><p>Wilson's shot of a dalek-like object, looking down into a milky grey sea at <a href=\"http://marcwilson.co.uk/the-last-stand/#PHOTO_3\">Studland Bay</a> in Dorset, is as alien to its isolated landscape as a Dr Who baddie in a Tesco Express. Yet somehow, it belongs – as though it's become glued and frozen to the stone like a stalagmite, as though it has adapted to its seaside environment.</p><p>The pictures ache for a bygone era, all too aware that they may be the portrayal of death throes for these remnants of the past. Like the rusted tin man in Oz, like gatekeepers of invisible time machines, like silent sentinels, they keep watch. </p><p>It looks cold in these pictures, windy and drizzly. Just as it was when troops stormed the beaches at Normandy. </p><p>Showing them like this, Wilson can only be displaying pride: a humble, stoic, artistic representation of the war effort. A celebration not only of the scope of sacrifice and danger but a depiction of the forlorn beauty of the physical and geographical borders that soldiers, brought by boats and planes, wished to penetrate. These are wildernesses we rarely visit, rugged coastlines inhabited by terns, gulls, seals and crabs, monuments only fishermen see in the half-light of dawn. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421503827'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/28/1382984737484/Second-world-war-defences-009.jpg' alt='Second world war defences in Findhorn, Moray, Scotland by Marc Wilson ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Findhorn, Scotland</figcaption></figure><p>Some photographs, like 2011's Findhorn, Moray, Scotland and <a href=\"http://marcwilson.co.uk/the-last-stand/#PHOTO_16\">Hayling Island, Hampshire</a> from 2013 are abstract, concrete and brutalist yet softly captured, lolling in brine.

It will become another icon, so you'll have two icons sat side by side. What could be better than that?\"</p><p>It was announced last week that Gehry will be joining Norman Foster in the next phase of the £8bn Malaysian-backed plan to transform south London's derelict cathedral of power into a gleaming wonder-world of 3,500 flats, shops and offices. Gehry will be responsible for five apartment buildings including a centrepiece, named the Flower, which, says Tincknell, \"will give Frank the opportunity to flex his design muscles as far as they go\".</p><p>The developer is speaking in rapturous tones of awe and wonder, like someone who has just bagged the biggest real estate prize imaginable. Not the Grade II* listed brick behemoth, but the promise that a Gehry building will one day materialise next door.</p><p>\"His style of architecture is completely unique,\" he continues. \"You can't miss it. Other architects might design buildings of different styles, and do it differently each time, but Frank's buildings are a continuous interpretation of his idea of fluidness. It's just fantastic.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421458170'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/31/1383241271121/Gehry-009.jpg' alt='Gehry' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Guggenheim museum in Bilbao. Photograph: Wolfgang Thieme/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>It is not an unusual reaction for someone who has just bagged a Gehry. The 84-year-old Canadian architect has garnered a reputation as the supreme magician of iconic forms, the go-to guy for a dose of wow-factor, bringing with him the promise of headlines, tourists and minor economic miracles. The billowing metallic flanks of his <a href=\"http://www.guggenheim.org/bilbao\" title=\"\">Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao</a>, completed in 1997, have been credited with reviving the fortunes of this ailing post-industrial town, to the extent the building spawned its own term – \"the Bilbao effect\" – and ushered in a light-headed era of copycat projects initiated by countless other towns in the pursuit of icon-led regeneration.</p><p>Since the success of Bilbao, Gehry has become a global brand. He is the king of the crumple, whose tangled concoctions of swooping metal and teetering glass now dot landscapes the world over. There is the 76-storey skyscraper in Manhattan – simply branded <a href=\"http://www.newyorkbygehry.com/\" title=\"\">\"New York by Gehry\"</a> – which hangs like a sheer silk scarf, rippling in the wind. There are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_and_Maria_Stata_Center\" title=\"\">tumbling university buildings in Massachusetts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/gehrycin/vontz.html\" title=\"\">Cincinnati</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.empmuseum.org/about-emp/the-emp-building.aspx\" title=\"\">museum shaped like a giant smashed guitar in Seattle</a>, and a <a href=\"http://www.pragueexperience.com/places.asp?PlaceID=651\" title=\"\">dancing apartment block in Prague </a>. On the desert peninsula of Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi, work is under way on what will one day be <a href=\"http://www.guggenheim.org/abu-dhabi\" title=\"\">the mother of all Guggenheims</a>, a 30,000 square metre museum complex formed from a jumble of clustered cones and tilting towers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421458171'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/31/1383241626044/Gehry-001.jpg' alt='Gehry' width='460' height='578' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nove Mesto (the New Town) in Prague. Photograph: Ren  Mattes/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>\"He now comes packaged as 'Gehry', with quotes on,\" says critic Charles Jencks, a close friend who has known him since he started out in 1970s Los Angeles. \"Like all the best artists, he has become part of the establishment, but he began on the outside, kicking against the fence. He's like the Woody Allen of architecture: he loves railing against the world and doesn't want to be liked by anybody – but at the same time he wants to be loved and accepted by everybody.\"</p><p>The Allen comparison almost extends to the level of fame he now enjoys. In a world of competing \"starchitects\", whose celebrity reputations often outshine their buildings, none come more starry than Gehry. His website carries a note that autograph requests can regrettably not be accommodated owing to the volume received.</p><p>He has <a href=\"http://www.downvids.net/frank-gehry-as-featured-in-the-simpsons-298248.htm\" title=\"\">appeared on an episode of the Simpsons</a>, designing Springfield opera house in the shape of a scrunched-up envelope; he has <a href=\"http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2009/12/04/frank_gehry_designs_hat_for_lady_gaga.php\" title=\"\">made a hat for Lady Gaga</a>, looking like a laundry bag savaged by a rottweiler; Mark Zuckerberg has asked him to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-24/facebook-gehry-build-idea-factory-for-ripstik-geeks.html\" title=\"\">design the new Facebook mega-campus</a>, and to top it all, Brad Pitt has become the architect's unlikely apprentice.</p><p>Taking Pitt under his wing, generously indulging his fantasies of being the actor-architect, Gehry has worked with him on various projects, from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/may/27/urbandesign.arts\" title=\"\">doomed development for Hove</a>, which would have resulted in the East Sussex waterfront being desecrated with four 120-metre towers shaped like crumpled Victorian dresses, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/16/entertainment/la-et-cm-brad-pitts-new-orleans-project-unveils-frank-gehry-house-20120715\" title=\"\">to a low-cost house in post-hurricane New Orleans</a>, completed last year.</p><p>\"I've got a few men I respect very much and one would be Frank Gehry,\" Pitt told Vanity Fair. \"He said to me, 'If you know where it's going, it's not worth doing.' That's become like a mantra for me.\"</p><p>Gehry has become a spiritual guide for more than just Hollywood stars, finding his influence reaching the highest corridors of power. In<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/hillary-clinton-sets-vision-for-continued-us-dominance-87029.html\" title=\"\"> her final official speech last year</a>, former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton went as far as using his architecture as an elaborate metaphor for where the world should be going. \"We need a new architecture for this new world, more Frank Gehry than formal Greek,\" she said to the audience at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p><p>\"Some of his work at first might appear haphazard, but in fact, it's highly intentional and sophisticated. Where once a few strong columns could hold up the weight of the world, today we need a dynamic mix of materials and structures.\"</p><p>So how did this rumpled everyman, who dresses in T-shirts and baggy trousers to meet corporate chiefs, end up being courted by the global elite, from princes to politicians? How did his punk post-modernist style end up being co-opted as a platitude in a Democratic presidential bid?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421458167'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/31/1383240843734/Gehry-009.jpg' alt='Gehry' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'His maverick manifesto writ large ...' Gehry's house in Santa Monica, California. Photograph: Kenneth Johansson/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>The beginning of the answer can be found on the corner of a residential street in Santa Monica, California, where Gehry <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/67321/gehry-residence-frank-gehry\" title=\"\">built his first project in 1978</a> – a house for himself, which appears to engulf and eviscerate the carcass of a modest beige bungalow. Wrapping the existing building with a grungy cocktail of corrugated metal sheeting, raw plywood and chain-link fencing, through which angular glazed structures burst open, it was his maverick manifesto writ large. And it offended the neighbours to such an extent that one regularly brought his dog to defecate on the garden path.</p><p>The building burst on to the scene at a time when dull mirror-glass modernism was in vogue, standing out against California's conservative architectural culture of anonymous corporate blocks. Gehry's gritty street-style bricolage of cheap industrial materials was a refreshing antidote, riffing off LA's ersatz pop culture with energetic wit. His house attracted swarms of young architects and critics, and came to serve as his laboratory and showroom, coming to stand as the primal site of his myth-making. As critic Beatriz Colomina has said, it is \"the House that Built Gehry\".</p><p>\"He developed an incredible skill at making very sophisticated work with cheap materials,\" says Jencks, who recalls how he would do \"the kind of B-movie jobs, like malls and parking lots, that no other architect would touch.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421458168'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/31/1383240932959/Gehry-009.jpg' alt='Gehry' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Gehry's Golden fish in Barcelona's Olympic Harbour.

It has even spawned an entire separate branch of the office, <a href=\"http://www.gehrytechnologies.com/\" title=\"\">now formalised as Gehry Technologies</a>.

Costing two and a half times the original budget, Gehry's <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/441358/\" title=\"\">Walt Disney concert hall</a> in downtown Los Angeles, launched in 1987 and finally completed in 2003, was subject to more than 10,000 requests for information from contractor to architect, resulting in a legal dispute that ended in a costly settlement.</p><p>And the problems didn't stop there. When it was finished, neighbours discovered that the building's concave polished steel surfaces had the effect of focusing the sun's rays into their apartments, leading to skyrocketing air-conditioning bills and the danger of blinding passing drivers.</p><p>Returning to manual methods, Gehry's office had to sand down the offending panels to eliminate the glare.</p><p>Having done battle with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/06/walkie-talkie-architect-predicted-reflection-sun-rays\" title=\"\">Walkie-Scorchie \"fryscraper\"</a> by Rafael Viñoly – who, somewhat ominously, is also responsible for the Battersea power station masterplan – at least London should be ready for whatever Gehry decides to throw at it.</p><h2>Potted profile</h2><p><strong>Born: </strong>Frank Owen Goldberg in 1929 in Toronto, Canada, to Polish Jews. He moved to California in 1947 and, after a stint as a lorry driver, studied architecture at the University of Southern California, then city planning at Harvard – which he left before completing, disillusioned. He set up his practice in LA in 1962, and has been married twice, with two children from each marriage.</p><p><strong>Best of times: </strong>Vanity Fair declared him \"the most important architect of our age\" in 2010.</p><p><strong>Worst of times: </strong>His proposal for the $112m Dwight D Eisenhower memorial in Washington, DC, has been severely criticised by the president's son, John Eisenhower, and his granddaughter, Susan Eisenhower, who says her entire family opposes it.</p><p><strong>He says:</strong> \"In the 80s, everyone was redoing the past, rebuilding Greek temples. I said, y'know, Greek temples are anthropomorphic. And three hundred million years before man was fish. If you gotta go back … why are you stopping at the Greeks? So I started drawing fish in my sketchbook, and then I started to realize that there was something in it.\"</p><p><strong>They say:</strong> \"[Gehry's buildings] became not only more extravagant but also more detached: they became signs of 'artistic expression' that could be dropped, indifferently, almost anywhere … The great irony is that Gehry fans tend to confuse his arbitrariness with freedom, and his self-indulgence with expression.\" Hal Foster, London Review of Books, 2001<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421396189|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|2e40e0b8f5e09bc760616512e4b18de1b1a0c3a8 -->",

        "headline":"Wanksy: celebrating Britain's worst graffiti art",
        "body":"<p>If there's one thing more pretentious than graffiti art – <a href=\"http://www.banksyny.com/\" title=\"\">the throwaway turned into the priceless</a> – it's books about graffiti art. They treat so-so street art as if it were by <a href=\"http://arthistoryfacts.com/ManWithABlueSleeveByTitian.jpg\" title=\"\">Titian</a> and aim for the coffee tables of the middle class with their colour spreads of <a href=\"http://www.shokhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/banksy-dreams_00349040.jpg\" title=\"\">Banksy masterpieces</a>.</p><p>I can't, therefore, resist noting an alternative art book that deserves a spot on your Christmas wish list. It is called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wanksy-Interpreting-Graffiti-James-Harris/dp/1849534748\" title=\"\">Wanksy: Interpreting a Graffiti Virtuoso</a>.</p><p>The authors, Marc Blakewill and James Harris, have gone around photographing street art – except it ain't art. They have sought out some of the basest, most moronic everyday graffiti and reproduced it in full-page colour pictures with texts that analyse it in a deadpan fashion. Having written about Banksy three times in a month, I get the joke.</p><p>For instance, some fool has scrawled MILLWALL in blue paint over a (\"proper\" graffiti artist's?) white stencil of a deer, and enhanced its anatomy. The authors lyrically comment: \"Millwall; a white deer; a dangling blue penis. As enigmatic as the quatrains of Nostradamus, as mystifying as hieroglyphics, one could gaze at this in awe for hours.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421297083'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383137779611/Wanksy-009.jpg' alt='Wanksy' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>So bad it's bad … the future classic work You're Having a Giraffe. Photograph: Marc Blakewill and James Harris</figcaption></figure><p>Gazing at the words \"PAUL N RICH\" painted on a window so it can only be read properly from the inside, they get even more carried away: \"Wanksy's most famous work using transparent perspective. Two men gaze out into the world and see themselves as the headline acts of their own lives. Paul and Rich. Meanwhile, the rest of the world looks in and thinks, 'Eh, what's that? Oh, those dickheads have forgotten to write backwards.' Clearly, we see ourselves differently from the way others do.\"</p><p>To collect the works of Wanksy, these discerning critics have visited bus shelters and derelict sites all over Britain. Their photographs gather some of the nation's worst efforts at graffiti. Their cutting parody of the habit of art critics to talk total bollocks praises these nasty daubs as if they were by <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Rembrandt_van_Rijn_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/790px-Rembrandt_van_Rijn_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\" title=\"\">Rembrandt</a>.</p><p>Someone has written on a pavement: JOE HAS A BIG KNOB Our intrepid art critics explain: \"This is a complex and ambiguous piece. On first impression, it appears to be a simple boast by someone called Joe: 'I've got a big one!' Yet it is clearly more subtle and manipulative. How will men see these words? Only by stopping and looking past their own manhood. A smug Joe thus imagines men with their heads hanging downwards, contemplating the meagreness of their own members compared to his.\"</p><p>They offer similarly profound insights into such masterpieces of street art as: \"Harry was here fucking ur mum\" \"Ryan does Anal\" And the immortal street sign: \"Strictly No Admittance UP THE BUM.\" Wanksy is a well-aimed satire on the pretensions of people who elevate street art as the philosophy of the age. But it's not as good a joke as the career of Banksy himself, whose <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/nyregion/monthlong-chase-around-new-york-city-for-banksys-street-art.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">work is revered, priced and discussed in ways that will give later generations a good laugh at us all</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421284303|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|13fd31fa93f89154bace7b556d62e629eee4b4ad -->",
