The ECB has just eased policy even further, while the Fed, for all its procrastinating, is still more than likely to scale back its asset purchases before too long. Furthermore, President Draghi added that rates could go even lower and that the ECB was “technically ready” to cut its deposit rate into negative territory.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we do not expect the strength of peripheral euro-zone government bonds to last just because the ECB has become more accommodative. A small cut to the refi rate will not transform the economic outlook and will not address the deep-seated problems of the peripheral countries such as their high debt burdens.</p> <p>Indeed, credit spreads on euro-zone peripheral government bonds have fallen all the way back to the sort of levels seen on comparably-rated assets outside the euro-zone. There would therefore appear to be a significant risk of a renewed rise in them over time if and when investors’ concerns about these problems reappear.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <h2>Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>1) One has to always doff one's hat to Draghi for his ability to &quot;blag a blagger&quot;, in rather<br />stark (sic) contrast to his predecessors, and the conservative Bundesbank type grouping<br />on the council.</p> <p>2) The timing for a rate cut is/was always key, and so the decision to &quot;go now&quot; rather<br />than roll out the red carpet for December made good sense.... but that unfortunately<br />is where the compliments stop.</p> <p>3) So to the rationale: the ECB is now expecting a &quot;sustained period of low inflation&quot;,<br />but sees &quot;no risk of deflation&quot; - really? a) Does the ECB has any control over such<br />a fine dividing line, given that Eurozone CPI is 0.7% y/y? b) One might even ask whether<br />the ECB is wondering into the BoE's bad forecasting territory? and c) What happened to that<br />recent suggestion that a very low level of inflation was in fact good for (hard pressed)<br />Eurozone (above all Club Med) consumers?</p> <p>4) While he could say nothing else other than that he &quot;believes rate cut is effective&quot;<br />to then follow it up with &quot;some would say reduction in excess liquidity is due to less<br />fragmentation&quot; and, that the rate cut &quot;reduces fragmentation in the periphery&quot;<br />is pushing on a gossamer thin bit of string, the more so when he continued later<br />with this particular bit of bravado: &quot;fundamentals in the Eurozone are probably<br />strongest in the world&quot;, while saying that the recovery is &quot;proceeding, but is weak<br />and fragile&quot;. Which epithet of these would be best to deploy: a) paradox,<br />b) oxymoron or c) bipolar?</p> <p>5) What will this do for growth in the Eurozone economy, employment, indeed bank<br />lending - not a lot. The fact is that by cutting the income of savers, and in fact discouraging<br />bank lending by keeping long-term rates at very depressed levels, as well as tying to<br />persuade businesses and consumers that they actually do not need act now to &quot;lock in&quot;<br />super low rates, the ECB, Fed and BoE may in fact be depressing the economy, while<br />exponentially fuelling asset bubbles and widening economic and social gaps.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Mike Ingram of BGC Partners:</h2> <p><strong>Cut and Run at the ECB</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What a shocker. The market had assumed, at most, a one in ten chance of the European Central Bank (ECB) cutting rates today and yet they did just that. The ECB refinancing rate was halved to 0.25%. For today at least, European stock and bonds were euphoric and the overly strong Euro has taken a beating. Mission accomplished Mr Draghi.</p> <p>In actuality, a rate cut has only been a question of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’ for some time now. Euro zone inflation is collapsing while output gaps are large and with feeble growth, set to be persistent. Moreover credit conditions are still tightening, albeit at a slower pace and little progress has been made in bringing down lending rates in Europe’s beleaguered periphery. To top it all, the Euro has been strong – defying the consensus call of a strong dollar. Taken together, I wasn’t kidding when I recently suggested that large swathes of the Euro zone are becoming eerily reminiscent of 1990’s Japan.</p> <p>And yet most of us have been wrong-footed today. (I included, I thought the Bank would wait for more data before cutting in December). In defence I can only say that even as the economic case for a rate cut became compelling, Team Draghi seem infuriatingly relaxed about the need to ease policy further. Now they have belatedly leapt into action.</p> <p>So for many reasons, I approached the recently concluded ECB press conference with more than a little curiosity. And while it was another polished performance from Super Mario, I wasn’t greatly comforted by what I heard either. I am now left feeling that while the ECB may no longer be horribly behind the curve, there is little chance they are ahead of it and it is only a matter of time before they are playing catch up again.</p> <p>It could have been worse of course; a late cut is better than none at all. One on the big positives was that, despite cutting rates to an all-time low, we learned that the ECB ‘continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or&nbsp;<em>lower levels</em>&nbsp;for an extended period of time’. It could easily have signalled that rates at 0.25% were an effective floor, but it didn’t. Moreover, it emerged in the Q&amp;A that such forward guidance was unanimous.&nbsp;The ECB feels it still has a few rate cards left to play.</p> <p>But this seemingly definitive statement of central bank activism sits uneasily with much else that the ECB had to say this afternoon. For instance, the Euro zone inflation outlook was once again described as ‘broadly balanced’. It clearly hasn’t been in the past and given significant deflationary headwinds, I suspect this remains a mistaken prognosis.</p> <p>Of more practical concern to most of us is that the ECB’s take on the nascent Euro zone economic recovery also seems threadbare. Having shifted the supposed growth drivers from exports and investment early in the year, to consumption and investment in the summer (as emerging markets swooned and PMIs picked up), it is now apparently all down to consumption. Presumably this belatedly recognises that businesses in the Euro zone remain loathe to invest. Hardly a surprise given ample spare capacity and in many cases continued credit rationing. They are more likely to bolster profits by squeezing employees. If so, sayonara consumption too!</p> <p>Perhaps the most disturbing part of the ECB’s performance today however, was a seemingly off the cuff remark that Mario Draghi made on the long-term outlook for the Euro zone economy. The Euro zone, he said, ‘had some of the best fundamentals in the world’. (I actually laughed out loud at that point). Mario then proceeded to reel off this secret recipe for economic success: low budget deficits and current account surpluses.</p> <p>I’m sure Angela Merkel must have been overjoyed, but it strikes me that if the main thrust of economic policy is that the rest of Europe deflates against an already competitive Germany, then the outlook for Europe is grim indeed. At that point the ECB’s hand may be looking quite poor – if the market doesn’t call their bluff first.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So after spending a good part of the last 18 months stating that Europe would be experiencing uplift in economic fortunes right about now Mr Draghi has had to cut rates today. I found it an unconvincing and contradictory performance in the press conference and found it especially interesting that Mr Draghi basically ignored two questions on QE.</p> <p>The big question is what can the ECB do next if the worrying recent trends with regard to loan demand and inflation do not reverse. Mr Draghi stated that he had a whole range of instruments left to deal with any deteriorating situation, but the ones he mentioned were very much interest rate options. Cheap money has not yet produced any uptick in loan demand in Europe and it is difficult to see why this should change whether he alters the benchmark rate, the deposit rate or whatever. Banks continue to be in deleveraging mode and companies are not confident enough of the immediate economic outlook to invest.</p> <p>Thus if the ECB rate cuts do not stimulate loan growth or reverse falling prices then what do they do next? I think the first port of call would be to try and encourage banks to lend by offering a much longer term LTRO. Something in the region of a 7 or 10 year. After that comes QE. Yes I know there are potential legal challenges to such a move but I do believe Mr Draghi when he says he will do whatever it takes and don’t forget that at the ECB press conference of 2nd&nbsp;August 2012 (just after Spanish 2 years hit 7% and he gave his ‘Whatever it takes’ speech) he said that ‘…the Governing Council may undertake may consider undertaking further non-standard monetary policy measures…’ and then in the Q and A section discussing what became the OMT he said that ‘Regarding sterilisation, you should not assume that we are not going to sterilise or that we will sterilise – you have to understand these operations&nbsp;<em>(the setting up of the OMT)</em>&nbsp;are complex and they affect markets in a variety of ways. So the relevant committees will have to work and tell us exactly what is right and what is not, so it is too early to say whether they are going to be sterilised or not sterilised…’</p> <p>So even though it didn’t happen then, QE was on the agenda, which makes me think it could well be on the agenda again if the ECB believes that deflation could be about to take hold.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if that isn't enough...there's even more reaction <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/11/07/1689602/ecb-rate-cut-the-analyst-reaction/\"><strong>on FT Alphaville</strong></a>:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FTAlphaville/statuses/398504766420287488\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB rate cut: the analyst reaction <a href=\"http://t.co/aAShhPd16n\">http://t.co/aAShhPd16n</a></p>— FT Alphaville (@FTAlphaville) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTAlphaville/statuses/398504766420287488\">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527bcce6e4b0541f62c72c16\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T17:25:11.037Z\">5.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Another photo from Greece tonight:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MakisSinodinos/statuses/398498975851876352\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Αρκετός κοσμος παραμένει εξω απο την <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ert&amp;src=hash\">#ert</a>.

The rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%.</p> <p>These decisions are in line with our forward guidance of July 2013, given the latest indications of further diminishing underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term, starting from currently low annual inflation rates of below 1%.</p> <p>In keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Such a constellation suggests that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on.</p> <p>Accordingly, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. It will thereby also continue to assist the gradual economic recovery as reflected in confidence indicators up to October.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527ba570e4b0f1cce82090d2\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T14:40:13.209Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Mario Draghi's declaration that the eurozone has the best economic fundamentals in the world may come back to haunt him, ECB-watchers suggest:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/statuses/398456937496330241\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Draghi will be trolled for a very long time for his overblown &quot;eurozone has the best fundamentals in the world&quot; quote.</p>— Yannis Koutsomitis (@YanniKouts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/statuses/398456937496330241\">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/statuses/398456879091027968\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Draghi trots out Trichet’s old canard about eurozone having some of strongest economic fundamentals in world.

The ECB’s mandate is for a Eurozone consumer price inflation rate of “close to but just below 2.0%”, and at just 0.7% in October the inflation rate is no longer at a level that can be seen as consistent with the ECB;s target rate.</p> <p>&nbsp;Furthermore, the ECB’s forward guidance that has been in place since July stated that&nbsp;“the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.”&nbsp;If the ECB had not reacted to Eurozone consumer price inflation dropping to just 0.7% in October by cutting interest rates, it could have led the markets to questioning how meaningful the ECB’s forward guidance was.</p> <p>&nbsp;While the drop in Eurozone consumer price inflation to just 0.7 in October was obviously the trigger for the ECB’s interest rate cut, the strength of the euro and only gradual Eurozone economic recovery from extended recession also supported the case for lower interest rates.</p> <p>&nbsp;The fact that the ECB chose to act now rather than wait until December when the Governing Council will have the ECB staff’s new Eurozone GDP and consumer price inflation forecasts suggests that the bank felt there was a compelling case for prompt action.</p> <p>The fact that the ECB chose to leave its deposit rate unchanged at 0.0% despite bringing the refinancing rate down from 0.50% to 0.25% reinforces our belief that the ECB is reluctant to go down the negative deposit rate route. However, this could still happen if there is not a marked pick up in bank lending to companies and the ECB struggles to develop recovery.</p> <p>While it seems unlikely that an interest rate cut to 0.25% would have a major impact in boosting Eurozone growth, it may at least help keep the euro at a more competitive level and limit market interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCGavinHewitt/statuses/398434071225073664\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB has taken plunge and lowered interest rate to 0.25%.

High unemployment in the region also another likely contributor to today’s rate cut – markets are now eyeing Draghi’s press conference for further insight into the decision. The tone of the conference is likely to be dovish with Draghi justifying the move which has knocked the euro currency sharply lower against rivals.</p> <p>A big question for the market is how effective is this rate cut really? Conditions in the euro zone are likely to see a meaningful change after this rate cut – it seems more of a demonstration by the ECB to move away from liquidity pumping measures to measures which will ensure sustainable growth feeding into the real economy. The move therefore could be more symbolic of the ECB’s evolving strategy to stimulate the euro zone economy. Earlier, the BOE kept policies unchanged, as expected – muted response in markets. Eyes are now firmly on Draghi for more</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chrisadamsmkts/statuses/398436462334853120\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB rate cut shows it has nothing left to fight austerity-induced deflation.

However, as the pace of economic growth strengthens, it is becoming clear that the first rise in official interest rates is likely to occur well before the Committee’s 2016 prediction, due to the earlier than anticipated fall in unemployment. The MPC must use next week’s Inflation Report to move towards a more realistic timetable for its forward guidance, to maintain business confidence and keep its credibility.</p> <p>The Committee must continue to combine forward guidance with a firm commitment to bringing down inflation.&nbsp;Additional QE must not be contemplated in current circumstances.&nbsp;The MPC must&nbsp;also&nbsp;place more emphasis on measures that will improve the flow of finance to SMEs and growing businesses.

Let's start with the fall in CPI [<em>consumer prices index</em>] and the apparent risk of deflation: first of all the fall in CPI is primarily a confluence of falling food prices, primarily predicated by a reversal of the long winter and flood related rise earlier in the year (check out CPI for Bavaria, which was among the worst hit by the floods) and Energy prices, dictated in part by the EUR and in part by shifting demand dynamics, it could therefore easily be argued to be transient.</p> <p>For those pointing to the low level of core CPI, it should be noted that one of the larger components in the Services CPI sub-index that has been weighing down on core CPI is Air Travel, which is heavily influenced by energy prices.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <h2>Jane Foley of Rabobank:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>EUR/USD pushed higher yesterday afternoon as ‘sources’ reported that the ECB would avoid cutting interest rates today even amid the dip in inflation. The decision, of course, was not made yesterday and will be debated by committee during the course of this morning.&nbsp;</p> <p>That said we do not expect that the ECB will announce a cut in rates today. In our view inflation is close to its trough and we would expect the ECB to wait for next week’s GDP data and the fresh staff projections due in December before considering such a step. We do, however, anticipate that President Draghi is likely to emphasis the dovish tone of the ECB by ‘disclosing’ that a cut was weighed up. After all, the market is expecting a dovish tone from the ECB, so if this is not forthcoming there would be an increased chance that EUR/USD would be chased higher and this could increase the disinflationary pressure that the ECB will want to avoid.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Jonathan Pryor, Investec Corporate Treasury:</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All eyes will be focused on whether the ECB will cut the refinancing rate to a record low of 0.25%.</p> <p>Although this is not the consensus view there are still many analysts who see a rate cut as being a distinct possibility. With Eurozone inflation having fallen to 0.7% in Oct, unemployment at record highs and the strong exchange rate a concern, there is an argument for Mr Draghi to ease the pressure, with the supply of credit to the periphery still anaemic.</p> <p>His main dilemma remains whether a rate cut will make any real difference with bank to bank lending rates already near zero. Even if rates were to be kept on hold, there is still a strong chance that markets will remain volatile as the accompanying ECB press conference will be scrutinized for further clues on how the ECB are thinking with regards interest rate or other accommodative policy measures.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you'd like even more, check out <a href=\"http://t.co/AROCXCusFh\"><strong>this post on the Wall Street Journal:</strong></a></p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T10:30:00.901Z\">at 10.30am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-527b65b7e4b0f1cce82090a0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T10:04:46.040Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/statuses/398386332969340928\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Latest CitiFX Poll shows that 15.6% believe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ECB&amp;src=hash\">#ECB</a> will cut today, while a very honest 42.8% admit to not having a clue <a href=\"http://t.co/0fY85DWVq9\">pic.twitter.com/0fY85DWVq9</a></p>— Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/statuses/398386332969340928\">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527b61a0e4b0e869ab0fb87b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T10:01:37.388Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish industrial production turns positive</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>There are new signs of recovery in Spain for the European Central Bank to ponder at today's meeting.</strong></p> <p>Seasonally-adjusted Spanish&nbsp;industrial output rose in September for the first time in 30 months, bolstering hopes that it is pulling out of recession.</p> <p>Calendar-adjusted output rose by 1.4% year-on-year in September, much better than the 2.1% contraction reported in August.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ine.es/en/daco/daco42/daco422/ipi0913_en.pdf\"><strong>Spain's statistics body reported</strong></a> that production of capital goods (expensive machinery and the like) was&nbsp;8.4% higher than a year ago.</p> <p>Nicolas Lopez, analyst at Madrid broker M&amp;G Valores, said the data was encouraging:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the indicators point to a turnaround, and that we're entering in to growth.

And I suspect the atmosphere will be quite different in London than in Frankfurt.</p> <p>The ECB must decide whether to cut rates, or ease monetary conditions in some other way, in response to signs that the euro economy is de-inflating as the recovery loses momentum.</p> <p>Few economists actually expect a cut to the headline borrowing rate at 12.45pm GMT today (<em>although it's certainly possible</em>), but the subsequent press conference with Mario Draghi (1.30pm GMT) will be closely watched.</p> <p>He&nbsp;may set the scene for a rate cut in December, for example. Another option would be to impose 'negative interest rates' on the eurozone banks, to encourage them to lend more.</p> <p><strong>The pressure is on the ECB after core consumer price inflation unexpectedly fell last week, and unemployment hit a new record high. This prompted much concern that the eurozone is slipping into a Japan-style slump.</strong></p> <p>Although there's only so much that even the president of the ECB can do to fix the euro area's troubles:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kitjuckes/statuses/398342215539654656\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Armed with a peashooter, faced with a deflationary tank, Mario ponders whether to blow hard, hurl his toy, or put his head in the sand...</p>— kit juckes (@kitjuckes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitjuckes/statuses/398342215539654656\">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>At Threadneedle Street, though, the Bank of England will have the luxury of looking at an economy that appears to be on the up.</p> <p>Governor Mark Carney's forward guidance that interest rate probably won't rise until 2016 is looking increasingly unconvincing, with economic surveys beating forecasts and house prices climbing.</p> <p><strong>The Bank of England is very unlikely to change rates, or boost its stimulus programme,at noon GMT -- but one can never rule out a surprise statement.</strong></p> <p>It's also a big day for company results, both in the UK:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/truemagic68/statuses/398314255088623616\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>UK results today - INMARSAT, WINCANTON, HALFORDS, C&amp;W COMM, SUPERGROUP, REED ELSEVIER, WM MORRISON, INVENSYS, TATE &amp; LYLE, RANDGOLD</p>— David Buik (@truemagic68) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/truemagic68/statuses/398314255088623616\">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>And across Europe:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SquawkBoxEurope/statuses/398315243593400320\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Big earnings day in Europe.

        "body":"<p>America's economy grew at a faster-than-expected 2.8% annual rate in the third quarter of 2013, raising the prospect that the Federal Reserve could start to phase out its recession-busting quantitative easing programme before Ben Bernanke bows out in January.</p><p>Wall Street analysts had expected the world's largest economy to slow between July and September from the 2.5% pace recorded in the second quarter.</p><p>But <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm\" title=\"\">in a keenly awaited statement</a> – delayed by the government shutdown in October – the Department of Commerce said the pace of the US recovery had picked up.</p><p>The health of the economy has been closely scrutinised by investors eager to gauge how soon the Fed will decide to \"taper\" the $85bn (£52bn) a month bond-buying programme it has been using to try to kickstart growth.</p><p>Bernanke, the Fed chairman, sparked a bout of chaos in world markets that became known as the \"taper tantrum\" earlier this year, after he suggested starting to withdraw the Fed's unprecedented programme of economic stimulus over the coming months.</p><p>Experts have warned that this early estimate of GDP may be more tentative than usual, because the government shutdown may have hampered efforts to collect data. The BEA said that the acceleration in growth was broadly based, with consumer spending, stockbuilding by firms, state and local government spending, and property investment, all making a positive contribution.</p><p>Thursday's data, which cover the third quarter of the year, do not yet reflect any damage inflicted on the US economy by the 16 day government shutdown that saw hundreds of thousands of public sector workers down tools in October as politicians on Capitol Hill wrangled over budget cuts.</p><p>Another crucial indicator of the state of the US economy will come on Friday, with the delayed monthly jobs report. Bernanke has made unemployment the key indicator of when the Fed will choose to act, promising to leave interest rates on hold at least until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5% — provided inflation remains under control. The Fed's Open Market Committee will hold two more meetings before Bernanke bows out at the end of January, when he is expected to be replaced by Janet Yellen, if she can win over sceptical Senators at forthcoming confirmation hearings.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421920182|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|f4c2f022c3dcf1e147a388647f293e7e7e6a8a55 -->",

        "body":"<p>All credit to Mario Draghi. The European Central Bank caught the financial markets totally unawares <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/07/ecb-eurozone-interest-rates-cut\" title=\"\">when it cut its key interest rate to 0.25%</a> and there was an instant response. The euro - perilously overvalued on the foreign exchanges - fell like a stone.</p><p>Draghi clearly had to overcome resistance from the ECB council, with some members seeking to delay any easing of policy to a later date. This would have been a mistake. The latest figures show the euro area flirting dangerously with deflation, with prices rising at an annual rate of just 0.7%. Try as he might to dispel the idea, the euro area today is starting to look worryingly like Japan in the early 1990s. Credit flows have dried up, a double dip recession has left oodles of spare capacity, and there is plenty of deflationary pressure coming down the pipeline, from the falling cost of food to lower prices for manufactured goods.</p><p>Deflation is already a reality for the troubled countries on the fringes of monetary union, with the real and present danger of the core following before too long. So Draghi was quite right to face down the Bundesbank and insist on immediate action.</p><p>The fall in the value of the euro will - if sustained - help avert the threat of deflation by increasing the cost of imports. Draghi, therefore, missed a trick when he said the value of the single currency had not been discussed at the ECB's council meeting. This was the opportunity to talk down the euro, getting the maximum out of the cut in borrowing costs.</p><p>The ECB president also invited derision by saying that the eurozone (unemployment 12.2%, trend rate of growth 1% at best, a broken banking system) had the best economic fundamentals in the world. In truth, deflation threatens to trigger a new phase of the eurozone crisis, because falling prices plus weak growth equals unsustainable debt. The ECB's action is a recognition that it has fallen way behind the curve in dealing with this threat. Further steps will be needed.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421949830|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|ad0ad817d9bd1e537e39a8dc491f068dc0d1b828 -->",

        "headline":"ECB surprises markets by cutting eurozone interest rates to 0.25%",
        "body":"<p>Borrowers across the struggling eurozone economies received an unexpected fillip on Thursday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/07/markets-await-ecb-interest-rate-decision-business-live\" title=\"\">when the European Central Bank cut interest rates to a fresh record low</a>, in a bid to stave off a slide into deflation.</p><p>After its monthly policy meeting in Frankfurt, the ECB's governing council announced that it would reduce its key refinancing rate to 0.25%, from 0.5%.</p><p>While the economy of the 18-member single currency area clambered out of recession earlier this year, Mario Draghi, the ECB's president, warned that the outlook could deteriorate in the coming months.</p><p>\"The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside,\" he said. \"Developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include higher commodity prices, weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth, and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries.\"</p><p>As well as the rate cut, which took financial markets by surprise, Draghi said the ECB would continue making low-cost loans to eurozone banks until at least mid-2015, to try to prevent the financial sector from seizing up.</p><p>Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"The fact that the ECB chose to act now rather than wait until December when the governing council will have the ECB staff's new eurozone GDP and consumer price inflation forecasts suggests that the bank felt there was a compelling case for prompt action.\"</p><p>With inflation running well below the ECB's 2% target, at just 0.7% in October, a growing number of analysts have started to warn that deflation – which can be disastrous for economies carrying a heavy debt burden, as prices and wages fall while debt-levels remain fixed – is a real threat. Draghi suggested at his press conference that, \"we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation\".</p><p>The recent strength of the euro against the dollar has also raised fears in some member-countries about the competitiveness of the zone's exports on world markets. The euro was down by more than 1% against most major currencies after Thursday's announcement, hitting a seven-week low of $1.3375 against the dollar.Italian prime minister Enrico Letta, speaking on a visit to Dublin, described the ECB's decision as \"great news\", adding that, \"it shows the ECB cares about growth and competitiveness in Europe\". The International Monetary Fund also welcomed the move. \"The decision is fully warranted by the weak inflation dynamics and substantial slack in the economy,\" said spokesman Gerry Rice.</p><p>The muted strength of the economic recovery in many eurozone countries is likely to have been another factor influencing the ECB's decision: earlier this week,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/eurozone-unemployment-stuck-2015-european-commission\" title=\"\"> the European commission revised down its expectation for growth across the 18 member-countries to just 1.1% in 2014</a>. Nevertheless, Draghi insisted at his Frankfurt press conference that the \"fundamentals\" of the eurozone are, \"probably the strongest in the world\".</p><p>However, some analysts warned that the rate cut should be no substitute for the urgent reforms the eurozone needs to secure recovery and tackle the legacy of unmanageable government debts. \"It's a palliative: a legal high,\" said Danny Gabay, of City consultancy Fathom. \"They need to get on with the really important stuff: fiscal union, banking reform, debt mutualisation.\"</p><p>The ECB's move is unlikely to prove popular in Germany, where the Bundesbank – whose president, Jens Weidmann, sits on the ECB's governing council – has tended to take a hawkish stance, opposing some of the ECB's recession-busting measures. Draghi admitted that Thursday's decision had not been unanimous, saying the governing council was, \"wholly in agreement about the need to act, but there were disagreements about when to act\". The suprise rate cut was the fifth since Draghi took over from the more orthodox Jean-Claude Trichet in 2011.</p><p>The decision followed an earlier announcement from the Bank of England that it will leave its own interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, and the total value of assets held under QE at £375bn.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421914003|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|29d635179858510d5f4fea6c78d24d6bc2f754f8 -->",

His summary:</p> <blockquote> <p>The US created more than 200,000 fresh jobs in October as the world’s biggest economy shrugged off the impact of the government shutdown.</p> <p>In news that immediately prompted speculation about a winding down of America’s growth stimulus, the Bureau of Labour Statistics published figures showing a much better employment outlook than had been expected.</p> <p>Wall Street had been prepared for an increase of 120,000 in non-farm payrolls last month amid speculation that the temporary layoffs of federal employees would offset job creation in the private sector.</p> <p>The BLS also revised up its estimates of jobs growth in the previous two months – from 193,000 to 238,000 in August, and from 148,000 to 163,000 in September.</p> <p>Early indications were of a sharp sell off in US shares due to concerns that the increase in payrolls will bring forward the timing of the tapering away of the $85bn (&pound;53bn) a month stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve’s bond buying programme.</p> <p>The US central bank deferred a decision on tapering in September, but is likely to discuss a scaling back of so-called quantitative easing when it meets next month.</p> <p>Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, said: “The data supports some views out there that the Fed will taper its quantative easing programme in December. However, the impact of the government shutdown in October reduces the reliability of the number, so we hold the view that the Fed will taper in March as opposed to December, once the Fed has seen more proof of improving labour market conditions.”</p> <p>The BLS said almost half the increase in jobs came from two sectors – a 53,000 increase in the leisure and hospitality sector, and a 44,000 rise in retail employment. Despite the increase in payrolls, the unemployment rate edged up from 7.2% to 7.3%. The employment rate dropped by 0.4 percentage points to 62.8%.</p> <p>James Knightley, at ING bank, said: “The numbers are much stronger than anyone expected – the highest forecast in the market was 175,000 for payrolls – and suggest the government shutdown had a negligible impact on the labour market. However, this goes against anecdotal evidence suggesting that with government contracts not being paid, and the general level of economic uncertainty it created, this led to firms pulling back on hiring.”</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527cf009e4b0541f62c72cbf\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-08T14:10:10.273Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">December taper?</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at the Capital Economics thinktank </strong>says the strong US payrolls number for last month point to the US Federal Reservce starting to scale back its bond-buying stimulus programme in December.</p> <p>He has just sent through this analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Together with the news yesterday of a stronger 2.8% gain in third-quarter GDP growth, the Fed now has the data to justify making its first reduction at December's FOMC meeting, but whether it will or not is still unclear. Frankly, given all the flip-flopping, it's hard to know exactly what evidence would satisfy the majority of Fed officials. </p> <p>... Overall, once again the US economy appears to be overcoming a summer swoon.

Sentiment around the economic picture has been boosted by upward revisions to the number of jobs added in August and Sepember (60,000 more than previously estimated).</p> <p>But better economic sentiment means more market fretting over the Fed's huge stimulus programme being scaled back. Worries aroun so-called tapering coming sooner rather than later have seen US stock market futures fall sharply.</p> <p>Some reactions to the data:</p> <p>Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The data will add to the view that the Fed is gearing towards a tapering of its asset purchases, but policymakers will most likely wait for clearer signs that the economy is capable of growing at a faster rate than seen in recent months, hoping to see a pace of economic growth that will eat into unemployment.</p> <p>An additional bonus was an upward revision to Septembers increase, while August’s total was also revised higher, leading to an extra 60K jobs in those months.</p> <p>The unemployment rate nevertheless ticked higher to 7..3%, up from 7.2% in September, highlighting how the sluggish current pace of economic growth is failing to create enough new jobs to bring down the jobless total.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/statuses/398811182556934144\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>This was a strong MONTHLY number.

A somewhat higher growth rate, of about 1.75%, is projected for 2014 as its trading partners also begin to recover.</p> <p>The 2014 budget targets a primary balance and an overall deficit of 4.8% of GDP, which is more ambitious than the deficit ceiling of 5.1% of GDP set under the excessive deficit procedure. To reach these goals, Ireland’s record of strong budget implementation needs to continue. Realising the proposed savings in health expenditure while protecting core services will require particular attention.</p> </blockquote> <p>Full statement <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2013/html/pr131108_1.en.html\">here.</a></p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fe8a1282-8b34-4ad9-ac1e-148bcef5da7e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/8/1383913009107/46fa8f1c-23f2-4c09-ac6b-385726438e48-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A discount store in the Moore Street area of Dublin.

With total exports edging up just 0.1% month-on-month in September and falling by 2.2% overall in the third quarter, it is evident that the economy is currently far from seeing a hoped-for rebalancing with a greater contribution from exports.</p> <p>Meanwhile, construction output unexpectedly fell by 0.9% month-on-month in September. While not too much should be read into one month’s performance given the well-known volatility in construction output and it followed a strong overall increase in August/July, it nevertheless meant that construction output expanded by 1.7% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter rather than by 2.5% quarter-on-quarter as had been estimated in the preliminary national accounts. In itself, this would mean that GDP growth in the third quarter would be shaved down by 0.05 percentage point given that construction output accounts for 6.3% of total output.</p> <p>Despite September’s fall in output, it should be noted that construction output has still seen decent quarter-on-quarter growth for two successive quarters (it rose by 1.9% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter) while latest survey evidence is strong. It therefore seems that the sector is building a decent recovery. </p> <p>Housebuilding activity is seeing particular strength which is welcome news given concerns that a shortage of properties risks contributing to a new housing market bubble. Even so, there needs to be sustained, major growth in housebuilding activity if the housing shortage problem is to be properly addressed.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527cb5b8e4b03445394401d2\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-08T10:08:25.374Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Airline group IAG benefits from Iberia recovery</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, has been struggling to restructure its Spanish business, amid labour disputes and the defection of customers to budget rivals.</strong></p> <p>But things might be starting to pay off.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This decision confirms what most analysts outside the French Government think. As S&amp;P put it this morning “we believe that the French government’s reforms (…) will not substantially raise France’s medium-term growth prospects”. GDP growth should not exceed 1% next year which in our view should lead the gross debt to GDP ratio to the brink of 100% by 2015 unless further efforts to cut the size of public spending (at 57% of GDP it is the largest in Europe).&nbsp;</p> <p>This comes as another wake-up call to the French Government so that the competitiveness problem can be addressed more quickly: reforms have been done and are slowly bringing results but they are no reason not to go further. This morning, the financing cost already rose for the French Government from 2.15% to almost 2.4%.</p> <p>This level is of course far from alarming, but at a time of required cost savings, it should push the [prime minister] Jean-Marc Ayrault's government into further efforts to turn the situation around.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527cac7be4b055987af6757e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-08T09:19:23.927Z\">9.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here's a chart of French industrial production, courtesy of Markit chief economist Chris Williamson:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/statuses/398731282307248128\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>French industrial production &amp; manufacturing output charted. prod'n -1.4% in latest 3 months, manu output -1.1% <a href=\"http://t.co/fzimI1himd\">pic.twitter.com/fzimI1himd</a></p>— Chris Williamson (@WilliamsonChris) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/statuses/398731282307248128\">November 8, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527caa42e4b055987af6757b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-08T09:09:48.361Z\">9.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Phillip Inman, our economics correspondent says <strong>analysts are less excited by France's downgrade than Mario Draghi's attempt to kickstart growth with yesterday's 0.25 percentage point rate cut</strong>.</p> <p>He points to comments by&nbsp;Philippe Waechter, head of economic research at Natixis Asset Management, who said in a note that the downgrade was less a panic cut in France's creditworthiness and more a shot across the bows for not implementing reforms needed to repair its economy.</p> <p>He said: &quot;I don't think there will be a dramatic impact on French debt in the short term, because S&amp;P is not expressing alarm and the outlook is stable.&quot;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527ca114e4b055987af67578\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-08T09:06:08.886Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Legoland owner Merlin builds up 13% gain on market debut</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Still with flotations, in the UK Merlin Entertainments has made a strong start to life as a public company.</p> <p>The owner of Tussauds and Legoland priced its shares at 315p each and they soared to 355p as conditional dealings began before dipping to 349p.

Analysts are expecting<strong> around 120,000 jobs to be created, compared to 148,000 in September. </strong>The unemployment rate is forecast to rise from 7.2% to 7.3%. The US Federal Reserve has said it may begin cutting back on its $85bn a month bond buying programme once the rate reaches 7%. Thursday's stronger than expected US GDP figures suggested tapering might begin sooner than expected, pushing Wall Street down by nearly 1%. But if the jobless rate does edge up, the mood could change again.</p> <p><strong>Back in the eurozone comes news that Standard and Poor's has cut its credit rating on France from AA+ to AA, citing concerns about unemployment.</strong></p> <p>All three major ratings agencies recently stripped France of its AAA rating, but S&amp;P is the first to cut the rating again, another blow to President Francois Hollande's attempts to the the eurozone's second largest economy back on track.

        "body":"<p>The US created more than 200,000 new jobs in October as the economy shrugged off impact of the federal government shutdown.</p> <p>In news that immediately prompted speculation about a winding down of&nbsp;America&rsquo;s growth stimulus, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published&nbsp;figures showing a much better employment outlook than had been&nbsp;expected.</p> <p>Wall Street had been prepared for an increase of 120,000 in non-farm&nbsp;payrolls last month amid speculation that the temporary lay offs of&nbsp;federal employees would offset job creation in the private sector. In the end, the BLS said the economy added 204,000 new jobs.</p> <p>Despite the increase in payrolls, the&nbsp;unemployment rate edged up from 7.2% to 7.3%, largely as a result of the temporary furloughs. The employment rate&nbsp;dropped by 0.4 percentage points to 62.8%.</p> <p>The BLS also revised up its estimates of jobs growth in the previous&nbsp;two months &ndash; from 193,000 to 238,000 in August, and from 148,000 to&nbsp;163,000 in September.</p> <p>Early indications were of a sharp sell off in US shares due to&nbsp;concerns that the increase in payrolls will bring forward the timing&nbsp;of the tapering of the $85bn (&pound;53bn) a month stimulus provided by&nbsp;the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s bond-buying programme.</p> <p>The US central bank deferred a decision on tapering in September, but&nbsp;is likely to discuss a scaling back of so-called quantitative easing&nbsp;when it meets next month.</p> <p>Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, said: &ldquo;The data&nbsp;supports some views out there that the Fed will taper its quantative&nbsp;easing programme in December. However, the impact of the government&nbsp;shutdown in October reduces the reliability of the number, so we hold&nbsp;the view that the Fed will taper in March as opposed to December, once&nbsp;the Fed has seen more proof of improving labour market conditions.&rdquo;</p> <p>The BLS said almost half the increase in jobs came from two sectors &ndash; a 53,000 increase in the leisure and hospitality sector, and a 44,000&nbsp;rise in retail employment.&nbsp;</p> <p>James Knightley, at ING bank, said: &ldquo;The numbers are much stronger&nbsp;than anyone expected &ndash; the highest forecast in the market was 175,000&nbsp;for payrolls &ndash; and suggest the government shutdown had a negligible&nbsp;impact on the labour market. However, this goes against anecdotal&nbsp;evidence suggesting that with government contracts not being paid, and&nbsp;the general level of economic uncertainty it created, this led to&nbsp;firms pulling back on hiring.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422013945|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|5de2961ed7f29237ae0f10f30cd369b0cd957f10 -->",
