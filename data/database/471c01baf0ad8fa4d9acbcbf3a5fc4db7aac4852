        "body":"<p>Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, is a \"good guy\", a \"good-hearted kid\" who offers the best tequila to his guests on his private island, according to the former basketball player Dennis Rodman.</p><p>Rodman talked about his friendship with the North Korean leader in London to promote a basketball game between a Rodman-selected team and a North Korean team to coincide with Kim's 31st birthday on 8 January.</p><p>\"They need money. I'm not doing it for the money. I'm doing it to open a gap between North Korea and the world. And North Korea has a lot to offer. They want to branch out,\" Rodman told the Times.</p><p>\"I'm not saying that the marshal of North Korea is in control. It's the system that's been built for years and years and years. And this young kid is trying to do one thing – to open that gap. To do something to make it work.\"</p><p>The former Chicago Bulls player described his trip to Kim's private island. \"It's like Hawaii or Ibiza, but he's the only one that lives there.</p><p>\"Fifty or 60 people around him all the time – just normal people, drinking cocktails and laughing the whole time. Everything he has is the best.\"</p><p>Rodman would not criticise Kim and emphasised that North Korea was only as bad as Japan, China or Hong Kong.\"I don't care what the fuck he does over there, what he does over there, what he does over here – between me and him we're friends. I don't care,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421506167|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|96db811f9e5d7e9676077bab0413240c1c55ff51 -->",

        "headline":"No more practice for A.I.: Allen Iverson says goodbye to Philadelphia",
        "body":"<p>Allen Iverson’s effective retirement from professional basketball preceded Wednesday’s formal announcement at the Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia by nearly three years. His final appearance in an NBA game had been in February 2010, with a brief, aborted stint with Turkish club Beşiktaş ending later that year. Over the past 34 months, one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history - who desperately wanted another shot at the game that elevated him from a background of poverty and violence to superstardom - had quietly waited for a call that never came. Many casual fans, even in Philly, presumed he'd retired years ago.</p> <p>Yet Iverson, now 38, was unable to walk away from basketball the way he played and lived throughout a Hall of Fame career: on his own terms. His was the atrophic, glacially paced exit of the faded, unwanted fighter, complete with the rumblings of financial insolvency and <a href=\"http://rochesterlancers.com/news.php?id=63\">humiliating sideshow offers</a>. The 6-foot (in sneakers, maybe), 160-pound guard from Hampton, Virginia, did not retire so much as exhaust his options. Everyone wanted a piece of him until they didn’t.</p> <p>His mother Ann, a courtside staple at Sixers games for years, momentarily took the podium minutes before Wednesday’s press conference got under way. “I just want everyone to know this is a joke and everyone can go home now,” she quipped. After the awkward uncertainty of the past three years, would anyone have been surprised?</p> <p>When Iverson finally emerged from an arena tunnel on Wednesday afternoon, he looked as if he’d been crying. Seated alongside three of his children and longtime manager Gary Moore - before an audience that included Julius Erving and legendary Georgetown coach John Thompson - Iverson made the inevitable official.&nbsp;</p> <p>“I never imagined the day coming, but I knew it would come,” said Iverson, an 11-time All-Star who won four scoring titles and was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player in 2001. “I gave everything I had to basketball and the passion is still there, the desire to play is just not. I just feel good that I’m happy with the decision I’m making. It was a great ride.”</p> <p>If you’re even a casual observer of American sport, chances are you formed your opinion of Iverson long ago. From his uncertain role in a bowling alley brawl that made national headlines when he was 17, Iverson was a cultural lightning rod and seemingly always at the center of controversies both manufactured and devastatingly real. For every brave performance like his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM4551c-bCQ\">52-point outburst against Toronto</a> in the playoffs, there was a public-relations misstep like his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBrbMj0eyqM\">tone-deaf foray into commercial hip-hop</a>. The drama never ended.</p> <p>To fully grasp Iverson’s impact on Philadelphia as a sportsman, one must recall the state of the franchise when the 20-year-old, was chosen with the top overall pick in the NBA draft. From the 1990 through 1996 seasons, the Sixers had finished with 53, 44, 35, 26, 25, 24 and 18 wins, respectively - seven consecutive years of diminishing returns that remains an NBA record. His fearlessness was immediately obvious: Who can forget when he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3X274lz3wY\">crossed over Michael Jordan</a> as a rookie? His ascent prompted a rapid turnaround that peaked in 2001, when Philadelphia made it to the NBA Finals with a Game Seven win over the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference finals. The title-starved city drank up that victory like most cities fete championships. On Wednesday, Iverson called the on-court celebration with teammates and fans after that game his greatest moment as a Sixer.</p> <p>Philadelphia's opponent in that year’s NBA Finals were the Los Angeles Lakers, who entered the championship series on a 19-game win streak. Yet Iverson <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euoRpQ6NT94\">poured in 48 points</a> in the opening game - punctuated by the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grXws5m11SA\">iconic baseline dagger and ensuing high-step</a> over a fallen Tyronn Lue - to carry the Sixers to a stunning upset. The Lakers, naturally, went on to win the next four games and the title, but Game One remains the signature Philadelphia sports moment for a generation - and no doubt the cathartic peak of the Iverson era - not least because it so completely embodied the workmanlike ethic of this blue-collar burg.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGDBR2L5kzI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> <figcaption>Iverson's most famous press conference</figcaption> </figure> <p>Iverson’s press conferences had always been compelling theater. He disarmed even his critics with an easy delivery of <em>bon mots</em> in his gravelly baritone rasp. He could make you pause and think. Wednesday’s farewell was no exception. The entire session lasted 55 minutes and somehow felt inadequate. The highlights, predictably, were many:</p> <p>On his cultural significance:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“I took an ass-kicking for me being me in my career, for me looking the way I looked and dressing the way I dressed. My whole thing was just being me. Now you look around the NBA and all of them have tattoos, guys wearing cornrows. You used to think the suspect was the guy with the cornrows, now you see the police officers with the cornrows.”</p> </blockquote> <p>On Phil Jasner, a longtime Philadelphia Daily News beat writer (and occasional Iverson sparring partner), who succumbed to stomach cancer in 2010:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“I wish Phil Jasner could be here today, especially on a day like this. Rest in peace, I know he’s looking down on this whole event. Thinking about the times that we laughed with each other and thinking about the times we fought with each other. But he was very inspirational in my career and he meant a lot to me.”</p> </blockquote> <p>On the teammates who helped him the most throughout his career, as he fought (unsuccessfully) through tears:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Aaron McKie. Aaron McKie. Aaron McKie. Aaron McKie. Aaron McKie. … I made a million mistakes in my career, but if it wasn’t for him, it would have been two million.”</p> </blockquote> <p>On the intense media scrutiny throughout his career:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“In this profession you have no idea how hard it is to live up to all the expectations, to try to be a perfect man when you know you’re not. Being in a fishbowl, everybody looking at every move you make, talking about everything you do. It’s just a hard life to live. It’s a great one, I wouldn’t trade it for nothing. I have no regrets on anything. People ask me all the time, ‘Do I have any regrets?’ I don’t have any. If I could back and do it all over, would I change anything? No. Obviously if I could go back and change anything I would be a perfect man. And I know there’s no perfect man and there’s no perfect basketball player. So no, I wouldn’t change anything. My career was up and down at times. I made a lot of mistakes, a lot of things I’m not proud of. But it’s only for other people to learn from.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Several hours after Iverson’s farewell, the Sixers opened their season with a surprising 114-110 upset of the Miami Heat. LeBron James, the reigning two-time Most Valuable Player who&nbsp;<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/9827704/lebron-james-two-role-models-michael-jordan-allen-iverson\">recently called Iverson one of his two role models</a>&nbsp;along with Michael Jordan, finished with 25 points in the losing effort. Iverson, whom many expected would address the crowd, was shown on the Jumbotron between the first and second quarters to a thunderous ovation: a mild disappointment for the capacity crowd of 19,523. The Sixers announced an official retirement ceremony will take place on March 1, a shrewd deferral for a club widely projected to be among the worst - and worst-drawing - in the league.</p> <p>It’s probably not a coincidence that Philadelphia’s two most iconic athletes of the post-Y2K era never formally retired until years after their final games. Iverson and Donovan McNabb had very little in common besides uncommon self-belief and the denial it so often engenders.</p> <p>Yet Iverson leaves behind a legacy far more complex and divisive than the longtime Eagles quarterback. Even he seemed uncertain on Wednesday about how to frame it. One minute, he spoke of “no regrets,” a phrase he repeated multiple times. The next, he characterized himself as a cautionary tale. “Anybody that wants to be me or wants to be like me, I would tell them not to be like me,” he said. “To want to be better than me.”</p> <p>For all his flaws, Iverson shared a bond with the local fans like few athletes this sports-mad city has ever known. He was from Virginia but he <em>was</em> Philly: uncompromising, defiant, self-certain to a fault with a taste for the fight. “It’s home,” he said. “I’ve been a part of this community for so long. These fans, they grew on me just like I grew on them.”</p> <p>Unlike so many of the sanitized, image-obsessed athletes of his vintage, Iverson always said what he thought. Love him or hate him - and there's plenty in both camps after all this time - it's what made him an original.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“When I looked in the mirror, I wanted to be the same person that I was. I didn't leave out my house and then turn into somebody else. I wanted to be me, I wanted to be the same person that my kids knew. I didn't want to go home to Virginia and have my mom look at my me, like, ‘Who is this guy?’ I always felt like it was cool being me.”</p> </blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421345404|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|8cbaa201722800b5ddf13ce77fbd5fe8ee3ee702 -->",

Highlights included Dwight Howard's 17 points and a career-high-equaling 26 rebounds on debut as the <strong>Houston Rockets</strong> beat the <strong>Charlotte Bobcats</strong> 96-83; Tony Parker's 13 points and nine assists to help the <strong>San Antonio Spurs</strong> get off to a strong start after last season's disappointing loss in the NBA Finals with a 101-94 win over the <strong>Memphis Grizzlies</strong>; and the <strong>Minnesota Timberwolves</strong> beating the <strong>Orlando Magic</strong> 120-115, with Kevin Love scoring 31 points, taking 17 rebounds and hitting the game-leveling three-pointer with 10.2 seconds left to force overtime.</p><p>At Philadelphia, Spencer Hawes scored 24 points for the Sixers, who defied expectations to start their season. As the NBA season tipped off, the over-under out of Las Vegas for total wins for the 76ers this year is 16.5, the lowest of any team in the league. Against the two-time defending champion Heat, that didn't seem to be bothering anyone in Philly.</p><p>Miami guard Dwyane Wade sat out to rest his sore knees. Coach Erik Spoelstra says he wanted to give Wade an extra day to recover with the Heat playing on consecutive nights. Wade scored 13 points for the Heat in their 107-95 win over Chicago on Tuesday. James missed five of six shots in the fourth quarter, losing the ball on one drive down the middle, then blowing a six-footer on the next possession. Shane Battier missed all seven three-pointers in the game and the Heat missed 10 straight shots in the fourth after scoring a whopping 45 points in the third.</p><p>Carter-Williams, meanwhile, set an NBA record for a debut game with nine steals. \"I couldn't think of a better way to start your NBA career,\" James said of his rival.</p><p>Howard celebrated his arrival at Houston with a big game against Charlotte. He spurned the Lakers to sign an $88m deal with Houston, joining James Harden and a team that made the playoffs last season for the first time since 2009. The Rockets led by four points in the fourth quarter before using a 14-4 run to extend the lead to 86-72 with about 3½ minutes left. Harden tossed an alley-oop to Howard for a dunk during that span. The crowd roared as Howard pointed and smiled at his new teammate.</p><p>In other games, Anderson Varejao scored with 28 seconds left to send the <strong>Cleveland Cavaliers</strong> to a 98-94 win over the remodeled <strong>Brooklyn Nets</strong> in coach Mike Brown's first game back with the Cavaliers, the <strong>Toronto Raptors</strong> beat the <strong>Boston Celtics</strong> 93-87 and the <strong>New York Knicks</strong> blew a 25-point lead before holding off the <strong>Milwaukee Bucks</strong> 90-83, with Carmelo Anthony scoring 19 points and making 10 rebounds.</p><p>At Oakland, Klay Thompson scored a career-high 38 points as the <strong>Golden State Warriors</strong> whipped the <strong>Los Angeles Lakers</strong> 125-94 to open their season. Jodie Meeks scored 14 points and Pau Gasol had 12 points and seven rebounds for an overmatched Lakers team playing on back-to-back nights.</p><p>Kevin Durant scored 22 of his 42 points from the free throw line, including a pair with 6.4 seconds remaining, to lift the <strong>Oklahoma City Thunder</strong> to a 101-98 win over the <strong>Utah Jazz</strong> at Salt Lake City. The new-look <strong>Detroit Pistons</strong> opened with a 113-102 win over the <strong>Washington Wizards</strong>, the <strong>Indiana Pacers</strong> rallied to beat the <strong>New Orleans Pelicans</strong> 95-90 with George Hill capping a 19-point performance with a pivotal 3-pointer in the final minute, and the <strong>Dallas Mavericks</strong> spoiled Mike Budenholzer's <strong>Atlanta Hawks</strong> coaching debut with a 118-109 win. Monta Ellis started his Dallas career with 32 points and Dirk Nowitzki contributed 24.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421372313|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d421549189a54bbc6474c1ee2df3b1459a66cffb -->",

        "headline":"The forgotten story of ... Shane Heal v the Dream Team",
        "body":"<p>The Dream Team III enforcer Charles Barkley was clear from the outset. “We’re here to prove we are the best country in the world. We’re the best at basketball. We have got to kill them all.”</p> <p>Heading into Australia’s 1996 exhibition match against the reigning Olympic champions, peroxide-blond guard Shane ‘The Hammer’ Heal and his Boomers team-mates were excited but not daunted by the prospect of taking on the NBA’s best.</p> <p>“I think it was a defining sort of a moment,” Heal tells Guardian Australia 17 years after a fiery confrontation that remains the first thing basketball fans want to discuss when they meet the veteran of four Olympic campaigns.</p> <p>The Australians, a blue-collar line-up by international standards, approached the game with respect for their opponents but didn’t fear them. Heal recalls “we’d seen other teams getting photos taken with them and autographs before and after games and things like that. We said that wasn’t the Australian way and we certainly weren’t handling the game like that.”</p> <p>Heal would finish the Olympic tune-up with 28 points and shoot a remarkable 8-from-13 from three-point range, many of them a remarkable distance out from the line, but it was his confrontation with the notorious Barkley that captured the attention of the media and fans alike.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3OCJBVgGHM\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L3OCJBVgGHM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>Late in the first half and growing in confidence, Heal found himself open on the wing and released a shot for his fourth three-pointer of the game. Barkley arrived late, aggressively undercutting Heal and sending him sprawling to the floor in front of the Australian bench.</p> <p>“The thing with Barkley and I, it was just a dirty play. You just wouldn’t expect someone to make such a dirty play against someone that’s in the air, anywhere in the world,” says Heal. “He just took my legs out and I landed on my back. It was just a really dirty play … he just ran straight through my legs. You definitely don’t expect that and you don’t expect it from an NBA superstar.”</p> <p>Undaunted by the height and weight differential – his opponent stood six inches taller – Heal chased the American star back down the court, letting fly with a volley of verbal barbs, and bumped chests with Barkley. “When I got up and gave him a few choice words I remember him looking down and he said ‘What did you say?’ I didn’t know whether he couldn’t understand the accent or he couldn’t believe what I’d just called him.”</p> <p>The tough-talking Barkley would later conclude: “He’s a talkative little fellow. I told him that if I don’t take that off Americans I’m definitely not going to take it off foreigners.”</p> <p>Heal and his team-mates acknowledged they were playing against the world’s best but refused to back down from confrontation when necessary.<strong> “</strong>I guess the Australian way is that we weren’t going to kiss their arse – we were going there to test ourselves against the best. We weren’t going to treat them any differently than we did anybody else. We had respect for them but we certainly weren’t going to bow to them.”</p> <p>As stunned as the Aussies were by the physical nature of the clash, not even Heal expected the sight of Barkley mimicking a gunshot at him as the teams went to their huddle. <strong>“</strong>I was going from one end of the court to our bench and he was going from the other end to his bench and we ran into each other again and we grabbed each other by the singlets and he was a big man, mate, he was a very big man. I’m very lucky he didn’t hit me because I’d still be asleep today I reckon.” Not for the last time, the match officials had to intervene.</p> <p>Boomers captain Andrew Gaze <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com.au/olympic-games/andrew-gaze-recalls-moment-shane-heal-took-on-legendary-charles-barkley-cadel-evans-good-to-go/story-fn5k3iok-1226433840934\">recently remembered the clash</a>. “Shane, I think in the emotion of the situation and also just trying to make a statement to the rest of the group to say, ‘Hey, we don’t back down to anyone. I don’t care who you are or what your reputation is, we play it on its merits.’ You could almost see Charles [think] like, ‘What is this little peroxide-haired bloke doing?’”</p> <p>In turn, Heal recalls Gaze’s attempts to halt the bubbling animosity, “I remember Andrew trying to calm [the Dream Team] down and try and calm us down, he was like the international peacekeeper. I remember him being hurt by the fact that they were so angry, but we really didn’t take a backward step.” Asked if his treatment of Heal was a sign of respect, Barkley replied: “I try to treat people equal. I try to hit everybody, and in that way I’m very consistent.”</p> <p>“He was definitely consistent,” laughs Heal.</p> <p>All the while, Heal had been on the receiving end of a trash-talking masterclass from the Dream Team guard and future NBA hall-of-famer Gary Payton. <strong>&nbsp;“</strong>The amount of rubbish that I listened to from Gary Payton about what he was going to do to me after the game and all the rest of it, it was just laughable. No-one spoke as much as what he did, that’s for sure.”</p> <p>On a promotional tour of Australia later in the year, <a href=\"http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960908&amp;slug=2348050\">Payton would admit</a> that he was looking forward to squaring off against the NBA-bound guard and that he’d eat Heal for lunch, mockingly concluding: “It is wonderful for Australia that a short guy can make it to the NBA.”</p> <p>“We certainly didn’t expect that it was going to be as physical and that we were going to have to stand up for ourselves like we did either,” says Heal. “The fact that they could be frustrated by an Australian team coming over with no NBA players like that, it was a little bit embarrassing I would have thought if you’re an American.”</p> <p>The US media were decidedly unimpressed by the antics on display. Sports Illustrated <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/events/1996/olympics/daily/july23/barkley.html\">singled Barkley out</a>: “It’s hard to imagine an Olympic athlete who adheres less to the Olympic ideal than Barkley”. He was unflinching in <a href=\"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/501349/SIR-CHARLES-IS-SIR-KNUCKLEHEAD.html?pg=all\">his response</a>. “We’re going to defend ourselves. If the American press wants to make us the bad guys, so be it.”</p> <p>Though Heal wishes fans would remember the game for his three-point spree and not the fight, his analysis of his own performance is matter of fact. “That was my role on the Australian team. Andrew [Gaze] didn’t have a great one in that game so I needed to try and be able to put some more points on the board for us.”</p> <p><strong>“</strong>A lot of the time when you look back on games you didn’t realise you were [shooting from] that far out, especially when you’ve got momentum and adrenalin and everything. You just shoot.” Despite Heal’s game-best scoring performance, the Australians went down 118-77.</p> <p>At the conclusion, Barkley stopped and embraced Heal in a sign of respect for the Australian’s performance and chutzpah.“From that point on he was great,” recalls Heal. “During the battle he was a knucklehead but then you forget about it and you move on.”</p> <p>Still, Heal’s stoush with Barkley was a microcosm of a basketball nation standing up for itself. The sensation that surrounded the “Barkley game” possibly even obscures the underdog story of the Boomers’ incredible <a href=\"http://www.basketball-reference.com/olympics/teams/AUS/1996%29.\">fourth-place finish</a> in Atlanta. Heal still views that Olympic tournament as the sport’s peak in his homeland. “Australian basketball was probably, if you look back and pinpoint where the high was in Australian basketball, it was probably right then.”</p> <p>Having defeated the Toni Kukoc-led Croatian side in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbcrLRHmcAg\">thrilling quarter-final knockout game</a>, the Boomers progressed to an unlikely semi-final clash with the Americans. “We were so excited to get back in that locker room and we sang with so much gusto that it was like, it was just great to be an Aussie.“</p> <p>In the semi-final clash, Payton was straight back in Heal’s face. “He was still talking to me right from the start and we were playing off to go into the gold medal game and obviously it was a big thing then because there was so much build-up because of [what had happened] the last time we played. During that [time Payton signed] an $89m contract and I remember when he was talking trash I said to him, “mate, the first thing you need to do when you get your $89m is buy yourself a jump shot.” His eyes spun – I reckon he was then the angriest man that I’d ever played against. He wasn’t happy.”</p> <p>Sticking with the US for the early stages of the semi, the Australians went down 101-73 in a spirited display. Barkley noted his grudging respect for Heal in particular. “That little kid’s tough. I hope he comes to the NBA. He doesn’t have good common sense so he’ll fit right in with the [NBA guard] JR Riders.”</p> <p>“I think that from that Dream Team game we built belief and then we won big games and played our roles and just kept finding a way to be able to get through,” says Heal. “We knew they were going to throw everything at us and we were on the world stage and playing in front of 40,000 people or something.”</p> <p>Barkley concluded, “I don’t stroke people, but I think the Australians should be very proud. I really think they thought they could win. “</p> <p>Australia had made the voyage weakened by the absence of then-Chicago Bulls centre Luc Longley but succeeded largely due to strong tournaments from Gaze and Heal and a healthy dose of enthusiasm and team spirit. “I have the utmost respect for guys like Bradtke and Ronaldson and Vlahov that were playing against much bigger opponents,” recalls Heal.</p> <p>In the bronze medal play-off the Australians went close to upsetting a strong Lithuanian team containing NBA stars Arvydas Sabonis and Sarunas Marciulionis. Heal recalls those opponents in similar esteem to the Americans. “Sabonis in that game for the bronze medal, I can’t remember his exact stats but it was just unbelievable.“ The Lithuanians triumphed 80-74, sending the Boomers home without a medal but an enhanced standing in the international arena.</p> <p>Heal’s performance at Atlanta landed him a three-year NBA contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves. “I didn’t ever envisage playing in the NBA. Leading right up to that first game [in Atlanta] I didn’t have goals of playing in the NBA. No-one from Australia had gone to the NBA except Luc Longley and he was 7ft 2in.”</p> <p>Heal says he only has himself to blame for not playing in the NBA for longer. “I don’t have too many regrets but that’s one of them.” Injuries and the challenges of raising a family in the land of 10,000 lakes got the better of the Australian, who packed his bags for home after a single season.</p> <p>Along the way Heal found a mentor and friend in wily Wolves veteran Terry Porter, but the warmth of their relationship took some time to develop. “We didn’t get off on a good foot. I remember in the [NBA] pre-season he got off the bus and he said, ‘Rookie, you carry my bag.’ I said, ‘I’m not a rookie, mate, I’ve played for 10 years and I’m not fucking carrying your bag.’ Anyway, I left it in the car park and I just kept walking. I know he was fuming after that but we ended up becoming pretty close.”</p> <p>The Timberwolves stint also reunited Heal with his Olympic sparring partner Payton. “He was still speaking when I went to the NBA and it was amazing. I remember standing at the free throw line and he looked over at a team-mate and he’s like, ‘I’ve got him, he’s mine’. I was like, ‘mate, you’ve gotta let it go – I’m a scrub at the end of the bench and you’re a superstar.’</p> <p>“He didn’t stop talking trash to me until I hit the five threes in a quarter for Minnesota against Seattle. At the end of that game when I hit five threes he came up and sort of gave me a hug of respect and that was the only time he ever did that. “</p> <p>Barkley was even more effusive in his praise of Heal’s journey to the big-time, stopping the Australian on the way to the lift when they were due to square off in the NBA play-offs that season. “I was like ‘wow, that’s Charles Barkley.’ I was sitting down and having a chat and he was great.”</p> <p>After a long career that included a further NBA stint and seasons in Europe, it’s the memories of his four Olympic campaigns that Heal holds dearest. “I told my Dad when I was 12 that I was going to play for Australia. Going to an Olympics was all I ever dreamed of. I was in the backyard for hours and hours and I was counting down, making game-winners against America. That’s what I did.”</p> <p>Atlanta still looms large in the careers of Heal and team-mates such as Gaze, Andrew Vlahov and Mark Bradtke, who had risen through the Institute of Sport together and benefitted from a warm camaraderie. He calls Atlanta a<strong> &quot;</strong>pivotal moment”, adding: “for us to finish fourth and come within a basket of winning the only ever medal against Lithuania is something that I look back on and just think it was one of the biggest overachievements for a team in our history.</p> <p>“When I went to Europe, the Greeks used to be blown away and say: ‘How the hell can Australia be in the top four in the world?’ We only had local players, no-one played in Europe back in those days and only [Atlanta absentee] Luc Longley played in the NBA so we were certainly fighting out of our weight class.</p> <p>“I think the main reason was because of the camaraderie we had and passion we had for playing for Australia and what it meant. It gave us that opportunity to overachieve. To lose by a bucket against Lithuania with those unbelievable superstars on there, people are looking at the line-ups and going: ‘Wow, how did this happen? Who are these guys?’</p> <p>“I think we earned a lot of respect in that period in world basketball. “</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421254266|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|7873e4997a1f4c9382dc1c8786dd2de94c6eeb02 -->",

The game was close for three quarters until the Lakers went on a fourth quarter run, winning the final stanza 41-24</p> <p>Chris Bosh scored 16 points, Battier finished with 14 and Dwyane Wade and Mario Chalmers each scored 13 for the Heat, who got their 2013&nbsp;NBA&nbsp;championship rings and raised their title banner in a pregame ceremony.</p> <p>Carlos Boozer had 31 points and seven rebounds for Chicago, who fell behind by 21 points at halftime but got within eight points in the final minutes.</p> <p>Rose's start was promising early, with two early drives for impressive scores. The Bulls led 15-10 when Rose checked out for the first time with 3:36 left in the opening quarter. But the Heat outscored the Bulls 13-3 in Rose's stint on the bench.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers got 24 points from Paul George and 16 rebounds and seven blocks from Roy Hibbert to defeat the Orlando Magic 97-87.</p> <p>The two-man tandem looked every bit as dominant in the season opener as they did leading the Pacers to the Eastern Conference finals in the playoffs last season.</p> <p>George's buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the third quarter gave Indiana a 69-64 lead and sparked the decisive 17-4 run to open the fourth.</p> <p>Hibbert nearly matched his career-high for rebounds (17) in the first half. He had eight points but left the game midway through the fourth quarter after injuring his knee in a spill underneath his own basket. Team officials said it was not serious and he could have returned.</p> <p>Victor Oladipo, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2013&nbsp;NBA&nbsp;draft, had 12 points and three turnovers for the Magic.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/29/nba-2013-14-season-preview\">2013-14 NBA season preview</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421249528|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d34a7c3baea74a0ab118eddac011a98afea62976 -->",

It feels like the NBA season just came to an end, but that might just be a byproduct of how long its postseason lasts. Weren't the San Antonio Spurs like <em>just</em> about to win the NBA Finals, it was so clear that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/19/san-antonio-spurs-miami-heat-nba-finals-live\">Miami Heat fans left American Airlines Arena rather than witness the end of all-but-certain end of their season</a>. Of course, then Ray Allen hit the biggest three of his life, and he has hit many threes in his long basketball life, and suddenly the Miami Heat weren't just alive they were in command of the series as they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2013/jun/21/miami-heat-nba-champions-in-pictures\">won their second straight NBA Finals in Game Seven</a> to cap off an end of a surprisingly entertaining postseason. </p><p>In case you missed it, it went something like this:</p><p><em></em><br />So what now? Can the Heat plan for a three-peat? Can a team emerge from the Eastern Conference that could challenge them? Who will emerge from a tough, crowded Western Conference to make the NBA Finals. What will the networks do if both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics suck? Will Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook be healthy? Will JaVale McGee make any sense? (Spoiler alert: No.) Will fans start to like Dwight Howard again? Will we, gasp, actually end up missing outgoing commissioner David Stern, set to retire midway through the season?</p><p>(For a more in depth look at most of the major moves franchises made this offseason, there's this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/31/nba-offseason-winners-losers-celtics-nets-lakers-rockets\">guide to the major free agent signings and trade acquisitions</a> as well as this breakdown of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/28/nba-draft-number-one-anthony-bennett\">David Stern's farewell edition of the NBA Draft</a>.)</p><h2>EASTERN CONFERENCE</h2><h2>Atlantic Division</h2><p><strong>NEW YORK KNICKS</strong></p><p>Can the New York Knicks win it all with a team built around Carmelo Anthony? It's not a particularly fair question mind you, especially in a league where the bigger question is \"Can any team in the East win when built around Not LeBron James?\" With rebuilding Boston Celtics solidly in the Knicks' rear-view mirror, although their old friends will still visit in the guise of the Brooklyn Nets, this might be the team's best shot to prove they could make the Eastern Conference Finals with the talented but limited Anthony as their leader.</p><p>Now, how far can they get? Well, the Miami Heat are more vulnerable this year than they were last year, and don't let Michael Jordan fool you, three-peating ain't easy and the Knicks have an interesting lineup. While Carmelo Anthony's game might be almost as underrated by current statistics as it is overrated by the eye test, he will get his team points and Tyson Chandler still should be able to help on the defensive end. They'll see what they can get out of the legally-obligated-to-call-him-enigmatic Andrea Bargnani and the hard-partying J.R. Smith, who wants to jump from Sixth Man role to the starting rotation. Metta World Peace is a Knick now, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiZ-XgJKAIk\">in a very real Jack Torrance in \"The Shining\" sense, he's always been a New York Knickerbocker</a>. The 2013-14 Knicks are very talented yet also exceedingly flawed, which makes them maybe the most Eastern Conference-y team in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>While the Heat could very easily find itself fighting with the risen Derrick Rose's Chicago Bulls or in a rematch with the Indiana Pacers, it seems inevitable that LeBron and the Miami Heat would have to face off against Melo and the New York Knicks at least once with an NBA Finals visit on the line. Do the guys from Gotham have an actual shot to knock out the King? That might be a tougher thing to predict. (On the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/knicks-nepotism-woodson-jr-bro-leg-article-1.1494455\">if they keep up roster spaces for their players' less talented brothers,</a> it's pretty easy to predict that they won't.)</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Iman Shumpert.</strong> <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304384104579139662411195936\">If 21 Shump Street doesn't get traded</a> and if he keeps the fade, he's close to a lock at becoming the next Knicks cult figure.</p><p><strong>BROOKLYN NETS</strong></p><p>Well, you can't accuse the Brooklyn Nets for standing pat, all hail the Brookston Netlics! Yes, after a somewhat disappointing first year in Brooklyn the Nets have decided to become the Knicks' newest rival by incorporating bits of their previous biggest rival, trading for Boston Celtics legends Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett (and also, to a much lesser extent, Jason Terry). Combined with Deron Williams, Joe Johnson and Brook Lopez, this configuration gives the Nets one of the best looking starting lineups on paper, or at least one of the most expensive ones. Can they all cohere into a proper team before Russian owner Mikhail Prokhorov gets sick of paying for his new toy? It's up to first year coach Jason Kidd, just months after the end of his playing career, to mold this group of past and present All-Stars into something remotely resembling a team. Will the fact that he's still seen more of as a player make him the perfect choice to lead this pack of veterans, or will his lack of any (seriously any at all) managerial experience come back to haunt Nets ownership?</p><p>Overall this feels like another failed \"fantasy dream team\" experiment that franchises keep trying to piece together out of big-named big-budget players. If the guys who used to play in New Jersey (Deron Williams, Brook Lopez) don't step up, expect them to go the way of last season's Lakers.</p><p><strong>X-factor</strong>: <strong>Brook Lopez</strong>. He has the opportunity to establish himself as the best center in the Eastern Conference, particularly if the Pacers' Roy Hibbert has another rough regular season and Andrew Bynum is once again in \"back of the milk carton\" mode.</p><p><strong>TORONTO RAPTORS</strong></p><p>The Toronto Raptors reminded casual fans that they exist last season when they traded for Rudy Gay, a strange all-in moment for a team that wasn't likely to reach the playoffs last year and only have a shot this year because the Eastern Conference is as watered down as the liquor bottle in an Eugene O'Neill play. An all-scoring ballplayer, Gay's numbers have been on the downswing for a few years now, but Toronto hopes that he will be better now that <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/rudy-gay-vision-problems-terrible-could-hardly-license-181035727.html\">he's getting a vision problem corrected</a>. </p><p>Sure, the Raptors' second option might be Kyle Lowry at point guard, but still things are looking a little sunnier for the Raptors this season, if only because they can't quite possibly disappoint Toronto as much as the Blue Jays did over in MLB. The Raptors hired new GM Masai Ujiri, a move that was solidly praised and they are contemplating rebuilding . There's even talk of a long overdue name change, which is even better news unless one happens to be a huge \"Jurassic Park\" fan.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Rudy Gay</strong>. It had to be tough to see the Memphis Grizzlies not only succeed without him but for being on the receiving end of \"addition by subtraction\" arguments. Expect him to be beyond motivated this season.</p><p><strong>BOSTON CELTICS</strong></p><p>The Boston Celtics will not be good next season, and, in fact, if they are good and in danger of departing from the realm of lottery teams, management will start to trade away pieces. If Rajon Rondo recovers from his ACL injury faster than expected and shows he's still the same player, GM Danny Ainge will trade him if he gets the right offer. If the Celtics <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/22/boston-red-sox-al-east-playoffs\">take a page from their baseball brethren and go on some sort of unexpected win spree</a>, ownership will put an end to all that and dismantle them. The only reason to watch the Boston Celtics play basketball this season is that they will be incredibly interesting, but not interesting in a \"score more points than the other team\" sort of way.</p><p>The Big Three are all gone. Ray Allen is now a Miami postseason hero. Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett are out there in Brooklyn as part of the World's Most Expensive Fantasy Team. Doc Rivers is a Clipper now, working with Chris Paul is his reward for having to deal with Rondo for all of these years. In his place Boston has hired college coach Brad Stevens, <a href=\"http://www.deseretnews.com/top/132/4/Butler-did-it-Top-NCAA-Tournament-moments-so-far.html\">the man most responsible for all of those \"Butler Did It\" headlines</a>. Stevens could be a fine NBA coach, but this almost certainly will be a training wheels year for him. No wonder longtime Celtics flagship WEEI <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/sports/touching_all_the_bases/2013/08/celtics_will_no_longer_air_on_weei.html\">didn't renew their contract this year</a>.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Avery Bradley</strong>. Because nothing you can say can take me away from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/mar/29/trayvon-martin-miami-heat-donald-sterling\">my guy</a>.</p><p><strong>PHILADELPHIA 76ers</strong></p><p>The Philadelphia 76ers this season are less of a NBA franchise and more of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjn1Y9YcIQM\">a basketball-centric remake of the The Producers.</a> When the Philadelphia 76ers traded their best player, Jrue Holiday for injured lottery pick Nerlens Noel it was a signal that the 76ers, having given up Andre Iguodala in exchange for zero minutes of Andrew Bynum the previous season, were no longer in the business of winning actual games. Instead, their clear priority is landing one of the top picks in what promises to be <a href=\"http://www.sheridanhoops.com/2013/10/17/nba-draft-2014-very-early-mock-lottery/\">one of the most loaded NBA Drafts in recent memory</a>.</p><p>So, the goal this season is to land the best chance of winning one of the first two slots in the draft lottery, which means losing as many game as possible, which means the likes of Evan Turner and rookie Michael Carter-Williams will be on your 76ers program guides. \"Tanking\" of course is such an ugly word for fans who want to believe that their team is at least trying to win, so let's just call it something like \"being strategically noncompetitive\". And this season, this 76ers team has a shot to be the most strategically noncompetitive team in NBA history.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Nerlens Noel</strong>. Wait, what he's going to be out the entire season, man that's gotta hurt the team's win total. (Cut to 76ers executives partying gleefully to the tune of Loverboy's \"Working For The Weekend\")</p><h2>Central Division</h2><p><strong>CHICAGO BULLS</strong></p><p>Keys to the game: Derrick Rose. Derrick Rose, Derrick Rose, Derrick Rose. The Chicago Bulls season will be entirely about the return of their former MVP from ACL injury, he injured his before it was cool. Derrick Rose <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/23355728-761/vindicated-derrick-rosesilences-critics-bulls-go-8-0-in-preseason.html\">has looked good in the preseason</a>, which is encouraging because \"seeing how players returning from injuries look\" is quite possibly the only worthwhile reason to pay attention to preseason games. If he stays healthy and productive he can return to his 2011 peak era identity as LeBron's Eastern Conference Rival.</p><p>In hindsight, the idea that the Chicago Bulls could have beaten the Miami Heat last year with Derrick Rose back at 75% seems absolutely ludicrous, the byproduct of two memorable Heat defeats (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/28/chicago-bulls-end-miami-heat-streak\">one in the regular season</a>, the other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/07/nba-playoffs-heat-bulls-spurs\">in the playoffs</a>). Still, they revealed they had the heart of a championship team. In Rose's absence, Joakim Noah developed more of a leadership role and Jimmy Butler flourished. Luol Deng should continue to be the rotation's rock if head coach Tom Thibodeau avoids overworking to the point of exhaustion and/or possible death. </p><p>Assuming that Rose's return doesn't negatively affect this newfound chemistry, and the core three (Rose, Noah, Deng) stay healthy, the Bulls should be the second best team in Eastern Conference and Miami's clearest rival. That might be too much of an \"if' though, especially considering that no one player has shown the difference that injuries can make than their former MVP.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Every internet and sports radio tough guy who called out Derrick Rose last season</strong>. You don't think Rose remembers every single time he was called a coward?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421545865'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/2/1370142964776/38560429-859b-413a-863f-e5629f14a41c-460x276.jpeg' alt='Indiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert has reason to celebrate as his team defeated the Miami Heat at home to force a Game 7 in the Eastern Conference Finals.

Photograph: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>INDIANA PACERS</strong></p><p>Last year was a breakout year for the Indiana Pacers. Although they played the Miami Heat tough in the 2012 NBA playoffs, Paul George made that all-important \"leap to the next level\" last season <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/02/heat-pacers-game-six-seven-nba-playoffs\">as his team pushed the Heat to seven games</a>. For a moment it seemed possible that Roy Hibbert, who struggled for much of the regular season, may have just figured out LeBron James.</p><p>He hadn't, of course, LeBron James isn't a math problem to be solved. Miami survived the challenge in the Eastern Conference Championship and moved on to an even closer match against the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals. While the Finals might have obscured what Indiana did in the series before, it shouldn't have because at this point the Pacers clearly aren't a fluke. This is a complete team, George, Hibbert, George Hill and David West play off each other as well as almost anybody in the league, maybe even the vaunted Spurs. The bad news for the Pacers is they won't be sneaking up on anybody this year, not with Paul George rapidly approaching star status around the league, and the league gets a lot more difficult once people start building expectations around you.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Danny Granger</strong>. Do the Pacers incorporate him back into the lineup when he's healthy, or does he become trade bait? There are worse problems a team could have.</p><p><strong>CLEVELAND CAVALIERS</strong></p><p>What happens when you surround one of the best young players in the game with an injured big man who never played a meaningful minute with his previous team, a sixth man whose shooting was too inconsistent even for the Golden State Warriors, a player trying to switch shooting hands mid-career and one of the most surprising number one draft picks of all time? It sounds like the Cleveland Cavaliers are taking cues from their baseball brothers in the Cleveland Indians, or at least the movie version of them in \"Major League\", but this might actually be the lineup that takes the Cavs to their first post-LeBron postseason.</p><p>After having the number one pick in the NBA Draft two out the last three years, it feels like the Cavs will finally compete for their first post-Decision playoff spot. Besides snagging Anthony Bennett in this year's draft, the Cavaliers made several seemingly shrewd moves. They signed Andrew Bynum to a short-term deal, he could flourish as the best center in the conference or he could provide nothing, think of him as a lottery ticket, high upside and low risk. They signed Jarrett Jack fresh off a productive sixth man season for the Golden State Warriors. While Tristan Thompson isn't exactly new to the team, he might as well be, he has spent the offseason <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/14/tristan-thompson-talks-switch-from-left-to-right-handed-shooter/\">switching his shooting hand from his left to his right.</a></p><p>Who's the guy in charge of keeping together this ragtag group of misfits, it's Mike Brown straight off of being fired by the Los Angeles Lakers and, before that, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Apparently ownership is hoping that reviving this off-again/on-again relationship will result in the Cavs getting stronger on the defensive end, a key thing they'll need to improve this season. The good news is that no matter what works out and what doesn't, they have a constant in Kyrie Irving, one of the best ten players in the Eastern Conference as long as he can, and this is always the caveat, stay on the court.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Andrew Bynum</strong>. Well, for starters, it would be nice if he actually plays in a NBA game at some point.</p><p><strong>DETROIT PISTONS</strong></p><p>Welcome back to the NBA Playoffs Detroit! Okay if the Pistons do make it back to the playoffs, it will be more of an indictment on the Eastern Conference than a sign that the Pistons are moving forward. Still, if you're a Detroit fan it has to be nice to see this once proud franchise actually be in competition, if only for an eighth-seed.</p><p>With the Celtics, 76ers and Bucks all looking beyond vulnerable, Detroit ownership opened up their wallets in the free agent market and... picked up Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings. <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/7/31/4574400/brandon-jennings-trade-josh-smith-pistons-fans-shooting\">That sounds like fun and games until it happens to your favorite franchise</a>. The Pistons will win more games, but that's a lot of money tied up to a volatile combination that could be amazing but could also be a complete car wreck. </p><p>Speaking of possible car wrecks: <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/2013/news/09/25/pistons-add-wallace-as-coach.ap/\">Rasheed Wallace, Player Development Coach</a>. This is internet basketball comedy writing gold, people. Just imagine Sheed telling impressionable young players the correct way to pick up technical fouls, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5L_QkUZ-3s\">imparting wisdom about basketballs and the veracity of their claims</a> and telling them how to transform their public image from being one of the league's dirtiest players to a beloved b-ball eccentric.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Andre Drummond</strong>. It's been a while since the Pistons had a young star, most experts think they have a budding one in center Andre Drummond. (<a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/andre-drummond-may-be-dating-nickelodeon-star-jennette-mccurdy-after-meeting-on-twitter-090413\">He also has the best \"meet cute\" dating story of the NBA offseason.</a>)</p><p><strong>MILWAUKEE BUCKS</strong></p><p>It's not that the Milwaukee Bucks will be absolutely terrible, in fact that's their problem. Has any other NBA franchise desperately courted mediocrity for a longer time than the Milwaukee Bucks? Last season, the Bucks once again landed in the postseason only to be quickly knocked out by a far superior team. The only memorable moment about the whole affair was when Brandon Jennings <a href=\"http://thegoodpoint.com/brandon-jennings-guarantee/\">guaranteed a victory in their opening round series against the Miami Heat</a>. To no one's surprise this didn't pan out, and the Bucks actually traded away Jennings during the offseason: it's not really helpful to try to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIxIRkiThak\">channel Joe Namath</a> when you really have more in common <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdEAwFH4I34\">with Glass Joe</a>.</p><p>Still, there are reasons to watch the Bucks unlike some of the other Eastern Conference teams that have decided they would rather court Andrew Wiggins. Most of those reasons are thanks to Larry Sanders, who established himself as one of the league's most ferocious defenders and a surprising offensive threat. They've also picked up O.J. Mayo and Caron Butler and they still have John Henson, giving them not one but two players <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwxKAwQ669g\">who share their names with talk show hosts</a> (either real or fictional). That's something right?</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>LARRY SANDERS!</strong> Has any athLete gone from \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zosx1JialxE\">pop culture joke name</a>\" to potentially a difference making All-Star this quickly? (Double checks on Cleveland Indians' catcher Carlos Santana. Nope not there yet.) </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421545866'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/24/1366775953061/617446b3-0d9c-4b1e-a367-96f4464e2da1-460x276.jpeg' alt='LeBron James and Chris Bosh Miami Heat vs Milwaukee Bucks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Can the Miami Heat three-peat? Photograph: Joe Skipper/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><h2>Southeast Division</h2><p><strong>MIAMI HEAT</strong></p><p>The Miami Heat come into the season once again as favorites to win the NBA Finals. A three-peat isn't out of the question, but this team has more question marks than it did this time last year and, keep in mind, their 2013 playoff run was more difficult than anyone expected. Dwyane Wade's knee is an issue, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/nba-durant-wade-jordan-lebron-trash-talk\">Kevin Durant may be right when he says that he might not be a top 10 player in the NBA any more</a>. Chris Bosh was underwhelming in last year's playoffs and he has quite possibly already peaked himself. Still, LeBron is the greatest player in basketball, possibly the best athlete in American sports right now, and in the NBA that will always be the biggest advantage a team could have. </p><p>This of course would be a different narrative coming into the season <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/19/san-antonio-spurs-miami-heat-nba-finals-live\">had Ray Allen not hit the greatest three-pointer in NBA Finals history</a>. Imagine if the Spurs had handed the Heat a season-ending defeat rather than going on to win game seven <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/21/miami-heat-san-antonio-spurs-finals-game-7-live\">to sew up their second straight championship</a>. Last year's playoffs remind us that the role players will always get their chance to make a difference. Last postseason the Heat got key contributions from Allen, Chris Andersen and Shane Battier. Former draft busts Greg Oden and Michael Beasley might not be locks to even make the team, but they aren't here as part of a charity program.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>LeBron James's impending free agency</strong>. You are going to be so, so sick of hearing about this. Even from this corner of the internet, we apologize in advance.</p><p><strong>ATLANTA HAWKS</strong></p><p>Al Horford is one of the best players in the league, Jeff Teague might be the best point guard that gets left off the \"best point guard\" conversation and now the Hawks have Paul Milsap, who somehow leaves Utah to a situation which is about as equally easy to overlook.</p><p>So once again the Atlanta Hawks put out a lineup that will end up being anywhere from aggressively mediocre to good-but-not-great. This appropriately enough puts the Hawks in about the same category as their compatriots in the Braves and Falcons. It's been 56 years since the Hawks won more than one playoff series which a) is ridiculous even for an Atlanta pro sports team and b) it also feels like it's been a lot longer. It also doesn't feel like this will end soon.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Lou Williams</strong>. He's still rehabbing from an ACL injury – who isn't in the NBA these days – but the guy can be a serious offensive weapon off the bench/Six Man of the Year candidate. <a href=\"http://www.peachtreehoops.com/2013/9/25/4768398/lou-williams-injury-return-date-atlanta-hawks\">The Hawks hope to have him back by December</a>.</p><p><strong>WASHINGTON WIZARDS</strong></p><p>Will this be John Wall's breakout year? The Washington Wizards hope so because they signed Wall to <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/7/31/4576108/john-wall-max-contract-extension-wizards\">a maximum extension worth $85 million during the offseason</a> with the hope that the talented young point guard would start to tap into his unused potential. Certainly the way he ended last season suggests that this could be the first fun year of Washington hoops <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/sports/2012/04/gilbert-arenas-finally-explains-why-he-pulled-out-four-guns-in-the-wizards-locker-room-in-december-2009\">since before Gilbert Arenas decided to pay tribute to the old Washington Bullets name</a>. (It would help if he were able to, you know, hit three-pointers.)<br /> <br />What about his supporting cast? As with everything in the NBA these days, it's all about health, particularly with the oft-injured Nene penciled in as the team's second option. Plus they have Emeka Okafor... <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/10/25/trade-marcin-gortat-emeka-okafor/\">what's that? Out indefinitely? And traded for Marcin Gortat? Oh uh well this is embarrassing</a>. Okay, if Nene and Gortat are actually in the lineup, and Bradley Beal expands his game in his second year in the bigs, Wall won't be doing this entirely alone.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>John Wall's ridiculous self-confidence</strong>. During this offseason, Wall <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/22999156/wizards-john-wall-believes-hes-the-best-point-guard-in-the-nba\">told reporters that he considers himself the best point guard in the league</a>. Laugh all you want, but if you're a Wizards fan that's exactly what you want to hear from your franchise star.</p><p><strong>ORLANDO MAGIC</strong></p><p>So, during the offseason, <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/9/12/4619946/orlando-magic-dwight-howard-trade-nikola-vukevic-arron-afflalo\">the Orlando Magic officially won the Dwight Howard trade</a>, and Magic fans should celebrate if only because there won't be very many more wins coming any time soon. Andrew Bynum didn't play a single game for the Philadelphia 76ers. Dwight Howard played most of the year of the Lakers, although some fans wished that weren't the case, almost certainly deliberately fouled out of his final game with the Lakers and then moved on to Houston. While Andre Iguodala ended up providing the most value to the Denver Nuggets, he opted out of his contract during the offseason to sign with the Golden State Warriors. That leaves Orlando as the only franchise to still have anything of any real value leftover (Aaron Affalo, Nikola Vucevic, Maurice Harkless) from the biggest trade of last year's offseason.</p><p>They also maybe have the most interesting player that came out of this year's draft in Victor Oladipo, whose preseason performance suggests that he may be one of those rare rookies capable of immediately doing some major offensive damage in his first year. But yeah, Orlando still needs a few more pieces to be a contending team, even in the Eastern Conference, so look for them to be fighting for lottery position with the 76ers and Suns this season.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis</strong>. Wait, he's still with Orlando right?</p><p><strong>CHARLOTTE BOBCATS</strong></p><p>The big news of the offseason? The Charlotte Bobcats have signed a big name free agent! Okay, so Al Jefferson isn't the biggest name available but the former Celtics prospect turned Utah Jazz semi-star is a name that casual NBA fans MAY actually recognize. That's rare for a Bobcats player, unless we're talking about \"recognizing as a punchline in a joke\". (In some circles, you can get laughs just by saying \"Adam Morrison\".)</p><p>Since changing one's team name is the hip things to do these days, unless you're Daniel Snyder, <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/the-charlotte-hornets-are-coming-back-824093267\">Charlotte is in line to reclaim the \"Hornets\" nickname next season</a> from the newly renamed New Orleans Pelicans. This works best for all sides, as the Hornets were meant to be a Charlotte team from the very beginning. It's always nice when an area has a nickname that really fits the surrounding area, your move next Utah.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Hornets mojo</strong>! It's not quite an exorcism, but a name change is as good a start as any at resetting this woeful NBA team.</p><h2>WESTERN CONFERENCE</h2><h2>Southwest Division</h2><p><strong>HOUSTON ROCKETS</strong></p><p>The Houston Rockets made a huge splash during the offseason when they convinced Dwight Howard to leave what was an increasingly bad – think Alex Rodriguez in New York bad – situation with the Los Angeles Lakers. While Howard should be healthier and more comfortable in Houston than he was in L.A., this is still Dwight Howard, a man as temperamental as he is talented. The Rockets look pretty dangerous now that James Harden, with a breakthrough year under his belt, is teamed up with the best center in the league, but will the two be able to play together?</p><p>After being relegated to Sixth Man duties with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Harden seemed absolutely liberated in his first full year with Houston. Will Harden be willing to return to more of a supporting role if Dwight Howard plays like his old Hall of Fame self? Will Omer Asik, whose skill set overlaps with Howard, demand a trade, and what could Houston get from him? The Houston Rockets already made the leap last season when Harden emerged as a MVP-caliber player, but Howard has a knack of solving some problems while creating others and the Western Conference is only getting tougher. The Rockets made the biggest and best move of the offseason, yes, but that doesn't guarantee that they will be anything but a tough out in the playoffs.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Jeremy Lin</strong>. Still a thing, although that thing may not end up being \"starting point guard in the NBA\".</p><p><strong>SAN ANTONIO SPURS</strong></p><p>Did Ray Allen kill the Spurs dynasty with his dagger three in Game Six of the NBA finals? Did the Heat shut down the Gregg Popovich/Tim Duncan Spurs' last real chance at winning another title by coming back in game six and winning it all in game seven? Let's go with \"probably not, because the Spurs never die\".</p><p>No one expected the 2012 team to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/02/boston-celtics-miami-heat-deshawn-stevenson-atm\">keep a winning streak alive until halfway through the Western Conference Finals</a>. No one expected the Spurs to make the NBA Finals, let alone be thirty seconds away from eliminating the Heat in a game six. Manu Ginobili may have had a rough postseason, but Kawhi Leonard put himself a half-step away from superstardom in this latest Spurs playoffs run. Tony Parker: Still a Top Five MVP voting threat. Tim Duncan: Still not making us believe he's anything other than a cyborg. Danny Green: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/12/danny-green-gary-neal-spurs-heat-3-point-record\">The dude can hit three-pointers</a>, just a little. Gregg Popovich: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ2W3wqNdHs\">Still awesomely curmudgeonly</a>. </p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Manu Ginobili</strong>. Will the Spurs actually have to deal with the consequences of aging to one of their key players this season? Nah, a New York team will probably just trade for him and give him a five year extension for no reason.</p><p><strong>MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES</strong></p><p>Congrats to Memphis for finally becoming interesting. Just one year ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/30/nba-2012-2013-season-preview\">thIS writer was resorting to Chuck Berry parodies</a> in lieu of saying anything about Zach Randolph, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. Then, of course, the club hired <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5980649/adrian-wojnarowskis-latest-column-features-a-sick-burn-on-john-hollinger\">some former cable sports employee </a>and did the number one thing designed to get more people talking about them: They traded away their best known player to Canada and then got better.</p><p>Can they make the Western Conference Finals again? That might be too much to ask for, although it would be great to see another Clippers/Grizzlies series in the playoffs. They have formed a true, natural rivalry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/26/clippers-grizzlies-best-action-playoffs\">that is quickly becoming one of the most interesting in the NBA</a>. Wherever Memphis goes, they will have to make it there without head coach Lionel Hollins, one of the most surprising victims of \"First thing we get rid of the head coaches\" uprising in the NBA this offseason. If the Grizzlies regress under the watch of new coach Dave Joerger, expect that move to be second-guessed, but this organization clearly doesn't mind risking their fanbase.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Tony Allen's Twitter account</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2013/2/17/3999480/tony-allen-twitter-nba-all-star-2013\">It's the best</a>.</p><p><strong>NEW ORLEANS PELICANS</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/69527/whats-in-a-name-why-the-pelicans-should-be-known-as-the-pellies\"><br />No we are not calling them the Pellies.</a></p><p>Say goodbye to the New Orleans Hornets. Despite the initial mocking, New Orleans have stuck with their decision to rename the team after Louisiana's state bird. Back when the Tampa Bay Devil Rays changed their name to the Tampa Bay Rays, all they did was make it to the World Series after not having a winning record before then. Can the New Or-</p><p>No. No they can't. The Western Conference is too darn stacked for them to have any hope of a Finals appearance, but will they be competitive this year? Absolutely. Certainly management thinks they will be, why else would they make a move to trade for Philadelphia's Jrue Holiday? Watch for Anthony Davis and his Unibrow to unleash a statement game or two against tough competition this season, and for Eric Gordon to quietly put up some nice numbers, just keep the expectations low. At least this year.<br /> <br /><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Austin Rivers</strong>: The goal is to improve on <a href=\"http://www.bourbonstreetshots.com/2013/04/24/season-in-review-austin-rivers/\">one of the worst NBA seasons anyone has ever had</a>.

Photograph: LM Otero/AP</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>DALLAS MAVERICKS</strong></p><p>Have the Dallas Mavericks already wasted Dirk Nowitzki's prime? Well, if nothing else this offseason, Mavericks fans have at least got to hear owner Mark Cuban's side of the story. After the Mavericks once again failed to rope a big name free agent to join along with Nowitzki in Dallas, this time it was that Dwight Howard fellow that everyone was coveting, Cuban <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/08/04/mark-cuban-dallas-mavericks-tanking/\">took to the internet to explain what the Mavs were trying to do and how they, well, failed</a>.</p><p>Is there hope? Let's hear it from their big free agent acquisition Monta Ellis <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/24/dallas-monta-ellis-says-he-is-passing-too-much/\">about his new role as the number two guy in the Mavs offense</a>: \"I'm looking for the pass too much\". Of course you are Monta. (Writer pencils them in for a 0% chance at making the postseason.) Oh and Ellis, <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-mavericks/headlines/20131011-new-stat-shows-mavs-monta-ellis-to-be-nba-s-worst-shooter-jose-calderon-league-s-best-from-outside.ece\">by at least one statistical measure the worst shooter in the NBA</a>, <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/01/monta-ellis-on-bad-shots-im-gonna-play-monta-ball/\">also is adamant that he is gong to play \"Monta-ball\"</a>. (Writer grabs pen, writes prediction that Dallas misses the playoffs again, this time in ink.)</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Shark Tank</strong>. Would owner Mark Cuban do some crazy, conference-shattering move <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E_TPgKMp-g\">just to promote his TV show</a>? Would you put it past him?</p><h2>Northwest Division</h2><p><strong>OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER</strong></p><p>It's been a tough twelve months for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Once thought to be the next dynasty of the Western Conference, the successor to the Lakers and Spurs, the Thunder instead traded James Harden to the Houston Rockets for a bunch of mostly departed spare parts, lost Russell Westbrook to injury in the middle of the playoffs and watched as Serge Ibaka did his best Sue Storm impression and turned invisible throughout the remainder of the postseason. </p><p>In other words, until Westbrook returns and is at something close to 100% this will be the Kevin Durant show, and you know what: The Kevin Durant Show is going to be awesome. We saw how Durant tried to put his entire team on his back after Westbrook went down in their series against the Rockets, it wasn't enough for a return trip to the Western Conference Finals but there's something incredibly fun about watching a guy as talented as Durant do everything. However, the team is going to need Russell Westbrook completely healthy and in full \"Beast Mode\" to reach their ultimate goal.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Kendrick Perkins</strong>. It's really remarkable to see how far Kendrick Perkins has gone without being amnestied: he's like the Inspector Clouseau of the bellow-average centers.</p><p><strong>DENVER NUGGETS</strong></p><p>What a weird year for George Karl, he received the Coach of the Year award and a pink slip from his bosses within the span of about a month. It has been a rough year for a Denver Nuggets team once again dealing with the aftereffects of an early playoff loss. Although the Nuggets got the best year out of Andre Iguodala that any team involved in the Dwight Howard Mega-Deal got out of any player, they weren't able to convince him to stay: Iguodala left for the Warriors at the end of the season. Injured Danilo Gallinari won't be back for the first few weeks of the season. </p><p>So, this is a franchise that has taken a step back. The main reason to follow the Nuggets is Kenneth Faried, which makes it bad news for Denver fans if <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9860683/32-bold-predictions-2013-14-nba-season\">Zach Lowe's prediction is right and he gets traded</a>. The second best reason to follow the Nuggets is JaVale McGee, who is also one of the major reasons not to pin one's hope and dreams on the Nuggets. </p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>JaVale McGee</strong>. The Human Lowlight Reel might just be <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lbB0M7dYPg\">the X-Factor of the entire league</a>.</p><p><strong>MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES</strong></p><p>The Minnesota Timberwolves of the last few years have gifted us <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAxARJyaTEA\">the basketball version of Burgess Meredith's glasses</a>. They look like they'll be the most fun team in basketball, and we'll have all the time in the world, but then Kevin Love and Ricky Rubio shatter into pieces during the regular season and it's just not fair... not fair at all. If you're a NBA fan, just pray to your preferred deity that we will have time enough to enjoy them at last.</p><p>Well, sometimes franchises make their own luck, and, for the most part at least, <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/david-kahn-ends-minnesota-timberwolves-career-blaze-excuse-173816338.html\">former GM David Kahn has been targeted as the T-Wolves' cooler</a>. Now that he's gone, Minnesota fans will have no one to blame for the things that will inevitably go wrong for them. Okay, other than when Kevin Love leaves because Kahn didn't want to offer him a maximum extension, that will totally be on him. </p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Kevin Love's health</strong>. And isn't it always for this team? </p><p><strong>UTAH JAZZ</strong></p><p>There will be no more slipping into the Western Conference playoffs via the seventh or eighth seed for the Utah Jazz. There are just too many strong teams, and it's not like the Jazz teams of the last few years was ever designed to do much damage in the postseason.</p><p>The Jazz could afford to let Al Jefferson and Paul Milsap go because they have a lot of young talent in the metaphorical pipeline. Plus, it's not like Jefferson and Milsap were LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, not exactly irreplaceable cogs of a legit title contender. It's safe to say that one or two of the Jazz's young players will perform well enough to get a decent sized feature in Sports Illustrated and maybe an All-Star Game appearance, but don't expect this year to be the one where you'll find many Jazz games on national television.</p><p>Unless of course, the Jazz make the playoffs and are interesting enough that the NBA won't be forced to hide them on NBA TV (unofficial home of every Atlanta Hawks playoff game). The trouble with that is, well, their competition in the West has become far more, well, competitive. Their best chance at finding themselves as high as the sixth seed in the postseason lies in a Conference shakeup. Salt Lake City is Eastern enough, right?</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Derrick Favors</strong>. Somebody's going to have to step up without Jefferson and Milsap and he's the most likely candidate.</p><p><strong>PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS</strong></p><p>Congrats Portand, you've become this year's Hardest Team To Say Anything Interesting About. Don't feel so bad, that was the Memphis Grizzlies last year and they ended <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/grizzlies/news/grizzlies-best-overall-pro-sports-franchise-espn-2013-ultimate-standings-130918\">up being named number one on \"ESPN: The Magazine\"'s best franchise list</a> after their 2012-13 campaign ended. The Trail Blazers's roster suggests that they most likely won't be making the same leap.</p><p>Damian Lillard was the deserved rookie of the year, in admittingly was somewhat of a down year for rookies, and LaMarcus Aldridge is the perennial Guy Who Will Become A Big Star When Inevitably Is On A Major Market Team. <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/brook-lopez-dunks-twin-brother-robin-continuing-lifelong-022337324--nba.html\">Hey there's their big offseason acquisition: Brook Lopez...

Don't laugh, it's more likely than you think. The San Antonio Spurs will have to start playing like they're older at some point, right? The Oklahoma City Thunder will most likely have to rely too much on their superstar Kevin Durant, while, conversely, that's exactly what their arch-enemies, the Memphis Grizzlies, lack. The Houston Rockets improved by picking up Dwight Howard, but that also means that they now have to deal with Dwight Howard. Ask the Los Angeles Lakers about the difference between Dwight Howard on paper and Dwight Howard in the locker room.</p><p>With the Clippers getting a huge upgrade at the coaching level by replacing Vinny del Negro with Doc Rivers, and adding a three-point threat with the signing of J.J. Redick, it's beyond time for the Clippers to finally go deep into the playoffs. The team most likely to block their way in the NBA Finals could very well be the Golden State Warriors, whose short-term success is wrapped up in the precarious health of Steph Curry and Andrew Bogut. Hey, worst case scenario they are still essentially guaranteed to be the best basketball team in Los Angeles for the second year in a row, that's not something Clippers fans will take for granted.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Blake Griffin</strong>. He seems willing to change his game and become more of an all-around player, he's even spoke about the Clippers moving away from their \"Lob City\" monicker. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IOSX-Hdqx0\">Maybe his time-traveling car could help him unlearn his previous bad habits</a>?</p><p><strong>GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS</strong></p><p>What if last year was their peak? While their surprising run to the Western Conference Finals, which included the two best NBA Playoff games that didn't involve a Ray Allen three at the buzzer, back-to-back, looked to have finally taken that jump from Fun Offensive Team to serious contender. However, with transcendent shooting guard Steph Curry's recurring ankle issues and center Andrew Bogut's recurring everything issues, they are not guaranteed to go that deep again. </p><p>What the Warriors need is health and a bit more emotional intelligence: Great teams need to learn how to close out games something which <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPAEj7U02B0\">they failed spectacularly at last season</a>. This is why one of the best moves any team made during the offseason was when Golden State let often great but sometimes inconsistent sixth man Jarrett Jack go to Cleveland while stealing Andre Iguodala away from the Denver Nuggets. Plus they still have Klay Thompson, David Lee, Harrison Barnes. Man, this team is going to be fun to watch. If healthy.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Steph Curry's ankle</strong>.

The other big news is that DeMarcus Cousins will be a King for the foreseeable future. Notice the lack of differentiation between \"good news\" and \"bad news\" in those statements. Simply put: The good news is that Sacramento is keeping their sole pro team and their biggest athlete, the bad news is that this is referring to the Kings and Cousins respectively.</p><p>The Maloof family is on its way out, which is good news for everyone involved, and the seemingly-inevitable move to Seattle seems completely dead, sorry SuperSonics fans. Sacramento Kings fans have already witnessed two miracles, so any further positive developments this season would just be bonuses.

It feels like the NBA season just came to an end, but that might just be a byproduct of how long its postseason lasts. Weren't the San Antonio Spurs like <em>just</em> about to win the NBA Finals, it was so clear that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/19/san-antonio-spurs-miami-heat-nba-finals-live\">Miami Heat fans left American Airlines Arena rather than witness the end of all-but-certain end of their season</a>. Of course, then Ray Allen hit the biggest three of his life, and he has hit many threes in his long basketball life, and suddenly the Miami Heat weren't just alive they were in command of the series as they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2013/jun/21/miami-heat-nba-champions-in-pictures\">won their second straight NBA Finals in Game Seven</a> to cap off an end of a surprisingly entertaining postseason. </p><p>In case you missed it, it went something like this:</p><p><em></em><br />So what now? Can the Heat plan for a three-peat? Can a team emerge from the Eastern Conference that could challenge them? Who will emerge from a tough, crowded Western Conference to make the NBA Finals. What will the networks do if both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics suck? Will Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook be healthy? Will JaVale McGee make any sense? (Spoiler alert: No.) Will fans start to like Dwight Howard again? Will we, gasp, actually end up missing outgoing commissioner David Stern, set to retire midway through the season?</p><p>(For a more in depth look at most of the major moves franchises made this offseason, there's this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/31/nba-offseason-winners-losers-celtics-nets-lakers-rockets\">guide to the major free agent signings and trade acquisitions</a> as well as this breakdown of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/28/nba-draft-number-one-anthony-bennett\">David Stern's farewell edition of the NBA Draft</a>.)</p><h2>EASTERN CONFERENCE</h2><h2>Atlantic Division</h2><p><strong>NEW YORK KNICKS</strong></p><p>Can the New York Knicks win it all with a team built around Carmelo Anthony? It's not a particularly fair question mind you, especially in a league where the bigger question is \"Can any team in the East win when built around Not LeBron James?\" With rebuilding Boston Celtics solidly in the Knicks' rear-view mirror, although their old friends will still visit in the guise of the Brooklyn Nets, this might be the team's best shot to prove they could make the Eastern Conference Finals with the talented but limited Anthony as their leader.</p><p>Now, how far can they get? Well, the Miami Heat are more vulnerable this year than they were last year, and don't let Michael Jordan fool you, three-peating ain't easy and the Knicks have an interesting lineup. While Carmelo Anthony's game might be almost as underrated by current statistics as it is overrated by the eye test, he will get his team points and Tyson Chandler still should be able to help on the defensive end. They'll see what they can get out of the legally-obligated-to-call-him-enigmatic Andrea Bargnani and the hard-partying J.R. Smith, who wants to jump from Sixth Man role to the starting rotation. Metta World Peace is a Knick now, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiZ-XgJKAIk\">in a very real Jack Torrance in \"The Shining\" sense, he's always been a New York Knickerbocker</a>. The 2013-14 Knicks are very talented yet also exceedingly flawed, which makes them maybe the most Eastern Conference-y team in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>While the Heat could very easily find itself fighting with the risen Derrick Rose's Chicago Bulls or in a rematch with the Indiana Pacers, it seems inevitable that LeBron and the Miami Heat would have to face off against Melo and the New York Knicks at least once with an NBA Finals visit on the line. Do the guys from Gotham have an actual shot to knock out the King? That might be a tougher thing to predict. (On the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/knicks-nepotism-woodson-jr-bro-leg-article-1.1494455\">if they keep up roster spaces for their players' less talented brothers,</a> it's pretty easy to predict that they won't.)</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Iman Shumpert.</strong> <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304384104579139662411195936\">If 21 Shump Street doesn't get traded</a> and if he keeps the fade, he's close to a lock at becoming the next Knicks cult figure.</p><p><strong>BROOKLYN NETS</strong></p><p>Well, you can't accuse the Brooklyn Nets for standing pat, all hail the Brookston Netlics! Yes, after a somewhat disappointing first year in Brooklyn the Nets have decided to become the Knicks' newest rival by incorporating bits of their previous biggest rival, trading for Boston Celtics legends Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett (and also, to a much lesser extent, Jason Terry). Combined with Deron Williams, Joe Johnson and Brook Lopez, this configuration gives the Nets one of the best looking starting lineups on paper, or at least one of the most expensive ones. Can they all cohere into a proper team before Russian owner Mikhail Prokhorov gets sick of paying for his new toy? It's up to first year coach Jason Kidd, just months after the end of his playing career, to mold this group of past and present All-Stars into something remotely resembling a team. Will the fact that he's still seen more of as a player make him the perfect choice to lead this pack of veterans, or will his lack of any (seriously any at all) managerial experience come back to haunt Nets ownership?</p><p>Overall this feels like another failed \"fantasy dream team\" experiment that franchises keep trying to piece together out of big-named big-budget players. If the guys who used to play in New Jersey (Deron Williams, Brook Lopez) don't step up, expect them to go the way of last season's Lakers.</p><p><strong>X-factor</strong>: <strong>Brook Lopez</strong>. He has the opportunity to establish himself as the best center in the Eastern Conference, particularly if the Pacers' Roy Hibbert has another rough regular season and Andrew Bynum is once again in \"back of the milk carton\" mode.</p><p><strong>TORONTO RAPTORS</strong></p><p>The Toronto Raptors reminded casual fans that they exist last season when they traded for Rudy Gay, a strange all-in moment for a team that wasn't likely to reach the playoffs last year and only have a shot this year because the Eastern Conference is as watered down as the liquor bottle in an Eugene O'Neill play. An all-scoring ballplayer, Gay's numbers have been on the downswing for a few years now, but Toronto hopes that he will be better now that <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/rudy-gay-vision-problems-terrible-could-hardly-license-181035727.html\">he's getting a vision problem corrected</a>. </p><p>Sure, the Raptors' second option might be Kyle Lowry at point guard, but still things are looking a little sunnier for the Raptors this season, if only because they can't quite possibly disappoint Toronto as much as the Blue Jays did over in MLB. The Raptors hired new GM Masai Ujiri, a move that was solidly praised and they are contemplating rebuilding . There's even talk of a long overdue name change, which is even better news unless one happens to be a huge \"Jurassic Park\" fan.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Rudy Gay</strong>. It had to be tough to see the Memphis Grizzlies not only succeed without him but for being on the receiving end of \"addition by subtraction\" arguments. Expect him to be beyond motivated this season.</p><p><strong>BOSTON CELTICS</strong></p><p>The Boston Celtics will not be good next season, and, in fact, if they are good and in danger of departing from the realm of lottery teams, management will start to trade away pieces. If Rajon Rondo recovers from his ACL injury faster than expected and shows he's still the same player, GM Danny Ainge will trade him if he gets the right offer. If the Celtics <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/22/boston-red-sox-al-east-playoffs\">take a page from their baseball brethren and go on some sort of unexpected win spree</a>, ownership will put an end to all that and dismantle them. The only reason to watch the Boston Celtics play basketball this season is that they will be incredibly interesting, but not interesting in a \"score more points than the other team\" sort of way.</p><p>The Big Three are all gone. Ray Allen is now a Miami postseason hero. Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett are out there in Brooklyn as part of the World's Most Expensive Fantasy Team. Doc Rivers is a Clipper now, working with Chris Paul is his reward for having to deal with Rondo for all of these years. In his place Boston has hired college coach Brad Stevens, <a href=\"http://www.deseretnews.com/top/132/4/Butler-did-it-Top-NCAA-Tournament-moments-so-far.html\">the man most responsible for all of those \"Butler Did It\" headlines</a>. Stevens could be a fine NBA coach, but this almost certainly will be a training wheels year for him. No wonder longtime Celtics flagship WEEI <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/sports/touching_all_the_bases/2013/08/celtics_will_no_longer_air_on_weei.html\">didn't renew their contract this year</a>.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Avery Bradley</strong>. Because nothing you can say can take me away from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/mar/29/trayvon-martin-miami-heat-donald-sterling\">my guy</a>.</p><p><strong>PHILADELPHIA 76ers</strong></p><p>The Philadelphia 76ers this season are less of a NBA franchise and more of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjn1Y9YcIQM\">a basketball-centric remake of the The Producers.</a> When the Philadelphia 76ers traded their best player, Jrue Holiday for injured lottery pick Nerlens Noel it was a signal that the 76ers, having given up Andre Iguodala in exchange for zero minutes of Andrew Bynum the previous season, were no longer in the business of winning actual games. Instead, their clear priority is landing one of the top picks in what promises to be <a href=\"http://www.sheridanhoops.com/2013/10/17/nba-draft-2014-very-early-mock-lottery/\">one of the most loaded NBA Drafts in recent memory</a>.</p><p>So, the goal this season is to land the best chance of winning one of the first two slots in the draft lottery, which means losing as many game as possible, which means the likes of Evan Turner and rookie Michael Carter-Williams will be on your 76ers program guides. \"Tanking\" of course is such an ugly word for fans who want to believe that their team is at least trying to win, so let's just call it something like \"being strategically noncompetitive\". And this season, this 76ers team has a shot to be the most strategically noncompetitive team in NBA history.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Nerlens Noel</strong>. Wait, what he's going to be out the entire season, man that's gotta hurt the team's win total. (Cut to 76ers executives partying gleefully to the tune of Loverboy's \"Working For The Weekend\")</p><h2>Central Division</h2><p><strong>CHICAGO BULLS</strong></p><p>Keys to the game: Derrick Rose. Derrick Rose, Derrick Rose, Derrick Rose. The Chicago Bulls season will be entirely about the return of their former MVP from ACL injury, he injured his before it was cool. Derrick Rose <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/23355728-761/vindicated-derrick-rosesilences-critics-bulls-go-8-0-in-preseason.html\">has looked good in the preseason</a>, which is encouraging because \"seeing how players returning from injuries look\" is quite possibly the only worthwhile reason to pay attention to preseason games. If he stays healthy and productive he can return to his 2011 peak era identity as LeBron's Eastern Conference Rival.</p><p>In hindsight, the idea that the Chicago Bulls could have beaten the Miami Heat last year with Derrick Rose back at 75% seems absolutely ludicrous, the byproduct of two memorable Heat defeats (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/28/chicago-bulls-end-miami-heat-streak\">one in the regular season</a>, the other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/07/nba-playoffs-heat-bulls-spurs\">in the playoffs</a>). Still, they revealed they had the heart of a championship team. In Rose's absence, Joakim Noah developed more of a leadership role and Jimmy Butler flourished. Luol Deng should continue to be the rotation's rock if head coach Tom Thibodeau avoids overworking to the point of exhaustion and/or possible death. </p><p>Assuming that Rose's return doesn't negatively affect this newfound chemistry, and the core three (Rose, Noah, Deng) stay healthy, the Bulls should be the second best team in Eastern Conference and Miami's clearest rival. That might be too much of an \"if' though, especially considering that no one player has shown the difference that injuries can make than their former MVP.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Every internet and sports radio tough guy who called out Derrick Rose last season</strong>. You don't think Rose remembers every single time he was called a coward?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421545865'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/2/1370142964776/38560429-859b-413a-863f-e5629f14a41c-460x276.jpeg' alt='Indiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert has reason to celebrate as his team defeated the Miami Heat at home to force a Game 7 in the Eastern Conference Finals.

Photograph: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>INDIANA PACERS</strong></p><p>Last year was a breakout year for the Indiana Pacers. Although they played the Miami Heat tough in the 2012 NBA playoffs, Paul George made that all-important \"leap to the next level\" last season <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/02/heat-pacers-game-six-seven-nba-playoffs\">as his team pushed the Heat to seven games</a>. For a moment it seemed possible that Roy Hibbert, who struggled for much of the regular season, may have just figured out LeBron James.</p><p>He hadn't, of course, LeBron James isn't a math problem to be solved. Miami survived the challenge in the Eastern Conference Championship and moved on to an even closer match against the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Finals. While the Finals might have obscured what Indiana did in the series before, it shouldn't have because at this point the Pacers clearly aren't a fluke. This is a complete team, George, Hibbert, George Hill and David West play off each other as well as almost anybody in the league, maybe even the vaunted Spurs. The bad news for the Pacers is they won't be sneaking up on anybody this year, not with Paul George rapidly approaching star status around the league, and the league gets a lot more difficult once people start building expectations around you.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Danny Granger</strong>. Do the Pacers incorporate him back into the lineup when he's healthy, or does he become trade bait? There are worse problems a team could have.</p><p><strong>CLEVELAND CAVALIERS</strong></p><p>What happens when you surround one of the best young players in the game with an injured big man who never played a meaningful minute with his previous team, a sixth man whose shooting was too inconsistent even for the Golden State Warriors, a player trying to switch shooting hands mid-career and one of the most surprising number one draft picks of all time? It sounds like the Cleveland Cavaliers are taking cues from their baseball brothers in the Cleveland Indians, or at least the movie version of them in \"Major League\", but this might actually be the lineup that takes the Cavs to their first post-LeBron postseason.</p><p>After having the number one pick in the NBA Draft two out the last three years, it feels like the Cavs will finally compete for their first post-Decision playoff spot. Besides snagging Anthony Bennett in this year's draft, the Cavaliers made several seemingly shrewd moves. They signed Andrew Bynum to a short-term deal, he could flourish as the best center in the conference or he could provide nothing, think of him as a lottery ticket, high upside and low risk. They signed Jarrett Jack fresh off a productive sixth man season for the Golden State Warriors. While Tristan Thompson isn't exactly new to the team, he might as well be, he has spent the offseason <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/14/tristan-thompson-talks-switch-from-left-to-right-handed-shooter/\">switching his shooting hand from his left to his right.</a></p><p>Who's the guy in charge of keeping together this ragtag group of misfits, it's Mike Brown straight off of being fired by the Los Angeles Lakers and, before that, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Apparently ownership is hoping that reviving this off-again/on-again relationship will result in the Cavs getting stronger on the defensive end, a key thing they'll need to improve this season. The good news is that no matter what works out and what doesn't, they have a constant in Kyrie Irving, one of the best ten players in the Eastern Conference as long as he can, and this is always the caveat, stay on the court.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Andrew Bynum</strong>. Well, for starters, it would be nice if he actually plays in a NBA game at some point.</p><p><strong>DETROIT PISTONS</strong></p><p>Welcome back to the NBA Playoffs Detroit! Okay if the Pistons do make it back to the playoffs, it will be more of an indictment on the Eastern Conference than a sign that the Pistons are moving forward. Still, if you're a Detroit fan it has to be nice to see this once proud franchise actually be in competition, if only for an eighth-seed.</p><p>With the Celtics, 76ers and Bucks all looking beyond vulnerable, Detroit ownership opened up their wallets in the free agent market and... picked up Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings. <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/7/31/4574400/brandon-jennings-trade-josh-smith-pistons-fans-shooting\">That sounds like fun and games until it happens to your favorite franchise</a>. The Pistons will win more games, but that's a lot of money tied up to a volatile combination that could be amazing but could also be a complete car wreck. </p><p>Speaking of possible car wrecks: <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/2013/news/09/25/pistons-add-wallace-as-coach.ap/\">Rasheed Wallace, Player Development Coach</a>. This is internet basketball comedy writing gold, people. Just imagine Sheed telling impressionable young players the correct way to pick up technical fouls, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5L_QkUZ-3s\">imparting wisdom about basketballs and the veracity of their claims</a> and telling them how to transform their public image from being one of the league's dirtiest players to a beloved b-ball eccentric.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Andre Drummond</strong>. It's been a while since the Pistons had a young star, most experts think they have a budding one in center Andre Drummond. (<a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/andre-drummond-may-be-dating-nickelodeon-star-jennette-mccurdy-after-meeting-on-twitter-090413\">He also has the best \"meet cute\" dating story of the NBA offseason.</a>)</p><p><strong>MILWAUKEE BUCKS</strong></p><p>It's not that the Milwaukee Bucks will be absolutely terrible, in fact that's their problem. Has any other NBA franchise desperately courted mediocrity for a longer time than the Milwaukee Bucks? Last season, the Bucks once again landed in the postseason only to be quickly knocked out by a far superior team. The only memorable moment about the whole affair was when Brandon Jennings <a href=\"http://thegoodpoint.com/brandon-jennings-guarantee/\">guaranteed a victory in their opening round series against the Miami Heat</a>. To no one's surprise this didn't pan out, and the Bucks actually traded away Jennings during the offseason: it's not really helpful to try to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIxIRkiThak\">channel Joe Namath</a> when you really have more in common <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdEAwFH4I34\">with Glass Joe</a>.</p><p>Still, there are reasons to watch the Bucks unlike some of the other Eastern Conference teams that have decided they would rather court Andrew Wiggins. Most of those reasons are thanks to Larry Sanders, who established himself as one of the league's most ferocious defenders and a surprising offensive threat. They've also picked up O.J. Mayo and Caron Butler and they still have John Henson, giving them not one but two players <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwxKAwQ669g\">who share their names with talk show hosts</a> (either real or fictional). That's something right?</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>LARRY SANDERS!</strong> Has any athLete gone from \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zosx1JialxE\">pop culture joke name</a>\" to potentially a difference making All-Star this quickly?

A three-peat isn't out of the question, but this team has more question marks than it did this time last year and, keep in mind, their 2013 playoff run was more difficult than anyone expected. Dwyane Wade's knee is an issue, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/nba-durant-wade-jordan-lebron-trash-talk\">Kevin Durant may be right when he says that he might not be a top 10 player in the NBA any more</a>. Chris Bosh was underwhelming in last year's playoffs and he has quite possibly already peaked himself. Still, LeBron is the greatest player in basketball, possibly the best athlete in American sports right now, and in the NBA that will always be the biggest advantage a team could have. </p><p>This of course would be a different narrative coming into the season <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/19/san-antonio-spurs-miami-heat-nba-finals-live\">had Ray Allen not hit the greatest three-pointer in NBA Finals history</a>. Imagine if the Spurs had handed the Heat a season-ending defeat rather than going on to win game seven <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/21/miami-heat-san-antonio-spurs-finals-game-7-live\">to sew up their second straight championship</a>. Last year's playoffs remind us that the role players will always get their chance to make a difference. Last postseason the Heat got key contributions from Allen, Chris Andersen and Shane Battier. Former draft busts Greg Oden and Michael Beasley might not be locks to even make the team, but they aren't here as part of a charity program.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>LeBron James's impending free agency</strong>. You are going to be so, so sick of hearing about this. Even from this corner of the internet, we apologize in advance.</p><p><strong>ATLANTA HAWKS</strong></p><p>Al Horford is one of the best players in the league, Jeff Teague might be the best point guard that gets left off the \"best point guard\" conversation and now the Hawks have Paul Milsap, who somehow leaves Utah to a situation which is about as equally easy to overlook.</p><p>So once again the Atlanta Hawks put out a lineup that will end up being anywhere from aggressively mediocre to good-but-not-great. This appropriately enough puts the Hawks in about the same category as their compatriots in the Braves and Falcons. It's been 56 years since the Hawks won more than one playoff series which a) is ridiculous even for an Atlanta pro sports team and b) it also feels like it's been a lot longer. It also doesn't feel like this will end soon.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Lou Williams</strong>. He's still rehabbing from an ACL injury – who isn't in the NBA these days – but the guy can be a serious offensive weapon off the bench/Six Man of the Year candidate. <a href=\"http://www.peachtreehoops.com/2013/9/25/4768398/lou-williams-injury-return-date-atlanta-hawks\">The Hawks hope to have him back by December</a>.</p><p><strong>WASHINGTON WIZARDS</strong></p><p>Will this be John Wall's breakout year? The Washington Wizards hope so because they signed Wall to <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/7/31/4576108/john-wall-max-contract-extension-wizards\">a maximum extension worth $85 million during the offseason</a> with the hope that the talented young point guard would start to tap into his unused potential. Certainly the way he ended last season suggests that this could be the first fun year of Washington hoops <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/sports/2012/04/gilbert-arenas-finally-explains-why-he-pulled-out-four-guns-in-the-wizards-locker-room-in-december-2009\">since before Gilbert Arenas decided to pay tribute to the old Washington Bullets name</a>. (It would help if he were able to, you know, hit three-pointers.)<br /> <br />What about his supporting cast? As with everything in the NBA these days, it's all about health, particularly with the oft-injured Nene penciled in as the team's second option. Plus they have Emeka Okafor... <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/10/25/trade-marcin-gortat-emeka-okafor/\">what's that? Out indefinitely? And traded for Marcin Gortat? Oh uh well this is embarrassing</a>. Okay, if Nene and Gortat are actually in the lineup, and Bradley Beal expands his game in his second year in the bigs, Wall won't be doing this entirely alone.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>John Wall's ridiculous self-confidence</strong>. During this offseason, Wall <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/22999156/wizards-john-wall-believes-hes-the-best-point-guard-in-the-nba\">told reporters that he considers himself the best point guard in the league</a>. Laugh all you want, but if you're a Wizards fan that's exactly what you want to hear from your franchise star.</p><p><strong>ORLANDO MAGIC</strong></p><p>So, during the offseason, <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/9/12/4619946/orlando-magic-dwight-howard-trade-nikola-vukevic-arron-afflalo\">the Orlando Magic officially won the Dwight Howard trade</a>, and Magic fans should celebrate if only because there won't be very many more wins coming any time soon. Andrew Bynum didn't play a single game for the Philadelphia 76ers. Dwight Howard played most of the year of the Lakers, although some fans wished that weren't the case, almost certainly deliberately fouled out of his final game with the Lakers and then moved on to Houston. While Andre Iguodala ended up providing the most value to the Denver Nuggets, he opted out of his contract during the offseason to sign with the Golden State Warriors. That leaves Orlando as the only franchise to still have anything of any real value leftover (Aaron Affalo, Nikola Vucevic, Maurice Harkless) from the biggest trade of last year's offseason.</p><p>They also maybe have the most interesting player that came out of this year's draft in Victor Oladipo, whose preseason performance suggests that he may be one of those rare rookies capable of immediately doing some major offensive damage in his first year. But yeah, Orlando still needs a few more pieces to be a contending team, even in the Eastern Conference, so look for them to be fighting for lottery position with the 76ers and Suns this season.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis</strong>. Wait, he's still with Orlando right?</p><p><strong>CHARLOTTE BOBCATS</strong></p><p>The big news of the offseason? The Charlotte Bobcats have signed a big name free agent! Okay, so Al Jefferson isn't the biggest name available but the former Celtics prospect turned Utah Jazz semi-star is a name that casual NBA fans MAY actually recognize. That's rare for a Bobcats player, unless we're talking about \"recognizing as a punchline in a joke\". (In some circles, you can get laughs just by saying \"Adam Morrison\".)</p><p>Since changing one's team name is the hip things to do these days, unless you're Daniel Snyder, <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/the-charlotte-hornets-are-coming-back-824093267\">Charlotte is in line to reclaim the \"Hornets\" nickname next season</a> from the newly renamed New Orleans Pelicans. This works best for all sides, as the Hornets were meant to be a Charlotte team from the very beginning. It's always nice when an area has a nickname that really fits the surrounding area, your move next Utah.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Hornets mojo</strong>! It's not quite an exorcism, but a name change is as good a start as any at resetting this woeful NBA team.</p><h2>WESTERN CONFERENCE</h2><h2>Southwest Division</h2><p><strong>HOUSTON ROCKETS</strong></p><p>The Houston Rockets made a huge splash during the offseason when they convinced Dwight Howard to leave what was an increasingly bad – think Alex Rodriguez in New York bad – situation with the Los Angeles Lakers. While Howard should be healthier and more comfortable in Houston than he was in L.A., this is still Dwight Howard, a man as temperamental as he is talented. The Rockets look pretty dangerous now that James Harden, with a breakthrough year under his belt, is teamed up with the best center in the league, but will the two be able to play together?</p><p>After being relegated to Sixth Man duties with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Harden seemed absolutely liberated in his first full year with Houston. Will Harden be willing to return to more of a supporting role if Dwight Howard plays like his old Hall of Fame self? Will Omer Asik, whose skill set overlaps with Howard, demand a trade, and what could Houston get from him? The Houston Rockets already made the leap last season when Harden emerged as a MVP-caliber player, but Howard has a knack of solving some problems while creating others and the Western Conference is only getting tougher. The Rockets made the biggest and best move of the offseason, yes, but that doesn't guarantee that they will be anything but a tough out in the playoffs.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Jeremy Lin</strong>. Still a thing, although that thing may not end up being \"starting point guard in the NBA\".</p><p><strong>SAN ANTONIO SPURS</strong></p><p>Did Ray Allen kill the Spurs dynasty with his dagger three in Game Six of the NBA finals? Did the Heat shut down the Gregg Popovich/Tim Duncan Spurs' last real chance at winning another title by coming back in game six and winning it all in game seven? Let's go with \"probably not, because the Spurs never die\".</p><p>No one expected the 2012 team to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/02/boston-celtics-miami-heat-deshawn-stevenson-atm\">keep a winning streak alive until halfway through the Western Conference Finals</a>. No one expected the Spurs to make the NBA Finals, let alone be thirty seconds away from eliminating the Heat in a game six. Manu Ginobili may have had a rough postseason, but Kawhi Leonard put himself a half-step away from superstardom in this latest Spurs playoffs run. Tony Parker: Still a Top Five MVP voting threat. Tim Duncan: Still not making us believe he's anything other than a cyborg. Danny Green: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/12/danny-green-gary-neal-spurs-heat-3-point-record\">The dude can hit three-pointers</a>, just a little. Gregg Popovich: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ2W3wqNdHs\">Still awesomely curmudgeonly</a>. </p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Manu Ginobili</strong>. Will the Spurs actually have to deal with the consequences of aging to one of their key players this season? Nah, a New York team will probably just trade for him and give him a five year extension for no reason.</p><p><strong>MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES</strong></p><p>Congrats to Memphis for finally becoming interesting. Just one year ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/30/nba-2012-2013-season-preview\">thIS writer was resorting to Chuck Berry parodies</a> in lieu of saying anything about Zach Randolph, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. Then, of course, the club hired <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5980649/adrian-wojnarowskis-latest-column-features-a-sick-burn-on-john-hollinger\">some former cable sports employee </a>and did the number one thing designed to get more people talking about them: They traded away their best known player to Canada and then got better.</p><p>Can they make the Western Conference Finals again? That might be too much to ask for, although it would be great to see another Clippers/Grizzlies series in the playoffs. They have formed a true, natural rivalry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/26/clippers-grizzlies-best-action-playoffs\">that is quickly becoming one of the most interesting in the NBA</a>. Wherever Memphis goes, they will have to make it there without head coach Lionel Hollins, one of the most surprising victims of \"First thing we get rid of the head coaches\" uprising in the NBA this offseason. If the Grizzlies regress under the watch of new coach Dave Joerger, expect that move to be second-guessed, but this organization clearly doesn't mind risking their fanbase.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Tony Allen's Twitter account</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2013/2/17/3999480/tony-allen-twitter-nba-all-star-2013\">It's the best</a>.</p><p><strong>NEW ORLEANS PELICANS</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/69527/whats-in-a-name-why-the-pelicans-should-be-known-as-the-pellies\"><br />No we are not calling them the Pellies.</a></p><p>Say goodbye to the New Orleans Hornets. Despite the initial mocking, New Orleans have stuck with their decision to rename the team after Louisiana's state bird. Back when the Tampa Bay Devil Rays changed their name to the Tampa Bay Rays, all they did was make it to the World Series after not having a winning record before then. Can the New Or-</p><p>No. No they can't. The Western Conference is too darn stacked for them to have any hope of a Finals appearance, but will they be competitive this year? Absolutely. Certainly management thinks they will be, why else would they make a move to trade for Philadelphia's Jrue Holiday? Watch for Anthony Davis and his Unibrow to unleash a statement game or two against tough competition this season, and for Eric Gordon to quietly put up some nice numbers, just keep the expectations low. At least this year.<br /> <br /><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Austin Rivers</strong>: The goal is to improve on <a href=\"http://www.bourbonstreetshots.com/2013/04/24/season-in-review-austin-rivers/\">one of the worst NBA seasons anyone has ever had</a>.

Well, if nothing else this offseason, Mavericks fans have at least got to hear owner Mark Cuban's side of the story. After the Mavericks once again failed to rope a big name free agent to join along with Nowitzki in Dallas, this time it was that Dwight Howard fellow that everyone was coveting, Cuban <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/08/04/mark-cuban-dallas-mavericks-tanking/\">took to the internet to explain what the Mavs were trying to do and how they, well, failed</a>.</p><p>Is there hope? Let's hear it from their big free agent acquisition Monta Ellis <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/24/dallas-monta-ellis-says-he-is-passing-too-much/\">about his new role as the number two guy in the Mavs offense</a>: \"I'm looking for the pass too much\". Of course you are Monta. (Writer pencils them in for a 0% chance at making the postseason.) Oh and Ellis, <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-mavericks/headlines/20131011-new-stat-shows-mavs-monta-ellis-to-be-nba-s-worst-shooter-jose-calderon-league-s-best-from-outside.ece\">by at least one statistical measure the worst shooter in the NBA</a>, <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/01/monta-ellis-on-bad-shots-im-gonna-play-monta-ball/\">also is adamant that he is gong to play \"Monta-ball\"</a>. (Writer grabs pen, writes prediction that Dallas misses the playoffs again, this time in ink.)</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Shark Tank</strong>. Would owner Mark Cuban do some crazy, conference-shattering move <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E_TPgKMp-g\">just to promote his TV show</a>? Would you put it past him?</p><h2>Northwest Division</h2><p><strong>OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER</strong></p><p>It's been a tough twelve months for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Once thought to be the next dynasty of the Western Conference, the successor to the Lakers and Spurs, the Thunder instead traded James Harden to the Houston Rockets for a bunch of mostly departed spare parts, lost Russell Westbrook to injury in the middle of the playoffs and watched as Serge Ibaka did his best Sue Storm impression and turned invisible throughout the remainder of the postseason. </p><p>In other words, until Westbrook returns and is at something close to 100% this will be the Kevin Durant show, and you know what: The Kevin Durant Show is going to be awesome. We saw how Durant tried to put his entire team on his back after Westbrook went down in their series against the Rockets, it wasn't enough for a return trip to the Western Conference Finals but there's something incredibly fun about watching a guy as talented as Durant do everything. However, the team is going to need Russell Westbrook completely healthy and in full \"Beast Mode\" to reach their ultimate goal.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Kendrick Perkins</strong>. It's really remarkable to see how far Kendrick Perkins has gone without being amnestied: he's like the Inspector Clouseau of the bellow-average centers.</p><p><strong>DENVER NUGGETS</strong></p><p>What a weird year for George Karl, he received the Coach of the Year award and a pink slip from his bosses within the span of about a month. It has been a rough year for a Denver Nuggets team once again dealing with the aftereffects of an early playoff loss. Although the Nuggets got the best year out of Andre Iguodala that any team involved in the Dwight Howard Mega-Deal got out of any player, they weren't able to convince him to stay: Iguodala left for the Warriors at the end of the season. Injured Danilo Gallinari won't be back for the first few weeks of the season. </p><p>So, this is a franchise that has taken a step back. The main reason to follow the Nuggets is Kenneth Faried, which makes it bad news for Denver fans if <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9860683/32-bold-predictions-2013-14-nba-season\">Zach Lowe's prediction is right and he gets traded</a>. The second best reason to follow the Nuggets is JaVale McGee, who is also one of the major reasons not to pin one's hope and dreams on the Nuggets. </p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>JaVale McGee</strong>. The Human Lowlight Reel might just be <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lbB0M7dYPg\">the X-Factor of the entire league</a>.</p><p><strong>MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES</strong></p><p>The Minnesota Timberwolves of the last few years have gifted us <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAxARJyaTEA\">the basketball version of Burgess Meredith's glasses</a>. They look like they'll be the most fun team in basketball, and we'll have all the time in the world, but then Kevin Love and Ricky Rubio shatter into pieces during the regular season and it's just not fair... not fair at all. If you're a NBA fan, just pray to your preferred deity that we will have time enough to enjoy them at last.</p><p>Well, sometimes franchises make their own luck, and, for the most part at least, <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/david-kahn-ends-minnesota-timberwolves-career-blaze-excuse-173816338.html\">former GM David Kahn has been targeted as the T-Wolves' cooler</a>. Now that he's gone, Minnesota fans will have no one to blame for the things that will inevitably go wrong for them. Okay, other than when Kevin Love leaves because Kahn didn't want to offer him a maximum extension, that will totally be on him. </p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Kevin Love's health</strong>. And isn't it always for this team? </p><p><strong>UTAH JAZZ</strong></p><p>There will be no more slipping into the Western Conference playoffs via the seventh or eighth seed for the Utah Jazz. There are just too many strong teams, and it's not like the Jazz teams of the last few years was ever designed to do much damage in the postseason.</p><p>The Jazz could afford to let Al Jefferson and Paul Milsap go because they have a lot of young talent in the metaphorical pipeline. Plus, it's not like Jefferson and Milsap were LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, not exactly irreplaceable cogs of a legit title contender. It's safe to say that one or two of the Jazz's young players will perform well enough to get a decent sized feature in Sports Illustrated and maybe an All-Star Game appearance, but don't expect this year to be the one where you'll find many Jazz games on national television.</p><p>Unless of course, the Jazz make the playoffs and are interesting enough that the NBA won't be forced to hide them on NBA TV (unofficial home of every Atlanta Hawks playoff game). The trouble with that is, well, their competition in the West has become far more, well, competitive. Their best chance at finding themselves as high as the sixth seed in the postseason lies in a Conference shakeup. Salt Lake City is Eastern enough, right?</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Derrick Favors</strong>. Somebody's going to have to step up without Jefferson and Milsap and he's the most likely candidate.</p><p><strong>PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS</strong></p><p>Congrats Portand, you've become this year's Hardest Team To Say Anything Interesting About.

Don't laugh, it's more likely than you think. The San Antonio Spurs will have to start playing like they're older at some point, right? The Oklahoma City Thunder will most likely have to rely too much on their superstar Kevin Durant, while, conversely, that's exactly what their arch-enemies, the Memphis Grizzlies, lack. The Houston Rockets improved by picking up Dwight Howard, but that also means that they now have to deal with Dwight Howard. Ask the Los Angeles Lakers about the difference between Dwight Howard on paper and Dwight Howard in the locker room.</p><p>With the Clippers getting a huge upgrade at the coaching level by replacing Vinny del Negro with Doc Rivers, and adding a three-point threat with the signing of J.J. Redick, it's beyond time for the Clippers to finally go deep into the playoffs. The team most likely to block their way in the NBA Finals could very well be the Golden State Warriors, whose short-term success is wrapped up in the precarious health of Steph Curry and Andrew Bogut. Hey, worst case scenario they are still essentially guaranteed to be the best basketball team in Los Angeles for the second year in a row, that's not something Clippers fans will take for granted.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Blake Griffin</strong>.

While their surprising run to the Western Conference Finals, which included the two best NBA Playoff games that didn't involve a Ray Allen three at the buzzer, back-to-back, looked to have finally taken that jump from Fun Offensive Team to serious contender. However, with transcendent shooting guard Steph Curry's recurring ankle issues and center Andrew Bogut's recurring everything issues, they are not guaranteed to go that deep again. </p><p>What the Warriors need is health and a bit more emotional intelligence: Great teams need to learn how to close out games something which <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPAEj7U02B0\">they failed spectacularly at last season</a>. This is why one of the best moves any team made during the offseason was when Golden State let often great but sometimes inconsistent sixth man Jarrett Jack go to Cleveland while stealing Andre Iguodala away from the Denver Nuggets. Plus they still have Klay Thompson, David Lee, Harrison Barnes. Man, this team is going to be fun to watch. If healthy.</p><p><strong>X-Factor</strong>: <strong>Steph Curry's ankle</strong>.

        "headline":"Miami Heat vs San Antonio Spurs: everything you need to know",
        "body":"<p>It has taken 82 regular-season games and three postseason rounds, but finally the NBA field has narrowed down to two teams. On Monday night, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/04/miami-heat-nba-finals-blowout-pacers\">the Miami Heat defeated the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals</a>, punching their ticket to their third straight NBA finals. On Thursday night, the Heat will face the well-rested, Western Conference-winning San Antonio Spurs for the NBA championship. So, who are these two teams, how did they get here and how do they stack up against one another? </p><p>Well, this quick-ish reference guide will tell you everything you need to know about the Heat and the Spurs – and also, probably, a lot of other things that you could quite honestly do without.</p><h2>MIAMI HEAT</h2><h2>Who they are</h2><p>The entire state of the NBA changed in the summer of 2010. Free agent LeBron James, a Cleveland Cavaliers superstar well on his way towards establishing himself the best player in the game, went on national television to announce that he was signing with the Miami Heat. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTeCc8jy7FI\">The Decision</a>, as the ESPN program was called, created a NBA superteam of sorts as James \"took his talents to South Beach\" to join hometown hero Dwyane Wade and the Toronto Raptors All-Star Chris Bosh. </p><p>The public reaction was swift and almost entirely negative – James was seen as someone who had betrayed his home state (he is an Akron native) to team up with superstars, because he couldn't win a championship on his own. It didn't help matters when the city of Miami threw a victory parade, minus the whole victory part of the equation, to celebrate their basketball team landing the biggest free agent in NBA history. James somehow managed to make things even worse in the by proclaiming that the newly formed Heat would <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT-I8jQDQ7c\">win at least eight championships</a>, or when they tragically attempted to coin the phrase \"the Heatles\" (no this is not one of my jokes, <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/01/04/heat-players-nickname-themselves-the-heatles/\">this is a real phrase they attempted to coin</a>). In the matter of a few days, James and the Heat established themselves as the newest villains in the NBA.</p><p>It was enough to make fans forget that the Heat actually had a long history well before James made his Decision. Well, OK, it's not an incredibly long one, considering that the Heat, like so many Florida sports franchises, were the product of possibly overambitious league expansion, forming in 1988. Unlike <a href=\"http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=tb\">other expansion teams in Florida</a>, though, the Heat have formed a bit of history. Since most of the early stuff involves dreadfully dull postseason series with the New York Knicks, let's skip ahead to 2003, when the franchise drafted a talented young shooting guard called Dwyane Wade. After he emerged as a star that first year, the Heat traded for the Lakers center and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AVaOl5vrx0\">part-time rapping genie</a> Shaquille O'Neal. With Wade and Shaq as their core, the Heat spent several years as one of the most talented teams in the Eastern Conference, eventually winning its first championship in 2006. After that championship, the Heat decided to keep a lineup full of aging former All-Stars mostly intact, apparently forgetting either how the aging process affects players or the fact that time is linear. By 2010, Shaq was gone, head coach Pat Riley had handed his responsibilities to his assistant, Erik Spoelstra, and it looked likely that Wade would leave for a more talented team.</p><p>Instead, Wade lobbied for the talent to come to him. First he announced he was re-signing with the Heat and that he had convinced Chris Bosh to come along. A month later came The Decision, and suddenly the Heat had transformed into the Team American Loved To Hate – and wow, were they ever so much fun to hate. When <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2011/jun/13/miami-heat-dallas-mavericks-nowitzki\">Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Heat in the 2011 NBA Finals</a>, a series where James made a habit of disappearing in the fourth quarter, it somehow felt like an underdog victory (because nothing screams \"true underdogs\" like a Dallas-based team <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban\">bankrolled by a billionaire mogul</a>).</p><p>That loss might have been the best thing to happen to the Heat, as James elevated his game the following year. In 2012's playoffs he played the best basketball of his, or any NBA player's, career <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/08/lebron-james-good-job-good-effort\">in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals, against the Boston Celtics</a>. The Heat went on to only lose one more game, Game One of the finals, against the Oklahoma City Thunder, on their way to a second championship. LeBron finally had his ring.</p><h2>How they got there</h2><p>How did the Heat get to their third straight NBA Finals? Oh no big deal, just being the best team in basketball for most of the year. After clinching the best record in the NBA during the regular season, a stint that included a 27-game win streak (good for second all-time in NBA history) the Heat were awarded the No 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. This gave them an opening series against the eighth-seeded Milwaukee Bucks, who basically only made it to the postseason because the rules required eight teams from each conference. (The Heat also will have home court advantage in the finals, meaning the first two games, the sixth game and a potential Game Seven will all be at their American Airlines Arena.)</p><p>Surprising nobody, the Heat swept the Bucks in four, moving on to face the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls were supposed to be Heat-killers, but were playing without point guard Derrick Rose, who was still recovering from an ACL injury suffered in last year's playoffs. When the Bulls caught the Heat by surprise in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/07/nba-playoffs-heat-bulls-spurs\">an extremely physical Game 1 and pulled off an unexpected victory</a>, it looked like the potential start of an unexpectedly great series. James and the Heat <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/09/miami-heat-nba-playoffs-chicago-bulls-game-2\">quickly put an end to the tomfoolery with a blowout Game 2 win</a>, and proceeded to win the next three games to advance to the Eastern Conference finals, to face the Indiana Pacers.</p><p>The Eastern Conference finals turned out to be more competitive than most expected. The Pacers benefited from breakthrough performances by center Roy Hibbert and Paul \"John Ringo\" George, while taking advantage of subpar play from Wade and Bosh, who were both playing through injuries. The Pacers were able to counter every Heat victory with a win of their own, pushing the finals to a Game 7. The good news is that after James basically kept his team alive for most of the series, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/04/indiana-pacers-miami-heat-game-7-live\">he finally received help from Wade and other teammates in a Game 7 victory on Monday night</a>. The bad news is that because of their protracted, physical battle with the Pacers, this banged-up Heat team only earned a few days to prepare for Thursday night's Game 1 of the NBA Finals, while the Spurs ran out of game tape to study in preparation so long ago that they have had time to catch up on the Game of Thrones episodes remaining on their DVR.</p><h2>Probable starters</h2><p><strong>LeBron James</strong>, power forward: What's there to say? Holy cow, what isn't there to say? He's been the league MVP for two years in a row, he's the reigning NBA finals MVP, he led Team USA to a gold medal in last summer's Olympics, he's on this year's All-Defense first team, oh and there's that <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/magazine/sportsman/12/02/lebron-james-2012-sportsman/index.html\">Sports Illustrated's sportsman of the year thing</a> … OK, you get the idea, there's a lot of compelling evidence out there that suggests that the dude knows how to play basketball. If Tim Duncan is arguably the best player of his generation, it seems almost certain that James will be recognized as the best player of his. The Spurs most likely will just accept that James will be good for around 30 points a game, and focus on stopping his more mortal teammates, starting with …</p><p><strong>Dwyane Wade</strong>, shooting guard: Before LeBron's arrival, Wade was the man in Miami, even earning some Michael Jordan comparisons as he led the Heat to their first championship, in 2006. Since The Decision, injuries have taken their toll, establishing him as the clear sidekick in his partnership with James. He's still a pesky and dangerous playmaker, although his effectiveness of late has been sapped by a knee injury that the Spurs certainly will exploit.</p><p>Since The Decision, Wade has also taken what in the pro-wrestling world would be called \"a heel turn\". Wade's reputation has changed from likable young superstar to <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/general/blog/gregg-doyel/22311531/way-of-wade-flopping-dirty-plays-for-the-win\">being considered one of the dirtiest players in the league</a>. The moral: never trust a guy who doesn't know how to spell his own first name.</p><p><strong>Chris Bosh</strong>, center: Miami's canary in the coalmine. You can tell how well the Heat are doing just by checking his numbers in games where all of the Big Three are playing. If Bosh is ineffective, the Heat are simply a very good team. If Bosh is racking up his fair share of points and rebounds, the Heat are an unstoppable offensive juggernaut. Bosh is routinely picked on for being an unconventional NBA big man – he's more tall than he is imposing – and for having the least impressive resume of the Big Three. Ignore the criticism and the played out, (<a href=\"http://www.slamonline.com/online/nba/2009/03/shaqs-nickname-for-chris-bosh-rupaul/\">often transphobic</a>) jokes: there's a reason the Heat ran into trouble when Bosh was out with an abdominal injury in the 2012 playoffs. but became nearly unbeatable when he made his way back into the lineup. The Heat have to hope that <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/5/29/4375446/chris-bosh-injury-heat-pacers-nba-playoffs-2013\">his ankle issue doesn't become a huge factor</a> in this series.</p><p>And then there's this:</p><p><em></em></p><p><strong>Mario Chalmers</strong>, point guard: The Heat list Chalmers as the point guard, but that doesn't really cover it. His true position is being <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304898704577478900746815584.html\">the Most Yelled At Person In Basketball</a>. It's both a blessing and a curse to be in the starting lineup with three possible Hall of Famers all begging to get the ball from you.</p><p><strong>Udonis Haslem</strong>, power forward: Along with Wade, Haslem is the last remaining member of the 2006 championship team. He has had a resurgence in the Eastern Conference finals, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/27/dwyane-wade-udonis-haslem-heat-pacers\">coming up with hist two best postseason games since those heady days of '06</a>. Don't expect him to score in the double-digits again during the NBA finals, especially since that would probably mean that one or more of James, Wade or Bosh wasn't being healthy or productive.</p><h2>Bench players</h2><p><strong>Ray Allen</strong> (shooting guard); <strong>Chris Andersen</strong> (power forward); <strong>Joel Anthony</strong> (center); <strong>Shane Battier</strong> (small forward); <strong>Norris Cole</strong> (point guard); <strong>Juwan Howard</strong> (power forward); <strong>James Jones</strong> (shooting guard); <strong>Rashard Lewis</strong> (power forward); <strong>Mike Miller</strong> (shooting guard); <strong>Jarvis Varnado</strong> (power forward)</p><p><strong>Key guys</strong>: Hall of Fame-bound <strong>Ray Allen</strong> was supposed to be the big free agent signing for the Heat over the summer, but the guard (and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNJtcD-vaK4\">much better actor than Shaq</a>) who owns the title for most three-pointers in NBA history has gone through an extended cold streak in the postseason. Miami have to hope that his productive first-half performance in Game 7 against the Pacers is a sign of things to come. </p><p>Despite the fact that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/23/lebron-james-chris-birdman-andersen-miami-heat\">his tattoos, mohawks and on-court demeanor make him look like at best a sideshow geek and at worst a particularly irredeemable inmate on Oz</a>, <strong>Chris \"Birdman\" Andersen</strong> has actually been the Heat's most valuable bench player, contributing big on defense and making all of his shots during the Eastern Conference finals. Unless they want to see more of <strong>Joel Anthony</strong>, the Heat have to hope that he's learned something from his Game 6 suspension for shoving Tyler Hansbrough. (Spoiler alert: He hasn't.)</p><p><strong>Shane Battier</strong> and <strong>Mike Miller</strong> were the key bench guys in last year's NBA finals – their three-point shooting was a big part of why the Heat were able to take out the Thunder in just five games. Second-year standout <strong>Norris Cole</strong> has hit some big shots over the course of the season – the Heat just have to <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/flo-ridas-manager-was-ejected-from-game-in-miami-511163837\">keep him away from rapper Flo Rida's manager</a>. <strong>Juwan Howard</strong> is apparently not retired. Who knew?</p><p><em></em></p><h2>Head coach </h2><p><strong>Erik Spoelstra</strong>: In the NBA, there's a very thin line between being a coach of the year candidate and being unemployed – just ask Spoelstra. Although he has been the Heat's head coach since 2008, his job seemed in jeopardy when the LeBron-led team failed to live up to expectations. Following the finals loss in 2011 and bumps in the road in the 2012 playoffs, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK61-XZWwHc\">most notably his on-court tussling with Wade</a>, there was talk that Spoelstra was too young and inexperienced to get the most out of his star-packed lineup. The speculation was that team vice president Pat Riley would step back in and relieve Spoelstra of his duties as head coach (as he did with Stan Van Gundy during their championship run of 2005-06).</p><p>Instead the 2012 Heat won it all, giving Spoelstra enough cache to experiment in 2013. Realizing the kind of talent he had to work with, Spoelstra's starting lineups were more suggestions to his players than definitive roles. Most notably, he's been playing James in positions other than his \"natural\" role as a small forward, creating nightmarish defensive matchups for other teams. In other words, no matter how these NBA finals go, Spoelstra won't have to be constantly looking back at Riley, at least not unless <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/articles/pat-riley-glares-at-1988-bottle-of-hair-gel-as-he,18582/\">he needs any hairstyling tips</a>.</p><h2>SAN ANTONIO SPURS</h2><h2>Who are they?</h2><p>The Spurs might just be the most successful NBA franchise of the 21st century, having appeared in four NBA finals since 1999 and having won four NBA finals since 1999 – a decent enough track record. They have made the playoffs every year since drafting power forward Tim Duncan, benefiting from the fact that the core group of Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili have played their entire NBA careers with the franchise. Despite all this, <a href=\"http://theshadowleague.com/articles/nobody-checks-for-the-spurs-because-they-ve-made-it-that-way\">they have been saddled with a reputation for being \"boring\"</a>. Of course, fans of most basketball teams could only wish that their teams were this level of \"boring\".</p><p>The Spurs have been around in some form since 1967, when they started as the Dallas Chaparrals in the American Basketball Association (think <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJVF7fWZRMg\">Will Ferrell in \"Semi-Pro\"</a>, if you're among the six or seven people who have seen that movie). In 1973, the franchise moved to San Antonio and became the Spurs, presumably because executives were tired of trying to explain what the heck a Chaparral was.* The Spurs joined the NBA in 1976, when the ABA merged in.</p><p>The Spurs' modern history doesn't begin until the 1996-97 season, when they were so terrible, almost certainly on purpose, they were able to secure the top pick in the 1997 draft, which they used on Wake Forest power forward Tim Duncan. The Spurs <a href=\"http://www.warriorsworld.net/2013/05/29/the-mirror-effect-warriors-and-spurs/\">built around Duncan over the next year</a>, being especially successful in the international market, drafting France's Parker and Argentina's Ginobili. They have gone on to win the NBA finals in 1999, 2003, 2005 and 2007, which has been enough to at least discuss \"dynasty\" talk (which is a big important word among people paid talk about sports, for some reason – see also \"elite quarterback\" and \"ace pitcher\"). The keys to the Spurs' success have been consistency, unselfish play and a strong emphasis on basketball fundamentals. OK, when put that way, this actually does sound a little boring, but it's the kind of boring that wins championships.</p><p>* <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparrals\">According to Wikipedia</a> a chaparral is \"a shrubland or heathland plant community found primarily in the US state of California and in the northern portion of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico\". Yeah, this just screams basketball, doesn't it? No wonder the ABA didn't last.</p><h2>How they got there</h2><p>The Spurs weren't talked about as favorites in the Western Conference at the start of the season, despite the fact that the previous year they went on a 20-game winning streak from <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0803/nba.longest.winning.streaks/content.3.html\">the end of the regular season to Game 2 of the Western Conference finals</a>. The West seemed wide open: Kevin Durant and the Thunder were reigning conference champions, the Lakers had improved by managing a trade for superstar center Dwight Howard, and the Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies looked like much improved ballclubs. Meanwhile, the Spurs looked to be just another year older.</p><p>The Spurs being the Spurs, all they did was win games, staying on top of the standings most of the year. In fact, the only reason the Thunder ended up having the best record in the Western Conference by season's end was that Parker and Ginobili missed time due to injuries in the last two months of the season. The Spurs settled for second place, which ended up being a blessing in disguise as they faced the seventh-seeded Lakers rather than the eighth-seeded Houston Rockets. The Lakers were the perfect first-round opponent, suffering from both the loss of their best player, Kobe Bryant, and from the presence of Howard, whose first year in LA ended up a complete disaster. The Spurs swept the Lakers in four games.</p><p>The only real challenge to the Spurs during the postseason were the Golden State Warriors, in the second round. The much younger Warriors looked like they had a chance to pull out a win, mostly because Golden State's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo2X9XdInbo\">Steph Curry would go on stretches</a> where it seemed like he was playing a game called \"Let's Find A Place On The Court Where I Won't Make This Shot\" … and losing badly. Despite looking shaky in the first two home games of the series, the Spurs' experience won out over the Warriors' younger roster and San Antonio clinched the series in Game 6.</p><p>The Spurs moved on to the Western Conference finals, facing the Memphis Grizzlies, who had done them a favor by knocking off Kevin Durant, the second best player in the NBA, and the Thunder (a task made easier after point guard Russell Westbrook suffered a season-ending injury the round before). The Spurs and Grizzlies looked like an even match on paper – and the Spurs swept for the second time in three postseasons series. That was on 27 May, which means that in the last week and a half you and I have played exactly as many seconds in an official NBA game as anyone on the Spurs roster. </p><h2>Probable starters</h2><p><strong>Tim Duncan</strong>, power forward: What's there to say? No seriously, what is there to say? Duncan is one of the greatest players in NBA history, perhaps the best power forward of all time. He has been the most important player in one of the most successful teams, and is a major reason why these Spurs have won four championships and are four games away from winning No 5. Perhaps only Kobe Bryant rivals him as the best player of his generation, although they have come to represent the exact opposite types of players. While Bryant has gotten the label of being selfish, concerned more with his own statistics and accomplishments, Duncan has been regarded as the epitome of a team player. If Duncan doesn't get nearly as much media attention as Bryant, well, he also doesn't get nearly as much criticism. </p><p>OK, well he still gets tagged with the \"boring\" label, but even that piece of criticism is a bit of a backhanded compliment. Duncan is so good that he makes basketball not only seem easy, but downright boring. Duncan's nickname, the Big Fundamental, reflects the fact that his lengthy resume of winning seasons, championships, and All-Star appearances isn't built on moments of flashy brilliance but rather his well-rounded game and remarkable consistency. </p><p><strong>Tony Parker</strong>, point guard: Although these Spurs are still Duncan's team, Parker – born in Belgium but raised in France – has emerged as the Spurs' best player in recent years, partly because the 31-year-old point guard is reaching his peak as Duncan and Ginobili ease into elder-statesmen roles. Parker, who was drafted in 2001, has always been a great point guard, but in recent years he has grown as a scorer. The last time he was in action he was scoring 37 points in a successful attempt to end the Grizzlies' season.</p><p>Parker also more than makes up for his other teammates' off-the-court anonymity. Most notably, he was married to the Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria for several years, putting him in the tabloid spotlight until their divorce in late 2010. (Parker reportedly was cheating on her with the wife of one of his teammates, a detail that has done little to change American stereotypes about the French – or about basketball players, for that matter.) More recently, Parker made the headlines for the wrong reasons again when his Olympics run with France was put in jeopardy after he suffered an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/post/tony-parker-sues-nightclub-over-injury-from-drake-chris-brown-fight/2012/06/22/gJQA6cSIvV_blog.html\">eye injury in a New York nightclub, when the entourages of Chris Brown and Drake got in a fight over Rihanna</a>. The moral, as always, is that Chris Brown ruins everything.</p><p><strong>Tiago Splitter</strong>, center: The Brazilian, despite having a name that sounds like an ill-fated secondary pitch made up by a struggling pitcher, bounced around Brazil and Spain before making his debut with the Spurs in 2011. The big man has developed into the Spurs' center, starting 58 games during the regular season.</p><p><strong>Kawhi Leonard</strong>, small forward: Acquired in a trade that sent George Hill to the Pacers, a trade neither team currently regrets, Leonard has been a breakthrough player for the Spurs this season. His defense was a big reason that the Grizzlies' offense was often stymied during the conference finals, so much so that he would probably be a person of interest if basketball investigators looked into the mysterious May disappearance of Grizzles forward Zach Randolph.</p><p><strong>Danny Green</strong>, shooting guard: Measure once, cut twice? It took a long time for Green to stick in the majors. He was cut twice, first by the Cavaliers and then by the Spurs, before the latter gave him a second chance. In 2011-12, Green began to start more often, as the Spurs wanted to have Ginobili back in his preferred role of sixth man off the bench. By outlasting Jeff Green (Boston Celtics), Gerald Green (Indiana Pacers) and Draymond Green (Golden State Warriors), Danny has established himself as the most dangerous Green left in theplayoffs. </p><p><strong>Manu Ginobili</strong>, shooting guard: The greatest basketball player to come out of Argentina – he lead his country to a gold medal in the 2004 Olympics – Ginobili is technically not a starter, but he is second only to Duncan and Parker in terms of importance. As the sixth man, off the bench, he's one of San Antonio's biggest offensive weapons even if the 35-year-old isn't quite as reliable a shooter as he once was. He's also the player the Spurs trust the most when they have a chance to tie or win the game with a bucket. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOrIAJKpQKI\">The three-pointer Ginobili made in double overtime against the Warriors in Game 1 of theirsemifinals series</a> might very well be the biggest shot of the season so far for San Antonio.<br /><a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/05/manu-ginobilis-bald-spot-through-the-years/\"><br />Plus, his bald spot is epic.</a></p><h2>Bench players</h2><p><strong>Aron Baynes</strong> (power forward); <strong>Matt Bonner</strong> (power forward); <strong>Nando de Colo</strong> (point guard); <strong>Boris Diaw </strong>(center); <strong>Gary Neal</strong> (point guard); <strong>Cory Joseph</strong> (point guard); <strong>Dejuan Blair</strong> (center); <strong>Tracy McGrady</strong> (shooting guard); <strong>Patty Mills</strong> (point guard)</p><p>There is an argument to be made – a bad argument but an argument nonetheless, that <strong>Matt Bonner</strong> was actually <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/62659/the-bonner-effect-how-shutting-down-the-spurs-shooter-could-be-the-key-for-the-grizzlies\">one of the biggest factors in the Spurs' sweep of the Grizzlies</a>. The \"Red Mamba\" provided some on-court highlights, while his Coach B clips on YouTube have provided much needed levity and something this writer likes to link to for the flimsiest of reasons:</p><p><strong>Key guys</strong>: Beyond <strong>Boris Diaw</strong>, who splits time as the Spur's big man with Tiago Splitter, the non-Ginobili/Bonner parts of the bench have been relatively quiet during the playoffs. If a game gets out of reach, always a possibility when a team is playing the Heat, <strong>Tracy McGrady,</strong> the former Houston superstar the Spurs rescued from China, shares duties with Australia's <strong>Patty Mills</strong> as either the Human Victory Cigar/Human White Flag, depending on whether the Spurs are winning big or losing big.</p><h2>Head coach </h2><p><strong>Gregg Popovich</strong>: Popovich has been head coach of the Spurs since 1996, when he committed one of the all-time greatest tanking jobs in sports history, accidentally-on-purpose guiding them to a 20-62 regular season, to put them in <a href=\"http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Draft#How_the_draft_works\">the best possible position to pick up Tim Duncan in the draft</a>. Popovich has not suffered through a losing season since snaring Duncan, he's coached the Spurs into the playoffs on an annual basis and he has been a key part of the team's four championships. He's been awarded coach of the year in 2003 and 2012, and probably deserves more.</p><p>This success –he is the longest-tenured coach in the NBA – has allowed Popovich a lot of leeway. At this point, time and success has made his curmudgeonly persona almost lovable, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4QpIVibbGc\">with his curt, cranky in-game interviews with sideline reporters bordering on comedic performance art</a>. He has even grown powerful enough to thumb his nose at NBA commissioner David Stern. When the NBA scheduled a Spurs v Heat regular-season game at the end of a long road trip, Popovich rested most of his starters, despite the fact that the league was hyping that prime-time game as a potential NBA finals preview. (OK, so maybe this talk of \"nobody expected the Spurs to get this far\" might be a tad disingenuous.) To Popovich's credit, the ragtag group of roleplayers and benchwarmers almost pulled off a victory. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/05/stern-popovich-wizards-win-hornets-change-name\">That wasn't enough to prevent Popovich getting a hefty fine from Stern</a> (or receiving after-the-fact scorn from writers working on finals previews who really could have benefited from having a little bit more to work with before making their predictions). </p><h2>How the Spurs and Heat match up</h2><p>Um, we'll see? Although the teams have played twice this season, those games don't really tell us much, even by regular-season NBA standards. The Heat won both but the <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/games/20121129/SASMIA/gameinfo.html\">first meeting was the game where Popovich rested most of his starters</a>. In the second game, <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/games/20130331/MIASAS/gameinfo.html\">the Heat were resting Wade, James and Chalmers for legitimate injury reasons</a>. So we really have no idea of what it will look like when the 2013 version of both of these clubs meet. Hey, that might make these NBA finals more fun – it's like a flashback to what the World Series was in baseball before interleague play came along: a battle between two teams that hadn't really seen each other during the regular season.</p><p>There's some talk that the extra time off may result in the Spurs being rusty, but it seems really doubtful that this experienced team will somehow suddenly forget how to play basketball at a high level. Popovich, <a href=\"http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/tim-duncan-did-not-play-old/125796\">who once rested Duncan by putting him on the \"Did Not Play\" list for being \"old\"</a>, wouldn't have been thrilled if the Spurs had had to play a grueling seven-game series like the one the Heat barely survived. If anything, the fact that both Wade and Bosh are beat up is probably the biggest advantage the Spurs have. This will sound like a cop out, and most likely is a cop out, but the results of these finals will probably revolve around health. If Wade and Bosh are healthier and more effective than they were during the Eastern Conference finals, the Heat should be able to the defeat the Spurs. If not, the Spurs officially will have the second- and third-best players in the series in Parker and Duncan, and will have a shot at championship No 5. </p><p>It seems a bit reductive to have the NBA finals hinge on just who's healthy, but that's basically been the story of this season. This hasn't been an NBA season, it's been a horror movie. The Heat and the Spurs have made it this far, in part, because so many of the other contenders have lost key players. In the Eastern Conference, the Bulls played without Derrick Rose, the Celtics didn't have Rajon Rondo and the Pacers were without Danny Granger. It was even more pronounced in the Western Conference, where the Nuggets lost Danilo Gallinari late in the season, the Lakers lost Kobe Bryant right before the playoffs and (maybe most crucially) the Thunder lost Russell Westbrook in their very first playoff series. The Heat and the Spurs made it this far because of the injuries to other teams – it only makes sense for injuries to be the deciding factor in the game's ultimate round.</p><h2>Prediction</h2><p><em>(Warning: The following is for entertainment purposes only, specifically the entertainment of watching the writer's predictions explode in his face over the course of the next two weeks.)</em></p><p>Wade and Bosh will be more productive they were than in the Eastern Conference finals. James will have at least one monstrous performance, while averaging around 25 points a game. The Spurs will give the Heat fits, and will absolutely embarrass them in at least one game, when it will look like they have a good shot at winning the series. In the end, however, it will turn out that the Heat took care of the team with the best chance of eliminating them when they knocked out the Pacers.</p><p><strong>Miami</strong> in six.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport\">Guardian US will have liveblog coverage of every game</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409724515|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|bf11905aaa18c1121e81570200edefecf400df52 -->",

        "body":"<p>Indiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert should have been in a celebratory mood on Sunday, after all he was a huge part of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/02/heat-pacers-game-six-seven-nba-playoffs\">his team's win against the Miami Heat in Game Six of the Eastern Conference Finals</a>. Instead, Hibbert was dealing with the fallout from his use of a homophobic slur during a colorful postgame press conference. On Sunday, the NBA - particularly conscious of potentially offensive language after Washington Wizards big man Jason Collins came out as gay in an April issue of Sports Illustrated - fined Hibbert $75,000 for, among other things, his use of a homophobic slur.</p><p><em></em><br />Hibbert could not have been surprised at being fined, he even began his postgame rant  on Saturday with \"I don't care if I get fined\", but he may have been somewhat surprised about the part of his comments that ended up being the most controversial. Following the Pacers' upset victory over the Heat, Hibbert unleashed an uncensored rant pointed at the media, at one point describing them using Samuel L. Jackson's favorite swear word. While Hibbert probably would have been fined for his use of \"motherfucker\", the more controversial part came later as he was describing how he defended the Miami Heat's LeBron James: <br /><em></em></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There was what — was it Game 3 here? I really felt that I let Paul down in terms of having his back when LeBron was scoring in the post or getting to the paint, because they stretched me out so much. No homo.</p></blockquote><p>While expecting to be fined for addressing the press with profanity, which most fans probably consider something close to a victimless crime, the more serious problem with Hibbert's remarks was his use of the derogatory phrase \"no homo\". Hibbert himself acknowledged this in his <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9334504/2013-nba-playoffs-roy-hibbert-indiana-pacers-apologizes-postgame-gay-slur\"> public apology</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I am apologizing for insensitive remarks made during the postgame press conference after our victory over Miami Saturday night. They were disrespectful and offensive and not a reflection of my personal views. I used a slang term that is not appropriate in any setting, private or public, and the language I used definitely has no place in a public forum, especially over live television. I apologize to those who I have offended, to our fans and to the Pacers' organization.</p></blockquote><p>In the last few years the NBA, like most other professional sports organizations, has become more aware of projecting an image of acceptance and tolerance of the LGBT community. The league's fine against Roy Hibbert, in fact, is roughly along the same lines as the one they issued to Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant, who was forced to pay $100,000 in April 2011 after <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/news/story?id=6344596\">he made a much more offensive gay slur on the court directly to a referee</a>.  In both of these cases, the fine was meant to be less punitive and more just to establish what the league finds acceptable. The NBA's press release emphasizes this point: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>While Roy has issued an apology, which is no doubt sincere, a fine is necessary to reinforce that such offensive comments will not be tolerated by the NBA.</p></blockquote><p>Some believe Hibbert should be suspended for his comments, notably David Zirin, who made<a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/174612/no-homo-no-way-suspend-roy-hibbert-game-7\"> a compelling argument for suspension in the Nation</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The league could send one hell of a message by saying, \"We pledged that the NBA would be a safe, nondiscriminatory atmosphere, and even though we recognize how unfair this will seem to Pacers fans and their organization, we are answering to a higher principal. Roy Hibbert therefore will not be playing Game 7.\"</p></blockquote><p>As much as I empathize with the reasons behind Zirin's stance, and would not have had any problem with the NBA had they decided to suspend Hibbert, the NBA's fine feels about right as far as punishments go. $75,000 is a large enough fine to be deterrent, but not so punitive that it feels like an overreach on NBA commissioner David Stern's part. As bad as Hibbert's choice of words were, they were off-handed remarks not made in an intentionally hateful context, making it difficult for the NBA to justify suspending a player in the middle of a playoff series for off the court reasons. If anything, a suspension could end up being counter-productive, as it would shift attention away from the subject at hand, the unacceptability of hurtful language, and towards yet another debate about whether or not the commissioner is abusing his power, given that this game is so important.</p><p>Thankfully for the league, Hibbert's comments were not anywhere in the league of former NBA star Tim Hardaway's infamous \"I don't like to be around gay people... It shouldn't be in the world for that or in the United States for it\" tirade. Had Hibbert been saying something that overtly and deliberately homophobic, Stern probably would have had little choice to suspend him for Game Seven of the Eastern Conference Finals, and the backlash to that decision could very well have done more harm than good in the short-term in providing ammunition to the \"this is Political Correctness run amok\" crowd that Zirin references in his article. (Hardaway, it should be noted, <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/dave_zirin/08/22/tim.hardaway/index.html#ixzz2V7wbOuJE\">later repented and is currently one of the biggest allies the LGBT community has among current and former athletes</a>, a perfect example of the possible positive results stemming from a public outcry.)</p><p>This is not to say that the NBA will, or should, never suspend a player for bigoted language or behavior. The league will almost certainly be even more vigilant about such language in the future than it was in the past following former Washington Wizards center Jason Collins' April announcement that he was gay, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2013/apr/30/jason-collins-comes-out-why-matters\">making him the first active player in the big four US professional sports to come out</a>. Collins' coming out is, of course, the hidden narrative behind this story. In fact, shortly after the swift negative reaction to his press conference comments, Roy Hibbert actually went to Twitter to contact Collins, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hoya2aPacer/status/341082858942767104\">seemingly with the intent of starting a dialogue about the appropriateness of his comment</a>. </p><p>While this was a very commendable move on Hibbert's part, and Collins' (private) response may very well have played some role in his apology, it also brings up a very real reason why it's important for the NBA, and all sports leagues, to create an atmosphere where gay athletes aren't afraid to be honest about themselves with the general public. With Collins being the only active player out at the moment, assuming that he is with a team next season, he will find himself being the go-to guy anytime there's any controversy revolving around LGBT rights not only within the NBA, but in the US sports scene in general. This is not only an unfair burden on Collins; it also creates the impression that one person could possibly act as the spokesperson for the entire, diverse LGBT community.</p><p>That situation will only change when more athletes are out, and that will only happen if the atmosphere around the league feels safer and more accepting than it does now. Which is exactly why the NBA should not tolerate Hibbert's \"no homo\", as benign of a phrase as it might seem to some at first. Although Hibbert, like the vast majority of those who use the phrase, most likely was not being consciously hateful, he was still expressing a statement, like the use of \"gay\" as a synonym for lame or uncool, that perpetuates the idea that being gay as a thing that one does not want to be. Beyond that, the phrase point blank includes the word \"homo\", a word which in any other context is in effect a homophobic slur. Many of Hibbert's defenders rest their argument on the fact that \"no homo\" is a phrase people use all the time without meaning anything bigoted about it, but that's all more the reason why it's a good thing that his comment has gotten this much negative attention. If you didn't know that phrase was potentially insensitive for some before, you can't honestly plead ignorance now.</p><p>In this incident, the league's fine and Hibbert's apology both feel like the best case scenario in how this incident could have played out. The NBA has made a statement that this not acceptable language, and maybe it's helped others both in and out of league think before using language that may be offensive for others. Ideally, Hibbert's slip, and the NBA's justifiable response, will end up being just one more stumbling block on the way towards a future where Jason Collins will no longer have to be the sole voice for the LGBT community among active players.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409973500|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|7516525ce11a1eb4622dd0c008e21aa79c409f72 -->",

While the Sixers are one of the worst road teams in the league, they are 19-17 at home.</p><p>The Sixers led by one at the end of the third quarter, then opened the fourth on a 19-4 run to put away the Pacers. Evan Turner and Thaddeus Young each contributed some lead-stretching buckets in the fourth to put all five starters in double figures.</p><p>Roy Hibbert had 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers.</p><p>The 76ers had enough this time to finish off one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. They had a late lead and the Heat on the ropes until they blew it and lost by four Wednesday night.</p><p>Just like they did against Miami, the Sixers got into an early groove in the quarter to put the upset alert on notice. Dorell Wright hit a 3-pointer and Lavoy Allen came off the bench to score his first two baskets to get a big run going. They forced turnovers on consecutive possessions at one point during the spurt and built a 10-point lead.</p><p>Somehow, Hawes, the much-maligned 7-1 center, outplayed Hibbert. Hawes has settled in nicely as a starter after an erratic first 42 games as a reserve. He had a fantastic one-handed rebound right over Hibbert's head in the third that put the crowd of 18,587 on their feet. Hawes had six blocked shots through the first three quarters and made the Pacers think twice about going inside.</p><p>At San Antonio, Tim Duncan had 30 points and 12 rebounds, Kawhi Leonard added 24 points and 13 boards, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-113.</p><p>Manu Ginobili added 14 points and 10 assists, Nando De Colo had 11 points and Tiago Splitter had 10 for San Antonio, which is 1½ games ahead of Oklahoma City in the Western Conference.</p><p>Wayne Ellington had 21 points and fellow reserve Marreese Speights added 19 for Cleveland. Shaun Livingston had 16 points, and Alonzo Gee and Dion Waiters added 15 apiece.</p><p>Neither offense was slowed by the loss of its starting All-Star point guards. The Spurs' Tony Parker is expected to miss another two weeks with a Grade 2 left ankle sprain and Cleveland will be without Kyrie Irving (shoulder) for another three weeks.</p><p>In Portland, Oregon, LaMarcus Aldridge had 31 points and 12 rebounds, and the Portland Trail Blazers handed the Detroit Pistons their eighth straight loss with a 112-101 victory.</p><p>Rodney Stuckey had a season-high 32 points for the Pistons, who have yet to win a game in March.</p><p>After trailing by as many as 11 points in the first half, the Blazers took a 90-81 lead on Nicolas Batum's 3-pointer with 8:33 remaining in the game. Portland extended the lead to 99-87 on J.J. Hickson's dunk.</p><p>In other games Saturday, Martell Webster scored a career-high 34 points in the Washington Wizards 127-105 win over the Phoenix Suns, Paul Pierce had 14 points, eight assists and six rebounds as the Boston Celtics powered past the Charlotte Bobcats 105-88 and Gordon Hayward scored 17 points in the Utah Jazz's 90-84 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405732009|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a9e5dbd5f17f93b7433e6e5ec50c2f1be8291020 -->",

        "headline":"Has Dwight Howard stolen LeBron James' title as Most Unpopular Player?",
        "body":"<p>Last week the Miami Heat became the first NBA team <a href=\"http://www1.skysports.com/basketball/news/12375/8551252/NBA-Miami-Heat-booked-their-place-in-the-play-offs\">to clinch a postseason appearance</a>. This tells us two things. First, it tells us that the Miami Heat are really insanely good, in case anyone was still doubting that. Secondly it tells us that we're into the last stretch of the regular season when individual games start to take on greater significance. (Offer not valid in Charlotte, Sacramento, Washington D.C., Orlando or New Orleans.)</p><h2>Dwight Howard is still not winning friends and influencing people</h2><p>When LeBron James finally won his first championship last year, it seemed to mark the end of his reign as the Most Hated Superstar in the NBA. Winning tends to silence critics. There was no official announcement or ceremony, but over the past year Lakers center Dwight Howard has done everything in his power to earn that dubious honor. Once the Magic's franchise player, Howard wore out his welcome in Orlando by demanding to be traded at times and making public gestures hinting he was willing to stay at other times. The Orlando Magic, eventually tired of this behavior, finally traded Howard to the Lakers over the summer, but not before they fired the team's head coach and GM in one last attempt to placate Howard. The way Howard left Orlando tarnished his public image, earning him labels such as \"difficult\" and \"coach-killer\", a reputation that has only gotten worse during his brief time with the struggling Lakers.</p><p>Tuesday night, Howard returned to Orlando for the first time as a member of the Lakers. Both franchises have been struggling since the trade. The Lakers, despite being stacked with Hall of Famers, are trying to sneak into the playoffs as the number eight seed while the Howard-less Magic have been forced into an indefinite rebuilding phase. This \"homecoming\" would have been contentious no matter what, but Howard, who has an almost uncanny ability to make bad situations even worse, didn't help things with <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/03/07/dwight-howard-orlando-magic-los-angeles-lakers/1969913/\">this comment</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> \"My team in Orlando was a team full of people who nobody wanted, and I was the leader and I led that team with a smile on my face\". </p></blockquote><p>There may be no more telling fact about how Howard is perceived by his fellow players than how quickly and bluntly Howard's former teammates responded. Jameer Nelson was quoted in the Orlando Sentinel as saying \"when are you going to take ownership and stay out of the media in a professional manner?\" (Note: This line about staying out of the media may have more sting if Nelson wasn't, well, speaking to the media.) J.J. Redick, the Magic shooting guard who was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks as part of the rebuilding process, was, if anything, even more blunt: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I would be more surprised when Dwight starts taking responsibility. That would be the most negative thing I can say, but that's the truth. You can't take all the credit and not accept any of the blame.\"</p></blockquote><p>At this point there's nothing really Howard can say or do off the court that will rehabilitate his image. If Howard is truly concerned with how the public sees him, and by all accounts he very much is, he is going to have to follow LeBron James's example and come through in big games. On Tuesday night, with all eyes on him, Howard came through with one of his best games in a Lakers uniform, scoring 39 points and 16 rebounds in a 106-97 win over his old team. A few more of those games could go a long way.</p><h2>We are no longer accepting nominations for Dunk of the Year</h2><p>Brandon Knight's Sunday was so lousy that he <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2013/03/12/brandon-knight-detroit-pistons-sprained-ankle/1981083/\">sprained his ankle the next day</a> and it was still a major improvement. On Sunday night's game against the Los Angeles Clippers, the Detroit Pistons guard attempted, and failed, to contest DeAndre Jordan's Dunk of the Year.</p><p><em></em></p><p>As sometimes happens when a player gets posterized, Knight became the punchline of the night. On Twitter the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RIPBrandonKnight&amp;src=typd\">#RIPBrandonKnight</a> started trending. Indeed, Knight's fall to the floor after his entirely futile attempt to stop Jordan does indeed somewhat resemble a particularly hammy extra dropping dead in an action movie.</p><p>Because this is the age of the internet, the jokes at Knight's expense jump-started an immediate backlash. As many pointed out, <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--basketball-s-backward-culture-makes-punch-line-of-brandon-knight-for-trying-to-stop-deandre-jordan-s-dunk-174058736.html\">most notably Yahoo! Sports analyst Adrian Wojnarowski</a>, Brandon Knight's sin was doing his job on the defensive end. Maybe Knight wasn't making the smartest play, but it's hard to fault a guy for being willing to risk public humiliation trying to stop the opponent from scoring.</p><p>Then, of course, there was the backlash to the backlash. Deadspin, as you might imagine, <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/geez-lighten-up-francis-quoth-adrian-wojnarowski-f-452430474?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">was solidly in the pro-ridicule camp</a>. Mike Prada of SB Nation <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/3/11/4090558/deandre-jordan-dunk-brandon-knight-pistons\">made a convincing case</a> that Knight did not, in fact, make the right play. In the end the best response to Brandon Knight's YouTube infamy and Twitter demise came from Knight himself. After the game, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrandonKnight07/status/311001874239221760\"> Knight tweeted</a>:</p><p><em></em></p><h2>Derrick Rose might return soon, Amar'e Stoudemire definitely won't</h2><p>Even though doctors have cleared Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose to play, it's uncertain when, or if, he will actually appear in a game. Rose, the 2011 MVP, has been recovering from an ACL injury suffered in last year's playoffs. Rose says that he has no set return date and his limitations are mental rather than physical. \"I can do everything,\" <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/chi-chicago-bulls-derrick-rose-20130312,0,7117005.story\">Rose told the Chicago Tribune</a>. \"It's just me having the confidence to do it and me feeling normal\".</p><p>This clearly doesn't sound like a player who is eager to play anytime soon, and it might be in the Bulls' best interests not to rush him back. Head coach Tom Thibodeau has done a great job this year working with a roster that was designed to work around Rose, not without him. Most notably, Joakim Noah and Luol Deng have become All-Stars in Rose's absence. Still, <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/sports/16685178-419/morrissey-sorry-thibs-bulls-even-with-rose-arent-title-contenders.html\">this Bulls team doesn't seem like it could beat the Miami Heat in a seven game series </a>without Rose at 100%. Unless Rose has access to Kobe Bryant's mysterious German doctor or Vijay Singh's supply of deer antler spray, that seems unlikely. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/bulls/post/_/id/12490/bulls-rose-need-to-decide-in-near-future\">The Bulls could very well punt on this season rather than risking losing Rose</a>.</p><p>One NBA player who is not going to be coming back any time soon is the New York Knicks' Amar'e Stoudemire, who has now had surgery on both knees in the same season (as far as we know, these injuries <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/03/amare-stoudemire-fire-extinguisher-paul-pierce-tebows\">are not fire extinguisher related</a>). It's very likely that the Stoudemire will not be available until the postseason, if then. Hey, at least head coach Mike Woodson no longer has to worry about trying to get him and Carmelo Anthony on the same page anymore. </p><p>Of course, no team is better off without an offensive threat like Amar'e Stoudemire. If Stoudemire's not available and reasonably effective in the postseason, this Knicks season that began so promising could end in yet another brief and insubstantial playoff run. Unfortunately for the Knicks' future, Stoudemire's contract is literally guaranteed to be neither brief nor insubstantial, he's owed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/sports/basketball/amare-stoudemires-absence-hurts-knicks-offense.html?_r=0\">$45.1 million over the next two seasons</a>. Even before this latest setback, Stoudemire had a reputation for being injury prone, a trend that's not likely to improve now that he's on the wrong side of 30. In other words, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/03/new-york-yankees-alex-rodriguez-hip-injury\">the Knicks might have the basketball equivalent of Alex Rodriguez </a>in their hands.</p><h2>Signs point towards a Western Conference Finals rematch</h2><p>For months now the conversation has been about whether or not the Oklahoma City Thunder have enough to match up with the Miami Heat in the playoffs. This conversation, however, assumes that the Thunder will return to the NBA Finals, that may not be a sure thing considering how the San Antonio Spurs have been playing. The Thunder may be the best team in the West, and Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook make them the most dangerous one, but here it is in early March and the Thunder have yet to overtake the Spurs for that top spot in the Western Conference.</p><p>Monday night, the Spurs defeated the Thunder in San Antonio 105-93. It's just one win, a home win at that, but it was still a statement game from the Spurs, a message that they were not planning on giving up that number one seed. The Spurs, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/06/miami-heat-unbeaten-tony-parker-out\">as noted last week</a>, have been at a disadvantage without their best player, point guard Tony Parker. So far the Spurs have won three out of four games without their MVP candidate. If this were another team that might be surprising, but the Spurs are the one team that you can never count out.</p><p>The Western Conference felt wide open during the first half of the season. The Los Angeles Clippers, the Denver Nuggets and the Memphis Grizzlies all had stretches where they looked like they could be dark horses, but it's looking more and more likely that Oklahoma City and San Antonio are the two best teams in the conference. Anything other than a Thunder/Spurs rematch in the Western Conference Finals would be something of an upset.</p><h2>Other things we've learned</h2><p>• After the Boston Celtics lost Rajon Rondo, Jared Sulinger and Leandro Barbosa for the season, many speculated that GM Danny Ainge would re-sign former Celtics such as Keyon Dooling, Delonte West or Brian Scalabrine to get them through the second half of the season. As it turns out, Scalabrine himself, currently an analyst with CSN New England, tried to sell Ainge on the idea of a comeback. During a conference call to promote Sky Sports' Sunday NBA double-header, Scalabrine elaborated:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> I was asking him \"Come on DA, nobody knows this system like me... just give a 10-day man\", but to no avail. He gave me some good advice. \"If you do broadcasting and then go back to playing, and then you go back to broadcasting sports people don't take you serious…. I think he was a little bit right about just focusing on what I'm doing now and trying to improve as a broadcaster.</p></blockquote><p>Sadly there will be no SCAL-A-BRINE chants during the end of blowouts this season, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiWvSQzCo0A\">but at least Celtics fans still have Gino</a>.</p><p>• Speaking of Delonte West, Sam Riches <a href=\"http://www.theclassical.org/articles/waiting-for-delonte\">wrote a pretty thoughtful piece</a> for the Classical about West specifically, and mental health issues in basketball in general.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5989639/stone+cold-kobe-bryant-only-thing-i-fear-is-bees?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">The only thing that scares Kobe Bryant? Bees.</a> So I'm guessing that's at least one vote in favor of the New Orleans Hornets becoming the Pelicans.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/demarcus-cousins-ejected-elbow-mike-dunleavy-head-team-200625665--nba.html\">DeMarcus Cousins is still DeMarcus Cousins.</a></p><p>• Monstrous Three-Pointer Display of the Week: The Brooklyn Nets' Deron Williams was a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw8c5SmcvJo\">one man Three-Pointer Contest</a> against the Washington Wizards, hitting 11 in the game, setting a NBA record for the most threes in a half by hitting 9 of them before halftime.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405310784|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|43a6a10098757c12d85fd08ea4a8f22e0c391d11 -->",

        "body":"<p>So, the 2013 NBA Trade Deadline has come and gone and, for all the talk about Dwight Howard/Paul Pierce/Josh Smith being on the move, nothing much has changed. Unless you believe that J.J. Redick changing his zip code from Orlando to Milwaukee is earth-shattering, there were not any major moves on Thursday. So now, most major moves will happen when a player returns from injury (hello Danny Granger), presumed retirement (hello Derek Fisher) or from elsewhere (hey <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/26/dennis-rodman-north-korea\">Dennis Rodman is apparently going to be playing in North Korea</a>). In other words, the only major player movement happening in your favorite team might be limited to their participation in surreal viral internet memes.</p><h2>The 2013 Trade Deadline was mostly dead</h2><p>The trade deadline is supposed to be the time of year when bad teams looking to rebuild trade away their movable parts to teams in the playoff hunt looking for difference-making players. This year, teams mostly did... nothing really. Unless you happen to have been a huge Duke supporter during the J.J. Redick era, no big names were moved and no teams did anything super drastic. In fact some have called last Thursday \"<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/trade-deadline-worst-ever-003028760--nba.html\">the worst trade deadline in NBA history</a>\".</p><p>So, let's go over \"the big trade\" where the Orlando Magic sent sharp-shooter J.J. Redick to the Milwaukee Bucks.<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/breaking-down-very-dull-moves-2013-nba-trade-231029970--nba.html\"> In the trade Orlando packaged Redick with Gustavo Ayon and Ish Smith for Beno Udrih, Tobias Harris and Doron Lamb</a>. The most important thing to take out of this deal is that yes, really, all of those names just mentioned in fact belong to professional basketball players. Every slow trade deadline is just a learning opportunity in disguise. It's not a bad trade for either team, Redick will be a free agent this summer so this allows the Magic, who aren't going anywhere, to get something back from the three-point machine. It's a decent get for the Milwaukee Bucks who could make some noise in the playoffs, but it's not a move likely to have any big time ramifications.</p><p>In fact the most controversial move of the dead deadline occurred the day before when, <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8970449/the-trade-deadline-exchange-part-1\">the Sacramento Kings sent Thomas Robinson, their struggling first round draft pick, along with Tyler Honeycutt and Francisco Garcia to the Houston Rockets for cash and a handful of spare parts</a> (Patrick Patterson, Toney Douglas, Cole Aldrich). What are the Sacramento Kings doing? Well, the answer is saving money. At this point, with the Kings likely to move to Seattle and become the SuperSonics, ownership is not really interested in moves that benefit the club in any way beyond financial. So, in basketball terms it does not make sense that the Kings would abandon their fifth overall pick after only four months or so of disappointing play, but it may just be that ownership is already in \"just don't care anymore\" mode. You're welcome Houston.</p><p>In retrospect, maybe it was just sports media wishful thinking to assume that the Los Angeles Lakers were actually going to trade away Dwight Howard so soon after trading for him, even if Howard doesn't seem to be fitting in with the team and could sign somewhere else as a free agent this off-season. Some expected GM Danny Ainge to \"blow up\" the Boston Celtics after they lost Rajon Rondo for the season, but the team has played well enough without Rondo that Ainge could afford to indulge his sentimental side and keep both Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett for the umpteenth trade deadline. Heck, the C's even added a piece by getting Jordan Crawford from the Washington Wizards <a href=\"http://greenstreet.weei.com/sports/boston/basketball/celtics/2013/02/21/what-jordan-crawford-can-do-for-celtics/\">for the contract of a guy who can't play and a big dude who exists just to eat up fouls.</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/2/21/4014574/josh-smith-nba-trade-deadline-hawks-bucks\"><br />Even Josh Smith didn't go anywhere.</a></p><p>The reason why this NBA trading deadline was so dead? Well, the season's biggest trades, by far, were made before the season even began. Dwight Howard had already been moved once, from the Magic to the Lakers, a move that has generated at least one third of the storylines of this NBA season. Then the Oklahoma City Thunder made a surprise trade before the start of the regular season, sending James Harden to the Houston Rockets after the team could not work out an extension. That was two All-Stars traded away right before a single game could be played. Then, shortly before the trading deadline, the cash-cutting Memphis Grizzlies, who had one of the few desirable pieces that could be traded in Rudy Gay, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2013/feb/06/rudy-gay-memphis-grizzlies-toronto-raptors\">sent their best scorer to the Toronto Raptors</a>. So, not only had the NBA season already seen two superstars moved at the height of their value before it had even began, one of their few other possible trade targets was moved a few weeks before the official deadline. So it really hasn't been a bad season for NBA trades at all, it's just been a matter of unusual timing.</p><h2>Danny Granger returned to the Pacers</h2><p>Saturday night, Indiana Pacers swingman Danny Granger returned to the floor after recovering from a knee injury. In his triumphant return against the Detroit Pistons, <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/24/danny-granger-hits-one-of-his-10-shot-attempts-in-return-from-injury-and-his-teammates-are-ecstatic-video/\">last season's key Pacers scorer ended up hitting one shot... out of ten</a>. Okay, so it was not the storybook return his teammates were probably hoping for, but the Pacers still won the game and kept pace as the second seed in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>Even though the Heat seem to have a stranglehold on the Eastern conference, certainly someone has to face them in the Eastern Conference Finals, and why couldn't it be this well-balanced Indiana Pacers team? After all, there was a point last season where it looked like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/18/indiana-pacers-beat-miami-heat-nba-playoffs\">the Pacers could have done the improbable and knocked out the Heat in the second round</a>, and they've become a much more rounded team in Granger's absence. It could be that nobody gives credit to the Pacers because they don't have the big market or the star power of Carmelo Anthony's New York Knicks teams and they don't have an intriguing X-factor like the divisional rival Chicago Bulls, who may or may not see the return of savior Derrick Rose this season. </p><p>The other reason people aren't giving credit to this Pacers team? Well the Miami Heat have been running away with this whole conference thing, and it's hard to give credit for the first runner-up in what is essentially a one man race. As of Tuesday, the Pacers were seven games in the loss column behind the Heat in the Eastern Conference Standings. That's the exact number of games in the loss column the eighth-seeded Milwaukee Bucks are behind Indiana. In other words, barring a key Miami injury, everyone else in the conference is essentially fighting over that second spot.</p><p>Still, bolstered by an All-Star season from Paul George and an All-Star caliber season from David West, this has been an Indiana Pacers team to overlook at one's own peril. Now,with Granger returning from injury, these 1-for-10 shooting nights will probably be a rarity, the thought is that center Roy Hibbert's season can only get better from here and that the Pacers should be a tough out in the playoffs. Will that be enough to stop LeBron James? Who knows, but \"will anything be enough to stop LeBron James?\" seems to be the question this year.</p><p>Monday evening <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ4UqLAwz5g\">the Pacers found themselves in an epic fight with the Warriors</a>. Well, that's one way for Roy Hibbert to start making an impression on the court again.</p><p><em></em></p><h2>The NBA welcomed back Derek Fisher</h2><p>If, in the wake of Billy Hunter's ousting, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/feb/20/jerry-buss-la-lakers-girls-cheerleaders\">Derek Fisher's career as union president comes to an end</a>, at least it looks like he will have his old job as a backup plan. The Oklahoma City Thunder, perhaps seeing the success the New York Knicks have had with Rasheed Wallace and Jason Kidd, or the Los Angeles Clippers have had with Grant Hill, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8992010/derek-fisher-rejoins-oklahoma-city-thunder-not-planning-retiring\">have signed veteran guard Fisher</a> to give them some depth for the remainder of the season. Or maybe Oklahoma just looked up in the standings to the Western Conference leading San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim \"DNP - Old\" Duncan, and noticed the veteran experience gap.</p><p>This, of course, is one of the ramifications of the end of the NBA Trading Deadline: since teams can no longer make straight trades they have to be a bit creative in filling roster needs. In some cases, this means teams signing players who get cut by their old teams, in other cases this means scouring the D-League or China for anybody that could be remotely useful, and oftentimes this means hooking back up with players whose retirements were either not voluntary or not permanent. Although Fisher asked the Dallas Mavericks to waive him earlier in the year to \"spend more time with his family\", apparently being offered a chance to return to the NBA Finals, and the possibility of a sixth title, was enough to get him back in action.</p><p>While Fisher probably won't be a major player for the Thunder, the team that may be the biggest obstacle in the Miami Heat's quest to win back-to-back as NBA championships certainly couldn't hurt to have a little bit of veteran leadership. Head coach Scott Brooks all but admits this: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"We're not looking for him to score... we're just looking for him to be one of those intangible players, those winning basketball players\". </p></blockquote><p>In other words, Derek Fisher's contributions to the Thunder might amount to little more than telling Kevin Durant \"here's a story about what a young guard named Kobe Bryant did in a similar situation\" to the younger players, but that might be all the Thunder need.</p><h2>The Raptors win...the Harlem Shake competition at least</h2><p>This column was not going to discuss the Harlem Shake. </p><p>It was well aware of the viral video sensation, where at first an ignored goofy figure dances to a song alone before being joined in the second act by a cast of colorful characters going crazy. This column was not going to provide any links to such examples, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzl7inEmE3I\">not even you Dallas Mavericks</a>, because there's nothing lamer than an out-of-touch writer clumsily attempting to explain a viral internet meme at this point in its existence. Just read the opening sentence of this paragraph for an example. The only possibly reactions at this stage would be for this writer to embrace the Shake by declaring it the \"new Gangnam Style\", or to savagely mock it by declaring it the \"new Gangnam Style\". In any case, the result would be like when you hear someone over 50 have a really strong opinion about a One Direction song, whether it's positive or negative it just seems really weird. </p><p><em></em><br />Then Amir Johnson of the Toronto Raptors <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/02/25/harlem-shake-toronto-raptors-amir-johnson-dwane-casey/?sct=uk_t2_a12\">produced his own version</a> of the Harlem Shake, and mostly thanks to a deadpan performance from coach Dwane Casey, well, the results transcend the genre (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPLc29pRpJY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">nice try 2013 All-Star Game</a>).</p><p>Of course, why not have some fun if you're the Toronto Raptors. Nobody expects anything from you this season, but you've been hanging around the ninth and tenth seed all season long. Management, rightly or wrongly, believes in you enough to have brought in Rudy Gay (and, um, Sebastian Telfair who was <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/page2/s/wiley/030708.html\">compared to LeBron James at one time</a> believe it or not). If nothing else, this proves that the Toronto Raptors, a team whose very name was the result of a short-lived \"Jurassic Park\" fad, should be the go-to NBA team for all future internet memes of uncertain duration.</p><h2>Other Things We've Learned</h2><p>• For the record, I wish the craze had been the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHSURA2RCAQ\">\"Harlem Shuffle\".</a> Don't laugh, if LeBron James <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI6_es6Lkow\">broke out with this</a> next Heat game, we could get Bob &amp; Earl back on the Billboard charts by next week. He can do that, he's at the height of his powers now.</p><p>• The newest person to criticize the struggling, Andrew Bynum-less Philadelphia 76ers? That would be Doug Collins, who just happens to be the head coach of the struggling, Andrew Bynum-less Philadelphia 76ers. Following a loss to the Orlando Magic, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/sixers/index.ssf/2013/02/doug_collins_goes_off_on_sixer.html\">Collins went off on, well, just about everyone</a>. </p><p>• Elsewhere in Chicago, the Derrick Rose Injury Situation has hit the <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/sports/18490957-419/bulls-taj-gibson-out-derrick-rose-shows-improvement.html\">\"who the heck even knows\"</a> stage.</p><p>• It was fun while it lasted. Golden State Warriors' <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/02/24/andrew-bogut-back-injury-update-warriors-golden-state/\">Andrew Bogut is out indefinitely with a back injury.</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://nba.si.com/2013/02/26/kobe-bryant-technical-fouls/?sct=uk_t2_a8\">The NBA rescinded a technical foul call on Kobe Bryant on Tuesday</a>, putting his number at 13, giving him two more to work with before facing a one-game suspension. The Lakers, of course, are currently one game out of the last playoff spot and Kobe is kinda an important part of the Lakers winning. So, in other words, expect Kobe to magically stop getting technical fouls shortly.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7tPuiMxgc\">The Dunk That Wasn't Of The Week</a>: LeBron James is even winning the pregame ceremonies.
