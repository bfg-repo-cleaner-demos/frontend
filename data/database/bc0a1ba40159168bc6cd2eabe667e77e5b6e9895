        "body":"<p>In the early morning half light, Ajad Miccoli stops his scooter on his way to work and contemplates the scene unfolding across the scruffy, shuttered-up bay. What he sees is both familiar and eerily disturbing. At the quayside, beside a hut advertising seafood treats and boats offering \"sunset aperitivi\", a ship with dozens of people on board has docked to unload its exhausted cargo. Altogether there are 210 new arrivals – mostly Syrians, with some Eritreans and Nigerians. Thirty-seven are children. Miraculously, after a perilous journey thought to have begun on the Libyan coast, they are in relatively good condition. One man waves to reporters from the window of a bus sent to drive them away from the port. \"These people have probably known death,\" says Miccoli, a local musician. \"Here, maybe, they have a hope.\"</p><p>\"Here\" is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampedusa\" title=\"\">Lampedusa</a>, the not-quite eight square miles of Italian territory in the Mediterranean that has become known the world over not for hope, but for tragedy. For years, its sparkling waters and postcard-pretty beaches have provided a jarring backdrop for migrant boat landings; the island is conveniently closer to Africa than Europe – around 70 miles from the Tunisian coast and further south than Malta. But even for a place well-acquainted with human suffering, the horror brought to its coastline in the past fortnight has been a shock. \"It's awful,\" says Pietro Riso, a fisherman watching Tuesday morning's first arrival. (Soon after there was another boat at the dock – this time carrying 90, including four pregnant women.) \"These landings have been going on for about 20 years. But these last disasters have upset the balance. You get up in the morning and you don't know what to expect.\"</p><p>In the early hours of 3 October, near a beach once declared the \"world's best\" by users of TripAdvisor, a boat packed with more than 500 Eritrean men, women and children caught fire and capsized. Only 155 people survived, and 364 bodies have since been recovered. It was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/07/lampedusa-divers-bodies-hold-migrant-boat\" title=\"\">one of the worst disasters to occur in the Mediterranean in recent years</a>. Absolutes are hard to establish when many victims, in the grip of an illicit people-smuggling trade, are never recovered. As the images of tiny white coffins and vivid testimony from survivors went around the world, tragedy struck again. On Friday night, Maltese and Italian rescuers raced to the site of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/11/two-dozen-killed-boat-capsizes-lampedusa\" title=\"\">another stricken vessel</a>, this time carrying mostly Syrians fleeing their war-torn country. More than 200 people were saved, but at least 38 died.</p><p>The double tragedy has prompted outrage from prime ministers, presidents and the pope, who had chosen Lampedusa for his first papal visit outside Rome in July. But, on the ground, locals are not setting much store by their words. When José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, and Enrico Letta, the Italian premier, visited the island, they were <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24456058\" title=\"\">greeted with heckles </a>by people who feel abandoned by both Rome and Brussels. \"I hope that they have finally understood something,\" says Riso. \"This is a political task. We are fisherman and workers, and we do workers' work. Now the politicians must do their bit. Because we can't tolerate so many deaths.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420226723'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381947272276/survivor-of-shipwreck-001.jpg' alt='survivor of shipwreck' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A survivor of the 3 October shipwreck looks out over the water at Lampedusa. Photograph: Tullio M Puglia/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Up and down the main street of Lampedusa's town centre, a pleasant promenade dotted with pavement cafes and tourist shops, the stories of those deaths – and people who survived – are everywhere. There are more mundane realities that follow in the wake of a disaster. Three Eritrean women who have come from Sweden to identify their dead relatives struggle through red-tape to replace a missing passport. A couple of Syrians, smoking and drinking black coffee out of plastic cups, wonder how to celebrate Eid al-Adha.</p><p>Sitting on a bench, Sium Mulugeta waits for money from a friend to buy new clothes and a phone. He was on the boat that went down on 3 October with his best friend, Tewelde Bereket. The pair had been at university together in Eritrea, Mulugeta studying chemical engineering, Tewelde applied geography. They had left their home country and been in Ethiopia and Uganda together. And they had the same dream: of reaching Europe and building better lives for themselves and their families.</p><p>But after their boat from Libya ran into trouble, Mulugeta survived and his friend did not. \"He didn't know how to swim. That was the problem,\" he says. \"When the fire happened, I&nbsp;immediately jumped into the water … I&nbsp;swam for four to five hours. I was near, almost to the coast, when help came.\" Now Mulugeta, like many of the Eritrean survivors and victims' relatives, is determined to return his friend's body to his homeland. At the moment, it is among the coffins buried in a cemetery on the mainland of Sicily. Mulugeta knows, because it was up to him to identify the corpse.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420226724'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381947036986/coffins-at-Lampedusa-airp-001.jpg' alt='coffins at Lampedusa airport' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Coffins of some of the victims of the 3 October disaster in a hangar at Lampedusa airport. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Like the majority of the migrants who have arrived in Lampedusa this year – a total of 13,078 so far, according to the Italian interior ministry – the polite, quietly-spoken 26-year-old comes from a country that, due to internal conflict and repression, is deemed \"refugee-producing\". According to figures from the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, more people have arrived on Italian shores from Syria and Eritrea this year than any other country. Somalia, another nation in turmoil, is the third biggest country of provenance. Between them, these nations account for more than 18,000 people. There is clearly no shortage of people for whom the huge risks of the sea crossing outweigh those of staying at home. \"We knew it was very dangerous. Everybody knows,\" says Mulugeta. \"There are 10-year-old children who know that. But we don't have any option.\"</p><p>Almost exactly the same words come from Nisar Salam Aish, a 41-year-old husband and father from Damascus whose family has fled to Jordan and who hopes that, once he has established himself in Europe, he will be able to bring them to join him. \"It was very difficult,\" he says of the journey from Zuwarah in Libya – for which he says he paid smugglers $2,000. \"There were about 300 men and women, many children. I can't believe I am in Italy, alive. But there is not any choice for us.\"</p><p>Under the still-hot October sun, the Syrian breaks down in tears as he recounts his brother's fatal shooting earlier this year in the civil war. His wife and two children, aged five and 11, first fled to Daraa, near the border with Jordan. But because of the ongoing violence, they left the country altogether. He, meanwhile, decided he could no longer stay in Damascus, so left for Egypt for two months, then Libya for three months – all to get to Lampedusa, where he does not want to be at all. \"If I stay in Italy I am better off going back to Syria to be under the bombs of Assad,\" he says. \"We are coming to Europe to change our lives.\"</p><p>The Syrian is not alone in his reluctance to stay in Italy, although, according to EU rules, he must apply for asylum in his first point of entry into the bloc. \"Most of the [migrants] tell us they moved on to improve their living conditions and they don't believe that if they stay in Italy this will happen,\" says Carlotta Bellini, head of child protection at <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.it\" title=\"\">Save the Children Italy</a>, one of a cluster of NGOs with a permanent presence at the reception centre in Lampedusa. \"They say the [Italian] protection and reception system is not appropriate for their needs. They believe that other EU countries, for example Sweden, can instead guarantee the right to study, the right to work, the right to have an appropriate house.\" Another big issue, she says, is that newly arrived people often want to go where there are already established communities and support networks.</p><p>If the boat passengers are unsure about Italy before they arrived in Lampedusa, the facilities on the island are not, at the moment, likely to change their minds. Surrounded by sloping shrubland outside the town, the reception centre to which the migrants are taken is currently hugely overcrowded. The numbers fluctuate daily, but on Tuesday afternoon it had 905 registered migrants, including 142 minors, both with families and without. The centre – an entire wing of which lies burned out after a fire several years ago – has space for 250, maximum 300, people.</p><p>\"The centre is in a critical condition. We want people to be transferred [to other centres on the Italian mainland] as soon as possible,\" says Maurizio Molina, senior protection associate at UNHCR Italy and one of the team working at the centre in the aftermath of this month's disasters. \"Many people are sleeping rough because in the centre there are not enough places.\"</p><p>Molina admits to  feeling tired. He is trying to connect families who were separated in the joint Maltese-Italian rescue mission on Friday. As a first-level reception centre, the Lampedusa facility is not supposed to house people for \"more than 48 hours, 76 at the very most\" before transferring them to the mainland for more sophisticated asylum screening, says Viviana Valastro of Save the Children Italy. But in recent weeks this has gone out of the window. NGO workers say there simply is not enough give in the system – not only in Lampedusa, but in Italy as a whole.</p><p>Most worryingly for Valastro is the situation of the children. \"This is not an environment for [them],\" she says, standing at the gates.</p><p>Behind her, as dusk falls, families ready makeshift camps for the night, a Syrian flag can be seen hanging amid the trees, and children play with balls in the very limited space. Sicilian regional authorities have declared a state of emergency on the island, a move that should free up funds for aid workers. Valastro is also pleased that they have at last won permission to let minors out to play in a special child-friendly area for two hours every morning and two hours every afternoon. \"We had to fight  the police for it,\" she says.</p><p>Surveying the camp from on high, above the hillsides strung with washing lines and studded with groups of potential refugees, Emanuele Billardello, a genial taxi driver born and bred in Lampedusa, says he feels great sadness. He remembers when the island was a place known not for migrant deaths and institutional failures, but cheap and cheerful tourism. Now it is different – even if the tourist industry, decimated in 2011 during the Arab Spring when huge numbers of migrants paralysed the island, picked up this year due to continued violence in Egypt, the visit of the pope, and – of course – the TripAdvisor fame of <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g262047-d568915-Reviews-Rabbit_Beach-Lampedusa_Islands_of_Sicily_Sicily.html\" title=\"\"><em>spiaggia dei conigli</em></a> – literally, \"rabbits' beach\".</p><p>But, in its own way, Lampedusa is building itself a new identity – one of collective compassion and solidarity with those most marginalised. Last week, there were even suggestions it should win the Nobel prize for peace. That might be going a bit far, but there is a growing sense that the island is, in its opposition to reactionary immigration laws, leading the way for the rest of the country.</p><p>This can, of course, come at a price. Posters in shop and bar windows advertise the counselling services of psychologists from the <a href=\"http://www.orderofmalta.int/latest-interventions/68966/the-lampedusa-boat-tragedy-nonstop-the-work-of-the-italian-relief-corps-of-the-order-of-malta/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Order of Malta's Italian Relief Corps</a> (CISOM), on hand not only to help victims' relatives and rescuers, but also the locals themselves. \"This is a welcoming population, maybe the most welcoming there is, because they do not make a distinction between Italians and foreigners,\" says Giovanni Matera. \"It's a population which has always been a place of transit. So the migrants are perfectly integrated with the Italians, and for this reason they experience the same pain.\"</p><p>For many, the person who has come to symbolise the locals' mixture of political anger and human compassion is the island's mayor, Giusi Nicolini, of whom Billardello says succinctly: \"She's a woman who is trying to do the right thing.\" It is Nicolini who has led Lampedusa's fight against Italy's harsh immigration laws that, among other things, treat illegal immigration as a crime punishable by a hefty fine, dissuade people from helping vessels in trouble for fear of being accused of aiding illegal immigration, and mean prosecutors are expected to place newly arrived migrants – even the survivors of the 3 October disaster – under investigation.</p><p>Letta has said he feels ashamed of these laws, brought in when the rightwing, xenophobic <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/59a7aa5c-58a7-11e2-bd9e-00144feab49a.html#axzz2htVI886a\" title=\"\">Northern League was in government with Silvio Berlusconi</a>, and would abolish them if it was up to him. But problems in his grand coalition – which he shares with the centre-right – may make that difficult. In Lampedusa, however, the message from Nicolini is clear. \"The law should be abolished immediately,\" she said earlier this month. \"Immediately.\"</p><p>The government in Rome has launched its own \"military-humanitarian\" mission in the Mediterranean around Lampedusa that will increase sea patrols, while at the same time urging the EU to take a greater share of the burden. NGOs, meanwhile, are keen for the authorities to move beyond crisis management of the arrivals – who have been coming in huge numbers since the early 2000s – and to improve what they say is the creaking and inadequate reception system for asylum-seekers in Italy.</p><p>Nowhere will the political players be watched more closely than from Lampedusa, where the coffins of the 3 October victims have gone, but the memories linger. \"It seems almost impossible that things like this still happen,\" says Miccoli, watching the early morning arrivals from the port. \"But certainly it's been happening for years. Now, we hope, the politicians might finally be listening.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420182201|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|3d666afd6f3a6309b9fb19200a4e859f8dbc78d5 -->",

        "body":"<p>The migration road from Africa to Europe's promised land has ended for one east African woman on a patch of concrete in a market in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. Seated on a cushion, dressed in a black shawl, she sells mattresses in the baking heat amid stalls offering everything from mobile phones and bathroom fittings to electric stun guns and firearms.</p><p>She won't give her name, or the country she comes from, but knows where she wants to go: Italy. \"My three children are there already,\" she says. \"But I can't find a boat.\"</p><p>Libya's post-revolutionary chaos has made it the key route for migrants moving to Europe from a broad swath of Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Eritrea and Somalia in the east.</p><p>It is a precarious and dangerous route, taking them north through Niger, Chad and Sudan across a border that is there in name only in the midst of the Sahara. From there, they endure a 1,000-mile journey through bandit-infested territory to Libya's coast.</p><p>Those routes have now become battlegrounds for competing smuggling gangs, well armed from a country awash in weapons left over from the revolution that toppled Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Once they reach the Mediterranean, the lucky ones are shepherded to a beach rendezvous with a smuggling boat. Even then, there is a precarious trip to the island of Lampedusa, a trip that last week claimed the lives of at least 200 migrants off the Italian coast.</p><p>Many never get that far: like the mattress-seller, they are dumped in one of Libya's coastal cities and left to fend for themselves, often at the mercy of their smugglers.</p><p>\"A combination of continued civil unrest, disrupted shipping lanes and European coastal patrols have resulted in trafficked persons remaining in Libya,\" says the US state department's Trafficking in Persons report. \"These networks use a variety of techniques to hold people in conditions of forced labour and forced prostitution.\"</p><p>The mattress-seller makes a few pounds a day in the market, and counts herself among the lucky ones; in contrast, thousands more have been scooped up by the Libyan authorities and held in detention centres, which are packed to beyond their normal capacity.</p><p>In one centre in Zlitan, Amnesty International found migrants from Eritrea and Somalia who had been held in cells for six months without access to the centre's courtyard.</p><p>\"They were in overcrowded cells without sunshine or access to fresh air,\" said Amnesty official Magda Mughrabi. \"We have cases of women strip-searched by male guards; we've documented many cases in which the treatment amounts to torture.\"</p><p>Amnesty says Libya has yet to sign the UN convention on refugees, meaning it does not recognise genuine asylum applicants, instead holding them indefinitely as illegal immigrants.</p><p>The International Office for Migration, an intergovernmental organisation, said it could assist Libya. \"This is a huge problem; what do you do with these people?\" said IOM spokesman Chris Lom. \"If the Libyans asked to help us build their migration capacity-building we would do it, but the Libyans would have to ask us.\" Immigrations gangs around Sabah are divided between often bitterly opposing Tuareg, Tobu and Arab tribes. They fight brutal battles for control of the smuggling routes. Under the regime of Gaddafi, border controls were tight, slowing the flow of immigrants. But since the revolution, those controls have lapsed. People and drugs are being smuggled into the country, while weapons are taken the other way.</p><p>The big concern for western diplomats is that jihadists are using the same routes to move between Libya, Algeria and Mali. The US has opened a drone base in Niger to carry out unmanned flights over the vast empty desert region to augment Libya's efforts.</p><p>Tripoli's government is itself overwhelmed with the problems of a country suffering political chaos, militia violence and fragmentation. It insists that it provides food and accommodation for all refugees.</p><p>This is scant comfort for the mattress-seller. She says she is aware of the perils of the sea journey to Europe but is determined to make it.</p><p>\"I've been all around Libya, to Tobruk and Benghazi searching for a boat; reaching Italy is my dream.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419144807|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|cf736a32454e22ec037532e78e47f673e6ca5d17 -->",

Separately, the Italian news agency Ansa, citing unnamed sources, put the number of dead at at least 50.</p><p>About 250 people were believed to be on board the ship. Many of the survivors were taken on board Italian and Maltese ships.The incident occurred just over a week after at least 319 people drowned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/07/lampedusa-divers-bodies-hold-migrant-boat\" title=\"\">when a boat carrying Eritrean and Somali migrants sank near the southern Italian island of Lampedusa</a>.</p><p>Last week's disaster was one of the worst in a long migrant crisis that has seen tens of thousands of people arriving in small, unsafe boats in southern Italy. Lampedusa, a tiny island located midway between Sicily and Tunisia, has borne the brunt.</p><p>According to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, 32,000 have arrived in southern Italy and Malta this year alone, about two thirds of whom have filed requests for asylum.</p><p>Although most migrants come from sub-Saharan Africa, this year many are fleeing the Syrian civil war or political turmoil in Egypt and other parts of north Africa. Many are drawn by hopes of finding work in Europe and often do not stay in Italy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419740881|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|bd495585bc6c5e91efcdaad81b5e7c4e285959e1 -->",

The more seriously injured among them were being flown by helicopter to Lampedusa.</p><p>Passengers on board the boat had been able to make an emergency call with a satellite phone, which enabled rescuers to pinpoint their location, a spokesman for the Italian coastguard said.</p><p>A Maltese military plane was on the scene at around 4pm local time (2pm GMT) and dropped a liferaft to start the rescue operation, according to the smaller EU country's navy.</p><p>The head of the Italian Red Cross said the latest deaths were yet more proof that urgent steps needed to be taken to open humanitarian corridors to protect migrant boats.</p><p>\"Reading the news that is coming out about a new tragedy at sea, I feel anger and bitterness. There is a need for concrete action, as we have said repeatedly, more than words,\" said Francesco Rocca in a statement.</p><p>\"This is the dramatic proof of everything we have been saying up to today: that we need to take urgent measures to open humanitarian corridors. There is no time to lose.\"</p><p>Even before the most recent disaster, it had become clear earlier on Friday that the potentially deadly perils of the crossing had not stopped the flow of migrants to Italian shores. The coastguard said that in five separate operations more than 500 migrants had been rescued in quick succession.</p><p>\"This is not just another wake-up call for Europe. This is the time for action,\" Muscat said, adding he had spoken to his Italian counterpart to discuss the latest disaster.</p><p>\"This is a European problem, not a problem for Italy or Malta only.\"</p><p>Italy is asking for more EU support and an overhaul of the bloc's immigration rules after last week's shipwreck.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419758723|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|2cfbff4ee9c3c5cb10cadd079e7378c5771806da -->",

The resettlement programme he has set up is one the European Union would do well to study as it wakes up to the waves of refugees pouring into Europe from Eritrea, Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p>Lucano, a hyperactive former schoolteacher who looks younger than his 54 years, walked out on to the balcony of the palazzo perched over the winding alleys of Riace that he has turned into a \"welcome centre\" for immigrants, offering Italian classes to children, setting up parents with jobs and handing out tokens that can be exchanged for food in local shops.</p><p>\"That house has been taken by an Egyptian family, that one by an Eritrean family,\" he says proudly, jabbing his finger at the tiled rooftops of the village, which is now home to 180 refugees.</p><p>Lucano sprang into action in 1998 when 200 Kurds fleeing the savage Turkish-Kurdish conflict landed on a beach near Riace. Instead of watching them get packed off to one of Italy's grim holding centres, he offered them houses in the village that had been abandoned as the local population dwindled.</p><p>\"My parents always taught me to welcome strangers,\" he said.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419805319'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/12/1381614341372/Children-at-Riace-s-nurse-010.jpg' alt='Children at Riace’s nursery school' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Children at Riace’s nursery school.

This term, the nursery school boasts eight nationalities. \"Integration is spontaneous, and the foreign kids are sharp – they learn faster than the Italians,\" said one teacher, Anna&nbsp;Niciforo.</p><p>After school last week, a gaggle of African children heading home with their satchels waved at the elderly Italian men lined up on chairs for a gossip outside the barber shop.</p><p>\"The village was in danger of becoming extinct as people disappeared to northern Italy for jobs during the economic boom,\" said Lucano. \"One village near Turin has more people from Riace than Riace itself.\"</p><p>Lucano describes the Italians who work with him in the centre as \"potential emigrants who didn't leave\", thanks to the migrant scheme. The centre is a mix of races. As he spoke a grey-bearded Egyptian Coptic priest wandered in, handing out homemade bread before heading out to hold Orthodox mass for Christian Africans in the local church.</p><p>Working with the team as an interpreter is Ethiopian Lemlem Tesfahun, 31, who recalled how Lucano drove her to Riace a decade ago from an immigrant holding centre in Calabria. \"It was like a jail there,\" she said. \"I didn't know where I was and cried every day to be&nbsp;released.\"</p><p>Today, local funding has spurred the opening of artisan workshops where migrants can earn a wage learning trades that were dying out locally. At the glassmaker just past the ceramics workshop, an Afghan woman who fled the Taliban is concentrating on a glass mosaic, while across the street at the embroidery shop, Nigerian Tayo Amoo, 34, is learning the tricks of the trade from a Riace woman who originally learned her skills from local nuns.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419805320'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/12/1381614691953/Tayo-Amoo-apprentice-embr-001.jpg' alt='Tayo Amoo, apprentice embroiderer' width='220' height='339' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tayo Amoo, apprentice embroiderer.

With a stable of 13 animals, the next step is to sell donkey's milk.</p><p>While Lucano waits to hear if the Italian government will send him any of the 155 survivors from the vessel that sank off Lampedusa more than a week ago, and as Italy reels from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/11/migrant-boat-capsizes-sicily\" title=\"\">another fatal sinking on Friday 60 miles from the same island</a>, a group of Eritreans has arrived after surviving a panicked landing in Sicily last month, where 13 drowned as they tried to leap from their vessel. \"They have given us everything here – so far so good,\" said Fasil Hidad, 46, who was still nursing a bruised eye after being punched by his minders when he refused to get on the overloaded boat as it prepared to leave Libya. Now, after leaving his wife and children in Eritrea to escape the country's brutal military conscription, and after handing over $7,400 for the trip over desert and sea to Italy, he said he was itching to work.</p><p>Lucano's efforts have not been universally appreciated. Apparently irked by his growing influence, the local 'Ndrangheta mafia shot through the windows of a restaurant where he was eating in 2009 and poisoned two of his dogs. Last year, a bureaucratic error temporarily halted funding for the migrant programme, which meant shopkeepers refused to accept immigrants' tokens. As mothers ran out of milk for their children, protesting migrants blocked the highway with upturned rubbish bins and Lucano threatened to go on hunger strike.</p><p>Even when the funding flows smoothly, many refugees choose to move on from Riace when their asylum papers come through. \"There are no opportunities in Italy – I need to get to Holland to carry on my veterinary studies,\" said Eritrean Awtsana Issak Kahsay, 29, who arrived on the same boat as Hadid.</p><p>Locals admit that goodwill towards migrants is partly linked to the government funding they bring – €25 to €30 per migrant per day – and the social service jobs they generate. \"Many people here are unemployed, so this means work for us too,\" said Monica Audino, who works for an agency helping new arrivals file asylum claims and find accommodation.</p><p>But whatever the hurdles, Riace's experiment marks a dramatic U-turn away from Calabria's traditional fear of foreigners following centuries of attacks by pirates. This is why villages such as Riace were built up in the hills, away from the vulnerable coast.</p><p>\"Whatever the challenges, this has to be a better solution for migrants than being locked up in a holding centre where their children cannot go to school,\" said local Francesca Salerno.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419805321'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/12/1381614439750/Bahram-Acar-a-Kurd-who-ar-010.jpg' alt='Bahram Acar, a Kurd who arrived by accident in Riace' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Bahram Acar, a Kurd who arrived by accident in Riace while fleeing the Turkish-Kurdish conflict in the 1990s.

        "headline":"Italy to triple Mediterranean naval and air units to address migrant safety",
        "body":"<p>Italy is to triple its air and sea presence in the Mediterranean between north Africa and Sicily in a bid to make it \"as safe as possible\" for migrants making the perilous journey in overcrowded rickety boats, the prime minister, Enrico Letta, has said.</p><p>Speaking after a fortnight during which at least 390 people lost their lives in disasters involving capsized vessels, Letta announced that Italy would on Monday launch a military and humanitarian mission in the part of the Mediterranean he said had been \"turned into a tomb\" in recent days.</p><p>\"We will spend a lot of money. We will triple the naval and air units that are currently working in the Strait of Sicily,\" he was quoted by La Repubblica as saying on Saturday.</p><p>Italy has repeatedly called for co-ordinated action by the European Union to tackle the crisis on its doorstep, and the issue looks set to feature prominently at a summit on 24 October.</p><p>But, he said, the issue needed to be tackled immediately and \"we cannot wait for European decisions to be taken and acted on\".</p><p>\"We will work so that Europe tackles it but on the other hand we will immediately do our bit,\" he said.</p><p>\"I can therefore announce that on Monday an Italian military and humanitarian mission will be launched – by sea and air – in order to make the part of the Mediterranean that in recent days has been transformed into a tomb as safe as possible.\"</p><p></p><p>The exact logistical details of the Italian mission were not immediately clear. Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported that unmanned Predator drones were being considered for use in surveillance. A spokesman for Letta said the full details would be made public by Monday, and would not comment further.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, Letta's Maltese counterpart, Joseph Muscat, said Europe was turning the Mediterranean  into a \"cemetery\" through its failure to deal with the migrant surge.</p><p>\"I don't know how many more people need to die at sea before something gets done,\" Muscat told the BBC. \"The fact is that as things stand, we are just building a cemetery within our Mediterranean Sea,\" he said. \"Until now we have encountered statements, words but little more than that.\"</p><p>The interventions came after another 34 bodies were recovered from the latest stricken vessel that sank south of Sicily on Friday. More than 200 passengers were rescued. Some of the survivors say they were shot at by another vessel soon after they left Libya.</p><p>Meanwhile, a further 19 bodies were found in a boat that sank last week, bringing the death toll from that incident to 358.</p><p>Italian naval spokesman Commander Marco Maccaroni said his units also rescued  180 people from other boats in the same area overnight in a further indication of the relentless flows of migrants braving the Mediterranean.</p><p>\"The flows have never stopped, especially over the summer months,\" Maccaroni said. \"The two accidents in such a short period have raised the attention of the public, but the tensions have been going on all summer.\"</p><p>More than 30,000 migrants arrived in Italy and Malta in the first nine months of 2013, compared with 15,000 in all of 2012, according to the UN refugee agency.</p><p></p><p>The majority leave from Libya, which has emerged as something of a funnel for migrants from as far afield as Senegal, Somalia and Syria. The number who left Libya rose sharply in September, according to the UNHCR. In all, 4,619 people left Libya for southern Europe in September on a total of 32 boats. In September 2012, the corresponding figure was 775.</p><p>\"The numbers are unprecedented,\" said Emmanuel Gignac, chief of the UNHCR mission in Libya. \"Why it is happening is a good question. Lack of border controls, lack of capacity, and war.\"</p><p></p><p>The UN secretary-general, Ban-Ki-moon, called for action to prevent future tragedies \"that places the vulnerability and human rights of migrants at the centre\", while Pope Francis lamented that \"too often we are blinded by our comfortable lives, and refuse to see those dying at our doorstep\".</p><p>At least 70,000 Syrians are registered in Egypt as refugees. Many, including thousands of Palestinians who  fled the war in Syria, are not registered and use the country as a stopover before making the perilous sea trip to Europe.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419826431|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|22473b5c9c28922caaa41a684dce61d188944d19 -->",

        "body":"<p>There are so many African migrants in Libya wanting to make the dangerous trip to Europe that Tripoli zoo has been turned into a processing centre for them.</p><p>With the country's 22 refugee centres overflowing, the zoo – closed since the 2011 uprising – is being used to handle those picked up on the streets. More than 50 people are brought there every day.</p><p>\"The numbers arriving here are changing in an unbelievable way,\" said Said Ben Suleiman, deputy commander of 20 Support Brigade, which operates the detention centre. \"We deport 10 and we find hundreds coming back.\"</p><p>The smuggling gangs stay one step ahead of the authorities. As police have stepped up their ability to catch people traffickers, so smugglers have developed a new and dangerous way to avoid capture.</p><p>\"Traffickers make sure they're nowhere near the migrants when the boats arrive to pick them up,\" Suleiman said. \"What they do, they buy a cheap boat, then they give one of the migrants the keys, so the captain is chosen from among them. It means they go to sea with no training.\"</p><p>He thinks this practice may have led to the Lampedusa boat disaster, as migrants head to the sea with neither training nor navigational skills.</p><p>However, he does not expect the disaster to deter would-be migrants. \"These guys don't care, all they are thinking is get to Europe.\"</p><p>Many arrive in Tripoli unable to afford the journey, with prices for a place on a boat starting at €1,000 (£850). \"They all have in the back of their mind that Europe is better than Libya, but the trip is a lot of money,\" he said. \"They all want it [Europe], but they can't all afford it.\"</p><p>For those facing deportation it is hard to know what to feel: pity that all those hard miles have come to nothing, or relief they won't be attempting the parlous journey north.</p><p>Abdul Rahman Ali, a 27-year-old from Niger who is expecting deportation after being picked up by police, paid smugglers a total of 700 dinars (£350) to make the long journey north across the Sahara to Tripoli.</p><p>Dressed in a gold-and-white striped shirt and sandals, he said the first leg of his trip was the crossing from Niger over Libya's Sahara desert border to Sabha, capital of Libya's southern Fezzan province: \"It was a four-day trip to Sabha in a 4x4. When we got there there was a new group [of smugglers] and we had to pay again.</p><p>\"They took us in another pickup, 14 of us crammed under canvas so we would not be spotted. We drove up the main highway, but there are checkpoints so we kept having to detour through desert.\"</p><p>Ali said he made the journey with two friends: one became sick in Sabha and returned to Niger, the other was arrested two days after arriving in Tripoli.</p><p>Back home, he says, conditions are grim and wages low. \"In Niger there is work, but its maybe 10 [dinar] a day. In Libya you can earn five times that. Everyone I know wants to migrate.\"</p><p>People smuggling is big business in a country where economic stagnation is the rule. The most popular embarkation point in the capital is not some out-of-the-way port, but Gagaresh, the capital's equivalent of Oxford Street.</p><p>A glass-fronted branch of Debenhams has just opened here, across the road from Marks and Spencer, but a few streets away the beachfront is home to a very different trade.</p><p>The long smooth beach is ideal for the people-smugglers to bring their boats, and local residents are used to the tell-tale lanterns of the migrants on the beach at night.</p><p>\"Just before Ramadan we caught 90 people trying to leave Gagaresh beach in a little boat for Italy. They have pregnant women on these boats – there was a baby a few months old,\" said Suleiman.</p><p>The International Office of Migration said Libya has yet to request an assistance programme, and repatriation flights it runs for some Africans to return home are rejected by asylum seekers from the horn of Africa. \"We have an active program of voluntary repatriation but nobody goes back to Somalia or Eritrea,\" said IOM spokesman Chris Lom.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419848221|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|52eb22516d82a07f6b890b20c90c120046c67f30 -->",

        "body":"<p>There are so many African migrants in Libya wanting to make the dangerous trip to Europe that Tripoli zoo has been turned into a processing centre for them.</p><p>With the country's 22 refugee centres overflowing, the zoo – closed since the 2011 uprising – is being used to handle those picked up on the streets. More than 50 people are brought there every day.</p><p>\"The numbers arriving here are changing in an unbelievable way,\" said Said Ben Suleiman, deputy commander of 20 Support Brigade, which operates the detention centre. \"We deport 10 and we find hundreds coming back.\"</p><p>The smuggling gangs stay one step ahead of the authorities. As police have stepped up their ability to catch people traffickers, so smugglers have developed a new and dangerous way to avoid capture.</p><p>\"Traffickers make sure they're nowhere near the migrants when the boats arrive to pick them up,\" Suleiman said. \"What they do, they buy a cheap boat, then they give one of the migrants the keys, so the captain is chosen from among them. It means they go to sea with no training.\"</p><p>He thinks this practice may have led to the Lampedusa boat disaster, as migrants head to the sea with neither training nor navigational skills.</p><p>However, he does not expect the disaster to deter would-be migrants. \"These guys don't care, all they are thinking is get to Europe.\"</p><p>Many arrive in Tripoli unable to afford the journey, with prices for a place on a boat starting at €1,000 (£850). \"They all have in the back of their mind that Europe is better than Libya, but the trip is a lot of money,\" he said. \"They all want it [Europe], but they can't all afford it.\"</p><p>For those facing deportation it is hard to know what to feel: pity that all those hard miles have come to nothing, or relief they won't be attempting the parlous journey north.</p><p>Abdul Rahman Ali, a 27-year-old from Niger who is expecting deportation after being picked up by police, paid smugglers a total of 700 dinars (£350) to make the long journey north across the Sahara to Tripoli.</p><p>Dressed in a gold-and-white striped shirt and sandals, he said the first leg of his trip was the crossing from Niger over Libya's Sahara desert border to Sabha, capital of Libya's southern Fezzan province: \"It was a four-day trip to Sabha in a 4x4. When we got there there was a new group [of smugglers] and we had to pay again.</p><p>\"They took us in another pickup, 14 of us crammed under canvas so we would not be spotted. We drove up the main highway, but there are checkpoints so we kept having to detour through desert.\"</p><p>Ali said he made the journey with two friends: one became sick in Sabha and returned to Niger, the other was arrested two days after arriving in Tripoli.</p><p>Back home, he says, conditions are grim and wages low. \"In Niger there is work, but its maybe 10 [dinar] a day. In Libya you can earn five times that. Everyone I know wants to migrate.\"</p><p>People smuggling is big business in a country where economic stagnation is the rule. The most popular embarkation point in the capital is not some out-of-the-way port, but Gagaresh, the capital's equivalent of Oxford Street.</p><p>A glass-fronted branch of Debenhams has just opened here, across the road from Marks and Spencer, but a few streets away the beachfront is home to a very different trade.</p><p>The long smooth beach is ideal for the people-smugglers to bring their boats, and local residents are used to the tell-tale lanterns of the migrants on the beach at night.</p><p>\"Just before Ramadan we caught 90 people trying to leave Gagaresh beach in a little boat for Italy. They have pregnant women on these boats – there was a baby a few months old,\" said Suleiman.</p><p>The International Office of Migration said Libya has yet to request an assistance programme, and repatriation flights it runs for some Africans to return home are rejected by asylum seekers from the horn of Africa. \"We have an active program of voluntary repatriation but nobody goes back to Somalia or Eritrea,\" said IOM spokesman Chris Lom.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419848221|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|52eb22516d82a07f6b890b20c90c120046c67f30 -->",

        "headline":"EU urged to tackle boat people crisis in Mediterranean",
        "body":"<p>The EU came under mounting pressure at the weekend to relieve a worsening refugee emergency in the Mediterranean, as leaders of southern member states called for urgent action to prevent the sea becoming a \"tomb\" for thousands fleeing north from Libya to Malta or Italy.</p><p>With dozens more dying in the waters separating the two continents at the weekend, and latest UN figures showing an acceleration in the numbers risking all in death-trap vessels leaving the Libyan coast, the Italian and Maltese prime ministers insisted that the EU tackle the boat people issue at its summit next week.</p><p>The Italian prime minister, Enrico Letta, said Italy could not even wait that long, and would  from Monday start the process of tripling its naval and air presence in the Strait of Sicily, the stretch of water in which at least 390 people have died in the last 10 days.</p><p>\"We will spend a lot of money,\" Letta said of Italy's planned \"military-humanitarian mission\". \"We will work so that Europe tackles it but on the other hand we will immediately do our bit,\" he said.</p><p>Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, said the EU had to act or it would face the same macabre spectacle on its southern rim again and again. \"If nothing changes we will be reporting more deaths next year and there will be consternation for a couple of days, a couple of headlines, but then we will return to life as usual,\" he said.</p><p>Muscat said southern states need more help from across the EU in patrolling the Mediterranean.</p><p>\"We're not really what you might call a military superpower. But we find ourselves patrolling the European frontiers. We want to give a more humane dimension to all this, but we need resources. It's not an issue of throwing money at the problem. It's an issue of having a more European approach.</p><p>\"I would like to hope that these tragedies that took place over the past week or so have opened up new avenues of political will.\"</p><p>According to UNHCR figures, 2013 represents one of the largest movements of migrants across the Mediterranean, with the numbers accelerating fast. More than 4,600 left Libya in September, compared to 755 in the same month last year. Of the 32,000 who have landed in Italy this year so far, 7,500 are Syrian and a further 7,500 Eritrean.</p><p>\"The numbers are unprecedented,\" said Emmanuel Gignac, chief of the UNHCR mission in Libya. \"Why it is happening is a good question. Lack of border controls, lack of capacity, and war.\"</p><p>As the numbers rise, so the body count has risen too: 34 bodies retrieved from the latest stricken vessel that sank south of Sicily on Friday; 12 dead in a shipwreck off the Egyptian coast; and a further 19 bodies found in a boat that sank just off Lampedusa 10 days ago, bring the toll from that particular disaster to 358.</p><p>Italian naval spokesman, Commander Marco Maccaroni, said his units also rescued 180 people from other boats at the weekend in a further indication of the relentless numbers of migrants braving the Mediterranean. \"The flows have never stopped, especially over the summer months,\" Maccaroni said. \"The two accidents in such a short period have raised the attention of the public but the tensions have been going on all summer.\"</p><p>EU leaders will confront the issue at the summit on 24 October. French president François Hollande has insisted that the issue be given top priority on the basis of \"prevention, protection and solidarity\".</p><p>But a draft of the concluding statement from the summit, obtained by the Guardian, makes no mention of the crisis. There is little appetite among Europe's national governments for any surrender to Brussels of authority over immigration policies. With far-right anti-immigration parties on the rise across large parts of Europe, governments are also little inclined to shift to more open or generous policies.</p><p>Northern EU countries are reluctant to commit much more resources, noting that their refugee burden is much higher than Italy's, despite the tragedies occurring with increasing frequency in the Mediterranean. The number of asylum-seekers reaching Germany last year was more than four times the figure for Italy.  Four northern EU states, including Britain, received more asylum-seekers than Italy last year.</p><p>Rome, arguing that this is a European and not an Italian problem, is clamouring for help. The Letta government conferred posthumous Italian citizenship on the drowned off Lampedusa. But the survivors of the tragedy are held in an island containment centre and face prosecution, meaning possible fines or deportation, for illegal entry. The German government maintains that the bulk of the boat people are \"economic migrants\" seeking to benefit from more generous European welfare and social security payments.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419848640|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|eff38dbe4a50e8ad80f5cd275179550137e0cedc -->",

        "body":"<p>In the early morning half light, Ajad Miccoli stops his scooter on his way to work and contemplates the scene unfolding across the scruffy, shuttered-up bay. What he sees is both familiar and eerily disturbing. At the quayside, beside a hut advertising seafood treats and boats offering \"sunset aperitivi\", a ship with dozens of people on board has docked to unload its exhausted cargo. Altogether there are 210 new arrivals – mostly Syrians, with some Eritreans and Nigerians. Thirty-seven are children. Miraculously, after a perilous journey thought to have begun on the Libyan coast, they are in relatively good condition. One man waves to reporters from the window of a bus sent to drive them away from the port. \"These people have probably known death,\" says Miccoli, a local musician. \"Here, maybe, they have a hope.\"</p><p>\"Here\" is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampedusa\" title=\"\">Lampedusa</a>, the not-quite eight square miles of Italian territory in the Mediterranean that has become known the world over not for hope, but for tragedy. For years, its sparkling waters and postcard-pretty beaches have provided a jarring backdrop for migrant boat landings; the island is conveniently closer to Africa than Europe – around 70 miles from the Tunisian coast and further south than Malta. But even for a place well-acquainted with human suffering, the horror brought to its coastline in the past fortnight has been a shock. \"It's awful,\" says Pietro Riso, a fisherman watching Tuesday morning's first arrival. (Soon after there was another boat at the dock – this time carrying 90, including four pregnant women.) \"These landings have been going on for about 20 years. But these last disasters have upset the balance. You get up in the morning and you don't know what to expect.\"</p><p>In the early hours of 3 October, near a beach once declared the \"world's best\" by users of TripAdvisor, a boat packed with more than 500 Eritrean men, women and children caught fire and capsized. Only 155 people survived, and 364 bodies have since been recovered. It was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/07/lampedusa-divers-bodies-hold-migrant-boat\" title=\"\">one of the worst disasters to occur in the Mediterranean in recent years</a>. Absolutes are hard to establish when many victims, in the grip of an illicit people-smuggling trade, are never recovered. As the images of tiny white coffins and vivid testimony from survivors went around the world, tragedy struck again. On Friday night, Maltese and Italian rescuers raced to the site of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/11/two-dozen-killed-boat-capsizes-lampedusa\" title=\"\">another stricken vessel</a>, this time carrying mostly Syrians fleeing their war-torn country. More than 200 people were saved, but at least 38 died.</p><p>The double tragedy has prompted outrage from prime ministers, presidents and the pope, who had chosen Lampedusa for his first papal visit outside Rome in July. But, on the ground, locals are not setting much store by their words. When José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, and Enrico Letta, the Italian premier, visited the island, they were <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24456058\" title=\"\">greeted with heckles </a>by people who feel abandoned by both Rome and Brussels. \"I hope that they have finally understood something,\" says Riso. \"This is a political task. We are fisherman and workers, and we do workers' work. Now the politicians must do their bit. Because we can't tolerate so many deaths.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420226723'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381947272276/survivor-of-shipwreck-001.jpg' alt='survivor of shipwreck' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A survivor of the 3 October shipwreck looks out over the water at Lampedusa. Photograph: Tullio M Puglia/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Up and down the main street of Lampedusa's town centre, a pleasant promenade dotted with pavement cafes and tourist shops, the stories of those deaths – and people who survived – are everywhere. There are more mundane realities that follow in the wake of a disaster. Three Eritrean women who have come from Sweden to identify their dead relatives struggle through red-tape to replace a missing passport. A couple of Syrians, smoking and drinking black coffee out of plastic cups, wonder how to celebrate Eid al-Adha.</p><p>Sitting on a bench, Sium Mulugeta waits for money from a friend to buy new clothes and a phone. He was on the boat that went down on 3 October with his best friend, Tewelde Bereket. The pair had been at university together in Eritrea, Mulugeta studying chemical engineering, Tewelde applied geography. They had left their home country and been in Ethiopia and Uganda together. And they had the same dream: of reaching Europe and building better lives for themselves and their families.</p><p>But after their boat from Libya ran into trouble, Mulugeta survived and his friend did not. \"He didn't know how to swim. That was the problem,\" he says. \"When the fire happened, I&nbsp;immediately jumped into the water … I&nbsp;swam for four to five hours. I was near, almost to the coast, when help came.\" Now Mulugeta, like many of the Eritrean survivors and victims' relatives, is determined to return his friend's body to his homeland. At the moment, it is among the coffins buried in a cemetery on the mainland of Sicily. Mulugeta knows, because it was up to him to identify the corpse.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420226724'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381947036986/coffins-at-Lampedusa-airp-001.jpg' alt='coffins at Lampedusa airport' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Coffins of some of the victims of the 3 October disaster in a hangar at Lampedusa airport. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Like the majority of the migrants who have arrived in Lampedusa this year – a total of 13,078 so far, according to the Italian interior ministry – the polite, quietly-spoken 26-year-old comes from a country that, due to internal conflict and repression, is deemed \"refugee-producing\". According to figures from the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, more people have arrived on Italian shores from Syria and Eritrea this year than any other country. Somalia, another nation in turmoil, is the third biggest country of provenance. Between them, these nations account for more than 18,000 people. There is clearly no shortage of people for whom the huge risks of the sea crossing outweigh those of staying at home. \"We knew it was very dangerous. Everybody knows,\" says Mulugeta. \"There are 10-year-old children who know that. But we don't have any option.\"</p><p>Almost exactly the same words come from Nisar Salam Aish, a 41-year-old husband and father from Damascus whose family has fled to Jordan and who hopes that, once he has established himself in Europe, he will be able to bring them to join him. \"It was very difficult,\" he says of the journey from Zuwarah in Libya – for which he says he paid smugglers $2,000. \"There were about 300 men and women, many children. I can't believe I am in Italy, alive. But there is not any choice for us.\"</p><p>Under the still-hot October sun, the Syrian breaks down in tears as he recounts his brother's fatal shooting earlier this year in the civil war. His wife and two children, aged five and 11, first fled to Daraa, near the border with Jordan. But because of the ongoing violence, they left the country altogether. He, meanwhile, decided he could no longer stay in Damascus, so left for Egypt for two months, then Libya for three months – all to get to Lampedusa, where he does not want to be at all. \"If I stay in Italy I am better off going back to Syria to be under the bombs of Assad,\" he says. \"We are coming to Europe to change our lives.\"</p><p>The Syrian is not alone in his reluctance to stay in Italy, although, according to EU rules, he must apply for asylum in his first point of entry into the bloc. \"Most of the [migrants] tell us they moved on to improve their living conditions and they don't believe that if they stay in Italy this will happen,\" says Carlotta Bellini, head of child protection at <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.it\" title=\"\">Save the Children Italy</a>, one of a cluster of NGOs with a permanent presence at the reception centre in Lampedusa. \"They say the [Italian] protection and reception system is not appropriate for their needs. They believe that other EU countries, for example Sweden, can instead guarantee the right to study, the right to work, the right to have an appropriate house.\" Another big issue, she says, is that newly arrived people often want to go where there are already established communities and support networks.</p><p>If the boat passengers are unsure about Italy before they arrived in Lampedusa, the facilities on the island are not, at the moment, likely to change their minds. Surrounded by sloping shrubland outside the town, the reception centre to which the migrants are taken is currently hugely overcrowded. The numbers fluctuate daily, but on Tuesday afternoon it had 905 registered migrants, including 142 minors, both with families and without. The centre – an entire wing of which lies burned out after a fire several years ago – has space for 250, maximum 300, people.</p><p>\"The centre is in a critical condition. We want people to be transferred [to other centres on the Italian mainland] as soon as possible,\" says Maurizio Molina, senior protection associate at UNHCR Italy and one of the team working at the centre in the aftermath of this month's disasters. \"Many people are sleeping rough because in the centre there are not enough places.\"</p><p>Molina admits to  feeling tired. He is trying to connect families who were separated in the joint Maltese-Italian rescue mission on Friday. As a first-level reception centre, the Lampedusa facility is not supposed to house people for \"more than 48 hours, 76 at the very most\" before transferring them to the mainland for more sophisticated asylum screening, says Viviana Valastro of Save the Children Italy. But in recent weeks this has gone out of the window. NGO workers say there simply is not enough give in the system – not only in Lampedusa, but in Italy as a whole.</p><p>Most worryingly for Valastro is the situation of the children. \"This is not an environment for [them],\" she says, standing at the gates.</p><p>Behind her, as dusk falls, families ready makeshift camps for the night, a Syrian flag can be seen hanging amid the trees, and children play with balls in the very limited space. Sicilian regional authorities have declared a state of emergency on the island, a move that should free up funds for aid workers. Valastro is also pleased that they have at last won permission to let minors out to play in a special child-friendly area for two hours every morning and two hours every afternoon. \"We had to fight  the police for it,\" she says.</p><p>Surveying the camp from on high, above the hillsides strung with washing lines and studded with groups of potential refugees, Emanuele Billardello, a genial taxi driver born and bred in Lampedusa, says he feels great sadness. He remembers when the island was a place known not for migrant deaths and institutional failures, but cheap and cheerful tourism. Now it is different – even if the tourist industry, decimated in 2011 during the Arab Spring when huge numbers of migrants paralysed the island, picked up this year due to continued violence in Egypt, the visit of the pope, and – of course – the TripAdvisor fame of <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g262047-d568915-Reviews-Rabbit_Beach-Lampedusa_Islands_of_Sicily_Sicily.html\" title=\"\"><em>spiaggia dei conigli</em></a> – literally, \"rabbits' beach\".</p><p>But, in its own way, Lampedusa is building itself a new identity – one of collective compassion and solidarity with those most marginalised. Last week, there were even suggestions it should win the Nobel prize for peace. That might be going a bit far, but there is a growing sense that the island is, in its opposition to reactionary immigration laws, leading the way for the rest of the country.</p><p>This can, of course, come at a price. Posters in shop and bar windows advertise the counselling services of psychologists from the <a href=\"http://www.orderofmalta.int/latest-interventions/68966/the-lampedusa-boat-tragedy-nonstop-the-work-of-the-italian-relief-corps-of-the-order-of-malta/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Order of Malta's Italian Relief Corps</a> (CISOM), on hand not only to help victims' relatives and rescuers, but also the locals themselves. \"This is a welcoming population, maybe the most welcoming there is, because they do not make a distinction between Italians and foreigners,\" says Giovanni Matera. \"It's a population which has always been a place of transit. So the migrants are perfectly integrated with the Italians, and for this reason they experience the same pain.\"</p><p>For many, the person who has come to symbolise the locals' mixture of political anger and human compassion is the island's mayor, Giusi Nicolini, of whom Billardello says succinctly: \"She's a woman who is trying to do the right thing.\" It is Nicolini who has led Lampedusa's fight against Italy's harsh immigration laws that, among other things, treat illegal immigration as a crime punishable by a hefty fine, dissuade people from helping vessels in trouble for fear of being accused of aiding illegal immigration, and mean prosecutors are expected to place newly arrived migrants – even the survivors of the 3 October disaster – under investigation.</p><p>Letta has said he feels ashamed of these laws, brought in when the rightwing, xenophobic <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/59a7aa5c-58a7-11e2-bd9e-00144feab49a.html#axzz2htVI886a\" title=\"\">Northern League was in government with Silvio Berlusconi</a>, and would abolish them if it was up to him. But problems in his grand coalition – which he shares with the centre-right – may make that difficult. In Lampedusa, however, the message from Nicolini is clear. \"The law should be abolished immediately,\" she said earlier this month. \"Immediately.\"</p><p>The government in Rome has launched its own \"military-humanitarian\" mission in the Mediterranean around Lampedusa that will increase sea patrols, while at the same time urging the EU to take a greater share of the burden. NGOs, meanwhile, are keen for the authorities to move beyond crisis management of the arrivals – who have been coming in huge numbers since the early 2000s – and to improve what they say is the creaking and inadequate reception system for asylum-seekers in Italy.</p><p>Nowhere will the political players be watched more closely than from Lampedusa, where the coffins of the 3 October victims have gone, but the memories linger. \"It seems almost impossible that things like this still happen,\" says Miccoli, watching the early morning arrivals from the port. \"But certainly it's been happening for years. Now, we hope, the politicians might finally be listening.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420182201|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|3d666afd6f3a6309b9fb19200a4e859f8dbc78d5 -->",

        "body":"<p>The mayor of Lampedusa has said she is \"extremely saddened\" by the Italian government's failure to hold a state funeral for the hundreds of Eritreans who died at sea off the island's coast earlier this month.</p><p>Italy's interior ministry has announced that, contrary to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/lampedusa-shipwreck-italy-state-funeral-migrants\" title=\"\">declaration made by the prime minister, Enrico Letta,</a> in the immediate aftermath of the 3 October disaster,  the at least 364 victims will be given a memorial ceremony on Monday – with the presence of government representatives but none of the dead.</p><p>Instead of being held on the Mediterranean island, which has seen more than 13,000 migrants and potential refugees arrive on its shores this year, the ceremony will take place in the seaside town of San Leone on the main island of Sicily. The dead have been buried in various cemeteries on the bigger island.</p><p>\"I am extremely saddened that this commemoration, even though it is belated and for bodies which have already been buried, is not being held in Lampedusa,\" the island's mayor, Giusi Nicolini, told La Repubblica, saying she would not be attending Monday's ceremony as she had an appointment in Rome with the Italian president.</p><p>\"My community does not deserve to not be involved and to be made to fit in with a decision already taken. I have said it before: if they had told us they would be taking away the coffins, we would have arranged for these people to have if not state funerals at least national funerals,\" she added.</p><p>Nicolini had made clear her anger at the authorities' failure to keep their promise on Tuesday, when she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/giusi_nicolini/status/390094311238672384\" title=\"\">tweeted that she had \"casually learned\"</a> that bodies taken from Lampedusa in coffins were being buried in several different cemeteries \"without funerals\". When visiting Lampedusa after the disaster, Letta said the victims would be given state funerals – an announcement that was however later modified to \"solemn funerals\".</p><p>An interior ministry spokesman said this week the bodies needed to be buried swiftly \"for sanitary reasons\". The minister for integration, Cécile Kyenge, said the authorities had faced many bureaucratic and logistical difficulties in the process of identifying the dead and fulfilling their families' requests.</p><p>In the absence of a unified plan, some Sicilian locals have taken it upon themselves to give the victims a dignified farewell.</p><p>On Thursday, in the town of Valledolmo, five coffins brought to the local cemetery were met by local authorities and given a proper funeral as a sign of \"human solidarity to those who were trying to flee hunger, poverty and war and find freedom\".</p><p>\"We are proud to give these bodies a proper burial,\" the mayor, Luigi Favari, was quoted as telling the local news website Si24.it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420347158|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|49c00857a33a68fb24cd092e992099544657da19 -->",
