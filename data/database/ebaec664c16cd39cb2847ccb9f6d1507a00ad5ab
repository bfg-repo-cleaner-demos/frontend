        "body":"<p>On Tuesday night, in the last hour of the working day and the final metaphorical hour of their credibility, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/05/lobbying-bill-paused-six-weeks-government-rethink\" title=\"\">government agreed to pause the second part of its lobbying bill</a>. We have many reasons to suspect this \"pause\", not least its newness. Like the \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20309441\" title=\"\">omnishambles</a>\" and the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/01/david-cameron-rebuked-over-debt-claims\" title=\"\">rebuke by a statistical authority</a>\", I don't remember anyone \"pausing\" before 2010. Looking at the <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/02/23/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nhs-reform-in-five-minutes\" title=\"\">pause in action</a> during the health and social care bill in 2011, it seems designed to concede enough small, technical things to humiliate its key defenders and bore everyone else into submission – while slipping in enough new, large things to show the world who was in charge once the government hit play again. Humiliation, shmumiliation! What doesn't unseat you makes you stronger.</p><p>Nonetheless, before we write off this particular pause, it marks a significant victory for this week's dry-sounding but firecrackingly page-turning report by the former Bishop of Oxford: Non-party Campaigning Ahead of Elections. It <a href=\"http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/19330\" title=\"\">read like a novel</a>. From the ex-bishop to the chief executive of Mumsnet, from the TaxPayers' Alliance to Amnesty International, from the joint select committee on human rights, through the … well, all the relevant committees, they rose as one, channelling the outrage of Joan of Arc through the baffled derision of (Elizabethan era) <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006xxw3\" title=\"\">Blackadder</a>.</p><p>\"This bill is an object lesson in how not to produce legislation,\" stated the political and constitutional reform select committee; \"we urge you to stop, to listen and to work with us,\" said Oxfam and the Women's Institute, among others. They called it perverse and terrifying and undemocratic, and pointed out that it had gone through no proper constitutional process. The report was so strongly worded that, had it only contained swearing, you would have assumed it was a spoof consultation paper on late-night Radio 4.</p><p>Why was this bill presented to parliament with only two working days to read it? In a massive, unprecedented shake-up of charities, why were no charities consulted? Why did Nick Clegg claim that the \"parts on third-party campaigning were discussed extensively by the three parties in the cross-party funded talks\" when nobody else can remember this extensive discussion, and one Labour MP, John Denham, suggested rather that they were \"never raised, never proposed and never discussed\"?</p><p>And the most obvious, pressing point belongs to Juliet Swann of the Electoral Reform Society in Scotland: \"What are they trying to prevent? What terrible thing has happened that they think this will stop from happening in the future? … Why are they trying to fix a hypothetical situation that you can't give me any examples of?\"</p><p>As little light as any of us can shine on the tearing up of due process and the inside of Clegg's troubled mind, I believe I can help with the \"hypothetical\" situation that this regulation seeks to fix. The government is attacking charities because it is terrified of them, and this is for a very good reason.</p><p>A few statistics have been plaguing MPs for some time. The National Trust has four million paying members; <a href=\"http://www.38degrees.org.uk\" title=\"\">38 Degrees</a> has 1.9 million (we don't have to pay subs but sometimes do anyway); many animal or wildlife charities boast 500,000 members. Membership of political parties, meanwhile, has fallen to 1%, or under 500,000 (in the three main parties combined). This means there are more people who care about birds than who can get meaningfully exercised about the victory of any particular candidate. If MPs are anxious about the impact a charity could have with a campaign they are dead right to be: just one petition from 38 Degrees could decimate a candidate's chances for years.</p><p>This has come to fixate the Commons – the idea that \"other political or campaigning organisations … are competing with parties for members\" (<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/commons/commonslibrary/\" title=\"\">House of Commons Library, 2012</a>). Is the National Trust seriously drawing away the Tory hardcore? Or is it possible that many people, beyond <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\" title=\"\">Russell Brand</a>, think that if a conventional politician is the answer, you have asked a really weird question? Do people need some other outlet for their civic spirit and sense of exuberant possibility?</p><p>Rather than asking these questions, politicians have determined that they can stave off this threat to their power by bringing down the third sector. Hubris combined with – in the kindest possible light – not giving themselves enough thinking time has resulted in a suggestion that, were charities sincerely to mobilise their supporters against it, it&nbsp;would fuel the closest thing we've seen to a revolution since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1651_in_England\" title=\"\">1651</a>.</p><p>No doubt in some blue-sky meeting, some sunny morning before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/02/steve-hilton-big-society-guru\" title=\"\">Steve Hilton</a> left, when everyone was still allowed to wear sandals and think of ways to turn the UK into a teeny, cut-price America, this seemed like a good idea: why do charities have to stick their oar in? Why can't they keep to what they're good at, delivering services we should be delivering – for free? Why can't we ask for some third-sector neutrality? You don't see Barack Obama getting his chain yanked by Child Poverty Action Group.</p><p>Tory politics is littered with Americanisms, from food parcels to free schools, cheap attempts to choke off decent state provision in the name of the free market, or \"freedom\" for short. But to attempt to strip charities of their right to campaign, damp down a philanthropic passion that is centuries old, that predates universal suffrage? It's so unlikely that it might even be fun to watch them try.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421827875|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|8c06c9650a14641cae087218088565e7e294bfef -->",

Like the \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20309441\" title=\"\">omnishambles</a>\" and the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/01/david-cameron-rebuked-over-debt-claims\" title=\"\">rebuke by a statistical authority</a>\", I don't remember anyone \"pausing\" before 2010. Looking at the <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/02/23/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nhs-reform-in-five-minutes\" title=\"\">pause in action</a> during the health and social care bill in 2011, it seems designed to concede enough small, technical things to humiliate its key defenders and bore everyone else into submission – while slipping in enough new, large things to show the world who was in charge once the government hit play again. Humiliation, shmumiliation! What doesn't unseat you makes you stronger.</p><p>Nonetheless, before we write off this particular pause, it marks a significant victory for this week's dry-sounding but firecrackingly page-turning report by the former Bishop of Oxford: Non-party Campaigning Ahead of Elections. It <a href=\"http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/19330\" title=\"\">read like a novel</a>. From the ex-bishop to the chief executive of Mumsnet, from the TaxPayers' Alliance to Amnesty International, from the joint select committee on human rights, through the … well, all the relevant committees, they rose as one, channelling the outrage of Joan of Arc through the baffled derision of (Elizabethan era) <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006xxw3\" title=\"\">Blackadder</a>.</p><p>\"This bill is an object lesson in how not to produce legislation,\" stated the political and constitutional reform select committee; \"we urge you to stop, to listen and to work with us,\" said Oxfam and the Women's Institute, among others. They called it perverse and terrifying and undemocratic, and pointed out that it had gone through no proper constitutional process. The report was so strongly worded that, had it only contained swearing, you would have assumed it was a spoof consultation paper on late-night Radio 4.</p><p>Why was this bill presented to parliament with only two working days to read it? In a massive, unprecedented shake-up of charities, why were no charities consulted? Why did Nick Clegg claim that the \"parts on third-party campaigning were discussed extensively by the three parties in the cross-party funded talks\" when nobody else can remember this extensive discussion, and one Labour MP, John Denham, suggested rather that they were \"never raised, never proposed and never discussed\"?</p><p>And the most obvious, pressing point belongs to Juliet Swann of the Electoral Reform Society in Scotland: \"What are they trying to prevent? What terrible thing has happened that they think this will stop from happening in the future? … Why are they trying to fix a hypothetical situation that you can't give me any examples of?\"</p><p>As little light as any of us can shine on the tearing up of due process and the inside of Clegg's troubled mind, I believe I can help with the \"hypothetical\" situation that this regulation seeks to fix. The government is attacking charities because it is terrified of them, and this is for a very good reason.</p><p>A few statistics have been plaguing MPs for some time. The National Trust has four million paying members; <a href=\"http://www.38degrees.org.uk\" title=\"\">38 Degrees</a> has 1.9 million (we don't have to pay subs but sometimes do anyway); many animal or wildlife charities boast 500,000 members. Membership of political parties, meanwhile, has fallen to 1%, or under 500,000 (in the three main parties combined). This means there are more people who care about birds than who can get meaningfully exercised about the victory of any particular candidate. If MPs are anxious about the impact a charity could have with a campaign they are dead right to be: just one petition from 38 Degrees could decimate a candidate's chances for years.</p><p>This has come to fixate the Commons – the idea that \"other political or campaigning organisations … are competing with parties for members\" (<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/commons/commonslibrary/\" title=\"\">House of Commons Library, 2012</a>). Is the National Trust seriously drawing away the Tory hardcore? Or is it possible that many people, beyond <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\" title=\"\">Russell Brand</a>, think that if a conventional politician is the answer, you have asked a really weird question? Do people need some other outlet for their civic spirit and sense of exuberant possibility?</p><p>Rather than asking these questions, politicians have determined that they can stave off this threat to their power by bringing down the third sector. Hubris combined with – in the kindest possible light – not giving themselves enough thinking time has resulted in a suggestion that, were charities sincerely to mobilise their supporters against it, it&nbsp;would fuel the closest thing we've seen to a revolution since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1651_in_England\" title=\"\">1651</a>.</p><p>No doubt in some blue-sky meeting, some sunny morning before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/02/steve-hilton-big-society-guru\" title=\"\">Steve Hilton</a> left, when everyone was still allowed to wear sandals and think of ways to turn the UK into a teeny, cut-price America, this seemed like a good idea: why do charities have to stick their oar in? Why can't they keep to what they're good at, delivering services we should be delivering – for free? Why can't we ask for some third-sector neutrality? You don't see Barack Obama getting his chain yanked by Child Poverty Action Group.</p><p>Tory politics is littered with Americanisms, from food parcels to free schools, cheap attempts to choke off decent state provision in the name of the free market, or \"freedom\" for short. But to attempt to strip charities of their right to campaign, damp down a philanthropic passion that is centuries old, that predates universal suffrage? It's so unlikely that it might even be fun to watch them try.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421827875|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|8c06c9650a14641cae087218088565e7e294bfef -->",

        "body":"<p>The government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lobbying\" title=\"\">lobbying bill </a>may be in trouble, but its attack on the confidentiality of union membership records continues in the&nbsp;Lords on Monday. To avoid what would have been a stonking defeat, ministers last week announced a \"pause\" on part two of this&nbsp;troubled bill, which would restrict free speech for groups other than political parties during an election campaign. The huge opposition it has provoked from across the political spectrum forced the government into this tactical retreat.</p><p>But this is no time to celebrate. The government has merely delayed debate in the House of Lords until December on part two – and it has brought forward to later on Monday the attacks on trade union membership contained in part three of the bill. They still aim to finish the bill by Christmas. Debating it in a different order is no victory for campaigners.</p><p>No one other than unions might be thought to be interested in plans for tying up union membership systems in blue tape. But there are wider questions at stake about how much personal data should be open to the state and its organs. The bill requires unions to appoint independent membership \"assurers\" from a list provided by government. These assurers, plus the government-appointed union regulator (the certification officer), and any other investigators appointed, will all have access to union membership records.</p><p>Any employer or political opponent of trade unionism will be able to make complaints about membership, which have to be investigated. As the extent of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/28/construction-industry-blacklisting-vince-cable\" title=\"\">blacklisting in the construction industry</a> has been revealed, members are&nbsp;naturally concerned at union lists being made open.</p><p>The government is unable to say why this section of the bill is needed. There is already a strong legal requirement on unions to have robust membership lists. Unions need efficient systems to collect subscriptions and they know that if there is anything dodgy about the membership in a strike ballot, the employer will win an injunction.</p><p>Freedom of information requests have established that no one has called on the government to introduce such a measure. And, according to its website, the Certification Office has received no complaints from trade union members relating to registers since 2004. On top of that, between 2000 and 2004 only six complaints were received – five of which were dismissed and no declaration was issued for the sixth.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.paultyler.libdems.org/coalitions-transparency-bill\" title=\"\">The Liberal Democrat spokesman Lord Tyler wrote</a>: \"The membership numbers of a trade union have a bearing on how much money they can give to a political party … in this sense, the trade unions have a unique role in UK politics. It is therefore important for transparency's sake that the membership lists are accurate.\" But only 15 of the 166 trade unions recorded by the certification officer are affiliated to the Labour party. And if unions are to be regulated because of their political role, why not regulate political party elections and membership lists? Parties have far more influence than unions do. Charles Moore, Margaret Thatcher's biographer, reports that she did not win the ballot to be selected as Finchley's Conservative candidate – the constituency chair fixed it for her.</p><p>Unions are also worried that membership accuracy will become a test that they can never pass. Any mass organisation's membership list is always changing and never absolutely accurate. People retire, change jobs and die without telling their union. A hostile certification officer could stir up constant trouble on the whim of employers, political opponents and anti-union groups.</p><p>Part three of this bill was written on the space left on the back of the envelope after ministers wrote part two's attack on free speech. But its threat to the confidentiality of union membership is just as chilling. Both should be put on permanent pause.<em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422125863|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|7e25ac95db79aade1cfb03a4d2e3187bc041f290 -->",

Concentrating the MPs' minds still further is the fact that several of them have distinctly slim majorities, several hovering around 1,000 and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/d38.stm\" title=\"\">in the case of Simon Wright in Norwich South, a mere 310</a>.</p><p>All the MPs at some point either supported or abstained on votes for the bill, which seeks to impose financial limits on spending &quot;for election purposes&quot;. A number of charities and campaign groups have warned this could affect even non-party political activities <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/06/lobbying-bill-uturn-charities-unions\" title=\"\">despite a series of amendments</a>, said David Babbs, the executive director of 38 Degrees.</p><p>&quot;We want to give the MPs a strong reminder that the lobbying bill threatens very popular institutions like charities and community groups, things that are generally held in much higher regard than they are, and their constituents will take a keen interest in how they voted on this,&quot; he said. &quot;Secondly, we want to remind MPs about what's good about grassroots community campaigning, which this bill threatens to constrain. Most MPs at some point thought this stuff was important.&quot;</p><p>Some Lib Dems were strongly supportive of the bill, Babbs argued, not least Tom Brake, the deputy commons leader, who helped shepherd it through. He said: &quot;I think lots of people are baffled as to why it's liberal and democratic to be pushing this, and why they think it makes political sense.</p><p>&quot;The Lib Dems often talk the talk of being very much in favour of civil society and grassroots campaigning, and hopefully this will remind them what it's all about.&quot;</p><p>While the bill has left the Commons, 38 Degrees hopes the campaign will focus MPs' attention if and when peers return it to the lower chamber with amendments to the contested elements.</p><p>Andrew George, MP for St Ives, is one of the Lib Dems targeted. He questioned the campaign's tactics given that he shared many of the same views of 38 Degrees. He was a primary sponsor of amendments to the bill. He said he abstained on the final Commons vote to show he supported elements connected to preventing undue big business lobbying, but that he had concerns about the section connected to charities.</p><p>&quot;I fundamentally do share their concerns that we don't want to gag the general public, or charities, or third sector organisations from genuinely having robust policy debate,&quot; George said . &quot;But if they have primarily chosen Liberal Democrat MPs they're risking an own goal.</p><p>&quot;It seems my neighbouring Conservative MPs are not being targeted in this way. And yet they voted in the wrong way, and I voted in the right way, and it's me who has to account for myself.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420462034|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|a6f7e7dfba24b0222e4e32557b6830c1ddffbdfc -->",

        "body":"<p>There is a certain irony that a prominent element of the coalition's stuttering constitutional agenda – the unreformed House of Lords – this week has the chance to give the kiss of life to another. The <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/transparencyoflobbyingnonpartycampaigningandtradeunionadministration.html\" title=\"\">transparency of lobbying, non-party campaigning and trade union administration bill</a>, the legislation more familiarly known as the gagging bill, was left unscathed by MPs in the Commons committee stage last month. In their defence, they only saw the bill for the first time the day before the summer recess and began to debate it on their first full day back, but all the same it is hard to understand the official support of Liberal Democrats, who had made transparency in lobbying a major demand in coalition negotiations.</p><p>Now all hope for significant reform of the bill rests with the peers, many of whom have close connections with charities whose activities are likely to be compromised by a bill that is a shameful travesty of what was needed to clean up British politics. The problem is that the bill is so flawed that it is hard to see how it can be easily amended. Instead, as both the constitutional affairs committee and the newly formed <a href=\"http://civilsocietycommission.info/news/\" title=\"\">Commission on Civil Society</a>, chaired by the former bishop of Oxford, are suggesting, it should be paused until it can be made fit for purpose.</p><p>This bill is supposed to do two big things. The first is to tackle the unhealthily obscure network of connections between lobbyists, politicians and Whitehall officials. The bill does not advance this objective by an inch. Campaigners say that as little as 1% of lobbying activity will be&nbsp;affected by it. The second ostensible aim is to restrict third-party campaigning in election periods. This may be a sensible contribution to a wider aim of taking money out of politics. But here the proposals <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/162144/Transparency-of-Lobbying-Non-Party-Campaigning-and-Trade-Union-Administration-Bill-Second-Reading-Briefing.pdf\" title=\"\">are so vaguely drawn </a>and generate such uncertainty that they are more likely to stifle non-party voices altogether. The triumphant result is that the drinks colossus <a href=\"http://www.diageo.com\" title=\"\">Diageo</a>, as an example, could go on meeting junior ministers and special advisers to argue against, say, minimum pricing for alcohol, while Alcohol Concern (annual income, <a href=\"http://www.alcoholconcern.org.uk/assets/files/Alcohol%20Concern%20signed%20accounts%202012.pdf\" title=\"\">less than &pound;1m</a>) would have to jump through a chilling series of hoops in order to take part in any kind of campaigning, with the risk of criminal charges if it were found in breach of a law that the Electoral Commission says is so opaque it cannot confidently predict how it will police it.</p><p>One by one, the coalition's ambitious plans for modernising the constitution, removing anachronisms such as the unelected House of Lords and promoting accountability and transparency into British political life, have foundered, skewered by the unrelenting defence of party advantage. The Lords has one last chance to get it right.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420486422|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|a48993672893b3a552403c382002df158064b859 -->",

This is untrue. Charities that campaign on policy issues, like Make Poverty History, or those that promote green or health issues, will be able to continue do so, in exactly the same way as they did in the run-up to the 2005 and 2010 elections. Only campaigns which can \"reasonably be regarded as intended to promote or procure the electoral success\" of parties or candidates, to use the language in the legislation that has been in place for 13 years and which is not being changed, would be required to register with the Electoral Commission, if they intended spending more than £5,000 in England, or £2,000 in Wales, NI or Scotland, on electioneering and be subject to spending caps.</p><p>I am surprised that Ms Toynbee does not support the intention of this Bill. If we were to see, as in other countries, unaccountable millions being spent by a third party in support of one party or another, I'm sure Ms Toynbee would be among&nbsp;the first to castigate us for failing to foresee the problem and do something about it. Anyone with an interest in making our political system as transparent and accountable as possible should support us in this modest and sensible reform.<br /><strong>Tom Brake MP</strong><br /><em>Deputy leader of the House of Commons</em></p><p></p><p>• Polly Toynbee usefully reminds us of the wide range of bodies threatened with gagging under the lobbying bill. The Trussell Trust did well to publish its report on food banks this week, since it will not be able to do so in a year's time, if the bill becomes law; and churches (most of which are charities) will have to restrict their activities to utterly uncontroversial pronouncements from next May onwards, not being permitted to comment on poverty or unsocial behaviour for fear of being judged political in the pre-election period.

        "body":"<p>As the controversial lobbying bill shoots through parliament at alarming speed, charities have been left further confused over the murky overlap between charitable activity and political campaigning.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/20/allies-fight-lobbying-bill\">the bill exited the House of Commons in a state that left many charities remainingdissatisfied.</a> Graham Allen MP, chair of the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/\">Political and Constitutional Select Committee</a>, had tabled two amendments. One to financial thresholds for charitable spending and another to prevent charity campaigning being restricted if the primary purpose of an organisation's expenditure is not party political. Both these amendments were narrowly defeated.</p><p>The bill now being considered more than halves the existing thresholds above which third parties such as charities have to register with the Electoral Commission. Total campaign spending in the year before an election is also cut by up to 70%.</p><p>The bill proposes a broader definition of election campaigning and materials, which could stymie free speech for charities in the run-up to an election. Smaller charities could be penalised for legitimate daily activities such as campaigning and advocacy work around election time. And charities whose campaigns inadvertently become party political hot issues could also be prosecuted. Some commentators believe this is a cynical government attempt to gag third-sector dissent.</p><p>Elizabeth Chamberlain, senior campaigner at the <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\">National Council for Voluntary Organisations</a>, says the bill has left charities in &quot;a very unclear and ambiguous situation with lots of questions unanswered, making it very difficult for them to plan any activity in the run up to an election&quot;.</p><p>Individual charities are also upset. <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a> senior campaigner Liz Hutchins says the government has &quot;failed to listen to voluntary organisations about the lobbying bill&quot;.</p><p>Faith groups sent the government a joint open letter stating that the bill did not safeguard the activities of religious organisations and that there was a &quot;very real risk&quot; that non-biased activity would be affected.</p><p>&quot;As Quakers, we find our faith often calls us to speak out in the world and seek social change; we remain concerned that this bill will prevent us practising this key element of our faith,&quot; says Paul Parker, recording clerk for Quakers in Britain.</p><p>And while the focus has so far been on England, the very low spending thresholds set out for the devolved countries are a real cause for concern. In Scotland, the spending threshold for campaigning will plunge from &pound;108,000 to &pound;35,000. Ruchir Shah, policy manager for the <a href=\"http://www.scvo.org.uk/\">Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations</a>, says this will have a big impact, especially when compared to England. &quot;Given that salary costs are included, the very tight &pound;35,000 in Scotland automatically puts a Scottish organisation at a disadvantage compared to &pound;300,000 for a similarly sized organisation in England,&quot; he says.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.jmt.org/\">The John Muir Trust</a>, a UK conservation charity, is feeling the effects. Because half of its work centres around the wild lands of Scotland, it is subject to devolved Scottish legislation, which caps campaigning at &pound;35,000. &quot;Immediately that's knocked out our staff costs before we've printed a leaflet or spent any other money or attended conferences,&quot; says spokesperson Alan McCombes.</p><p>He also worries that if a Scottish political party endorses its wildlife campaign – an issue that cuts across political divisions – the charity could be penalised. &quot;What if a political party decided to put [our wildlife campaign] in their manifesto? Would that mean our entire wildland campaign at the heart of the organisation would have to be put on hold for a year?&quot;</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the voluntary sector network</strong></a><strong> for analysis, best practice and the latest job opportunities</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420378771|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|08519e5147e1c76e3d36f8ce246e4c3ba6ecf771 -->",

        "body":"<p>An audacious attempt is to be made to delay the lobbying bill for three months in the Lords by putting its controversial plans for limiting the campaigning activities of charities into a special committee for detailed consideration.</p><p>The move is to be made on Tuesday by the crossbench peer Lord Ramsbotham with Labour backing, and is likely to prove a difficult test for government whips in the Lords.</p><p>The referral of part two of the bill to a special select committee would also delay consideration of other aspects of the bill.</p><p>The move would result in the part of the bill on regulating third-party campaigning to go to a special select committee until 13 February 2014.</p><p>The call for a pause is being made by an alliance of charities, thinktanks, faith groups and unions.</p><p>It is being argued that a pause would allow the government to get the bill right, and to hold the consultation it failed to hold before the bill was published.</p><p></p><p>Ministers argue that they have already made substantial concessions in the Commons to meet the fears of charities and pressure groups, who say the bill will have a chilling effect on their campaigning ahead of the general election.</p><p>Simon Barrow, the co-director the Christian thinktank Ekklesia, has warned the bill is too weak in bringing corporate lobbyists to account but unjustifiably limits the freedom of expression on charities, civil society organisations and thinktanks - restrictions that amount to gagging orders.</p><p>The House of Lords constitution committee warned \"effective parliamentary scrutiny matters in relation to every bill but it is of manifest importance where legislation is of constitutional significance. The present bill directly affects the ability of people and organisations to engage with the government and to participate in political and electoral campaigning.\"</p><p>The committee asked whether part two was necessary.</p><p>The joint select committee on human rights also called for the bill to be paused, as did the Commons political and constitutional reform select committee.</p><p>Charities claim lowering the registration thresholds for third party organisations would impose an undue burden on small organisations, and the definitions of permitted campaigning in a general election period were wrong-headed.</p><p>The Electoral Commission has also questioned the need to lower the spending limits of charities.</p><p>Underlying the dispute is likely to be a government fear that charities tend to be left-leaning or critical of government spending cuts, and so likely to be critical of the government during an election period.</p><p>Ramsbotham has warned ministers they \"must avoid giving the impression they own the voluntary sector\". Lord Phillips, a Liberal Democrat, has called for a fundamental review.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680083|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|ab6bdaac533bbc882034b933a2b397f403b6cb90 -->",

        "body":"<p>The coalition government started to offer concessions on the lobbying bill ahead of a vote on Tuesday that might lead to proposals for a three-month pause in the bill's scrutiny and reference of the regulation of charities at election times to a special select committee.</p><p>Lord Wallace, the minister handling the bill, has written to coalition peers saying he is willing to raise the threshold substantially to ensure smaller charities are not covered by the bill's provisions that restrict the campaigning activity of charities during an election period.</p><p>Ministers have also proposed that scrutiny of the section of the bill addressing charity campaigning could be deferred as long as six weeks, so long as the rest of the bill continued as normal.</p><p>Lord Ramsbotham, the crossbench peer pushing for a full three-month delay, does not appear likely to accept the compromise, and will push for delay to allow a fresh scrutiny of the bill.</p><p>Ramsbotham's plan, with Labour backing, would mean the referral of part two of the bill to a special select committee, which would also delay consideration of other aspects of the bill.</p><p>The move would result in the part of the bill on regulating third-party campaigning to not go to a special select committee until 13 February 2014.</p><p>The call for a pause is being made by an alliance of charities, thinktanks, faith groups and unions.</p><p>It is being argued that a pause would allow the government to get the bill right, and to hold the consultation it failed to hold before the bill was published.</p><p>Ministers say they have already made substantial concessions in the Commons to meet the fears of charities and pressure groups, who say the bill will have a chilling effect on their campaigning ahead of the general election.</p><p>Simon Barrow, co-director of the Christian thinktank Ekklesia, has warned the bill is too weak in bringing corporate lobbyists to account but unjustifiably limits the freedom of expression on charities, civil society organisations and thinktanks – restrictions that amount to gagging orders.</p><p>The House of Lords constitution committee warned \"effective parliamentary scrutiny matters in relation to every bill but it is of manifest importance where legislation is of constitutional significance. The present bill directly affects the ability of people and organisations to engage with the government and to participate in political and electoral campaigning.\"</p><p>The committee asked whether part two was necessary.</p><p>The joint select committee on human rights also called for the bill to be paused, as did the Commons political and constitutional reform select committee.</p><p>Charities claim lowering the registration thresholds for third party organisations would impose an undue burden on small organisations, and the definitions of permitted campaigning in a general election period were wrong-headed.</p><p>The Electoral Commission has also questioned the need to lower the spending limits of charities.</p><p>Underlying the dispute is likely to be a government fear that charities tend to be left-leaning or critical of government spending cuts, and so likely to be critical of the government during an election period.</p><p>Ramsbotham has warned ministers they \"must avoid giving the impression they own the voluntary sector\". Lord Phillips, a Liberal Democrat, has called for a fundamental review.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421714793|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|8890a9e7dcf52445196a70566e16f24d2882e5b9 -->",

        "body":"<p>The government has agreed to pause the lobbying bill in the Lords for as long as six weeks to give ministers time to rethink plans to regulate the way charities campaign, especially during general elections.</p><p>Ministers were forced into the concessions after they risked encountering a coalition in the Lords – led by crossbencher Lord Ramsbotham – which would have forced the bill into a select committee for consideration for up to three months.</p><p>Ramsbotham said he risked the opprobrium of some charities by not pushing for a vote on the bill, which has been widely criticised for gagging charities, but he said the government's integrity was now on the line.</p><p>An alliance of charities, thinktanks and NGOs are furious that the government introduced changes to the regulation of the political activities of charities without prior consultation.</p><p>The bill lowers the threshold that a charity is allowed to spend in the runup to the election without needing to register with the Electoral Commission from £10,000 to £5,000 in England.</p><p>Lord Wallace, handling the bill in the Lords for the coalition, has written to peers saying: \"We are looking again at the thresholds for registration to ensure that small campaigning groups including charities are not caught by the regulatory regime.\" He promised to raise the threshold substantially, but government sources refused to confirm a figure.</p><p>Wallace has also agreed to review the limits being imposed on the amount third parties can spend in each constituency. The bill had proposed that a charity could only spend up to 0.05% of the total of the maximum campaign expenditure limits in any particular parliamentary constituency. For UK parliamentary elections, the maximum spending is £18.96m in Great Britain, so the cap equated to about £9,480 for each constituency.</p><p>The charities welcomed the pause, but Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, called for real change including the abandonment of measures that would create \"alarming levels\" of red tape for charities, such as asking them to account for staff time.</p><p>\"Similarly, asking charities working in coalitions to each account for the spending of the entire coalition remains unfair and unworkable.\"</p><p>Lady Hayter, the shadow cabinet office minister, warned the legislation would \"wrap up charities in red tape\" and threaten free speech and freedom of assembly.</p><p>She said: \"What we need is much more of a commitment from the government not just to listen and engage – welcome as that is – but to act on what is heard. The third sector is not just looking for reassurance, it is looking for change\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421735762|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|6abb9efeb5ee0224e9ed6b56bc3ab5818029f399 -->",
