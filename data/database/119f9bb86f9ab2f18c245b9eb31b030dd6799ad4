        "body":"<p>The revolution will not be edited. It&nbsp;will not be succinct. It won't be  vetted by the usual spin doctors. It&nbsp;won't perform well in front of the self-selected committees of the  political and media elite. It will, in fact, be all over&nbsp;the shop.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\" title=\"\">Russell Brand's revolution</a> has been held  up and found wanting both personally and  politically. But not by me. As evidenced by the ranks of the professionally sensible putting him back in his place, his ramblings have kickstarted some absolutely necessary conversations. A light entertainer has provoked unease. He has been repeatedly chided for telling people not to bother with voting. He has been described as a proto-fascist, grudgingly labelled \"intelligent\", though not properly educated, and, of course, derided as a womanising ex-drug addict – a fact he has never tried to hide.</p><p>He may indeed be a sexist. Or, as he put it earlier this week in these pages, in his most imitable style, may \"suffer from the ol' sexism\". And you would have to pay me to sit through one of his shows again; I find  his endless see-sawing between braggadocio and yoga-ed up humility exhausting. So I am not what you would call a fan.</p><p>Still, I love the way Brand has wrongfooted the media with a teenage essay, a Newsnight performance and a viral YouTube presence. For all its flaws, what he said nicely highlights the narrowness of our present political discourse, the province, as we saw at Leveson, of a nexus of interlocking politicians, media and police. That discourse needs busting open.</p><p>It's no surprise that it took a comic to do this. Comedians function as our public intellectuals, wise and witty speakers of truth. Brand may lack the political sophistication of some of his colleagues but he has a wide appeal. My 12-year-old loved what he said. I told her to read his essay. \"You don't get it, Mum. He is a talker not a writer.\" And  before you say his essay is an adolescent and flowery \"It's so unfair!\" rant, let me agree. It doesn't make what he said untrue.</p><p>All the retorts amount to defences of  parliamentary democracy, a political process that many are clearly alienated from. But Brand's idea is that there are other ways one can be politically involved without voting.  He is railing against the democratic deficit in non-parliamentary language. Many of his  demands are straight out of Occupy, pointing, for example, to the inequality that Cameron says is declining, and asking for an end to  corporate tax avoidance.</p><p>What Brand has provoked is a defence of traditional politics: the old \"Go and knock on doorsteps! Stuff envelopes! And above all vote!\" model. We have been reminded too that not all politicians are venal. Yet those who  accuse Brand of naivety are themselves naive about what voting achieves. Did we vote for this level of mass surveillance, for instance? Or what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/us-trade-deal-full-frontal-assault-on-democracy\" title=\"\">George Monbiot just revealed</a>, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which will stop the regulation of private companies?</p><p>Brand hits home because politics as it is enacted is dull and conformist. Matthew D'Ancona's new book, In It Together: The Inside Story of the Coalition reveals the unappetising \"quad\" that props up the coalition: Cameron, Osborne, Clegg and Alexander. Remember Boris Johnson is  alleged to have said that this government is \"a&nbsp;triumph for the public-school system\".</p><p>This system is so dead and closed that there feels little choice. Like Brand, I have often not voted. But at the last election I decided to stand as an independent. I was sick of Labour's war-mongering, I couldn't vote for them, but I wasn't sick enough to vote Lib Dem. I made this gesture because I figured democracy works on the grounds that anyone who has £500 for a deposit can stand. This is the illusion. If you test it, you will be called an idiot, a narcissist, an anarchist. Guilty, m'lud. But you soon learn no one wins without party machinery and party money.</p><p>In reality, people are falling away from political parties. Brand's idealism is in part a response to this. If such idealism is a joke, that is very sad. Brand was roundly mocked by the pundits for his talk of consciousness, but the pundits revealed only their own narrow-mindedness. As if there is not a tradition of this! Rosa Luxemburg talked of \"spiritual transformation\". A feminist revolution has always been understood as an individual as well as a collective awakening.</p><p>Brand is sneered at for not being humble enough, an inflated fool who should vote for socialism if he desires it. Well, no. He is right on many counts and while we are far from revolution we have a younger generation with high expectations and no means to meet them. Those in power would do well to be less smug and self-satisfied. The strength of Brand's message lies precisely in the reaction against it. Rarely have I seen such a spirited defence of the status quo. Brand's demands, like everything about him, are excessive. But should he just get back in his comedy box and leave politics to that class of people that are educated beyond their intelligence?</p><p>They say he has made the mistake of  demanding the impossible – and they are right.&nbsp;He has demanded the impossible. But&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn't a mistake.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421843238|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|c6236774daa1417e7334957c25d5a961a4dcc452 -->",

        "body":"<p>It is good to see the IMF come round to the idea of a wealth tax as a way of resolving the current crisis. We suggested this three years ago in these pages (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/15/deficit-crisis-tax-the-rich\" title=\"\">Let's be really in it together</a>, 16 August 2010), and the IMF has now made a similar calculation that a 10% levy could return European countries to pre-crisis public debt/GDP ratios (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/nov/05/moral-case-wealth-tax\" title=\"\">The moral case for a one-off wealth tax is compelling</a>, 5 November).</p><p>But the issue is not simply moral. The problem policymakers have still not faced is that the intense concentration of wealth at the top of society creates a mobility of private capital seeking rapid profitable investment. This is often in speculative activity, in commodities such as food, or as we are seeing once again in the frenzy gripping housing markets. Such capital needs to be recirculated into the economy in productive areas for social use but instead is destabilising in its effects, whether in the disaster of financial derivatives, or in producing the next housing crash.</p><p>The current bubble has of course been helped by the £130bn pumped in by the chancellor in an attempt to create the appearance of sustainable growth. It makes no economic sense, but politically it is attractive because over half the population live in homes which they own, and the house has become a touchstone of security where people are increasingly worried about pensions, employment, education fees and health. So a rise in house prices keeps the middle class temporarily happy, and partly explains why conservative politicians and the political system retain a legitimacy, however grudging.</p><p>Russell Brand is right to say that a large section of the population is excluded from this system (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/05/russell-brand-democratic-system-newsnight\" title=\"\">A televised beginning to the Russell revolution</a>, 6 November). The bottom half of the population indeed have only 9% of the wealth. But the top half have the rest, and most will currently vote for either the existing coalition, or parties to the right of them. So a coherent alternative must be developed, in which social wealth is directed to social use, and it will have to be enacted through existing political structures, which have at least the formal power to direct taxation and economic policy. This means the hard, grinding work of electing committed politicians, of linking trade unions and activist groups, of bringing together the excluded, and fighting for the true representation of political alternatives in a media so dominated by the constant assumption that \"there is no alternative\".<br /><strong>Professor Greg Philo</strong><br /><em>Glasgow University Media Group</em></p><p></p><p>• David Runciman's discussion of democracy (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/08/trouble-with-democracy-david-runciman\" title=\"\">Dictator envy?</a>, Review, 9 November) was interesting and perceptive, but he was not perceptive enough to notice the herd of elephants charging through his study as he wrote. The elephants presently trampling democracy under their huge feet are international companies.</p><p>The power of international capitalism, with some companies having greater wealth than many nations, is in the process of destroying democracy. Companies are deciding for themselves whether and where they pay taxes, and using the threat of closing factories to control wages and humiliate unions. Democratic governments have to bribe them with grants and special freedoms so that they will kindly make money in their countries. Democracies that cannot control their economies are in real trouble.</p><p>The power of international capitalism is the main cause of the diseases of recent politics, including a disengaged electorate. It has forced all major parties, of right and left, to converge on the \"centre\" ground, which can be interpreted as an acceptance of a neoliberal market economy. Genuine choice has been removed. The only answer seems to be merging small nations into large conglomerates such as the EU – with the subsequent loss of any real feeling of involvement in democracy. I only hope that David Runciman is right and democracy will muddle through in the end.<br /><strong>Professor Trevor Hussey</strong><br /><em>High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire</em></p><p></p><p>• In the early 70s I campaigned against homelessness (\"land for people, not for profit\"), helping homeless people get out of \"halfway houses\" and into needlessly empty property, thus preventing \"prior demolition\" (homes being demolished before a public inquiry). I researched and co-compiled Shelter's Bed &amp; Breakfast Report (1974) and had posters in my window: \"Don't Vote – It Only Encourages Them\" and \"Whoever You Vote For, the Government Gets In\".</p><p>Then, I was encouraged to join the Labour party by a prominent politician and, apart from several years' lapse as a protest against the Iraq war, I have remained for 40 years. But, with 80,000 children currently in B&amp;B accommodation, I believe Russell Brand has a point. It's up to politicians to prove him wrong.<br /><strong>Mary Evans Young</strong><br /><em>Banbury, Oxfordshire</em></p><p></p><p>• If Jeremy Paxman thinks the tuition fees U-turn is one of the most blatant lies of recent political history (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/07/russell-brand-row-nick-clegg-jeremy-paxman\" title=\"\">Clegg says Paxman makes good living sneering at politics</a>, 8 November), one rather wonders where he's been during the last decade. I think the lies told around Iraq must beat almost anything we have been misled on by recent administrations.</p><p>As to serious defects in our political processes (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/nov/06/russell-brand-ideas-great-where-strategy\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 7 November) surely the first-past-the-post electoral system must take the honours. Nick Clegg tried and failed to begin to right this wrong, albeit with a system of proportional representation which was not the best but at least a step in the right direction.Because the popular press hated Nick Clegg more than they valued a fair voting system, the referendum buried the attempt. I fear another attempt will not happen in my lifetime.</p><p>If only Russell Brand would halt his blathering and come up with something useful in order to challenge the status quo and inspire the non-voters instead of washing his hands in public of his responsibility to his fellow citizens.</p><p>Campaign, Mr Brand, for a fair voting system. Then perhaps people like me will applaud and not condemn. As for Paxman, perhaps he should call it a day since he feels so cynical about those he uses and abuses to make his living. <br /><strong>Ann Smith</strong><br /><em>Stockport</em></p><p></p><p>• Nick Clegg is quite wrong to criticise Jeremy Paxman for \"sneering about politics\". Paxman is not sneering about politics, but about politicians. Only someone who has a belief that our political system should deliver better would be driven to criticise the daily tide of spin, shattered promises, operational incompetence and self-preservation in which we voters are drenched by the Rt Hon Nick Clegg's generation of fellow career MPs.<br /><strong>Simon Cherry</strong><br /><em>Claygate, Surrey</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422127451|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|639560e64cd96185e7efe3ea09054d2d8c0863b7 -->",

        "body":"<p>So Jeremy Paxman and Russell Brand have more in common than fetching facial hair. It turns out that the Newsnight anchor agreed with the comedian more than he let on when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\" title=\"\">the pair sparred in a YouTube-ready exchange</a> that centred on Brand's disillusion with the democratic process. \"I think part of Russell Brand's diagnosis is right,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/05/paxman-politics-russell-brand-voting\" title=\"\">Paxman confesses</a> in the latest edition of the Radio Times. \"There is a huge sense of disillusion out there.\"</p><p>Some will react to that the way they would to a complaint by Miley Cyrus about the sexualisation of young female musicians: you should know, because you're part of the problem. For if politicians are held in low regard, if not outright contempt, then some responsibility surely belongs to those from the rottweiler school of interviewing who cannot look at an elected official without dripping disdain. Those who watch Paxman, or listen to the Today programme's John Humphrys, can hardly be blamed for picking up some of that cynical attitude to the Westminster classes, which regards anyone who's won an election as automatically suspect. Recall Paxman's <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/571500/\" title=\"\">description of his own mindset</a> when interviewing a politician: \"I am always asking myself why is this lying bastard lying to me?\"</p><p>Don't get me wrong: I'm not calling for Paxman or Humphrys to pull in their claws. Those in power merit forensic, unrelenting scrutiny. The problem is the definition of power. Paxman seems to believe the only authority that deserves the full Paxo treatment is the elected variety. He tends to reserve the trademark sneer, loaded first question and presumption of guilt for members of parliament and ministers – even those who, truth be told, wield only the most modest modicum of influence.</p><p>Rare is the occasion when he shows similar venom to those who wield unelected power. Watch the compilation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/27/jeremy-paxmans-greatest-clips\" title=\"\">Paxo's greatest hits</a> and they consist chiefly of the grand inquisitor shredding politicians. Look for a similar encounter with a corporate titan, the heads of one of those companies or banks that exert vast influence over the national or global economy, and you will struggle. If it's happened once or twice, it's the exception not the rule. The likes of former junior minister <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\"bddWaHuxTzc\"\" title=\"\">Chloe Smith</a> have more to fear from Paxman than the likes of Google's Eric Schmidt.</p><p>This problem goes far beyond the Newsnight presenter. Our media cover Westminster politics at a thousand times the intensity and detail with which it covers big business. Yet are our politicians really so much more powerful than the banks, the tech giants and the bond markets?</p><p>The usual defence for such aggressive interrogation is that this or that person is \"elected\" and therefore deserves to be held to the highest possible standard. The implication is that they would deserve it less if they were unelected. But this is surely the wrong way around. It is unelected, unaccountable power that needs more scrutiny. As, to his credit, Paxman himself concedes in his Radio Times article, elected politicians are, in fact, our only potential brake on power being \"wielded by the rich and strong for the benefit of the rich and strong\".</p><p>If too many people have lost sight of that democratic truth, regarding anyone who stands for elected office as a power-crazed weirdo and compulsive liar, then Paxman might put this tough question to himself, <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\"Uwlsd8RAoqI#t=19\"\" title=\"\">asking it 12 times over if necessary</a>: \"Do you really believe you played no part whatsoever in this process, one you yourself now regret?\"</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@Freedland</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421703535|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|a225528e6f81810f9ed3faf86601ff5eeb1a529c -->",

        "headline":"Russell Brand: mad, bad and dangerous for democracy?",
        "body":"<p>The last time there was an economic meltdown on the scale of the one from which Europe may now be slowly and painfully emerging, it destroyed democracy and ended in war. This time – despite nasty outbreaks of neo-fascism even in unlikely quarters like the Netherlands – it's brought us Russell Brand, political hero. If he knew a bit more history, he might be a bit more careful about who and what he attacks.</p><p>Perhaps he should start with The Pike, Lucy Hughes-Hallett's new biography of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/06/lucy-hughes-hallett-prize-biography-interview\" title=\"\">Gabriele D'Annunzio</a>, which has just won the Samuel Johnson non-fiction prize. There's something about the romanticism that imbues <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/05/russell-brand-democratic-system-newsnight\" title=\"\">Brand's description of the state of democracy</a> that feels a little like the distorted utopianism of the Italian proto-fascist, for whom Byron (the Russell Brand of his day) was an early hero.</p><p>The core Brand message, which is \"I am naive, and I have screwed up, but I tell you something, I believe in change\", is perfectly pitched (Byron: \"Pleasure's a sin and sometimes sin's a pleasure\"). Here he is, a hero for our times, idealist, hedonist, radical. Above all, individual, yet also a man of the crowd, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/protesters-gather-million-mask-march\" title=\"\">out with the Million Mask protesters last night</a>, demanding something different, a world where everyone loves everyone else and we'll all agree with Russell because what to do if we don't isn't in the manifesto.</p><p>Brand's voice resonates around cyberspace. There is a great hunger for change and a dangerous sense of powerlessness. The world is longing for a hero who can see how to put things right. It's just that heroes are really bad for democracy. For democracy, boringly, depends on bringing people with you, step by step, not just spotting where they'd like to be in their dreams and declaring that you can take them there.</p><p>That's why democracy needs political parties. The trouble is they can be bad for democracy too. The search for a majority ends up with bland politics and bland politicians. Fertile territory for the hero. Even so, the Brand appeal is harder to pull off when you are actually in power, though that's not stopping <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/05/toronto-mayor-resign-rob-ford-crack-allegations\" title=\"\">Rob Ford, the drink-and-drug-stricken mayor of Toronto</a>. Last night, with a catch in his voice, he begged voters to let him go on being mayor despite his tendency to ricochet unsteadily off studio cameras during live TV appearances. Astonishingly, it seems just possible that being authentic, as such openness is described these days, may be just what's needed to distract voters from rather more serious charges as painstakingly uncovered by the city's leading newspaper, the Toronto Star.</p><p>The trouble poor old democracy has is that it depends on a romantic idea, when it only works if it's an unglamorous grind. \"Campaign in poetry, govern in prose,\" as Aneurin Bevan, probably the last politician capable of heroic oratory along with quite high grade administrative skills, used to say. Politicians have to sell the romance and then put in the graft, and the tragedy of experience is that romance loses its appeal. Poor old Ed Miliband, balancing the ambitions of his party, the unions and the country, he cannot hope to compete with the Russell Brand party of Russell Brand.</p><p>But party Brand couldn't change anything without becoming the Napoleon of the revolution. What democracy needs to work is an educated, demanding electorate, President Eisenhower's alert and knowledgeable citizenry. (He also had a good line about bad officials being elected by good voters who didn't vote). Demagoguery is not entirely dangerous. Its purpose is to remind us why the boring bits of democracy actually matter.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421789054|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|f466eda5aeee3dd1824228ebf9466481f6fc76ee -->",

        "body":"<p>The revolution will not be edited. It&nbsp;will not be succinct. It won't be  vetted by the usual spin doctors. It&nbsp;won't perform well in front of the self-selected committees of the  political and media elite. It will, in fact, be all over&nbsp;the shop.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\" title=\"\">Russell Brand's revolution</a> has been held  up and found wanting both personally and  politically. But not by me. As evidenced by the ranks of the professionally sensible putting him back in his place, his ramblings have kickstarted some absolutely necessary conversations. A light entertainer has provoked unease. He has been repeatedly chided for telling people not to bother with voting. He has been described as a proto-fascist, grudgingly labelled \"intelligent\", though not properly educated, and, of course, derided as a womanising ex-drug addict – a fact he has never tried to hide.</p><p>He may indeed be a sexist. Or, as he put it earlier this week in these pages, in his most imitable style, may \"suffer from the ol' sexism\". And you would have to pay me to sit through one of his shows again; I find  his endless see-sawing between braggadocio and yoga-ed up humility exhausting. So I am not what you would call a fan.</p><p>Still, I love the way Brand has wrongfooted the media with a teenage essay, a Newsnight performance and a viral YouTube presence. For all its flaws, what he said nicely highlights the narrowness of our present political discourse, the province, as we saw at Leveson, of a nexus of interlocking politicians, media and police. That discourse needs busting open.</p><p>It's no surprise that it took a comic to do this. Comedians function as our public intellectuals, wise and witty speakers of truth. Brand may lack the political sophistication of some of his colleagues but he has a wide appeal. My 12-year-old loved what he said. I told her to read his essay. \"You don't get it, Mum. He is a talker not a writer.\" And  before you say his essay is an adolescent and flowery \"It's so unfair!\" rant, let me agree. It doesn't make what he said untrue.</p><p>All the retorts amount to defences of  parliamentary democracy, a political process that many are clearly alienated from. But Brand's idea is that there are other ways one can be politically involved without voting.  He is railing against the democratic deficit in non-parliamentary language. Many of his  demands are straight out of Occupy, pointing, for example, to the inequality that Cameron says is declining, and asking for an end to  corporate tax avoidance.</p><p>What Brand has provoked is a defence of traditional politics: the old \"Go and knock on doorsteps! Stuff envelopes! And above all vote!\" model. We have been reminded too that not all politicians are venal. Yet those who  accuse Brand of naivety are themselves naive about what voting achieves. Did we vote for this level of mass surveillance, for instance? Or what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/us-trade-deal-full-frontal-assault-on-democracy\" title=\"\">George Monbiot just revealed</a>, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which will stop the regulation of private companies?</p><p>Brand hits home because politics as it is enacted is dull and conformist. Matthew D'Ancona's new book, In It Together: The Inside Story of the Coalition reveals the unappetising \"quad\" that props up the coalition: Cameron, Osborne, Clegg and Alexander. Remember Boris Johnson is  alleged to have said that this government is \"a&nbsp;triumph for the public-school system\".</p><p>This system is so dead and closed that there feels little choice. Like Brand, I have often not voted. But at the last election I decided to stand as an independent. I was sick of Labour's war-mongering, I couldn't vote for them, but I wasn't sick enough to vote Lib Dem. I made this gesture because I figured democracy works on the grounds that anyone who has £500 for a deposit can stand. This is the illusion. If you test it, you will be called an idiot, a narcissist, an anarchist. Guilty, m'lud. But you soon learn no one wins without party machinery and party money.</p><p>In reality, people are falling away from political parties. Brand's idealism is in part a response to this. If such idealism is a joke, that is very sad. Brand was roundly mocked by the pundits for his talk of consciousness, but the pundits revealed only their own narrow-mindedness. As if there is not a tradition of this! Rosa Luxemburg talked of \"spiritual transformation\". A feminist revolution has always been understood as an individual as well as a collective awakening.</p><p>Brand is sneered at for not being humble enough, an inflated fool who should vote for socialism if he desires it. Well, no. He is right on many counts and while we are far from revolution we have a younger generation with high expectations and no means to meet them. Those in power would do well to be less smug and self-satisfied. The strength of Brand's message lies precisely in the reaction against it. Rarely have I seen such a spirited defence of the status quo. Brand's demands, like everything about him, are excessive. But should he just get back in his comedy box and leave politics to that class of people that are educated beyond their intelligence?</p><p>They say he has made the mistake of  demanding the impossible – and they are right.&nbsp;He has demanded the impossible. But&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn't a mistake.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421843238|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|c6236774daa1417e7334957c25d5a961a4dcc452 -->",

        "headline":"Russell Brand: we deserve more from our democratic system",
        "body":"<p>I've had an incredible week since I spoke from the heart, some would say via my arse, on Paxman. I've had slaps on the back, fist bumps, cheers and hugs while out and about, cock-eyed offers of political power from well intentioned chancers and some good ol' fashioned character assassinations in the papers.</p><p>The people who liked the interview said it was because I'd articulated what they were thinking. I recognise this. God knows I'd love to think the attention was about me but I said nothing new or original, it was the expression of the knowledge that democracy is irrelevant that resonated. As long as the priorities of those in government remain the interests of big business, rather than the people they were elected to serve, the impact of voting is negligible and it is our responsibility to be more active if we want real change.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/05/paxman-politics-russell-brand-voting\" title=\"\">Turns out that among the disenchanted is Paxman himself</a> who spends most of his time at the meek heart of the political establishment and can't summons up the self-delusion to drag his nib across the ballot box. He, more than any of us is aware that politicians are frauds. I've not spent too much time around them, only on the telly, it's not pleasant; once you've been on Question Time and seen Boris simpering under a make-up brush it's difficult to be enthusiastic about politics.</p><p>The only reason to vote is if the vote represents power or change. I don't think it does. I fervently believe that we deserve more from our democratic system than the few derisory tit-bits tossed from the carousel of the mighty, when they hop a few inches left or right. The lazily duplicitous servants of The City expect us to gratefully participate in what amounts to little more than a political hokey cokey where every four years we get to choose what colour tie the liar who leads us wears.</p><p>I remember the election and Cameron didn't even get properly voted in, he became prime minister by default when he teamed up with Clegg. Clegg who immediately reneged (Renegy-Cleggy?) on his flagship pledge to end tuition fees at the first whiff of power.</p><p>When students, perhaps students who had voted for him, rioted they were condemned. People riot when dialogue fails, when they feel unrepresented and bored by the illusion, bilious with the piped in toxic belch wafted into their homes by the media.</p><p>The reason these coalitions are so easily achieved is that the distinctions between the parties are insignificant. My friend went to a posh \"do\" in the country where David Cameron, a man whose face resembles a little painted egg, was in attendance. Also present were members of the opposition and former prime minister Tony Blair. Whatever party they claim to represent in the day, at night they show their true colours and all go to the same party.</p><p>Obviously there has been some criticism of my outburst, I've not been universally applauded as a cross between Jack Sparrow and Spartacus (which is what I'm going for) but they've been oddly personal and I think irrelevant to the argument. I try not to read about myself as the mean stuff is hurtful and the good stuff hard to believe, but my mates always give me the gist of what's going on, the bastards. Some people say I'm a hypocrite because I've got money now. When I was poor and I complained about inequality people said I was bitter, now I'm rich and I complain about inequality they say I'm a hypocrite. I'm beginning to think they just don't want inequality on the agenda because it is a real problem that needs to be addressed.</p><p>It's easy to attack me, I'm a right twerp, I'm a junkie and a cheeky monkey, I accept it, but that doesn't detract from the incontrovertible fact that we are living in a time of huge economic disparity and confronting ecological disaster. This disparity has always been, in cultures since expired, a warning sign of end of days. In Rome, Egypt and Easter Island the incubated ruling elites, who had forgotten that we are one interconnected people, destroyed their societies by not sharing. That is what's happening now, regardless of what you think of my hair or me using long words, the facts are the facts and the problem is the problem. Don't be distracted. I think these columnist fellas who give me aggro for not devising a solution or for using long words are just being territorial. When they say \"long words\" they mean \"their words\" like I'm a monkey who got in their Mum's dressing up box or a hooligan in policeman's helmet.</p><p>As I said to Paxman at the time \"I can't conjure up a global Utopia right now in this hotel room\". Obviously that's not my job and it doesn't need to be, we have brilliant thinkers and organisations and no one needs to cook up an egalitarian Shangri-La on their todd; we can all do it together.</p><p>I like Jeremy Paxman, incidentally. I think he's a decent bloke but like a lot of people who work deep within the system it's hard for him to countenance ideas from outside the narrowly prescribed trench of contemporary democracy. Most of the people who criticized me have a vested interest in the maintenance of the system. They say the system works. What they mean is \"the system works for me\".</p><p>The less privileged among us are already living in the apocalypse, the thousands of street sleepers in our country, the refugees and the exploited underclass across our planet daily confront what we would regard as the end of the world. No money, no home, no friends, no support, no hand of friendship reaching out, just acculturated and inculcated condemnation.</p><p>When I first got a few quid it was like an anaesthetic that made me forget what was important but now I've woken up. I can't deny that I've done a lot of daft things while I was under the capitalist fugue, some silly telly, soppy scandals, movies better left unmade. I've also become rich. I don't hate rich people; Che Guevara was a rich person. I don't hate anyone, I judge no one, that's not my job, I'm a comedian and my job is to say whatever I like to whoever I want if I'm prepared to take the consequences. Well I am.</p><p>My favourite experiences since Paxman-nacht are both examples of the dialogue it sparked. Firstly my friend's 15-year-old son wrote an essay for his politics class after he read <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\" title=\"\">my New Statesman piece</a>. He didn't agree with everything I said, he prefers the idea of spoiling ballots to not voting \"to show we do care\" maybe he's right, I don't know. The reason not voting could be effective is that if we starve them of our consent we could force them to acknowledge that they operate on behalf of The City and Wall Street; that the financing of political parties and lobbying is where the true influence lies; not in the ballot box. However, this 15-year-old is quite smart and it's quite possible that my opinions are a result of decades of drug abuse.</p><p>I'm on tour so I've been with thousands of people every night (not like in the old days, I'm a changed man) this is why I'm aware of how much impact the Newsnight interview had. Not everyone I chat to agrees with me but their beliefs are a lot closer to mine than the broadsheets, and it's their job to be serious. One thing I've learned and was surprised by is that I may suffer from the ol' sexism. I can only assume I have an unaddressed cultural hangover, like my adorable Nan who had a heart that shone like a pearl but was, let's face it, a bit racist. I don't want to be a sexist so I'm trying my best to check meself before I wreck meself. The problem may resolve itself as I'm in a loving relationship with a benevolent dictator and have entirely relinquished personal autonomy.</p><p>Whilst travelling between gigs I had my second notable encounter. One night late at the Watford Gap I got chatting to a couple of squaddies, one Para, one Marine, we talked a bit about family and politics, I invited them to a show. Then we were joined by three Muslim women, all hijabbed up. For a few perfect minutes in the strip lit inertia of this place, that was nowhere in particular but uniquely Britain, I felt how plausible and beautiful The Revolution could be. We just chatted.</p><p>Between three sets of different people; first generation Muslims, servicemen and the privileged elite that they serve (that would be me) effortless cooperation occurred. Here we were free from the divisive rule that tears us apart. That sends brave men and women to foreign lands to fight their capitalist wars, that intimidates and unsettles people whose faith and culture superficially distinguishes them, that tells the comfortable \"hush now\" you have your trinkets. It seemed ridiculous that refracted through the power prism that blinds us; the soldiers could be invading the homeland of these women's forefathers in order to augment my luxurious stupour. Here in the gap we were together. Our differences irrelevant. With no one to impose separation we are united.</p><p>I realised then that our treasured concepts of tribe and nation are not valued by those who govern except when it is to divide us from each other. They don't believe in Britain or America they believe in the dollar and the pound. These are deep and entrenched systemic wrongs that are unaddressed by party politics.</p><p>The symptoms of these wrongs are obvious, global and painful. Drone strikes on the innocent, a festering investment for future conflict.</p><p>How many combatants are created each time an innocent person in a faraway land is silently ironed out from an Arizona call centre? The reality is we have more in common with the people we're bombing than the people we're bombing them for.</p><p>NSA spying, how far-reaching is the issue of surveillance? Do you think we don't have our own cute, quaint British version? Does it matter if the dominant paradigm of Western Capitalism is indifferent to our Bud Flanagan belief in nation? Can we really believe these problems can be altered within the system that created them? That depends on them? The system that we are invited to vote for? Of course not, that's why I won't vote. That's why I support the growing revolution.</p><p>We can all contribute ideas as to how to change our world; schoolboys, squaddies, hippies, Muslims, Jews and if what I'm describing is naive then you can keep your education and your indoctrination because loving our planet and each other is a duty, a beautiful obligation. While chatting to people this week I heard some interesting ideas, here are a couple.</p><p>We could use the money accumulated by those who have too much, not normal people with a couple of cars, giant corporations, to fund a fairer society.</p><p>The US government gave a trillion dollars to bail out the big five banks over the past year. Banks that have grown by 30% since the crisis and are experiencing record profits and giving their execs record bonuses. How about, hang on to your hats because here comes a naïve suggestion, don't give them that money, use it to create one million jobs at fifty grand a year for people who teach, nurse or protect.</p><p>These bailouts for elites over services for the many are institutionalised within the system, no party proposes changing it. American people that voted, voted for it. I'm not voting for that.</p><p>That's one suggestion for the Americans; we started their country so we owe them a favour now things are getting heavy.</p><p>Here's one for blighty; Philip Green, the bloke who owns Top Shop didn't pay any income tax on a £1.2bn dividend in 2005. None. Unless he paid himself a salary that year, in addition to the £1.2bn dividend, the largest in corporate history, then the people who clean Top Shop paid more income tax than he did. That's for two reasons – firstly because he said that all of his £1.2bn earnings belong to his missus, who was registered in Monaco and secondly because he's an arsehole. The money he's nicked through legal loopholes would pay the annual salary for 20,000 NHS nurses. It's not illegal; it's systemic, British people who voted, voted for it. I'm not voting for that.</p><p>Why don't you try not paying taxes and see how quickly a lump of bird gets thrown in your face. It's socialism for corporate elites and feudalism for the rest of us. Those suggestions did not come from me; no the mind that gave the planet Booky Wook and Ponderland didn't just add an economically viable wealth distribution system to the laudable list of accolades, to place next to my Shagger Of The Year awards.</p><p>The first came from Dave DeGraw, the second Johann Hari got from UK Uncut. Luckily with organisations like them, Occupy, Anonymous and The People's Assembly I don't need to come with ideas, we can all participate. I'm happy to be a part of the conversation, if more young people are talking about fracking instead of twerking we're heading in the right direction. The people that govern us don't want an active population who are politically engaged, they want passive consumers distracted by the spectacle of which I accept I am a part.</p><p>If we all collude and collaborate together we can design a new system that makes the current one obsolete. The reality is there are alternatives. That is the terrifying truth that the media, government and big business work so hard to conceal. Even the outlet that printed this will tomorrow print a couple of columns saying what a naïve wanker I am, or try to find ways that I've fucked up. Well I am naïve and I have fucked up but I tell you something else. I believe in change. I don't mind getting my hands dirty because my hands are dirty already. I don't mind giving my life to this because I'm only alive because of the compassion and love of others. Men and women strong enough to defy this system and live according to higher laws. This is a journey we can all go on together, all of us. We can include everyone and fear no one. A system that serves the planet and the people. I'd vote for that.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421728790|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|1213ea1b97827fafd4f41ecd487d33df149b3edc -->",

        "body":"<p>If you're a regular viewer, you'll know the look. It's the one the politicians on Question Time – the ministers and their Labour shadows – shoot at the outsider, whose status is usually signalled by their position around the table: the more distant they are from the Westminster mainstream, the further they sit from David Dimbleby. Sometimes the occupant of that fringe seat is a politician from one of the smaller parties, a George Galloway, Caroline Lucas or, this week, Nigel Farage. Sometimes it's a journalist or entertainer. But the look from the political insider is always the same.</p><p>It combines disdain, condescension and disagreement, of course. But more intriguing is the envy. The Labour spokesman on this or junior minister of that watch jealously as satirist Ian Hislop or transgender activist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paris-lees\" title=\"\">Paris Lees</a> get to say whatever they like, unguarded, tickling the audience's erogenous zones and milking the applause.</p><p>The politician watches, remembering the person inside them who once talked equally freely and who can still be funny or angry in private; but then they glance down at the talking points prepared by the party research department, the sheet filled with \"the line to take\" – and they talk the way they're meant to talk. And the rest of us zone out.</p><p>Rare is the day that a politician's speech becomes a YouTube hit or goes viral. But it happens to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JIvARoGbS4\" title=\"\">Mehdi Hasan laying into the Daily Mail</a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\" title=\"\">Russell Brand going head-to-head with Jeremy Paxman</a>. The success of Brand's \"Don't vote\" riff probably frightens some in the political class. Perhaps a luckless special adviser is drawing up bullet points for a PowerPoint presentation on the \"Brand demographic\" as I write. But I'm not sure the gap Brand is filling is really political at all. I wonder if his tanks are parked on a very different lawn.</p><p>First, though, a word on the politics. The response to Brand's intervention surely gives the lie to the tired notion that people, especially the young, are not interested. It turns out that people can be gripped by political ideas when they believe in, or are even curious about, the people articulating them. One important qualification, it seems, is that you stand somehow at odds with the establishment norm, whether by virtue of your gender, your class, your race or simply your past. So Brand is white, male and fabulously rich – but he is also, as he puts it, \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/05/russell-brand-democratic-system-newsnight\" title=\"\">a right twerp … a junkie and a cheeky monkey</a>\". And so he gets a hearing.</p><p>That move is not available to most politicians (though the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24824651\" title=\"\">mayor of Toronto</a>, Rob Ford, who this week admitted smoking crack, seems determined to give it a try). Even loosening the vocabulary is tricky. Nigel Farage can talk like Nigel Farage because he is not trying to build an electoral majority. If David Cameron copied his shtick, the Tory right would lap it up but he would lose two voters for every one he gained.</p><p>The same would happen to Ed Miliband if he adopted the voice of George Galloway. But this goes deeper than a rebel biography or knack for colloquial language. What makes an outsider strike a nerve is the sense that he or she is getting to the heart of things, talking about what really matters – not just to the country, which is an inevitably abstract notion, but in your own life.</p><p>This week, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00729d9\" title=\"\">Grayson Perry concluded his widely acclaimed Reith lectures</a>, which also broke through in a way that has eluded more conventional speakers. He too is white, male and wealthy but he doesn't look or sound like the establishment (wearing a dress tends to have that effect on men). When he wrote an essay for <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/if-i-ruled-the-world-grayson-perry/#.Un0BjY3wyE\" title=\"\">Prospect magazine's \"If I ruled the world\" slot</a>, there was some politics in there – including a call for all government jobs to be performed by women for at least a generation. But that's not what gave the piece its force.</p><p>Instead, it was Perry's remarks about emotional intelligence, his admission that it was hard \"to be aware of one's subtle feelings, responses and desires\". Or his observation that \"few people seem to have the confidence to measure subjective experiences\", which is why they rely on brands to tell them what makes good art or even what makes them happy. He wanted people to connect with their true selves, hence his call for the banning of the business suit: \"People hide behind it as a cipher for 'seriousness'.\"</p><p>Perry was touching something that almost always escapes the reach of politics: how people actually live, and their relationships with each other. When public figures enter this terrain they are often rewarded with a response that politicians can only envy. Note <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability.html\" title=\"\">Brené Brown's TED talk</a> on rethinking guilt and shame, which has now received nearly 12m views. Or the strong reaction sparked by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/05/honey-trap-plane-richard-dawkins-twitter\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins' plea</a> for us to see that public-spiritedness sometimes trumps narrow self-interest.</p><p>It's ironic, perhaps, to mention the master atheist in this context, for the gap he and others are plugging is surely the one once filled by men of God. This is the need he, Perry and even Brand are meeting – the yearning so many feel for understanding and for meaning. Brand makes an unlikely bishop, but note his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/05/russell-brand-democratic-system-newsnight\" title=\"\">Guardian sermon</a> and its lamentation that inequality is \"a warning sign of end of days\", adding that past civilisations fell, despite their wealth, because they \"had forgotten that we are one interconnected people\". Amen.</p><p></p><p>This might give pause to the church, wondering how it ceded its role to a priesthood of comedians. But politicians should feel rebuked too. Those who seek to lead need to show they understand that we are not mere economic units, whose lives can be measured in growth statistics. Of course, that's easier to do when times are good. Before the 2008 crash, Cameron was tiptoeing on to this ground, speaking about life beyond the balance sheet – whether it was premature sexualisation or \"big society\" volunteerism. Recession shut that discussion down before it had really started, <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2006/05/cameron_disting.html\" title=\"\">Cameron's talk of a \"general wellbeing\" index</a> alongside GDP now a&nbsp;faded memory.</p><p>But Labour too – even when, in government, the public coffers were flush – has often seemed too economistic in its interests and obsessions, less able to speak about what constitutes a good life. In these straitened days, it's natural and right that Ed Miliband focuses on the cost of living, on energy bills and low pay. But what Brand, Perry and the others reveal is that a deeper need exists too – a hunger that cannot be fed by bread alone.</p><p><em>Twitter:</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Freedland\" title=\"\"><em> @Freedland</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422042520|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|5359842b8875833326b361cbb097b059634ba8f7 -->",

But&nbsp;what an enchantment to be proved wrong, and by none other than Chris's erstwhile leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/07/russell-brand-row-nick-clegg-jeremy-paxman\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg, who this week offered his own view</a> of the iniquities of politicians being held to&nbsp;account.</p><p>\"Here is a guy …\" he opined of Jeremy Paxman to listeners to his LBC phone-in, \"he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics.\" Eh? It's always alarming to hear a politician say what they actually think – though given that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/nov/06/nick-clegg-fan-spin-emma-gilpin-jacobs\" title=\"\">Clegg's office staff has risen to 20</a> – 20! – you'd think there could these days be a minimum of three handlers on site in any situation in which he might make an unscripted utterance. But this revelation is more alarming than most, with the deputy prime minister apparently casting someone who holds politicians to account as a sort of parasite.</p><p>As someone who has only spent his entire professional life in politics, this may come as a shock to Clegg, but Paxman does not live off politics, any more than voters or protesters or pressure groups do. Politics is an ecosystem, of which Westminster is a component. But this ecosystem includes all manner of components other than Clegg's green-bench colleagues, from voters to non-voters to rioters to journalists to protesters to vested interests and all sorts of others besides. It should be blindingly obvious, even to a Brussels-product such as Clegg, that it includes those who ask difficult or disparaging questions of politicians – and even those who dismiss them altogether.</p><p>Without wishing to overload Clegg with further enlightenment, Westminster MPs do not \"own\" politics, any more than the Christian church owns marriage, which was knocking around as an idea long before Jesus was even a glint in the Holy Spirit's eye. They are simply part of it.</p><p>Indeed, if holding people to account were left solely to those whom Clegg would class as politicians, we'd all be the poorer. The dramatic rise in profile of the committee system in recent times has too often laid bare the disappointing calibre of MP inquisitors, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nsa-leaks-enemies-rubbing-hands-glee-mi6\" title=\"\">spy chiefs' appearance before the intelligence and security committee</a> this week being a case in point. \"Sir John, do you want to say anything?\" wondered Malcolm Rifkind of the head of MI6, deploying the sort of hardball inquiry This Morning's Holly Willoughby might lob at someone who'd just been voted off Strictly Come Dancing. If only it had been possible to bring on John Humphrys – or indeed an appalled member of the surveilled public – who might have felt less instinctively deferential.</p><p>Whatever people say about the US, it at least embraces the filth and fury of politics, and puts the whole malfunctioning and fetid business out there for all to see. In Nick Clegg's unwittingly revelatory aside on those who \"live off\" politics, there is some of the rarefied disdain of the EU, where he was politically schooled, where it is regarded as vulgar to make too many inquiries as to what the overlords are up to, and where public adversarialism is shunned in favour of private machinations. In his reflexive sense that politics should somehow be beyond the irreverent attentions of what Tony Blair called \"the sneerers\" lies the germ of what so many people loathe about Brussels.</p><p>Unhappily, though, the deputy prime minister was not done. \"At the end of the day,\" Clegg expanded to LBC listeners, \"I have got this old-fashioned view that if you want to change something, get stuck in and get your hands dirty.\"</p><p>Of all the idiotic arguments about criticism, deployed almost without exception by those who can't take it, there is none more extravagantly stupid than one that says you can't criticise something unless you've actually done it yourself. By this logic, neither you nor I should have the temerity to offer an opinion about some $200m Hollywood turkey unless we have personally had a crack at the form.</p><p>A little tip for Nick: most people in the country, whether they vote or not, \"get stuck in\" to politics every day of their lives, whether they care to or not. We live politics, to varying degrees, with the sad irony that those who might feel most voiceless in politics are the ones with the most politics in their lives, usually via the welfare state. If Clegg really wants an example of that rare group, those who have the luxury of not having to get stuck into politics, we might offer him the bankers, who have been given such a free run by the self-styled custodians of politics in Westminster that they now exist in a sort of post-politics wonderland, where socialism is evil unless it is required to bail out capitalism, and other looking-glass inversions.</p><p>The rest of us are still very much stuck into politics, and indeed to economics, and just because we haven't taken the decision to become a career politician and devote our lives to the noble business of trooping where we're told in the voting lobbies, or attempting to get the taxpayer to fund our patio furniture, doesn't mean we have forfeited the right to an opinion. I'm no electoral strategist, but I wonder whether \"keep politics for the politicians\" is quite the 2015 slogan the Lib Dems want to be going for.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarinaHyde\" title=\"\"><em>@MarinaHyde</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422031607|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|3f6d96d9dfadbedd05b8cb2c24a8040ffcf0f0ba -->",

Russell, we all feel like that. Some find it in music or literature, some in the wonders of science and others in religion.</p><p>\"But it isn't available any more in revolution.

He don't know where I live, I suppose. And no, no death camps. Just for the record, in case anyone else from Peep Show is worried, I'm definitely against death camps – just in case the bloke who plays Super Hans thinks I'm a Nazi.\"</p><p>\"Definitely no killing.

Maybe it's okay for Robert Webb; no one is going to take his kids away, but I've heard some examples.</p><p>\"I don't claim to be a politician, like all things I'm sure there are people in the room who know more about this than I do, I didn't have an education like Robert Webb had. But there are people from Leicester in Guantánamo Bay.</p><p>\"If you went to Oxbridge, if you went to a private school, no one is coming for your kids. They're not coming for you if you're from Oxbridge. That's my open letter to Robert.

        "headline":"Paxman: Brand was right over public's disgust at 'tawdry pretences' of politics",
        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/27/jeremy-paxmans-greatest-clips\" title=\"\">once asked Michael Howard the same question 12 times</a> and questioned Tony Blair if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/27/jeremy-paxmans-greatest-clips\" title=\"\">he was familiar with Megaboobs and Horny Housewives magazines</a>. Now the Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, famous for giving ruthlessly short shrift to politicians, has confirmed that his irascible on-screen attitude towards Westminster is more than skin deep.</p><p>The rottweiler figurehead of the BBC2 programme gave both barrels to all three main parties in a no-holds-barred column in the Radio Times published on Tuesday.</p><p>The presenter, 63, revealed he once did not vote because the choices were so \"unappetising\" and said politicians' burning desire to order people about was \"one of the many reasons they are so odd\".</p><p>\"At the next election we shall have a choice between the people who've given us five years of austerity, the people who left us this mess, and the people who signed public pledges that they wouldn't raise student fees, and then did so – the most blatant lie in recent political history,\" wrote Paxman.</p><p>\"It won't be a bombshell if very large numbers of the electorate simply don't bother to vote. People are sick of the tawdry pretences,\" said the presenter who dubbed the \"whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster … a remote and self-important echo-chamber\".</p><p>Paxman's withering critique followed his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\" title=\"\">much-discussed Newsnight interview with Russell Brand last week</a>. The 10-minute encounter, in which Paxman upbraided the comedian because he \"can't be arsed to vote\", became an unlikely YouTube hit, with 10 million views – nearly 20 times Newsnight's average audience.</p><p>But despite his criticism of Brand for never voting, Paxman confessed he too had once failed to vote in an election. \"I think part of Russell Brand's diagnosis is right. There is a huge sense of disillusion out there,\" he said.</p><p>\"Russell Brand has never voted, because he finds the process irrelevant. I can understand that: the whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster looks a remote and self-important echo chamber. But it is all we have. In one recent election, I decided not to vote, because I thought the choice so unappetising.</p><p>\"By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write 'none of the above' on a ballot paper – disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.\"</p><p>He warned: \"We ignore the democratic process at our peril … People died for the right to choose their government, because otherwise power is wielded by the rich and strong for the benefit of the rich and strong.</p><p>\"Whether you bother to vote or not, someone is going to sit on those benches and tell you what to do.\"</p><p>Recent Newsnight guests to have been \"Paxoed\" include Tory MP Chloe Smith, when she was economic secretary to the Treasury last year, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/sep/29/jeremy-paxman-european-commission\" title=\"\">Amadeu Altafaj-Tardio, a European commission spokesman who walked off the show after Paxman called him \"Mr Idiot\"</a>.</p><p>Paxman, who will complete 25 years on the programme next year, admitted he had low expectations of Brand, whom he interviewed on the show after the comedian guest-edited the New Statesman.</p><h2>'Spawn of the devil'</h2><p>\"A multimillionaire with a house in California talking about the need to take from the rich and give to the poor. That is – what's the word? – rich,\" said Paxman.</p><p>\"But we really ought to admit it, Daily Mail columnists may think Russell Brand the spawn of the devil. But there is something irresistible about him. The energy, the loquacity, the camp manner, the apparent frankness. He stands squarely in the British tradition of cheeky chappies.\"</p><p>He added: \"He [Brand] thinks the wrong people are in charge. Well, perhaps they are. But the people in charge are always people who want to be in charge … I have no burning desire to order people about. Politicians do; that is one of the many reasons they are so odd.\"</p><p>The BBC traditionally frowns on its presenters, especially those in BBC News, using columns to comment on news and current affairs. Strict guidelines were introduced 10 years ago after several controversies caused by corporation presenters and journalists speaking out in newspapers and magazines.</p><p>Days after the Tory party chairman, Grant Shapps, complained about a lack of \"fairness\" in the BBC's reporting, Paxman appeared to be equally dismissive of all three parties.</p><p>The BBC declined to comment on Paxman's statements.</p><p>In last week's Newsnight interview, Brand asked Paxman: \"Aren't you bored, aren't you more bored than anyone? Ain't you been talking to [politicians] year after year, listening to their lies, their nonsense, then it's this one gets in, that one gets in, but the problem continues? Why are we going to continue to contribute to that facade?\"</p><p>Brand, it appears, may have been closer to the truth than he realised.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421642267|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|033913a70f5dfe05cd5e86ac9bf1637b5bfbcbb6 -->",

He joins actors Charlie Sheen and Jamie Foxx and basketball star Ty Lawson on the company's roster.</p> <p>Called simply <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/russell-brand/id733557559?mt=8\">Russell Brand</a>, the iPhone and iPad app &ndash; with Android likely to follow, judging by TopFan's previous releases &ndash; is fairly standard for its genre, with feeds of Brand's official posts on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook as well as photo and video galleries.</p> <p>It also invites people to compete in \"interactive fan challenges\" to win autographs, merchandise, meet-and-greets and other rewards from the star. Fans will earn points by completing the challenges &ndash; although none are yet available within the app &ndash; exchanging them for prizes.</p> <p>15,000 points will earn a copy of Brand's Scandalous live show, 40,000 points an autographed Rolling Stone magazine, and for fans keen enough to accumulate 500,000 points, they'll win a 10-minute Skype call with the star.</p> <p>Are celebrity apps just vanity projects? They can actually be decent money-spinners. Musician <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/1560642/how-trey-songzs-fan-club-app-earns-more-than-50k-a-month\">Trey Songz was making $50,000 a month</a> from his fan-app in May this year, with fans bidding to get their profile photos featured on its \"Instant VIP\" board.</p> <p>That app's developer, Handmade Mobile Entertainment, has been applying lessons learned from its Flirtomatic dating app to celebrities, working with Soulja Boy, Terrell Owens and The Only Way Is Essex's Mark Wright on similar apps.</p> <p>Also in May, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/appsblog/2013/may/07/snoop-dogg-snoopify-app-instagram\">Snoop Dogg launched an app called Snoopify</a>, which fans could use to customise their photos with virtual stickers bought from an in-app shop.&nbsp;By June, the app was <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324069104578531820453319946\">selling $30,000 of stickers a week</a>, and by August <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/09/snoop-lion-spliff-smoke-app-snoopify\">included a $99.99 spliff as one of its options</a>, bought 15 times in its first week.</p> <p>That's not a strategy likely to appeal to the drug-free Brand, whose app's moneymaking is more about promoting his tour, books and films, while keeping fans up to date on his latest news and political views.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421881068|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|33604b8a930e01e75176bcff2e4f6ae7081870eb -->",

        "body":"<p>Nick Clegg criticised Jeremy Paxman on Thursday for being \"sneering about politics\", while at the same time making a good living from Westminster. The Newsnight presenter treated all politicians as \"rogues and charlatans\", Clegg said.</p><p>The deputy prime minister took aim at Paxman on his regular LBC radio show after Paxman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/05/paxman-politics-russell-brand-voting\" title=\"Guardian\">suggested this week</a> that he had some sympathy with Russell Brand's disillusionment with politics and refusal to vote.</p><p>In the Radio Times Paxman wrote: \"I can understand that: the whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster looks a remote and self-important echo-chamber,\" adding that in one recent election he did not vote as he felt the choice of candidates was \"so unappetising\".</p><p>Clegg was scathing when asked about Paxman's comments, telling listeners: \"Here is a guy who gets paid a million pounds, thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers. He lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics.\"</p><p>Paxman was at first dismissive of Brand's argument, expounded in a <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\" title=\"\">long essay in the New Statesman</a>, that voting was pointless given the fundamental similarity of political parties. A subsequent interview on Newsnight has been viewed on YouTube more than 9m times sparking a debate on disaffection with the political system.</p><p>Another comedian, Robert Webb, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/russell-brand-robert-webb-choosing-vote-most-british-kind-revolution-there\" title=\"\">wrote a response to Brand in the New Statesman</a>, arguing that it was absurd to dissuade young people from voting. Clegg echoed that view, saying that to remove yourself entirely from voting and politics was \"a total abdication of responsibility\".</p><p>He said: \"We know that politics is not perfect, but at the end of the day it is the way that we decide how you pay your taxes, how we support our hospitals, our schools, whether we are going to war or not, how we deal with climate change.</p><p>\"Of course it is sometimes unedifying, but this idea that you can just sort of sneer at the whole thing, dismiss everyone as being rogues and charlatans and therefore 'I am going to wash my hands of the whole thing' – I think it is a total abdication of responsibility.</p><p>\"At the end of the day I have got this old-fashioned view that if you want to improve something, get stuck in and get your hands dirty. Don't somehow pretend that you can turn your back on it.\"</p><p>In the Radio Times column Paxman said politicians' burning desire to order people about was \"one of the many reasons they are so odd\".</p><p>He said: \"At the next election we shall have a choice between the people who've given us five years of austerity, the people who left us this mess, and the people who signed public pledges that they wouldn't raise student fees, and then did so – the most blatant lie in recent political history.\"</p><p>He said he had regretted his decision not to vote. \"By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write 'none of the above' on a ballot paper – disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421895836|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|72ad371df58a1fb90e7e39b2c0abfd86913b8a68 -->",
