        "body":"<p>Samoa's coach, Matt Parish, is trying to manage his injury-ravaged squad carefully as they head into the quarter-finals of the World Cup. A last-eight spot was all but assured by way of a 38-4 victory over Papua New Guinea in Hull,  in what was effectively a shoot-out for the last qualifying place in Group B.</p><p>An Antonio Winterstein hat-trick and impressive displays from Anthony Milford and Sia Soliola were at the heart of the win, and Parish needs to make sure they and the rest of his 17 players from the game stay healthy.</p><p>The former Salford man was able to name only an 18-man squad for the game owing to the amount of injuries he is dealing with and, with no replacements allowed, he must make sure no more drop out before a quarter-final against England or Fiji.</p><p>\"We have to regroup now and manage them in training as we can't afford any more injuries,\" he said.</p><p>Parish has lost Frank Winterstein to a tournament-ending injury and said he expects announcements to be made about the fitness of his captain, Harrison Hansen, and the versatile Rene Maitua over the coming days.</p><p>Against PNG Parish's men looked light years away from the side hammered by the England Knights in a pre-tournament warm-up. \"I'm very pleased and I said all along that as the tournament goes on we will improve,\" he said. \"Our first-half performance was as good as any other team in this tournament so far. I thought we played very well and to win a World Cup game 38-4 showed outstanding defence.</p><p>\"The first half really was outstanding and we will look to improve as the tournament continues.\"</p><p>For Papua New Guinea, the prospect of a second World Cup without a win is now a real one, with this defeat added to one against France and a meeting with New Zealand ahead of them.</p><p>The Kumuls have not lived up to their reputation as entertainers and have just 12 points to their name.</p><p>\"Our start was really poor and that was the No1 priority in the week, to start well,\" the coach, Adrian Lam, said. \"One thing we have always done in Papua New Guinea is score points and we haven't done that. We didn't handle their size and they were too big and strong.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421663305|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|0f1068a590d60075934a5618eee72e1f0cdba30f -->",

        "body":"<p>England fought through the wind and rain to get up and running at this World Cup but a cloud lingers over their campaign. This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/02/england-ireland-rugby-league-world-cup\" title=\"\">42-0 victory over Ireland</a> was a formality after 20 minutes but for Steve McNamara controversy has followed his squad even as their two performances so far have shown them to be a force in the tournament.</p><p>An eight-try win against Mark Aston's Ireland should have reason enough for an afternoon to savour but McNamara was forced to rebuff questions about Zak Hardaker's absence. There were suggestions the Leeds back did not travel on the team bus to Saturday's game at Huddersfield following a breach of discipline. The official line from England was that Hardaker was ill.</p><p>A group of players went out drinking following the warm-up defeat by Italy. Gareth Hock was dealt with swiftly by England <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/22/gareth-hock-england-rugby-league-world-cup\" title=\"\">for breaking an alcohol ban and thrown out of the squad</a>. James Graham did not play in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/26/australia-england-rugby-league-world-cup\" title=\"\">28-20 loss to Australia</a>.</p><p>McNamara has denied that Graham's non-selection followed a breach of discipline and, asked if Hardaker's absence  was for disciplinary reasons, he said: \"Absolutely not. You people are just making things up to try and disrupt my squad.\"</p><p>Graham returned on Saturday, when England ran in six tries in a blistering opening 25 minutes that left Ireland breathless and bewildered. They stemmed the early white tide but once Ryan Hall had scored a hat-trick and Tom Briscoe two, the result was never in doubt. When asked about missing the first game of the tournament Graham, of Canterbury Bulldogs, admitted he was frustrated but is now pleased to be back.</p><p>\"I am just trying to do my job for the team,\" he said. \"I am not trying to make it about me or trying to do anything that is not within the game-plan or go away from what we are trying to do as a team. I try and stay calm out there and do my job.</p><p>\"It was frustrating missing last week but I was not selected. It is not my thing to talk about selection policy, you would have to ask the coach. I was still cheering the boys on.\"</p><p>McNamara will check on Graham and George Burgess this week, before England's final group match against Fiji on Saturday at Hull, after the pair sustained minor injuries. The England coach will have been impressed by his side's display, which included a fine performance from Rangi Chase as well as Hall and Briscoe.</p><p>Graham added: \"It was really good to be back playing on English soil again, it has been a while. It was really good to be out there and playing with a good set of boys.</p><p></p><p>\"We are just taking it week by week. I do not think there is any point in coming out and saying we can win it [the World Cup]. We will just focus on Fiji and hopefully we can get a win and go into the quarter-finals. Our forwards have to stand up in every game so Fiji is not different. We will not be taking them lightly.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421573280|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|52314a1290b9abc6fb3a70434208ec912482733b -->",

        "body":"<p>The <strong>Wales</strong> coach, Iestyn Harris, put on a brave face after his side crashed out of the World Cup by losing a second consecutive match to a qualifying team.</p><p>Their 24-16 Group D defeat by the <strong>United States</strong> at Wrexham on Sunday, followed the 32-16 loss to <strong>Italy</strong> at the Millennium Stadium in their opening group match and Harris said: \"It's a bad result but, as the World Cup has shown, I don't think you can tag anybody as a bad team because, come the World Cup, they come from all over the world.</p><p>\"There wasn't one USA man in the whole squad. There's a lot of Australian-based players in there who are of a very good quality.\"</p><p>The defeat rendered meaningless Wales' final pool match against Cook Islands in Neath on Sunday but it left the Tomahawks contemplating a quarter-final against <strong>Australia</strong> in Wrexham.</p><p>There was no hint of the shock to come when Christiaan Roets gave Wales the lead with the first of his two tries but they conceded 24 points before producing a late rally.</p><p>Harris bemoaned his side's poor decision making and said: \"We had probably 20 or 25 opportunities in the game to score points. We took a lot of wrong options</p><p>\"We're not a good enough side to be at 50-60 per cent and expect to win games. We weren't anywhere near where we needed to be. We didn't deserve to win.</p><p>\"The USA were dogged and they stayed with us. It was up to us to put that game to bed and we weren't good enough.\"</p><p>At Derwent Park, meanwhile, Ben Hellewell's second try earned <strong>Scotland</strong> a 30-30 draw against <strong>Italy</strong> in Group C.</p><p>Inspired by Danny Brough, Scotland, who had beaten Tonga five days earlier, seemed on course for another victory when they led 14-0. But Italy came back and, as the Scots faded in the second half, went ahead 30-26 before Hellewell intervened to deny them victory.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421574825|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|2ac616e941aeee02daae5b922cb3ff219b79f2ef -->",

They haven't put it back in so it looks like his tour is over.\"</p><p>Fiji, playing muscular, pragmatic football, tested the tournament favourites amid the winds and icy rain.</p><p>Fiji were first on the scoreboard, with Alipate Noilea putting over a penalty on seven minutes.</p><p>Manly's Daly Cherry-Evans laid on Australia's first try for debutant Josh Papalii in the 14th minute, and seven minutes after that Darius Boyd picked up Lewis's pass to go over for the second. The centre Michael Jennings went over before the break to give Australia a 16-2 lead at the break.</p><p>After half-time Australia ploughed relentlessly through the bleak St Helens night while Fiji did go close to scoring once or twice.</p><p>Cherry-Evans finished off a long-range movement to cross between the posts at 56 minutes and Lewis stepped neatly past the cover to touch down with 15 minutes left, just before his injury.</p><p>But Fiji showed enough to indicate that if conditions are similar in Hull on Saturday night, they have the structure and power to worry England.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421537872|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|ccd2732902d3c6f668ddb2f7124a823284cb1de8 -->",

        "headline":"England bounce back to hammer Ireland in Rugby League World Cup",
        "body":"<p>England have arrived at the party, but Ireland barely got through the door. This was as one-sided as a World Cup game can be, albeit that the early white tide was briefly stemmed, as England secured their first victory in the competition to get up and running in Group A.</p><p>Steve McNamara's side started in the same impressive manner that they did against Australia last Saturday and remain on course for a semi-final encounter with New Zealand. The opening 25 minutes was one-way traffic as England crossed the line six times without reply, Ryan Hall scoring a hat-trick and Tom Briscoe two as Ireland were opened up with alarming ease.</p><p>England led 30-0 before 30 minutes had been played, as a sell-out crowd of 24,375, a stadium record, enjoyed some scintillating attacking play. Eight tries were scored in all and Ireland rarely threatened the England line – whenever they did venture into opposition territory their efforts were usually met by dismal handling errors.</p><p>There was a 30-minute period either side of half-time when England's level dropped, as the wind and rain swirled across west Yorkshire. However, by then the result was already assured and Kallum Watkins added another try to stretch England's lead.</p><p>McNamara was in no mood before the game to discuss Zak Hardaker's absence from the squad amid allegations of a breach of discipline. Asked whether Hardaker's omission was related to alcohol, McNamara replied: \"Absolutely not. You people are just making this up to try and disrupt the squad.\"</p><p>The England coach's demeanour will have improved, though, after an impressive opening 20 minutes. The first 24 points were scored by Leeds players as Hall and Briscoe capitalised on some lacklustre defending, with Kevin Sinfield adding to the score with his boot.</p><p>\"We're pretty pleased,\" said McNamara. \"We hit a purple patch in the first half and played some nice stuff overall so we're pretty pleased. Ireland threatened us and put us under a little bit of pressure, but we did OK. We showed a bit of grit, kept them out so that bodes well.</p><p>\"It's very difficult selecting a team, a 17 to go on the field, because they are all very good players. There are some players very disappointed to miss out.</p><p>\"We've got a couple [of injuries]. George [Burgess] got a knock in the first five minutes and James Graham is a slight concern but I don't think they are major.\"</p><p>Sinfield added: \"The driving rain in the second half affected our play but we should expect those conditions and be able to handle them.\"</p><p>Hall first went over in the corner after two minutes in a move that involved a smart offload from Rangi Chase and a final pass from Leroy Cudjoe that seemed to take an age, before the Rhinos winger dived low to open the scoring.</p><p>Ten minutes later Cudjoe fed Hall on the same flank for the blond to score again, before a blistering Briscoe double increased the lead.</p><p>Sam Tomkins, who produced a fine display at full-back, lifted a high kick from left to right for Briscoe, who showed wonderful agility to claim the catch and stay in touch before diving over. Tomkins then showed a burst of pace from deep with a 40-metre surge upfield, offloading inside to the onrushing Briscoe who added his second.</p><p>The Ireland coach, Mark Aston, said: \"We're disappointed because there were large spells in the game when we were very competitive. They asked questions and at times we couldn't answer. There are no excuses. We were battered again today but we go on to Saturday and, hey, we might get battered again.</p><p>\"I still think there are areas you can exploit [England], they've still got some work to do to get to the level they want. It was always tough with the group that we were pulled out in. You've got to put in perspective where we are as a developing nation. But it will stand us in good stead going forward.\"</p><p>Hall completed his hat-trick and in the process overtook Tomkins as England's leading try-scorer – he now has 17 in 17 Tests – before Brett Ferres scored the sixth in the space of 25 breathtaking minutes to secure a 30-0 half-time lead.</p><p>The pace of the game dropped but Watkins lifted the temporary malaise with his try after being set up by Briscoe, who collected brilliantly from a Gareth Widdop kick, before Chase went over for his first try in eight Tests.</p><p>It was an emphatic result, but England have far tougher tests to come.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421517038|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|d7c19d325147d7e2169cf3e8037672597202c57b -->",

        "headline":"New Zealand crush France with Shaun Johnson and Issac Luke to the fore",
        "body":"<p>Shaun Johnson and Issac Luke turned on the style as the defending champions New Zealand clicked into gear to beat France 48-0 in Avignon.</p><p>Stephen Kearney's side were sometimes good, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/27/new-zealand-samoa-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">sometimes patchy as they beat Samoa in their Group B opener last weekend</a>, but were far improved on Friday as they virtually assured themselves of top spot.</p><p>Half-back Johnson scored 24 points while hooker Luke was simply too quick and creative in and around the ruck for Richard Agar's France.</p><p>The duo really came into their own after New Zealand earned the right to play, slugging it out with the French in a rough opening 30 minutes. After that it was a free for all, and they duly ran in eight tries for a tournament-high score, achieved even without Sonny Bill Williams, who did not feature.</p><p>As with last week's win, the Kiwis started well and just four minutes had gone when they touched down for the first time. Kieran Foran's kick from the left fell perfectly into the hands of a rising Krisnan Inu, who duly dotted down his first try in New Zealand colours. Johnson added the goal and then went close to laying on a try with a kick out of hand. His right-to-left chip appeared to be shelled by Cyril Stacul leading to a score for Frank Pritchard, but the video referee Shayne Hayne decided Jason Nightingale had committed a knock-on and no try was given.</p><p>Kicks were ruining France – even in attack as Andrew Bentley's apparently good 40-20 was not given – and a second try went against them from another one in the 24th minute. New Zealand had already gone close when Jean-Philippe Baile dumped Nightingale in touch, but when Johnson's kick found Bryson Goodwin, no one could get across to cover and the centre scored.</p><p>So accustomed to fielding kicks, France nearly conceded down the middle as half-time approached, but were saved by Hayne again. Luke broke through and after his pass went loose, it eventually found his team-mate Roger Tuivasa-Sheck who torched down the middle to the posts. The vide referee, though, called a knock-on against Kevin Locke in the build-up. But Frank-Paul Nu'uausala made it a trio of first-half scores, taking a no-look pass from Luke under the posts in the 38th minute, giving Johnson an easy conversion.</p><p>France had not been outplayed but were finding New Zealand's defence tough to break down, a trait which continued into the second half as Jared Waerea-Hargreaves drove Freddy Vaccari into the ground as he closed in on the corner.</p><p>The hosts' inability to find gaps was costing them and with 51 minutes gone New Zealand showed them the way once more. Luke nipped away from the ruck and had Johnson on his inside to do the rest before adding the goal for good measure. The same duo linked up in identical fashion four minutes later to add another six points – Luke far too clever and quick for France – before Greg Eastwood barged his way over for a sixth try which was also converted.</p><p>Morgan Escare nearly got a consolation for France as he went the length of the field on an intercept before Locke swept up, and play quickly went back to the other end as Nu'uausala dragged two men over with him for his double. An eighth score would follow with the last play of the game too, Tuivasa-Sheck reaching out after a scramble, with Johnson maintaining his 100% record with the boot.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421489655|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|264f95ce1a531b01e95f31fa6e04fe31d83319e7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Kevin Sinfield is expecting Ireland to \"throw everything\" at England when they meet in their World Cup group match  on Saturday, as the two sides look to bounce back from opening defeats in the tournament and avoid early exits.</p><p>England, having lost their first Group A game 28-20 to the favourites, Australia, have made three changes to their squad with James Graham, Sean O'Loughlin and Tom Briscoe all named in the 19, replacing Lee Mossop, Josh Charnley and the suspended Sam Burgess.</p><p>Graham returns after being left out by Steve McNamara for the opening match, reportedly for a breach of discipline, and the co-hosts will be spurred on by a sell-out crowd in Huddersfield.</p><p>Ireland were beaten 32-14 by Fiji on Monday, leaving Mark Aston's side knowing a result  is crucial before their final group match against Australia. However, Sinfield, the England captain who was part of the squad that dispatched Ireland in the 2000 World Cup quarter-final, is confident of a first win in the competition.</p><p>\"We know how important this game is and we know how important the performance is. Everyone is fighting for places and the squad is really committed to trying to do something special for England. We need to get off the board now and play well this week,\" he said. \"Ireland are going to turn up tomorrow and throw everything at us, we're aware of that. We're preparing for the best of Ireland. A lot of the lads have experienced playing here in front of big crowds.</p><p>\"The group are fully concentrated on what's between our four walls. Our expectation is greater than anything that anybody externally can put on us. We just want to get out there and play well, perform, hopefully get the winand get this competition moving for us.\"</p><p>On the Australia defeat, Sinfield added: \"We learned a lot of lessons from it. When you're in a tournament like this you have to switch your minds pretty quickly. We sat and watched the Ireland game on Monday night and we realise how important this game is for us.</p><p>\"We could have sat and dwelled all week about it or we could have done something about it, which is the attitude we took.\"</p><p>England's preparations for the match suffered a minor glitch  when the fire alarm was activated in the team hotel, forcing the players outside at 6.30am.</p><p>Sam Tomkins, whose brother Joel will represent the England union team against Australia  on Saturday, joked that \"it must have been the Irish\" but Sinfield played down any potential ill effects of the wake-up call. McNamara said there were no major injury concerns and revealed that there had been messages of supportshared between the two codes before a huge weekend.</p><p>\"With Sam and Joel, the two brothers playing, there have been some good luck messages. We've had plenty of good support from other national sports and rugby union is one of them. Hopefully we can get a great double done tomorrow and England beat Australia and we get the job done against Ireland,\" said McNamara.</p><p>\"We expect Ireland to be very good against us. They know a lot about us but fortunately we know a lot about them as well. It's going to be a good contest. There has been a lot of expectation on the team. There has been for a fair period of time now, none more so than we put on ourselves. It's probably not about who we are playing but how we perform ourselves which is important.\"</p><p><strong>England</strong> <strong>Ablett</strong> (Leeds Rhinos), <strong>Briscoe</strong> (Leeds Rhinos), <strong>G Burgess</strong> (Rabbitohs), <strong>T Burgess</strong> ( Rabbitohs), <strong>Burrow</strong> (Leeds Rhinos), <strong>Chase</strong> (Castleford Tigers), <strong>Cudjoe</strong> (Huddersfield Giants),<strong> L Farrell</strong> (Wigan Warriors), <strong>Ferres</strong> (Huddersfield Giants), <strong>Graham</strong> (Canterbury Bulldogs), <strong>Hall</strong> (Leeds Rhinos), <strong>Hill</strong> (Warrington Wolves),<strong> O'Loughlin</strong> (Wigan Warriors), <strong>Roby</strong> (St Helens), <strong>Sinfield</strong> (Leeds Rhinos, capt), <strong>Tomkins</strong> (Wigan Warriors), <strong>Watkins</strong> (Leeds Rhinos), <strong>Westwood</strong> (Warrington Wolves), <strong>Widdop</strong> (Melbourne Storm).</p><p><strong>Ireland</strong> <strong>Allen</strong> (Widnes), <strong>Ambler</strong> (Halifax), <strong>Beswick</strong> (Leigh), <strong>Blanch</strong> (Catalan Dragons), <strong>Bridge</strong> (Warrington), <strong>Currie</strong> (Warrington), <strong>Finn</strong> (Featherstone, capt), <strong>Finnigan</strong> (Leigh), <strong>Haggerty</strong> (Barrow), <strong>Hasson</strong> (Manly), <strong>Kostjasyn</strong> (North Queensland), <strong>Littler</strong> (Leigh), <strong>McCarthy</strong> (Warrington),<strong>Mendeika</strong> (Warrington), <strong>Mullally</strong> (Huddersfield), <strong>Pewhairangi</strong> (Parramatta), <strong>Richards</strong> (Wigan), <strong>Toole</strong> (St George Illawarra), <strong>White</strong> (Canberra).</p><p><strong>Referee</strong> T Alibert (Fr)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421478023|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|a36d30aaed2c84f84eb55336a7aab72f3a16d5d7 -->",

        "body":"<p>George Burgess is glad to be home, even if he is without a few comforts. The burly forward was England's standout player in their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/26/australia-england-rugby-league-world-cup\" title=\"\">opening World Cup game against Australia</a>, making history on his debut as part of the first trio of brothers to represent the nation, and has left the sun and sand of Sydney behind for a shot at glory.</p><p>Burgess moved from Bradford to Russell Crowe's South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2011 but will return to his native west Yorkshire on Saturday when England attempt to get their World Cup campaign up and running against Ireland in Huddersfield. There were plenty of positives to take from the 28-20 defeat to Australia but Steve McNamara's side know a win is now crucial to avoid an early exit.</p><p>Having acclimatised to life in Australia, Burgess is enjoying being back in England, even if his routine has been disrupted. \"I love to get to the ocean and freshen my legs up [before a game]. If you were going to do something similar over here you'd probably go to the local pool or whatever. It's totally different,\" he says.</p><p>\"It was a bit of a risk going out there that early but I just wanted to try and test myself. A few people recognise your face now and again [in Sydney]. It's a bit funny but I'd stop and say hello to anyone, so it's good. Everyone's friendly and says hello for a chat.\"</p><p>The Burgess's rise to prominence in Australia has meant all four brothers, including the oldest of the bunch, Luke, who was the only one omitted from McNamara's squad, receive minor-celebrity status. A recent documentary that tracked Sam's move to the NRL – as well as the lives of George, his twin Tom and Luke – opened the door to Burgess family life, with mother Julie a teacher in Sydney.</p><p>She has remained in Australia while three of her flock attempt to secure a World Cup title for a northern hemisphere side for the first time in more than 40 years, staying up long into the night to watch England's opening match.</p><p>\"I spoke to her on Sunday,\" says George Burgess. \"She loved the game even though we lost, she just enjoyed watching us run out. She stayed up to watch it but I think everyone else fell asleep. She was very excited and said she couldn't get to sleep afterwards because she was so pumped.\"</p><p></p><p>Burgess, who won the rookie-of-the-year award in the NRL last season, marked his international debut last weekend with a try but claimed his display was irrelevant because England left Cardiff pointless. However, McNamara was clearly impressed with the 21-year-old's performance and he now has the opportunity to cement his place in the England starting side. \"It was always my goal to make my way into the England side. I probably didn't think it would be this quick but it's going well,\" he  says. \"There's very strong competition, particularly in the forwards. You've got to go out and do your best for the team, that's what counts.</p><p>\"It was good to get my first cap and I was very excited to get out there with my brothers and sing the national anthem. It was a great feeling – I just can't wait to get out there and do it in a winning side.</p><p>\"It was very special all four of us playing together [for South Sydney] but it was also very special three of us playing for England. It's pretty hard to compare them both.\"</p><p>About his return homeon Saturday, Burgess adds: \"It's going to be great to be back in Yorkshire, playing in front of a lot of people that I know. I'll have a lot of family and friends going and it will be great to put on the jersey in front of them all.</p><p>\" I don't have enough tickets to go around – I keep getting asked for tickets but I think it's a sell-out so I'm struggling a bit there. I'm really looking forward to it and I can't wait.\"</p><p>England will be without Sam Burgess for Saturday's match after he received a one-match ban for a high tackle on Australia's Sam Thaiday, a challenge that resulted in the Australian press labelling him a \"thug\". \"They like to put that label on him sometimes,\" says Burgess. \"You've just got to put stuff like that to one side, try and stay in the bubble and not take too much notice of it.\"</p><p>Staying in the bubble will be the message McNamara emphasises in the build-up to the Ireland game as England look to avoid the complacency that was their downfall against Italy in a warm-up tie.</p><p>For Burgess, though, there is no doubt that a World Cup title is within their grasp. \"We're not the finished article yet,\" he says. \"There's a lot more to come.\"</p><p><strong>England squad C Ablett</strong> Leeds Rhinos, <strong>T Briscoe</strong> Hull FC, <strong>G Burgess</strong> South Sydney, <strong>T Burgess</strong> South Sydney, <strong>R Burrow</strong> Leeds Rhinos, <strong>R Chase</strong> Castleford Tigers, <strong>L Cudjoe</strong> Huddersfield Giants, <strong>L Farrell</strong> Wigan Warriors, <strong>B Ferres</strong> Huddersfield Giants, <strong>J Graham</strong> Canterbury, <strong>R Hall</strong> Leeds Rhinos, <strong>C Hill </strong>Warrington Wolves, <strong>S O'Loughlin</strong> Wigan Warriors, <strong>J Roby </strong>St Helens, <strong>K Sinfield</strong> (capt) Leeds Rhinos, <strong>S Tomkins</strong> Wigan Warriors, <strong>K Watkins</strong> Leeds Rhinos, <strong>B Westwood</strong> Warrington Wolves, <strong>G Widdop</strong> Melbourne Storm</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421400057|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|f87214427ffe4c18e044a14a47817ced8638ef5d -->",

        "headline":"Bristol opens its heart to the Cook Islands as they take on the USA",
        "body":"<p>Wednesday night, and Gloucester Road is gridlocked. \"Can't think why,\" said the cabbie. \"There must be something on.\" So there was. The Cook Islands versus the USA. The Rugby League World Cup had come to Bristol, a corner of the country where union is the game they play.</p><p>It was not the first time international league teams had played in the city, but no one there was alive to see the last one. It was 102 years ago, when Australia beat  Wales &amp; South West 23–3 at Ashton Gate in front of what was described at the time as a crowd of \"1,000 confused spectators\". At least seven times as many were at the Memorial Stadium, the crowd filling the terraces in three of the rickety stands around the windswept ground.</p><p>That sounds small, but pessimists had been predicting that the game would do well to attract half that many. Given that it was a match between two obscure teams in a city with no grounding in the game, it was a good turn-out, a fine tribute to the work done by the PR people and the wonderful quality of the matches that had come before it in the tournament.</p><p>They were an eclectic mix of expat experts from the league-loving territories Up North and Down Under, enthusiastic Americans, a lot of them family and friends of the players, and curious locals who rightly reckoned that £10 was a price worth paying for a World Cup ticket, whatever the code.</p><p>They got their money's worth before the match even began, as it was preceded by lavish entertainments which seemed somewhat at odds with the low-key surrounds on a wet Wednesday night. After the cheerleaders, the samba band, the Cook Island dancers and musicians, the modern dance done by a hundred local school children, the choir singing Jerusalem, a tribute to the Avon &amp; Somerset police force, a small military parade, the national anthems, a long and vivid haka in which the Cook Islanders seemed to threaten to do all manner of terrible things to the US players, the game finally began.</p><p>The Cook Islanders may have brought plenty of hardy dancers who performed bare-chested, and bare-footed before the start, but they did not have too many supporters. Which was unsurprising, given that the country has a population of around 19,000, slightly smaller than that of Frome. This, then, was one of the biggest mismatches in international sport. Though in fairness to the USA, while there may be 313m people living there, only 836 of them are registered rugby league players. And a lot of those seemed to have been left behind, their places taken by overseas players with obscure qualifications.</p><p>If the Cook Islands did not have many supporters at the start of the night, they had thousands by the end. The Bristolians adopted them, partly because of a natural inclination to root for the underdog, and partly because of an equally instinctive irritation at the American supporters and their boisterous cries of \"U-S-A! U-S-A!\" So the visitors were treated to some of the more traditional terrace chants, like \"Who are you? Who are you?\" as Lulia Lulia scored to make it 14-14, and \"You're not singing any more,\" when Dominique Peyroux made it 20-20 when there were 17 minutes to go.</p><p>The USA pulled away to win 32-20, an impressive victory given that this was their first World Cup match, and that they have had so little time working with their new coach, Terry Matterson.</p><p>By the end then, every one of the 7,000 spectators was smiling. Some more than others. Phil Cole, for instance. In 2002 he had posted a message on an internet forum asking if anyone in Bristol was interested in starting a league team. A handful of people replied, enough to surround a pub table. They formed the Bristol Sonics, and in their first season they fielded a side which included only five men who had ever played the game. A decade later, the Sonics have two senior teams, two youth teams, and, together with the University of Gloucester All Golds, have managed to introduce the game to a lot of local schools.</p><p>Some of the Sonics players gave a guard of honour for the teams as they came out on to the pitch. This match, then, was a triumph for the likes of Cole and his club, just as much as it was for the USA.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421334426|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|c06e90a8b00089d2d0f41671909ce056795f5041 -->",
