        "headline":"Can a play ever be too short?",
        "body":"<p>Linger at a press desk on a first night and you are guaranteed to see smiles all round when critics discover they are about to see a show with a short running time. Of course, nobody expects that Chichester's upcoming King Lear with<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/28/frank-langella-king-lear\"> Frank Langella</a> will finish in 90 minutes without an interval, but sometimes the lure of an early night, particularly after a run of epic shows, can be attractive. After all, nobody likes a playwright who after there's nothing more to be said still carries on saying it. It's sacrilege to think it, but sometimes even Shakespeare could have benefited from an editor.</p><p>Do other theatregoers feel short-changed if the play lasts less time than it takes to get to the theatre or have a pre-show cup of tea and a slice of cake? London's Print Room is currently reviving <a href=\"http://www.the-print-room.org/page66.htm\">Pinter's The Dumb Waiter</a> in a production by that fine actor and now director <a href=\"http://www.ayoungertheatre.com/feature-spotlight-on-jamie-glover-actor-director-pinter-print-room-dumb-waiter/\">Jamie Glover</a>. In a few blogposts and reviews, I noticed that critics, although enthusiastic about the production, also mention that the <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/39094/the-dumb-waiter\">55-minute running time makes for an insubstantial evening</a>. </p><p>The Dumb Waiter is often paired with another Pinter short but, although I haven't seen this particular revival, I think it's a meaty enough play to merit being mounted on its own. Earlier this year I saw Beckett's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/may/22/not-i-review\">Not I</a>, performed by the remarkable Lisa Dwan (look out for its return to the <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/beckett-trilogy\">Royal Court</a> after Christmas with Footfalls and Rockaby), and I can't for imagine anyone who has experienced its extraordinary intensity would complain about its 8min 45sec running time. Brevity doesn't have to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/apr/16/theatre\"> suffocate playwrights</a>, as <a href=\"http://www.miniaturists.co.uk/\">the Miniaturists</a>,<a href=\"http://www.theatreuncut.com/\"> Theatre Uncut</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/breakfast-plays-clean\">Traverse Breakfast Plays</a> have proved numerous times.</p><p>Maybe people who divide the cost of their ticket by the number of minutes spent in the theatre (I once saw a group of American students do just that with the West End transfer of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/07/caryl-churchill-landmark-theatre\">Caryl Churchill's</a> Far Away), but it seems like an odd way to value art. After all, paying £20 for 55 minutes of entertainment at the Print Room may be far more rewarding than spending £20 on three hours of entertainment elsewhere. But I suppose if you arrive at the theatre at 7.30pm and are out before 8.30 there is quite a lot of evening to fill before it's time for cocoa. </p><p>What do you think?
