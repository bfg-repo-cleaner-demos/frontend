        "body":"<p>Rolfe looked like the sort of person you wouldn't want to run into in a dark alley. And yet that is exactly where I ran into him. He occasionally slept in the alley next to the commercial building <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/christmas-guilt-homeless-children\" title=\"\">in which I took discreet refuge while dispossessed</a>.</p><p></p><p>Rolfe had worked out how to work the cane bolt which gave access to the alley from the outside. At a towering six feet, four inches – his size enhanced by layers of secondhand coats and threadbare blankets – the first time I ran into him, I was frightened. His face was obscured by matted hair, dirt and scrapes. After a few days, we began to silently acknowledge each other with a small nod of the head.</p><p></p><p>One February morning, I looked out the window and saw Rolfe covered with snow. I was certain he was dead. He was not, but from that point onwards, on nights when the weather was particularly cold, I would leave the door to a storage area at the back of the building slightly ajar for him. He would sneak in, rest a while and disappear by dawn. In time, we started to share what little food we had, at first silently. Later, we started to share stories.</p><p></p><p>Rolfe had been in the military all his adult life. He had served in Bosnia and twice in Iraq. The second Iraq conflict left him disillusioned and traumatised, for reasons he wouldn't share and at which I could only guess. After leaving the forces, his life collapsed. The small resettlement grant he received lasted a very short time. He spoke of booze, anger, depression and family breakup. He spoke of his inability to cope with ordinary \"civvy\" pressures. Rolfe had spent all his life in the bosom of his family, then straight into the structured care of his unit. He had never dealt with rent or bills or finding a job or the local council; he had never chosen a utility or phone service; never made a household budget, shopped or cooked for himself; never negotiated the maze the rest of us navigate daily without thinking. He could survive in the desert under enemy fire, but was lost when it came to getting a TV licence. He ended up an alcoholic, sleeping rough.</p><p></p><p>Rolfe is, sadly, far from unique. Estimates suggest that, in London, <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/rough-sleeping.html\" title=\"\">former armed forces personnel make up 10% of homeless individuals</a>. They are more likely than others to brave sleeping rough because of their training and less likely to seek help. In the past two years, in Scotland alone, <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/revealed-2000-military-veterans-living-on-the-streets.22584946\" title=\"\">more than 2,000 veterans</a> are registered as homeless after leaving the military. Over a fifth of serving personnel <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/help-information/mental-health-a-z/A/armed-forces/\" title=\"\">report common mental disorders</a>. A staggering 13% suffer from alcoholism. Roughly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/sep/24/jailed-veteran-servicemen-outnumber-troops\" title=\"\">10% of the prison population have served in the military</a>, often jailed for violent crime. Young men leaving the armed forces have a suicide risk <a href=\"http://www.mhs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/press/medicine/servicemen/\" title=\"\">up to three times higher than the average population</a>. In 2012, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23259865\" title=\"\">more soldier and veteran deaths resulted from suicides</a> than fighting in Afghanistan. Thousands of service personnel <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/army-personnel-informed-of-redundancies\" title=\"\">have been, or are about to be, made redundant</a> because of the programme of austerity cuts.</p><p></p><p>I'd love to tell you that, despite all this, Rolfe would have done it all again, but that would be a lie, to ease our collective conscience. He was proud of serving his country – that much is true – but he also resented bitterly the way he had been treated. He used to refer to armed forces personnel as \"disposable people\".</p><p></p><p>Rolfe died in early 2012 of complications arising from cirrhosis of the liver. By the time I was informed it was too late. When I got to the hospital, the nurse was already stripping the linen off his bed. The heart and mind of this remarkable man had long been claimed by the ghosts of the past. The terrible living conditions, the drinking and poor nutrition did for him. \"Were you a friend?\" she asked in a warm central African accent. \"Yes; yes, I suppose I was,\" I muttered.</p><p></p><p>At this time of year, we pay our respects to all those who lost their lives in battle. Few think of those who lost personal wars, long after those battles have been won; those who came back missing a part of them that is invisible, but as fundamental as a limb. Today, I pay my respects to Rolfe and all those like him.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422175382|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|aa966d6cb2733b7f0d526a3a0249e80d97957ddc -->",

        "headline":"Lest we forget: remembering our cyclist soldiers",
        "body":"<p>My regular bike ride takes me past a couple of village war memorials, but to the best of my knowledge, none of the names engraved in the stone was ever a member of Britain&rsquo;s specialist cycling corps.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of &ldquo;cyclist soldiers&rdquo; signed up to serve during both world wars and other conflicts. <a href=\"http://bsamuseum.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/cycle_for_king.jpg\">Recruitment posters</a>&nbsp;in Britain on the eve of war declared: &ldquo;Are you fond of cycling? If so, why not cycle for the King? Bad teeth no bar.&rdquo;</p> <p>Other countries &ndash;&nbsp;notably Italy and Germany &ndash;&nbsp;also had dedicated cycling units. In fact, the world&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1325485.stm\">last surviving cycling regiment was disbanded by the Swiss Army</a>&nbsp;only 10 years ago.</p> <p>The origins of cycling soldiers can be traced back to the second Boer war in South Africa at the end of the 19th&nbsp;century. Historian Colin Stevens, who curates an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://oldbike.wordpress.com/page-1-meet-the-author-a-frank-admission/\">online museum dedicated to vintage and military bicycles</a>, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Remember that the messenger pigeon was one of the most advanced communication methods of the time so this was a logical step, especially as automobiles and motorcycles were still far and few between. And [bicycles] did not require the constant care and feeding that horses did.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>The cyclist soldiers weren&rsquo;t merely confined to scouting and messenger duties. Plenty of them saw frontline action. When a Boer position was attacked, &ldquo;a cyclist or two would be with the leading rank,&rdquo; according to Jim Fitzpatrick, author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thebicycleinwartime.com/\">The Bicycle In Wartime</a>. &ldquo;By the end of the war, Lord Kitchener was asking for several more&nbsp;cyclist battalions,&rdquo; says Fitzpatrick.</p> <p>And during the early weeks of the first world war, before the fighting became trench-bound in northern France, several cycling units were involved in daring raids on German ammunition wagons, according to breathless reports in the weekly&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bsamuseum.wordpress.com/military-cyclists-journal/\">&ldquo;military cyclists&rsquo; journal&rdquo;, Cycling</a>.</p> <p>As an example of what the cycling corps could achieve, Fitzpatrick quotes the case of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/WH1-Cycl-fig-WH1-CyclP007b.html\">2nd&nbsp;Anzac cyclist battalion</a>&nbsp;&ndash; comprised mainly of New Zealanders &ndash; that earned 72 medals despite suffering 59 fatalities during its 32 months fighting on the western front. It was also honoured by the town of Epernay for its role in repelling a German attack.&nbsp;</p> <p>Campaigning for more cyclist battalions to be formed in 1908,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huntscycles.co.uk/Trapman%20-%20History.htm\">Captain A. H. Trapmann tried to convince a military panel</a>&nbsp;of the merits of soldiers on bikes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The cyclist does not suffer from sore feet, nor does his mount ever get out of condition. The longer a campaign lasts the fitter the cyclist becomes. When on the move the cyclist offers a much smaller and at the same time more difficult target to hit than even the infantryman. He can ride behind hedges with body bent low and remain invisible&hellip;It may also perhaps be of interest to note that the great majority of cyclists are practically teetotallers.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p>After the first world war, Britain disbanded its specialist cycling battalions, partly because of the difficulties of riders steering and firing their rifles at the same time, and also because the bicycle had proved useless at transporting heavy loads such as machine guns. A 1932 history of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.25thlondon.com/history.htm\">London Cyclist Battalion</a>&nbsp;noted that though &ldquo;it was the ambition of every hardy cyclist to get posted to the Gun Section &hellip; only the hardiest enjoyed it.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Germans and Italians, however, commissioned extensive studies into the effectiveness of their cyclist-soldiers. As a result, German&nbsp;Radfahrtruppen&nbsp;were involved in the blitzkriegs of world war two &ndash; &ldquo;several hundred thousand, right behind the Stukas and Panzers,&rdquo; according to Fitzpatrick &ndash; while units of cyclists riding folding Bianchi bicycles with optional machine gun mounts were added to Italy&rsquo;s elite regiments of&nbsp;Bersaglieri (marksmen).</p> <p>In Britain, though, soldiers on bikes were largely limited to home defence duties, until&nbsp;<a href=\"http://oldbike.wordpress.com/1939-1945-ww2-bsa-airborne-folding-paratroopers-bike/\">BSA designed its folding &ldquo;Airborne&rdquo; bike</a>&nbsp;for paratroopers jumping from gliders. However, by the time of the D-day landings, much larger gliders &ndash; big enough to accommodate jeeps &ndash; had been produced, so instead the &ldquo;airborne&rdquo; bikes were carried by infantry soldiers arriving by sea. According to Stevens:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Going down the ramp of a landing craft carrying a rifle or Bren Gun, a heavy ruck sack, ammunition and a bicycle was very difficult and some soldiers drowned when they fell into the water and could not get rid of their load. Even once they were on shore, cyclists quickly ran into the problem of flat tires due to the broken glass, shell fragments etc. that littered the roads.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite such shortcomings, the legacy of military bikes lives on in today&rsquo;s designs. A modern, US version of the BSA Airborne, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.militarybikes.com/products.html\">Montague Paratrooper Tactical Folding Mountain Bike</a>, was used during the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. A civilian version &ndash; still in camouflage colour but minus the gun rack &ndash; is available for $725.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.foldingcyclist.com/folding-bike-history.html\">A folding bike co-designed by French Army lieutenant Henry G&eacute;rard</a>&nbsp;in 1893 became the first mass-produced bike of its type when Peugeot won the contract to supply it to the French, Russian and Romanian armies.</p> <p>And&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bsamuseum.wordpress.com/1911-bianchi-military-folding-bicycle/\">the 1912 model designed by Bianchi</a>&nbsp;for Italian troops is widely regarded as the forefather of modern mountain bikes, thanks to its slightly smaller wheels, rear suspension and front shock absorbers.</p> <p>Will there ever be a place for bikes in wars again? Fitzpatrick points to one quality the humble machine has over its rivals in an age of surgical strikes and thermal detection technology:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It gives off little or no thermal signature to belie its presence. The power source still does, however.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421793747|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|bd261fc6370739bac84765ee541f69787e7c80fb -->",

        "headline":"Remembrance day remains as relevant as ever. Just don't ask me to wear a poppy",
        "body":"<p>Just as I was about to go in front of the cameras on a BBC news show, the producer came up to me with a nervous smile. \"Are you absolutely sure you won't wear a poppy? We have some spare in the studio?\" It was the third time I had been asked in five minutes; my reply was once again in the negative.</p><p>Not that I have the slightest concern over the cause. When men and women in our armed forces are still dying in foreign fields, the annual <a href=\"http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal British Legion appeal</a> and festivals of remembrance remain as relevant as ever. Like&nbsp;millions of others I make an annual donation, while Remembrance Sunday offers an important opportunity to reflect again on the brutality and carnage of war.</p><p>But there is something wrong with enforced displays of patriotism and public grief. It has become almost a political protest not to wear a poppy these days. Look at your television screen – that potent red emblem is pinned to almost every person on display, from football commentators to political pundits. How many give much thought to the profound meaning before sticking it dutifully on their chest?</p><p>This goes to the heart of a bigger issue over the nation's relationship with its armed forces. They remain among the most respected institutions in the country, with polls showing the public retains a highly positive view at a time when support for several other pillars of British society is crumbling. No wonder our tarnished politicians and troubled red-top press eulogise the military with such fervour, constantly hailing the troops as heroes to gain some reflected glory.</p><p>It must take huge courage to go out night after night in Helmand after seeing friends killed or maimed in horrific circumstances. But, as any soldier will tell you, they are not all heroes – just ordinary people doing a difficult job in sometimes very dangerous conditions. Some display genuine heroism – but a few others do terrible things in the stress of war, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/08/royal-marine-guilty-executing-afghan\" title=\"\">as we have seen this week</a>. And not all in the military serve on the frontline, of course. Yet this word is chucked around cheaply, often by the same politicians sending young people to their deaths in dubious wars with the applause of armchair warriors in their ears.</p><p>Both main parties claimed credit for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/armed-forces-covenant-recognised-in-law-for-first-time\" title=\"\">the military covenant being passed into law</a>, although it remains baffling why decent treatment of soldiers and sailors needed to be subject to legislation rather than standard practice. And the welfare state is supposed to provide support for anyone who needs it. Now the proceeds of fines on banks are being passed to military charities, while firms and councils are being pressured to provide special help for service personnel.</p><p>Already Britain's 4.5 million veterans have been given priority access to healthcare for service-related conditions. But is this fair to the teacher beaten up by a troubled pupil in a tough area, let alone the police officer wounded on duty or the lifeboat volunteer injured in a storm? Or does it merely cover up the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1530398/The-military-hospitals-that-have-closed.html\" title=\"\">closure of military hospitals</a> by successive governments and subsequent failure to ensure decent care for mentally and physically damaged personnel, along with the inadequate state of the health service?</p><p>No one is served by saccharine sentimentality. A major study last year found even troops worried about sympathy playing too big a part in public attitudes to them, along with significant over-estimation of the physical and mental health consequences of joining the armed forces. Some feared the success of charities such as Help for Heroes caused people to feel sorry for them, while false impressions of military service impact on veterans' job prospects.</p><p>We can see clearly now the damage caused by mythologising doctors and nurses. As one senior officer told me, the military should not be put on a pedestal like the NHS because serious issues can fester below the surface of a&nbsp;deified institution. This is particularly true when the forces are being slashed in size, soldiers are dying needlessly, troops are losing morale, procurement is wasteful and our nation is unsure of its&nbsp;place in a fast-changing world.</p><p>But then it is so much easier to stick poppies in lapels and emote about heroes than to confront these issues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422013664|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|56c8cb43e46bb2413d501ccd9bf4a116abdac2a6 -->",

        "body":"<p>The empty tomb, elevated on a high pedestal, was knocked up in a matter of days as a temporary wooden structure at the suggestion of prime minister David Lloyd George for \"<a href=\"http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/cenoptaph.html#_ftn1\" title=\"\">peace day</a>\" in July 1919. Regarded with some mistrust by politicians who feared it could become a focus for discontent in troubled times, instead it was immediately successful in conveying a longed-for nobility in sacrifice, inspired by the Greek idea of a visible memorial to the invisible dead. Its architect, Edwin Lutyens, was already endowing the casualties of the western front with a kind of immortality through the <a href=\"http://www.cwgc.org/media/10446/easy_read_about_cwgc_cemeteries_and_memorials.pdf\" title=\"\">simple headstones</a> of Portland stone that he designed for the Imperial War Graves Commission. Since his death in 1944, <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v04/n01/david-cannadine/architect-as-hero\" title=\"\">his reputation</a> has bobbed about on the tides of fashion. But – however one feels about war – the Cenotaph, memorialising more than a million dead, is a model of understatement not always typical of later memorials.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422147984|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|4eb2310b2631deefc0bdacd0511af084de5e0570 -->",

        "body":"<p>Rolfe looked like the sort of person you wouldn't want to run into in a dark alley. And yet that is exactly where I ran into him. He occasionally slept in the alley next to the commercial building <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/christmas-guilt-homeless-children\" title=\"\">in which I took discreet refuge while dispossessed</a>.</p><p></p><p>Rolfe had worked out how to work the cane bolt which gave access to the alley from the outside. At a towering six feet, four inches – his size enhanced by layers of secondhand coats and threadbare blankets – the first time I ran into him, I was frightened. His face was obscured by matted hair, dirt and scrapes. After a few days, we began to silently acknowledge each other with a small nod of the head.</p><p></p><p>One February morning, I looked out the window and saw Rolfe covered with snow. I was certain he was dead. He was not, but from that point onwards, on nights when the weather was particularly cold, I would leave the door to a storage area at the back of the building slightly ajar for him. He would sneak in, rest a while and disappear by dawn. In time, we started to share what little food we had, at first silently. Later, we started to share stories.</p><p></p><p>Rolfe had been in the military all his adult life. He had served in Bosnia and twice in Iraq. The second Iraq conflict left him disillusioned and traumatised, for reasons he wouldn't share and at which I could only guess. After leaving the forces, his life collapsed. The small resettlement grant he received lasted a very short time. He spoke of booze, anger, depression and family breakup. He spoke of his inability to cope with ordinary \"civvy\" pressures. Rolfe had spent all his life in the bosom of his family, then straight into the structured care of his unit. He had never dealt with rent or bills or finding a job or the local council; he had never chosen a utility or phone service; never made a household budget, shopped or cooked for himself; never negotiated the maze the rest of us navigate daily without thinking. He could survive in the desert under enemy fire, but was lost when it came to getting a TV licence. He ended up an alcoholic, sleeping rough.</p><p></p><p>Rolfe is, sadly, far from unique. Estimates suggest that, in London, <a href=\"http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/rough-sleeping.html\" title=\"\">former armed forces personnel make up 10% of homeless individuals</a>. They are more likely than others to brave sleeping rough because of their training and less likely to seek help. In the past two years, in Scotland alone, <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/revealed-2000-military-veterans-living-on-the-streets.22584946\" title=\"\">more than 2,000 veterans</a> are registered as homeless after leaving the military. Over a fifth of serving personnel <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/help-information/mental-health-a-z/A/armed-forces/\" title=\"\">report common mental disorders</a>. A staggering 13% suffer from alcoholism. Roughly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/sep/24/jailed-veteran-servicemen-outnumber-troops\" title=\"\">10% of the prison population have served in the military</a>, often jailed for violent crime. Young men leaving the armed forces have a suicide risk <a href=\"http://www.mhs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/press/medicine/servicemen/\" title=\"\">up to three times higher than the average population</a>. In 2012, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23259865\" title=\"\">more soldier and veteran deaths resulted from suicides</a> than fighting in Afghanistan. Thousands of service personnel <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/army-personnel-informed-of-redundancies\" title=\"\">have been, or are about to be, made redundant</a> because of the programme of austerity cuts.</p><p></p><p>I'd love to tell you that, despite all this, Rolfe would have done it all again, but that would be a lie, to ease our collective conscience. He was proud of serving his country – that much is true – but he also resented bitterly the way he had been treated. He used to refer to armed forces personnel as \"disposable people\".</p><p></p><p>Rolfe died in early 2012 of complications arising from cirrhosis of the liver. By the time I was informed it was too late. When I got to the hospital, the nurse was already stripping the linen off his bed. The heart and mind of this remarkable man had long been claimed by the ghosts of the past. The terrible living conditions, the drinking and poor nutrition did for him. \"Were you a friend?\" she asked in a warm central African accent. \"Yes; yes, I suppose I was,\" I muttered.</p><p></p><p>At this time of year, we pay our respects to all those who lost their lives in battle. Few think of those who lost personal wars, long after those battles have been won; those who came back missing a part of them that is invisible, but as fundamental as a limb. Today, I pay my respects to Rolfe and all those like him.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422175382|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|aa966d6cb2733b7f0d526a3a0249e80d97957ddc -->",

        "headline":"This year, I will wear a poppy for the last time",
        "body":"<p>Over the last 10 years the sepia tone of November has become blood-soaked with paper poppies festooning the lapels of our politicians, newsreaders and business leaders. The most fortunate in our society have turned the solemnity of remembrance for fallen soldiers in ancient wars into a justification for our most recent armed conflicts. The American civil war's General Sherman once said that \"<a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman\" title=\"\">war is hell</a>\", but unfortunately today's politicians in Britain use past wars to bolster our flagging belief in national austerity or to compel us to surrender our rights as citizens, in the name of the public good.</p><p></p><p>Still, this year I shall wear the poppy as I have done for many years. I wear it because I am from that last generation who remember a war that encompassed the entire world. I wear the poppy because I can recall when Britain was actually threatened with a real invasion and how its citizens stood at the ready to defend her shores. But most importantly, I wear the poppy to commemorate those of my childhood friends and comrades who did not survive the second world war and those who came home physically and emotionally wounded from horrific battles that no poet or journalist could describe.</p><p></p><p>However, I am afraid it will be the last time that I will bear witness to those soldiers, airmen and sailors who are no more, at my local cenotaph. From now on, I will lament their passing in private because my despair is for those who live in this present world. I will no longer allow my obligation as a veteran to remember those who died in the great wars to be co-opted by current or former politicians to justify our folly in Iraq, our morally dubious war on terror and our elimination of one's right to privacy.</p><p></p><p>Come 2014 when the government marks the beginning of the first world war with quotes from Rupert Brooke, Rudyard Kipling and other great jingoists from our past empire, I will declare myself a conscientious objector. We must remember that the historical past of this country is not like an episode of Downton Abbey where the rich are portrayed as thoughtful, benevolent masters to poor folk who need the guiding hand of the ruling classes to live a proper life.</p><p></p><p>I can tell you it didn't happen that way because I was born nine years after the first world war began. I can attest that life for most people was spent in abject poverty where one laboured under brutal working conditions for little pay and lived in houses not fit to kennel a dog today. We must remember that the war was fought by the working classes who comprised 80% of Britain's population in 1913.</p><p></p><p>This is why I find that the government's intention to spend £50m to dress the slaughter of close to a million British soldiers in the 1914-18 conflict as a fight for freedom and democracy profane. Too many of the dead, from that horrendous war, didn't know real freedom because they were poor and were never truly represented by their members of parliament.</p><p></p><p>My uncle and many of my relatives died in that war and they weren't officers or NCOs; they were simple Tommies. They were like the hundreds of thousands of other boys who were sent to their slaughter by a government that didn't care to represent their citizens if they were working poor and under-educated. My family members took the king's shilling because they had little choice, whereas many others from similar economic backgrounds were strong-armed into enlisting by war propaganda or press-ganged into military service by their employers.</p><p></p><p>For many of you 1914 probably seems like a long time ago but I'll be 91 next year, so it feels recent. Today, we have allowed monolithic corporate institutions to set our national agenda. We have allowed vitriol to replace earnest debate and we have somehow deluded ourselves into thinking that wealth is wisdom. But by far the worst error we have made as a people is to think ourselves as taxpayers first and citizens second.</p><p>Next year, I won't wear the poppy but I will until my last breath remember the past and the struggles my generation made to build this country into a civilised state for the working and middle classes. If we are to survive as a progressive nation we have to start tending to our living because the wounded: our poor, our underemployed youth, our hard-pressed middle class and our struggling seniors shouldn't be left to die on the battleground of modern life.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421949694|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|ef1c456356a39c0087ece14b2adbbaa440a98531 -->",

The hospital ship Rohilla, which was carrying medical staff to Dunkirk to pick up casualties, had hit Whitby Rock, 600m offshore. Survivors included Mary Roberts, a nurse who had been on the Titanic's last&nbsp;voyage.</p><p>\"The gale was terrible and after the ship had struck the submerged rocks all went into darkness. Only those who experienced it can realise the horror of it all,\" Sarah Waterworth, wife of Anthony, an ambulanceman, later wrote.</p><p>\"[Anthony] had turned in fully clothed and before he could get out of the cabin he was waist-deep in water. He was lifted bodily up a flight of stairs by the gale and landed in [sic] the deck there to cling for hours. Eventually the lifeboat was carried over land a long way and put down to the sea and after many setbacks reached the vessel and brought a load of men to safety … amongst them … Anthony.</p><p>\"The people of Whitby were really wonderful, every few steps the rescued men had to have a drink of something, coffee, brandy, tea etc … and blankets were brought to the shore and the men wrapped into them.\"</p><p>The Whitby coxswain Thomas Langlands, on the rowing boat lifeboat first to the wreck, was among three people awarded the RNLI's gold medal for gallantry, its equivalent of the Victoria Cross. Four silver medals, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Gallantry_Medal\" title=\"\">Empire Gallantry Medal</a> and the bronze medal of the RSPCA (the Rohilla's captain saved the ship's cat) were also awarded.</p><p>Elsewhere, Quakers plan an online project in which blogged accounts of four real young people living 100 years ago will run alongside those of a fictional present-day writer in the White Feather Diaries, a title reflecting the symbol of cowardice handed to those not volunteering to fight.</p><p>It will discuss too the effects of the 1916 Military Service Act, which introduced conscription but also, for the first time, enshrined the right to be a conscientious objector because of one's faith.</p><p>With documents, letters, diary entries and photographs from the period, Twitter and other social media will be used to compare historic attitudes with those towards current conflicts.</p><p>\"We want people to understand choosing to be a pacifist is never easy in&nbsp;a culture of war. It is always a brave and difficult decision,\" said Jane Dawson, of Quakers in Britain. \"Some people suffered, some were imprisoned and died there.\"</p><p>Though tribunals hearing the cases of those wishing to be recognised as conscientious objectors were \"not necessarily as fair as they could be … we as British people should be incredibly proud [of establishing the right]. This is a fascinating part of our record as a&nbsp;liberal-minded country.\"</p><p>Some Quakers did fight and others served in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends'_Ambulance_Unit\" title=\"\">Friends Ambulance Unit</a>, Dawson pointed out. \"They lived in appalling conditions with no equipment and in the mud like everyone else. Everyone was ill-prepared.\"</p><p>The war artists' exhibition coincides with the London IWM's full reopening in July following a £40m revamp, but in February it launches Lives of the First World War, a digital memorial to more than 8 million people from across the Commonwealth.</p><p>\"The first world war centenary really matters to a huge amount of people,\" said Diana Lees, director-general of the IWM. \"It may be because of a personal connection, the effect the war had on their home town, how it changed our wider society or because of their beliefs about war and the importance of&nbsp;peace.\"</p><p>Tate Modern and the National Portrait Gallery in London, IWM North in Manchester, the National Museum, Cardiff, the Thackray Medical Museum, Leeds and the Bradford Peace Museum are among others planning first world war‑related projects.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421572585|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|8391dfdcfe37dc15ef07f4d55c6b5414476e668e -->",

        "body":"<p>It all begins so cheerfully, in gorgeous weather, with the troops itching to join the great adventure abroad. As the 2nd Battalion of the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry sets sail from Dublin for Le Havre on an old cargo ship, the SS Buteshire, on 14 August 1914, a chorus of hoots and sirens fills the riverside air as a large crowd sends them noisily on their way. It feels, in the words of a young medical officer on board, \"like the realisation of the dream of every soldier\". When they head out into the open sea and are sailing towards Land's End, a message is read out to all those on deck from King George V. \"You are leaving home to fight for the safety and honour of my Empire,\" he tells them. \"I pray God to bless you and guard you and bring you back victorious.\"</p><p>Just two and a half months later the same 26-year-old doctor, who kept a daily diary, beautifully written in pencil in his standard-issue Army Book 129, is holed up in a farm in northeastern France which he has chosen as his aid post, just outside a tiny village called Richebourg-l'Avoué. The battalion is already severely depleted. The retreat from Mons in August and early September and the subsequent \"race to the sea\" have taken a terrible toll. But what is unfolding now is even worse than what went before.</p><p>\"Hell would be a tame word to describe what we went through,\" he writes of five dreadful days in October. On the 27th, German shells are raining down around the farm, just 100 yards behind the British fire trench, and he is struggling to cope with the wounded as they flood in. In the garden behind, British and German dead are laid out waiting to be buried as soon as the shelling dies down in the evening. \"Many fell in our frontline trenches, causing awful casualties. Men were buried alive whilst others were just dug out in time and brought to, unable to stand, with their backs half broken. My cellar was soon packed, but I could not put any wounded upstairs as any minute I expected the place to be blown up.\" His work, dressing the injured, is so relentless and intense that at times it takes his mind off the horrors unfolding outside. But when he does pause to listen, the noise almost shatters his nerves. \"Unimaginable\" is how he describes his feeling at such moments. \"There is nothing I know of more trying to the nerves than to sit listening to shells and wondering how long there is before one comes and finds your hiding place.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421641889'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383145918451/Cyril-Helm-008.jpg' alt='Cyril Helm' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>After the war: Cyril Helm, doctor, diarist and survivor of the First World War.</figcaption></figure><p>The farm survives the German fire of 27&nbsp;October, but the next day at noon it starts up again. Somehow that morning he finds time to write a letter home to his parents. He thanks them for a Thermos flask they sent through the military post and says how sorry he is not to have written for a few days. The reason, he tells them, is because of the \"rather trying situation\" the battalion has found itself in. His private diary records the much darker reality. The 28th, he writes, \"really was a&nbsp;sort of nightmare\". \"The crumps were coming just over, and then short, until 12 o'clock when there was a blinding flash and a roar. The next thing I knew was that I&nbsp;was leaning up against a wall in pitch darkness with the air full of dust and acrid fumes.\"</p><p>A shell had burst by the cellar where he was working. \"After some time we heard tapping and eventually saw light through one of the windows… What a relief it was to see the light, but what a ghastly picture was revealed. Six lay dead about the cellar and many wounded. One poor RAMC orderly who had been standing next to me when the shell burst was lying dead with his chest smashed in by a&nbsp;huge fragment of shell.\"</p><p>The next day saw less shelling, but for the young doctor it was no less painful. By this time, 11 weeks into their war, he and the quartermaster, who worked well behind the front line, were the only two officers remaining of the 27 who had set sail from Dublin in August: 300 men had died in the previous nine days.</p><p>\"It had been appalling seeing one's friends picked off one after the other,\" he writes, \"and I can only marvel now that I&nbsp;survived. At times, when I&nbsp;realised all those, my pals, had gone, I nearly went off my head.\"</p><p>I had known since 1998, when I began to make inquiries ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of the First World War, that Cyril Helm, my grandfather, had kept a diary. I was sent a copy that I think had been typed up in the 1960s by a relative in the autumn of that year. But what I had never seen until a few weeks ago were the pencil notes on which it was based almost word for word, the actual daily entries that my grandfather somehow found the time and the strength to write from his hideouts near the front amid the hell of war in the last four months of 1914 and early 1915.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421641890'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383338272901/Postcard-001.jpg' alt='Postcard' width='460' height='300' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Postcard from the edge: Cyril lets his family know he is still alive.</figcaption></figure><p>My father, himself a doctor who served in Normandy in 1944, had rarely talked of his own father's First World War record, but I&nbsp;remembered him referring once or twice to some notes and \"pieces of paper\" which he thought must still be somewhere, that formed the basis of the diary.</p><p>With next year's 100th anniversary of the start of the war approaching, my interest was rekindled and I asked other members of the family to search over the summer. At first we had no luck. We assumed they had been lost as the family had divided, and spread far and wide. But then in July came an email with \"great news\". One of his two sons by his second marriage, a doctor and professor at the Saint Louis University Hospital, Missouri, had found the two Army Book 129s at the bottom of his father's old trunk as he was packing up in preparation to return to the UK after many years abroad.</p><p>A few weeks later, after he arrived back, I&nbsp;saw it for myself: 99 years on it was in almost perfect condition, a prime, contemporaneous pencil account, page after page in his own eccentric handwriting. Almost nothing could beat such a discovery, I thought, as I turned its pages for the first time.</p><p>One incident from his typed-up manuscript had always stuck in my mind, about a&nbsp;young soldier, and I wanted to find it. There it was, on 27 October, the same description in full. \"A&nbsp;most pathetic thing happened that afternoon. A young gunner subaltern was on his way up to observe a machine-gun position. Just as he got outside my door a shrapnel shell burst full in front of him. The poor fellow was brought in to me absolutely riddled. He lay in my arms until he died, shrieking in his agony and said he hoped I would excuse him for making such a noise as he really could not help it. Pitiful as nothing could be done for him except an injection of morphia. I&nbsp;always will remember that incident, particularly as he was such a fine- looking boy, certainly not more than 19.\"</p><p>The books were not all I found. I was also sent, over the summer, a cache of my grandfather's letters that he had sent home to his parents, mostly in 1914 and 1915, and in which he often addressed them as \"My Dearest People\".</p><p>In these, he shielded his family from the worst, though time after time he wrote emotionally of his longing to come home. There were also adoring birthday greetings to his daughter, his first child, on her first and second birthdays in 1917 and 1918, with little drawings of \"naughty Germans\" dropping bombs and \"Daddy's house\" where he was dodging shells at the time. And more: a&nbsp;batch of finely illustrated programmes of swimming and other sports events he had arranged for troops behind the front line in the quieter times; an unopened packet of tobacco and another of cigarettes, a gift to all troops at Christmas 1914 from Princess Mary, the daughter of George V and Queen Mary, with a card wishing them \"A&nbsp;Happy Christmas and a victorious New Year\"; and photographs of the desolate scenes in and around Ypres and Passchendaele, where Cyril Helm would serve later in the war.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421641891'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383338064953/A-Christmas-gift-of-cigar-007.jpg' alt='A Christmas gift of cigarettes from Princess Mary' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A Christmas gift of cigarettes from Princess Mary. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>With this treasure trove in my possession, for so long scattered among relatives and stashed away in drawers and trunks, I contacted the <a href=\"http://www.iwm.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Imperial War Museum</a>, wanting it all to have a wider audience. They told me that they too were working on a similar idea for the 100th anniversary of the First World War, but on a&nbsp;massive 21st-century, and global, scale. It is to be called <a href=\"http://www.livesofthefirstworldwar.org/\" title=\"\">Lives of the First World War</a>, and will be launched in February next year.</p><p>It aims to draw millions of hitherto privately held diaries, letters, photographs and other material out of people's bottom drawers, attics and cupboards and to put them on to the internet over the course of the next four years. It is a huge enterprise that will benefit from the passage of time. In many cases survivors of the war did not discuss their experiences much afterwards. Some could not bring themselves to, or did not think their families would want to know, or understand. Information was often hidden away at home, or in the recesses of their minds.</p><p>In her Booker Prize-winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/29/pat-barker-book-club\" title=\"\"><em>Regeneration </em>trilogy, Pat Barker</a> explored the way many survivors repressed their worst memories on their return from the front and would not confront or discuss them, often with appalling psychological results. Their experiences sometimes only resurfaced in nightmares.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421641892'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383338498488/birthday-letter-for-Helm--008.jpg' alt='birthday letter for Helm’s daughter' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>‘Naughty Germans’: a birthday letter for Helm’s daughter.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, after 100 years, the IWM is aiming to unearth those hidden histories and assemble up to 8m individual stories from those who served in different capacities, and in all parts of the world, helping their relatives to get in touch with each other and with the families of contemporaries who served alongside them. Established in 1917 with an appeal for any information and records about those who were lost and who had survived, the museum is returning to its founding purpose, but rebooting the enterprise for the internet age.</p><p>Many of the stories that will emerge, and be available at the press of a button, have tragic endings. Some 16 million people died in the First World War and another 20 million were wounded. In other cases families will discover more details about relatives, but their searches will ultimately settle nothing for them. The precise fates of many of the tens of thousands who lie anonymously in the cemeteries of northern France and Belgium under headstones bearing the words \"A Soldier of the Great War, Known Unto God\" will remain that way – unknown to their descendants. There will however be plenty of tales, like that of Cyril Helm, that tell of miraculous escape and survival.</p><p>The first two weeks of his war were a&nbsp;microcosm of all that would follow. After landing in France, his battalion headed southeast until it confronted the Germans near the Belgian town of Mons. Before crossing into Belgium, life still seemed good for his contingent of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). At times he makes it sound like nothing more arduous than a trekking holiday in the August sun as local French people cheered them on and spoilt them with food along the way.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421641893'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383338911682/Cyril-Helm-008.jpg' alt='Cyril Helm' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The King’s men: Helm (right) and friends make the most of a quiet moment</figcaption></figure><p>On 19 and 20 August \"the men were given a splendid time in the farms in which they were billeted. People gave them as much butter and milk as they wanted, also fruit and eggs. In fact too much as I as Medical Officer found out to my cost.\"</p><p>On 23 August, however, on reaching Mons, they came face to face with the Germans, and the medical duties changed from tending upset stomachs to saving lives and horribly damaged limbs. Shrapnel shells burst over their billets for the first time and many were wounded and killed. The generals decided they should retreat and a long march ensued towards the French town of Le Cateau.</p><p>Although it was a hard slog there were many compensations. \"The country in this region was beautiful, miles and miles of rolling hills covered with ripe corn. The wild flowers were gorgeous and all the vegetation most luxurious. By this time we were as brown as berries.\" But on 26 August the Germans caught up with them at Le Cateau and they got a foretaste of things to come.</p><p>Helm became separated from the battalion as he treated the wounded, and was shocked when he came across what was left of it later in the day. \"I found the remains of my battalion in a corner of a field and was horrified to find that we mustered seven officers and about 150 men. Roughly speaking 18 officers and 700 of our men were killed wounded or missing on that day.\" They had been in  mainland Europe for just 11 days.</p><p>Over the next few weeks there are short idyllic interludes as they head north. He enjoys picking the ripe fruit from the sides of the roads and the men steal into local gardens to get more. The officers take occasional refuge in French châteaux. But most days see skirmishes and brushes with death.</p><p>On 15 September they end up by the river Aisne, horribly exposed to the Germans on the other side. The men are told to lie on their stomachs in a single line next to a row of trees. \"We knew we had been seen by the German observers and almost immediately four high explosive 5.9 [inches in diameter] shells burst together, exactly over our heads. They were beautifully timed and only a few yards above us. The scene after that was appalling. A great many men had been killed.\"</p><p>Helm describes in his army book the \"groans of the wounded\" as being \"too nerve-racking for words\" and admits he felt \"like running away\", but could not as he had to \"set an example to the men.\" \"My thoughts were indescribable as I realised that lying on my belly the next shell might blow me to smithereens.\" Next to him, an orderly corporal was \"frightfully shattered, one of his legs being completely blown away. Of course his death was instantaneous!\"</p><p>Officer morale was restored a little, some days later, at the French village of Guiscard when the mayor entertained the valiant few still standing in his chateau. \"The Mayor was a charming man,\" my grandfather wrote on 1&nbsp;October. \"When we arrived he prepared a&nbsp;very recherche dinner with champagne.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421641894'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383339324905/A-picture-kept-by-Helm-fr-008.jpg' alt='A picture kept by Helm from the frontline' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A picture kept by Helm from the frontline.</figcaption></figure><p>Another letter was written home on 15&nbsp;October. He was homesick and frustrated but full of praise for the troops. \"The war is expected to last until the spring. The prospect is too awful as we are all heartily sick of it and have no nerves left – but our soldiers are really wonderful the way they fight.\" In mid-November, two weeks after surviving the German pounding near Richebourg-l'Avoué, Cyril Helm was told he was to be given a rest from the regiment and would switch to No 15 Field Ambulance. \"I was not sorry at all as all my friends were gone,\" he writes, \"and the few officers remaining were comparative strangers to me. If any of my old friends had been there I would have applied to stay, hating the thought of leaving them.\"</p><p>Life behind the front line was calmer for periods, but sometimes \"strenuous to an extreme\". The first battle of Ypres was under way and as transport officer he had 70 horses to look after. Stationed two miles behind the front line his job was to take the horse-drawn ambulances out at 9pm before leaving them not far from the trenches. Stretcher bearers would then trudge back and forth through the muddy fields to the regimental aid posts and bring the wounded back from there. \"It was very cold-blooded work as bullets were whistling round the whole time… The bearers had an awful time getting the lying cases back across the sodden country, the worst part being the negotiation of ditches full of water.\" On one occasion a bullet landed between his legs and he wished it had struck his foot so he could have taken some desperately needed leave.</p><p>On Christmas Day 1914 he sat down and wrote again to his parents, and his wife. \"Just a line to wish you all a Happy New Year and to thank you for all the presents you have given me,\" he began. But he ended on a note that betrayed how hard he was finding it to be apart. \"It seems awfully unnatural to be spending Xmas away from home and makes me feel more homesick than ever. Your loving boy, Cyril.\"</p><p>Two days later he wrote home again relating details of the now famous festive cessation of hostilities on Christmas Day. \"The Germans and our men met between the trenches and gave each other cigars and cigarettes. They then sang hymns together and were very jolly. The officers did the same and some of ours lunched in their trenches… A lot of the Germans spoke English and said they were heartily sick of the war. They said they hated the Kaiser and long live good old King George.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421641895'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383338690172/Cyril-Helm-001.jpg' alt='Cyril Helm' width='460' height='370' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'A rather trying situation': one of the photographs Cyril Helm kept. </figcaption></figure><p>On 1 January 1915 he was awarded the Military Cross. In 1917 he would also receive the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). From early 1915, however, the entries in his diary become far fewer. On Easter day 1915 he went up to Ypres where he stayed in the remains of a convent until the shelling became so bad that all troops and local people had to leave. Much of the town had already been pummelled by German shells, but a good many civilians had insisted on remaining. \"It was an absurd sight to see pretty girls dressed in the latest fashions looking into hat shops which consisted of one storey only, all the rest having been blown away.\"</p><p>In late April, shortly after the Germans launched gas attacks on the allied lines north of Ypres, my grandfather was evacuated sick to England. For some reason his diary ends there. The notes in his army book stop, too, though his letters continue. On 18 February 1917 he wrote to his one-year-old daughter to wish her a happy birthday. \"My Darling Little Sheila,\" he says, \"Poor Daddy wishes he could be with you, but owing to a&nbsp;nasty thing called war he cannot manage it. Be a good little girl and love your Mummy. With lots and lots of love and kisses, from Daddy.\"</p><p>In a postscript added to his diary years later he accounts for the rest of his war, from early 1915 on, in a couple of paragraphs. He says that after two months at home in spring and early summer that year he returned to the front to take command of No 15 Motor Ambulance Convoy. Later he was put in charge of advanced dressing stations in the Inverness Copse and Passchendaele sectors and eventually took part in the final attacks that ended the war in 1918.</p><p>He would serve again in the Second World War, first in West Africa; and then a&nbsp;week after D Day he commanded the first 600-bed mobile hospital to be established in occupied Europe at Bayeux, Normandy. He was appointed an OBE in 1945, and after the war returned to work as a&nbsp;general practitioner. He died in 1972 aged 83.</p><p>I have no idea why he stopped writing his diaries so early in the war. Perhaps he couldn't bear to carry on, or he thought he had said all there was to say about one man's survival during those first few dreadful months. Whatever the reason, I&nbsp;would love to find out more. Perhaps with the centenary approaching and the internet at our disposal, the families of soldiers and officers who served with him will get in touch, with private accounts from their attics and trunks, and together we can all build a fuller picture of what they all went through 100 years ago.</p><h2>Sharing your wartime stories<br /></h2><p><strong>Like the Imperial War Museum, we would love to see your letters, stories and photographs of any relatives or friends who were involved in the First World War.

        "body":"<p>They are considered some of Stanley Spencer's finest works – a poignant, visionary memorial to the forgotten dead of the first world war – but they are not as widely known as many believe they should be.</p><p>Now, because of restoration work at the National Trust-owned chapel where they are always displayed, the paintings are going on a tour which will bring them to new eyes.</p><p>On Thursday visitors to <a href=\"http://www.somersethouse.org.uk\" title=\"\">Somerset House in London</a> will be able to see the large canvas panels that Spencer painted based on his memories of his war service, first as a hospital orderly in Bristol and then as a soldier on the Salonika front in Macedonia.</p><p>\"This is really like seeing them for the first time,\" said David Taylor, the National Trust's curator of pictures, who is used to visiting them in their usual home. \"It is thrilling. We've been hanging [paintings] for two days and each time I go in there, it's like it's a second version I didn't know about. They are the same canvases but different – you can spot things you hadn't spotted before and the colours are different.\"</p><p>The historian Simon Schama has called the Spencer murals \"the most powerful art to emerge from the carnage of the Great War\". Others have called the series Britain's answer to the Sistine Chapel.</p><p>Spencer himself would have preferred comparison to Giotto's Arena chapel in Padua, while for Taylor \"there is a more Rothko-esque experience when you sit in the chapel and look at the paintings, and certainly after 10 minutes you are overcome by a sense of poignancy.\"</p><p>The panels are very British. The ones depicting life in the military hospital show the washing of lockers, the sorting of laundry, the making of jam sandwiches. Spencer called them \"a symphony of rashers of bacon\" with \"tea-making obligato\" and said they depict a banality of life which was, for those sent there from the battlefield, a \"heaven in a hell of war\".</p><p>Spencer witnessed previously unimagined horrors and acts of brutality – both in the hospital where he worked and at Salonika. But there is no blood or gore or atrocities in his paintings.</p><p>\"He would have seen horrific things and he didn't depict them,\" said Taylor. \"Maybe that is part of his coming to terms with it, maybe that's how he survived the war.\"</p><p>The paintings, created from 1927-1932, are widely considered Spencer's finest achievement. They hang in the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sandham-memorial-chapel/\" title=\"\">Sandham Memorial Chapel in Burghclere, Hampshire</a>, that was built by his patrons John Louis and Mary Behrend. Amanda Bradley, assistant curator of pictures at the Trust, said the chapel \"is one of the greatest glories of art in northern Europe. It is Stanley Spencer's masterpiece and is arguably one of the greatest modern British artistic schemes ever conceived.\"</p><p>Sixteen canvases have travelled to London, while Spencer's altarpiece – Resurrection of the Soldiers – which is fixed in place, is shown as a projection. The display, at Somerset House until 26 January, is part of the many activities leading up to next year's 100th commemoration of the outbreak of the first world war. They will later travel to the <a href=\"http://www.pallant.org.uk\" title=\"\">Pallant House Gallery</a>, Chichester, and be on show from 15 February to June 2014. The chapel reopens in July.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421835900|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|839c3e319c5296c89db4d1955d9e7231c72637d3 -->",

        "body":"<p>A secular campaigner has called for the Church of England to abandon its role in the annual Remembrance ceremony at the Cenotaph in London, claiming it no longer represents the views and beliefs of the majority of Britons.</p><p>Norman Bonney, emeritus professor of sociology at Edinburgh Napier University and a director of the National Secular Society, argues that the Cenotaph was deliberately conceived as a non-religious memorial and should be treated as such.</p><p>The Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Whitehall monument is usually led by the bishop of London, who offers prayers for all those who have died in the service of their country.</p><p>In his paper, The Cenotaph: a contested and consensual symbol of remembrance, Bonney argues that the monument's designer, Edwin Lutyens, did not want it to have religious significance as he recognised that many of those killed fighting for the British empire in the first world war were not Christian but Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh.</p><p>He  points out that David Lloyd George's cabinet rejected the Church of England's requests for the Cenotaph to include a cross and to bear Christian inscriptions. It is marked only with the words \"The Glorious Dead\" and dates commemorating both world wars, 1914-1918, and 1939-1945.</p><p>Yet despite the monument's explicitly secular nature, argues Bonney, the remembrance ceremony retains strong Christian aspects that demonstrate \"the continuing ritual dominance of that religion – in its Church of England form – in the public life of the UK state and its annual ceremony of remembrance of the dead of war\".</p><p>The church cannot claim to speak for everybody in 21st-century Britain, he argues. \"Changes in religious belief, emphasised in recent census findings, demonstrate that Christianity in general, and the Church of England in particular, can no longer be fully inclusive of the whole community, particularly when over a quarter of the population have no religion,\" he writes.</p><p>Bonney would rather see the event stripped of all its religious aspects and replaced with \"a secular ceremony with which all can identify\".</p><p>According to the Ministry of Defence, there are 265 Christian chaplains serving the armed forces, including 49 army reservists. Sixteen Anglican chaplains are understood to be spending Remembrance Sunday on active service in Helmand, Afghanistan.</p><p>The Church of England dismissed Bonney's suggestions, saying the religious ceremony served a valuable purpose.</p><p>\"The Remembrance Sunday Service at the Cenotaph has always contained prayers and readings from scripture, and the fact that it continues to be so central a part of our public life would suggest that it is meeting people's pastoral needs,\" said the Venerable Peter Eagles, archdeacon for the army.</p><p>The church's director of communications was more forthright, accusing the National Secular Society of a \"rather sad\" attempt at seeking publicity.</p><p>\"As the nation prepares to collectively remember the sacrifice of those who laid down their lives, it is both misjudged and misguided for the National Secular Society to attempt to politicise Remembrance Sunday for their own ends,\" said Arun Arora.</p><p>\"As millions of people prepare to gather at churches and war memorials for remembrance services led by clergy this Sunday, they will be accompanied by those on active service who will join services led by chaplains in the field. To see the National Secular Society – and its barely 10,000 members – hijack this time of solemn remembrance is rather sad.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422106279|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|64686dcfc17189d8d2ac578d7551d4de5d4bdaf5 -->",

        "headline":"Remembrance: Finding our lost boys",
        "body":"<p>In the autumn of 1913, a handsome boy of 15 had just left school in London and gone to boarding school in Heidelberg to improve his German. His father was German and he had a large extended German Jewish family. Jack's exuberant letters home tell of his escapades: toboganning, skating and practical jokes on the teachers.</p><p>Within two years, the outbreak of war had transformed this schoolboy into a young officer (he lied about his age to enlist) and a few weeks after he arrived in France he was dead, killed in the battle of the Somme. His German cousin was killed in the same battle, fighting on the other side. Two years later, his clever older brother, Norman, was also dead. Their little sister Nancy, my grandmother, was devastated along with the rest of her family.</p><p>These are the kinds of stories that thousands of families have buried in their history and as the centenary of the first world war arrives next year, there will be four years of public commemorations. But it's the personal significance, the emotional weight of this all too common tragedy that has drawn me into a compelling journey over the last two years. Each family can tell its own story of how it has carried that grief over the last century and how it has shaped characters and relationships in succeeding generations. Many of those stories are lost and hard to piece together. But completely unexpected for me was the power of the story of these two young men and their bereaved family, and how it resonated with me – making more sense of my grandmother, but also of myself.</p><p>It began with reading a shoebox of letters from Norman and Jack, which my grandmother had kept for more than 80 years. There were more than 150, some on smart, headed paper, some on notebook pages, written with stubs of pencil. They start with Jack's schoolboy pranks in Heidelberg in late 1913 and end with Norman's last letter in March 1918, asking for a copy of Shelley and assuring his anxious mother that his posting in the trenches \"has become almost a fairy bower and is approached by rustic arches and surrounded by flower beds\".</p><p>What sprung off the pages were two vivid and distinct characters. Jack is the impatient and quick-witted one, poking fun at his dull German cousins but enjoying the cakes they sent. He revels in the idiosyncrasies of his teachers, baiting them to the delight of his classmates. He is deeply affectionate to his parents, assuring them that he kisses their photograph at night \"even if there are people watching\" and including messages to his two younger sisters. As he embarks on army training, his eager bravado is palpable and he opts to join the machine gun corps – \"They call it the suicide club,\" he writes airily.</p><p>At last, in January 1916, the waiting is over and Jack is leaving his training camp \"for an unknown destination\"; he has been put in charge of four machine guns, yet is short of his 18th birthday. He issues instructions home for new boots, a waterproof sheet, a lamp, field glasses and a camera. The constant requests from the two brothers for supplies – cakes, butter, razors, soap, blankets, mouth organs and books – must have entailed dozens of shopping trips and hundreds of parcels over the four years of war.</p><p>In 1916, Jack wrote to Norman, then in Gallipoli: \"Tonight I am going up [to the front] to stay for some time and tomorrow we are going to end the war, at least we think so, and my division is in the firing line. At present it is rather rotten up in the trenches because they keep on retaliating against our bombardment with beastly heavy stuff. Our trench mortars are wonderful things. I don't know if you had any of the football variety in Gallipoli but you should see the mess they make of the Hun's wire, it simply rolls it up and lays it aside.\" He died the following day. His sergeant wrote to his parents to praise Jack's remarkable courage.</p><p>Norman's letters, by contrast, are long and descriptive as he writes of his experiences in three theatres of war – Gallipoli, Egypt and France – between 1915 and 1918. He gives vivid accounts of the utter chaos of <a href=\"http://www.gallipoli-association.org\" title=\"Gallipoli\">Gallipoli</a> where he shelters under flimsy awnings in shallow holes in the ground, exhausted and starving. In Egypt he is restless, bored by the remote posting and agitated that he might never experience the glory of battle. Finally, he is in Flanders and recounts horrific battles where he struggles with the mud, rats and deafening roar of the guns. On one occasion, he is stranded in no man's land for days and watches the wounded groaning where they lie. Interspersed with accounts of the trenches are affectionate notes to his younger sisters and his nanny, with cartoon drawings, jokes and promises of presents. Threaded through the letters is a constant attempt to care emotionally for his family at home, with reassurances and anecdotes.</p><p>During quieter periods, Norman talks of the books and magazines he is reading and the essays he is trying to write; he writes of poetry, music, politics, art, philosophy, religion and ideas. Gradually disillusionment sets in; in 1916 he talked of Jack's noble death but within 18 months he has become bitterly angry at Beaverbrook's warmongering Times and lambasts the incompetence of the generals and the politicians. By 1918, he is calling for a revolution in England such as Russia has just experienced. Towards his own life, he develops a chilling fatalism and requests that on his gravestone they engrave: <a href=\"http://quotes.dictionary.com/tis_all_a_chequerboard_of_nights_and_days\" title=\"Tis all a chequer-board of nights and days/Where destiny with men for pieces plays.\">\"Tis all a chequer-board of nights and days/Where destiny with men for pieces plays.\"</a></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422001598'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/8/1383909885718/Nancy-Konstam-001.jpg' alt='Nancy Konstam' width='220' height='372' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Frozen with sadness … Nancy Konstam. </figcaption></figure><p></p><p>There is a photograph of my grandmother as a teenager in the aftermath of her brothers' death; she seems frozen with a deep, unspeakable sadness. She grew up to be a charismatic but brittle woman; she was a tyrannical mother and only softened as a grandmother in late old age.</p><p>But alongside this emotional legacy of tragedy was another, more concrete, commemoration. My great-grandparents decided after the first world war to fund a health clinic for children in the then dire slum of Highgate New Town, in north London, in memory of their sons. It would be for minor operations, convalescence and general outpatient services. It was in operation for 40 years until it was handed over to Camden council in 1967; now the Konstam Family Centre, it has been a nursery ever since.</p><p>A year ago, my mother and I went to visit the clinic into which her grandparents had poured their grief. It's a large, handsome building and in the hallway a bronze plaque commemorates the lives of Norman and Jack; the staff had put poppies in the small vase. Old photos were produced, showing the two wards named after Norman and Jack; framed photos of them stood on small tables in the centre of the ward with a vase of flowers – a form of secular shrine.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422001599'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/8/1383910115245/Konstam-clinic-exterior-001.jpg' alt='Konstam clinic exterior' width='476' height='372' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Konstam clinic, set up by Norman and Jack's parents in their memory, opened 1924.</figcaption></figure><p>I detected the hands of both my great-grandparents. Photos of the boiler room, operating theatre and sluice room spoke of my great-grandfather's practicality and attention to detail; the beautiful Indian flowered bedspreads and carved wooden furniture spoke of my great-grandmother's flamboyant taste. She was a dedicated volunteer at the clinic until her death in the 1950s.</p><p>But the main revelation was the visitor's book. After the clinic opened in 1924, page after page lists the paediatricians, public health officials and politicians who came from all over the world – Siam, Russia, China, Latin America, the US and Europe. Until the outbreak of the second world war, the clinic was a pioneering model of child healthcare. It was riding a wave of new understanding about the importance of public preventive health, in particular for children whose lives could be unnecessarily blighted by poor health care. It was projects like this clinic that paved the way for the postwar NHS.</p><p>I've tracked the story through old ledgers of council minutes and given talks to local history societies where former pupils of the Konstam nursery expressed appreciation of my great-grandparents' generosity, but the most moving point of the two-year odyssey was when my nephew and a friend did a reading of Jack and Norman's letters in a local theatre. Eighty of the surviving family gathered to remember these young men; among those present were six of their nieces and nephews, including my mother. This act of remembrance felt long overdue. And now I find myself thinking of Norman, Jack and their parents frequently; it is as if I have finally met relations – to whom I owe so much – that I have always half-known.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421829663|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|4ff3c4e515ecb118cc6e35dc76af4267534efbdb -->",

        "body":"<p>In brilliant autumn sunshine, and the lengthening shadow of the approaching centenary of the war to end all wars, the pavements were lined 10-deep on Whitehall long before the start of the Remembrance Sunday ceremony.</p><p>When the  street was officially declared \"at capacity\" by the police, with 10,000 people lined up waiting to march past the Cenotaph once the Queen and the politicians had laid their wreaths, crowds were still piling into Parliament and Trafalgar squares  to be present when the deep boom of a first world war field gun launched the eerie silence at the heart of the capital. Many brought small children, who almost without exception – a single hastily stifled wail was just audible on Whitehall – were awed into joining the silence.</p><p>The two-minute tribute, originally intended, like the Cenotaph – first built as a temporary wooden structure – as a gesture of mourning and remembrance just for November 1919 when the slaughter of the war was still agonisingly close,  has been repeated every year,  in ceremonies  in towns and cities and at modest village war memorials, across Britain and overseas.</p><p>With the deaths in the past decade of the last veterans of the first world war, it was thought the event might dwindle to a small official ceremony: instead it seems to grow every year.</p><p>This year, the parade, which took well over an hour to pass the Cenotaph, was led by the War Widows Association: some shockingly young faces demonstrated why remembering those who die in war has never gone out of fashion.</p><p>In Ireland, the taoiseach, Enda Kenny, travelled north of the border to  join the Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, in laying wreaths at the memorial in Enniskillen, in the heart of the town ripped apart by an IRA bomb during a Remembrance ceremony 26 years ago, killing 11 people. His deputy, Eamon Gilmore, attended the ceremony in Belfast.</p><p>Prince Andrew and the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, laid their wreaths at Camp Bastion in Helmand province in Afghanistan, where 446 British personnel have died since 2001. The prince said Remembrance Sunday brought back personal memories of  friends and colleagues  lost in the Falklands. \"I always think of those I served with, who never came back,\" he said.</p><p>At Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire, people stood in silence again, in the streets  where for years the bustle of everyday life stopped  every time repatriated bodies, 345 in all, were driven through the town from the nearby airfield.</p><p>One group of 60  British schoolchildren aged between nine and 18 travelled to Ypres, where they will join in the ceremony at the Menin Gate on Monday  for the actual 11 November anniversary.  Twinned with Belgian schools who are hosting them, they are also collecting soil from battlefields in Flanders, which will be brought back to create a memorial garden next year at Wellington Barracks, near Buckingham Palace.</p><p>A wreath was laid at the Cenotaph by Prince Harry on behalf of his father, who attended a ceremony at a Commonwealth War Graves cemetery at Kirkee, in India, where he and his wife were shown the graves of the youngest and oldest buried there, 15-year-old bandsman Norman Halliburn, and 68-year-old Sydney Frankcom, who both died in the 1940s as the Japanese advanced through Burma. They also met a group of second world war veterans at the \"Afghan\" church in Mumbai – built not to mark the present but the many who died in the 19th-century war.</p><p>In Whitehall, a large delegation  from the Korean Veterans Association joined the parade for the last time.  The war, which cost the lives of 1,139 British service personnel,   seems painfully recent to many although this year marks the 60th anniversary of the armistice that ended it – leaving the still gaping fault line between North and South Korea. Although individuals will join future ceremonies, the veterans association is being dissolved because most of the survivors are now in their 80s.</p><p>One small group joined the parade for the first time, nondescript now, their wartime activities entirely unknown to their families in 1942.  The activities of the Auxiliary Units, known as \"Churchill's Secret Army\", were kept so quiet, with each unit operating in isolation, that Trevor Miners, from Perranporth, who has been campaigning to win them official recognition, has no means of contacting many of the veterans who signed the Official Secrets Act during the war, and in many cases have never broken it since. They never saw active service, but their intended role was to surface as secret agents, sabotaging and harrying the enemy, after a German invasion.</p><p>The parade, including a loudly cheered group of Gurkhas, marched briskly without registering another small group of Gurkhas who have been mounting a vigil at the feet of the towering statue of Monty, Field Marshall Viscount Montgomery, for the past fortnight. Some have launched a hunger strike there as part of their campaign for better pensions, medical treatment and settlement rights for Gurkha veterans and their families.</p><p>Nearby, peace campaigner Maria Galliastegui, a veteran of the camp set up by Brian Haw and others on Parliament Square, stood wearing a white poppy. She had met with no antagonism but little recognition for the gesture, she said.</p><p>\"This is a very moving event. You have to honour all the people who have served this country and given up their lives on our behalf.  But we have got to re-awaken the peace movement. We have got to ensure that the politicians bring the troops home by next year – and not just leave us strategically positioned for wars to come in Syria and Iran.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422126015|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|2eea10e0581a8134484398d8c38b06f04e5d5cd2 -->",
