        "headline":"Talking Horses: Final entries for Champions Day, Thursday's best bets",
        "body":"<h2>Today's best bets, by Chris Cook<br /></h2><p>The final declarations are out for Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday, with the immediate point of interest being the fact that Ryan Moore is aboard Ruler Of The World in the Champion Stakes, rather than Hillstar. It appears that Sir Michael Stoute has let him off Hillstar, so that he can maintain his association with the Aidan O'Brien-trained Derby winner. If you'd backed Hillstar, you'd have to be worried about that, though Richard Hughes is a pretty darned good substitute.</p><p>Perhaps it's a one-off arrangement that has no significance for future riding contracts. Moore has yet to offer public comment but I don't imagine for a moment that he would be rash enough to do a Dettori and jump ship without making sure the boss was OK with it.</p><p>The fields for Champions Day have held up pretty well, despite the prospect of soft going, with an average of 11 runners in the Group races. The withdrawals were widely predicted: Toronado, Sky Lantern, Declaration Of War, Magician, Sole Power and Trading Leather are the most significant.</p><p>There has been a further 1mm of rain at Ascot this morning and the going remains soft all round. The rest of today is expected to be dry but showers are forecast tomorrow and on Saturday.</p><p>Here are the declared runners for the <strong>Queen Elizabeth II Stakes</strong>:</p><p>Burwaaz<br />Caspar Netscher<br />Gordon Lord Byron<br />Gregorian<br />Maxios<br />Soft Falling Rain<br />Dawn Approach<br />Elusive Kate<br />Kingsbarns<br />Leitir Mor<br />Olympic Glory<br />Top Notch Tonto</p><p>And here are those entered for the <strong>Champion Stakes</strong>:</p><p>Cirrus Des Aigles<br />Farhh<br />Hunter's Light<br />Main Sequence<br />Mukhadram<br />Parish Hall<br />Hillstar<br />Morandi<br />Ruler Of The World<br />Triple Threat<br /><a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings/0,14906,17-10-2013%5E2,00.html\"><br />You can see declarations for all Saturday's Flat races here</a>.</p><p>I like the look of the QEII. The Champion Stakes, I'm afraid, has not attracted the sort of field that the prize money deserves. Still, that's what happens when the ground turns at this time of year: the fast, flashy animals don't turn up.</p><p>But it seems there is no prospect of moving Champions Day to an earlier point in the year, so we're just going to have to keep hoping for unseasonably dry weather for Ascot in mid-October. Jumps fans will simultaneously be hoping for plenty of rain in the West Country, so that Cheltenham's first autumn fixture can offer safe, spongey ground on the same weekend.</p><p>Cheltenham's two-day meeting starts tomorrow. To tide us over, there's Wincanton this afternoon, when I think <strong>Sugar Hiccup (2.20) </strong>has an excellent chance of extending her winning run to four.</p><p>Sugar Hiccup is another of those Jim Best-trained beasts who showed nothing in novice hurdles, was given a break and then showed dramatic improvement in handicaps. Best is not uniformly popular among punters but at least we should all be familiar with the fact that his horses do sometimes follow this kind of career arc.</p><p>Eventually, arcs return to earth, of course, and Sugar Hiccup will be beaten one day soon. She has been raised 33lb, more than two stones, since the first of her three recent wins, on 22 August, and it is hard to believe she can still have anything in hand.</p><p>But she has had a month off since her last outing and should again be ready to put in her maximum effort. The runner-up that day has since won from a 5lb higher mark, while the third was beaten 20 lengths.</p><p>Sugar Hiccup really might be able to win again from a mark 8lb higher than last time. The market will be wary because Tony McCoy, who has such a great record for Best and was aboard for all three of the mares' wins, has gone to Uttoxeter today. The ride passes to Tom Scudamore, but he also has a good record for the yard (nine winners at 19% over five seasons) and I like their chances at the current 5-1.</p><p>The favourite is Buckthorn Tom, from the Colin Tizzard yard that has yet to hit its stride. Tizzard is 0/16 in October so far.</p><p>McCoy has a couple of good rides at Uttoxeter, notably <strong>Foundation Man (4.30)</strong>, making his chase debut in a novice handicap. He has always had the look of a chaser and has the family connections for this game, as well, being a half-brother to Captain Chris and a son of Function Dream, who won the Victor Chandler and beat Flagship Uberalles in the Game Spirit.</p><p>Foundation Man has been handicapped on his hurdles form and should have plenty in hand if ready to go today. Still, at 5-2, the bookies are not giving much away and it's a pity the going has gone soft.</p><h2>Flat racing tips, by Greg Wood<br /></h2><p>The going will be soft for the final afternoon of the season at Brighton and one of the shortest-priced horses of the year, too, in the opening maiden, but the bulk of the card is competitive, with a couple of very open handicaps later in the afternoon.</p><p><strong>Compton Bird (3.40)</strong> is up 8lb since winning over course and distance last week but did so in a style which suggested she stands every chance of following up. Smokey Oakey, a Group Three winner on soft ground in the past, has fallen a long way in the weights since then and will be a danger, but it was good to soft here last week and Hans Adielsson's four-year-old coped impressively.</p><p><strong>Sword Of The Lord (4.10)</strong> won at the same meeting and should also follow up in the next, while <strong>Hamis Al Bin (4.40)</strong> is a big price for a horse with a course and distance success this year who has now dropped back to his winning mark that day.</p><h2>Tipping competition, day four<br /></h2><p>Our winners so far:</p><p><strong>Monday</strong></p><p>Hasopop 7-2</p><p>Layla's Oasis 22-1</p><p>Eric The Grey 11-1</p><p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p><p>Embsay Crag 10-1</p><p>Dom Lukka 5-2</p><p>Ty Gwr 12-1</p><p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p><p>Grandads Horse 2-1</p><p>Tahaamah 6-1</p><p>The Great Gabrial 5-1</p><p>And our leader is:</p><p><strong>Tommy2002</strong> +29.50</p><p>… who is plainly not interested in tipping winners at 6-1 or shorter and struck out yesterday, as, indeed, did his only near pursuers, <strong>15244</strong> (+27) and <strong>ID3220887</strong> (+25). <strong>23skidoo</strong> (+13) had a double.</p><p>Today, we'd like your selections, please, for these races: <strong>3.40 Brighton</strong>, <strong>3.50 Wincanton</strong>, <strong>4.00 Uttoxeter</strong>.</p><p>This week's prize is a copy of <strong>Timeform's Chasers &amp; Hurdlers</strong> annual, the much-loved and lovingly produced book which serves as a complete record of the last jumps season (and, hopefully, offers some insights into the new one). Costing £75 if you actually pay for it, the latest annual is newly published and will shortly be reviewed on this site by m'colleague Tony Paley. You can <a href=\"http://www.timeform.com/show_article.asp?num=73\" title=\"Timeform\">buy a copy here</a> or <a href=\"http://v.calameo.com/2.0/cviewer.swf?bkcode=000362465232732dfe24c&amp;langid=en\" title=\"Calameo\">read a sample here</a>.</p><p>As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of £1 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers.</p><p>If you have not already joined in this week, you can do so today, but you will start on -9.</p><p>In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/sep/07/talking-horses-tipping-competition-terms-and-conditions\" title=\"Ts  Cs\">For terms and conditions click here</a>.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Click <a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings\" title=\"racecards\">here for all the day's racecards</a>, form, stats and results.</p><p><em>And post your tips or racing-related comments below.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246816|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|d152bfcbd56fdeed2dbea04adbe0ac0aba693ee3 -->",

        "body":"<p>The going at Ascot turned soft all round on Wednesday after a midday downpour dropped 6mm of rain on the course. That news will be unwelcome for a number of trainers who would like to have Champions Day runners at the Berkshire track on Saturday, but are unhappy about the prospect of a testing surface.</p><p>The first Champions Day, in 2011, was blessed with fine weather and good going but there was a feeling at the time that it would not normally be the case for a mid-October fixture. This will be the second time running that the card, offering £3.4m in prize money, will be held on a surface with plenty of give.</p><p>Asked to predict the likely going for Saturday, Chris Stickels, Ascot's clerk of the course, said: \"I think it'll be a mixture of good to soft and soft.\"</p><p>He reported a forecast predicting \"occasional showers\" for Thursday, Friday and Saturday but added: \"It's hit and miss stuff, very difficult to predict how much we're likely to get, but I would say [Thursday] is quite likely to be dry. It's an unclear picture after that. I think we've seen the worst of it.\"</p><p>Soft Falling Rain is, ironically, one of the horses whose connections would rather see plenty of sun in the Ascot area. A Group One winner in his native South Africa, he was a comfortable winner on fast ground at Newmarket last month, on the strength of which he is joint second-favourite for Saturday's QEII Stakes, worth £1m.</p><p>While that prize money is plainly tempting, Soft Falling Rain could yet be withdrawn, should his trainer, Mike de Kock, decide the ground is too testing. \"If it becomes a bog, Mike has said that he'll have to talk it over with [the colt's owner] Sheikh Hamdan,\" said Steve Jell, De Kock's assistant trainer. \"So we're training him for the race but we'll have to keep an eye on the weather, just as a lot of other people are doing.</p><p>\"He's such a good-actioned horse on fast, firm ground. Will he be effective on both [types of going]? We're not too sure.\"</p><p>Jell takes some comfort from the fact that the QEII is due to be run up Ascot's straight mile, which drains more quickly than the round course. He reported a lot of enthusiasm within the camp for Soft Falling Rain's chance. \"He upped his game in quite an impressive manner last time,\" Jell said. \"He's got to do that again but he's a fighter who doesn't give up easily.\"</p><p>De Kock is also due to run Igugu in the Fillies &amp; Mares Stakes, newly raised to Group One status, and Jell hopes that, as a daughter of Galileo, she will be able to cope with some cut underfoot. Igugu has not been able to reproduce her best form since leaving South Africa last year, which Jell explained was in part because she had not enjoyed her experiences of travel, but he added that she was showing signs of coming back to herself after five months in Newmarket.</p><p>There appears to be confusion in the Sky Lantern camp over whether the grey will run on Champions Day, with her trainer, Richard Hannon, appearing to rule it out just one day after his son and assistant, Richard Jr, had enthused about her chance of running in quotes reported by the Racing Post. Her jockey, Richard Hughes, used the Hannon website yesterday to say: \"I'd be inclined to give it a miss … It would not surprise me if it rode heavy.\"</p><p>Hughes revealed that the Hannon-trained Olympic Glory will wear blinkers for the first time when he runs in the QEII. \"We gave him&nbsp;a spin in them earlier in the week and there was a positive reaction. I would envisage it could make three lengths difference, which would put him in&nbsp;there with a big shout,\" the jockey said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420181668|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|6ff6ded5b23c523144844d498c7e9240268f1f8a -->",

        "body":"<h2>Today's best bets, by Chris Cook<br /></h2><p>A perfect storm is forecast to hit punters at Lingfield late this afternoon, when Cafe Society runs. Here are the close-up comments for the colt's last two starts, both at Ascot. As you read them, bear in mind that he is now switching to Leafy, where every finish comes with guaranteed heartbreak for someone:</p><p><strong>13 July</strong> 2nd of eight, beaten a neck</p><p><em>Steadied start, held up in last, smooth progress on inner just over 2f out to track leading trio over 1f out, switched around them soon after, pushed along and closed to take 2nd last stride, too much to do</em></p><p><strong>7 September</strong> 5th of 14, beaten two and a quarter lengths</p><p><em>Heavily restrained start, held up in last, ridden 2f out, stayed on from over 1f out to take 5th last strides, far too much to do </em></p><p>Jamie Spencer, who rode in the July race, is back aboard, Martin Lane having ridden him the last time. Connections appear to believe the horse must be held up, in which case he'll always need a strong pace and luck in running.</p><p>He might get both today but would you enjoy betting on that at the available odds of 13-8? I'd rather take <strong>Space Ship (4.05)</strong> at 7-2, even though you face some of the same risks with him. This counts as a step down in class for a horse who was beaten only a length in the King George V at Royal Ascot and the vibes appear positive for this John Gosden beast, returning from a three-month break.</p><p>Soft going at Nottingham is likely to mean the finishes look very different to those at Lingfield. I fancy a couple of Tom Queally's mounts and, although he's not a jockey I follow, I'm interested to note that he has ridden more winners at this track in the past five years than any of his colleagues with mounts in the relevant races.</p><p><strong>Weapon Of Choice (4.20)</strong> is up 5lb for scoring at Epsom a fortnight ago, which counted as a return to form after 18 winless months. He had looked very unlucky on his previous start at Newbury, even though only ninth. He remains well treated on his best form and has conditions to suit, so 10-1 is enticing.</p><p>In the closing sprint handicap, <strong>Pastureyes (5.50)</strong> is friendless at 25-1 on Betfair but has an interesting profile. She showed some promise in maidens and then won on her handicap debut, despite appearing to hate Brighton. She was drawn away from the main action at Leicester next time and may have disliked the fast ground, finishing well beaten. With first-time cheekpieces and Queally replacing a 5lb claimer, it appears connections mean business, though soft ground is an unknown.</p><p>Another runner who may be overpriced is <strong>Diamond Frontier (2.50) </strong>at 14-1 for the two-mile handicap chase at Wetherby. He will need to be fit for this reappearance but John Wade's horses have been winning at a 16% strike-rate since the new season began in May and several have been at big prices — the market does not seem to offer reliable insights into the chances of runners from this yard.</p><h2>Tipping competition, day three<br /></h2><p>Our winners so far:</p><p><strong>Monday</strong></p><p>Hasopop 7-2</p><p>Layla's Oasis 22-1</p><p>Eric The Grey 11-1</p><p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p><p>Embsay Crag 10-1</p><p>Dom Lukka 5-2</p><p>Ty Gwr 12-1</p><p>And our leader is:</p><p><strong>Tommy2002</strong> +32.50</p><p>… who added Embsay Crag to Hasopop and Layla's Oasis for a deeply impressive start. Even so, he is barely ahead of <strong>15244</strong> (+30) and <strong>ID3220887</strong> (+28).</p><p>Today, we'd like your selections, please, for these races: <strong>3.55 Wetherby</strong>, <strong>4.20 Nottingham</strong>, <strong>5.10 Lingfield</strong>.</p><p>In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.</p><p>This week's prize is a copy of <strong>Timeform's Chasers &amp; Hurdlers</strong> annual, the much-loved and lovingly produced book which serves as a complete record of the last jumps season (and, hopefully, offers some insights into the new one). Costing £75 if you actually pay for it, the latest annual is newly published and will shortly be reviewed on this site by m'colleague Tony Paley. You can <a href=\"http://www.timeform.com/show_article.asp?num=73\" title=\"Timeform\">buy a copy here</a> or <a href=\"http://v.calameo.com/2.0/cviewer.swf?bkcode=000362465232732dfe24c&amp;langid=en\" title=\"Calameo\">read a sample here</a>.</p><p>As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of £1 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers.</p><p>If you have not already joined in this week, you can do so today, but you will start on -6.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/sep/07/talking-horses-tipping-competition-terms-and-conditions\" title=\"Ts  Cs\">For terms and conditions click here</a>.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Click <a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings\" title=\"racecards\">here for all the day's racecards</a>, form, stats and results.</p><p><em>And post your tips or racing-related comments below.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420133344|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|05cfc897a17912f3afbb2d3af14f0051b3a9d4bc -->",

        "headline":"Cirrus Des Aigles in 'perfect' nick for Champions Day, says trainer",
        "body":"<p>Cirrus Des Aigles is in \"perfect\" condition as he attempts to recover his Champion Stakes crown at Ascot on Saturday, his trainer reported on Tuesday. Corine Barande-Barbe added that Christophe Soumillon has been booked to ride once more, having won twice on the horse in the past month.</p><p>When the concept of Champions Day at Ascot was first dreamed up, its creators could not have envisaged Barande-Barbe being among its key early supporters but her gelding has become a standing dish on the card, winning the feature race in 2011, when its prize money had been raised past £1m for the first time, and then chasing home Frankel last year. Once rated the best horse in the world, Cirrus Des Aigles will be a reliable source of interest and international glamour on Champions Day for the third year in a row, even as soft ground keeps other stars in their boxes.</p><p>\"I don't know what else is running,\" Barande-Barbe said from her base in Chantilly, north of Paris. \"You must always respect the opposition, but I think he might win.</p><p>\"He's very well, just perfect. I think he's on his way to the top.\" Backing up the trainer's confidence, bookmakers offer no better than 5-4 about Cirrus Des Aigles, though some had him on 16-1 just a month ago.</p><p>At that point, he had not won for almost a year and the racing public had begun to think of him as a back number. A strained ligament sustained in Hong Kong in December had kept him on the sidelines for six months and the series of disappointments that followed suggested he would not recover his former talent.</p><p>Even now, after back-to-back successes, he remains an object of suspicion for some, since neither of those wins came in a top-class race. But the manner of his victory at Longchamp on Arc weekend was redolent of peak-form Cirrus Des Aigles and Barande-Barbe is satisfied.</p><p>\"I had never doubted him but you never know. He is getting a bit older but finally he is just the same as he was last year and the year before.\"</p><p>It is a pity that such a fine animal should be peaking as the European turf season ends but Barande-Barbe regards his year as \"not really disappointing\" and believes he has legitimate excuses for each beaten effort. \"The first time out, at Saint-Cloud, he was not ready at all.</p><p>\"Then he was fourth in the King George, which is a great race, very good horses, giving weight to three-year-olds, which is very hard. It was a bit long for him and a bit hard for him. If you remember, they were waiting for the rain and then it came after the race. So they were really not ideal conditions for him.</p><p>\"Then, at Deauville, we maybe didn't have a bit of luck but he still put in a nice finish and was second. Next time, in the Grand Prix de Deauville, he had to come very early and the [extra] distance told a bit.</p><p>\"After, I saw he was better and better and when he ran at Maisons-Laffitte, he was really near to his best.</p><p>\"I think he will stay in training as long as he is happy to be. The main problem will be when he stops, because he is used to a lot of attention and a lot of events through the day, he plays with the girl rider in the morning. It might be a little depressing for him.</p><p>\"It is the same with people: half the people don't work enough and the other half work too much. Me, I never go on holiday for more than a week and after four days, I miss my work.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420058703|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|1b352e758d269c6795c223e2af77445dc7626981 -->",

        "headline":"Talking Horses: News of Hydrogen's debut and best bets for today",
        "body":"<h2>Today's best bets, by Chris Cook<br /></h2><p>Remember Hydrogen? Just over a year ago, he made headlines when sold at Tattersalls in Newmarket for 2.5m guineas to Sheikh Fahad, who was enticed by the prospect of owning a Galileo half-brother to Authorized.</p><p>There then followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/14/hydrogen-colt-newmarket-sales\" title=\"Guardian report\">an amusing arrangement</a> by which the Sheikh's 20 British trainers were gathered together for lunch and presented with envelopes containing the details of which yearlings would be sent to them. One of those lucky trainers would find Hydrogen's name staring up at them.</p><p>Of course, the glass-half-empty view is that it's a curse to be sent such a high-profile prospect. If he does well, it's because of his innate talent; if he flops, it's because you're a loser.</p><p>Anyway, the lot fell on Peter Chapple-Hyam, who has presumably spent much of the year worrying about what the British Horseracing Authority were going to do to him (he had doctored some phone records when asked to produce them). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/05/peter-chapple-hyam-fine-phone-records\" title=\"Guardian report\">In the event, he was fined £5,000</a>, which must have been at the lower end of the punishments the trainer had envisaged for himself.</p><p>Only Chapple-Hyam can say whether that distraction has had any impact on his productivity this season but, for whatever reason, he has managed just 11 winners so far at an 8% strike-rate, compared to 29 at 16% through the whole of 2012. And, of course, we have yet to see Hydrogen on a racecourse, with almost all the major juvenile races now behind us.</p><p>But word has come from Sheikh Fahad's racing manager, David Redvers, that the colt is being lined up for a Newbury maiden a week on Saturday, one week before the end of turf racing in Britain. \"I saw him do another piece of work the other morning under Jamie Spencer and he worked with a very fast lead-horse and went extremely well,\" Redvers told Sky Sports News Radio.</p><p>\"He looks a nice mile-and-a-half horse, which is what you'd expect on pedigree. We'd just like to get him to win a maiden and put him away for the winter.</p><p>\"He's certainly showing that he's way above average ability. I think he'll turn into a beautiful three-year-old.\"</p><p>Just to confirm that acquiring an expensive yearling is only the start of a trainer's problems, consider Classic Devotion, sold for $1.2m at Saratoga in August last year and not seen since. Now with Godolphin's Charlie Appleby, he was due to make a belated and low-key racecourse debut today at Newcastle but has been pulled out.</p><p>That, presumably, is because the going is now heavy in places after 31mm of rain since declarations were made on Sunday. Classic Devotion is a son of Street Cry, whose progeny have a 5% strike-rate on heavy and only a 7% strike-rate on soft. His only other entry at the moment is in the Derby and the odds are good that we won't see him until next year.</p><p><strong>Authentication (4.00)</strong> should love the ground, though, as a son of Authorized, whose kids score at a 24% rate on heavy (13/55 so far). He has already contributed to that tally, having scored on deep ground at Folkestone last year, when with Mark Johnston. Mel Brittain hasn't had much joy out of him yet but the horse hasn't really had his ground yet and is now back down to 1lb above his last winning mark. I like him at 16-1.</p><p>The day's nap is <strong>Trixie Malone (5.30)</strong>, who gave Karl Burke one of his first winners after recovering his licence when scoring on her handicap debut at Ayr last month. She and Mash Potato pulled clear of their rivals that day and I'd bet a 6lb rise underestimates her.</p><p>That was her first run for four months and her first on soft, so she should be ready to go well again in these conditions. At 4-1, the market sees her chance but I still think those odds are a bit generous.</p><p>At Huntingdon, I'm interested in a couple of horses who were showing improved form when they fell last time. <strong>Darnborough (2.50) </strong>was four lengths up over today's course and distance when coming down at the last a month ago, while <strong>Lucky To Be Alive (4.20) </strong>tripped over the second-last at Uttoxeter when disputing the lead. I think there are good reasons to expect continued progress from both and they appeal at 5-1 and 7-1 respectively.</p><h2>Tipping competition, day two<br /></h2><p>Our winners so far:</p><p><strong>Monday</strong></p><p>Hasopop 7-2</p><p>Layla's Oasis 22-1</p><p>Eric The Grey 11-1</p><p>And our leader is:</p><p><strong>Tommy2002</strong> +24.50</p><p>… who made a scarcely believable start with both Hasopop and Layla's Oasis.</p><p>Today, we'd like your selections, please, for these races: <strong>4.00 Newcastle</strong>, <strong>4.20 Huntingdon</strong>, <strong>5.45 Leicester</strong>.</p><p>In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.</p><p>This week's prize is a copy of <strong>Timeform's Chasers &amp; Hurdlers</strong> annual, the much-loved and lovingly produced book which serves as a complete record of the last jumps season (and, hopefully, offers some insights into the new one). Costing £75 if you actually pay for it, the latest annual is newly published and will shortly be reviewed on this site by m'colleague Tony Paley. <a href=\"http://www.timeform.com/show_article.asp?num=73\" title=\"Timeform\">You can buy a copy here</a> or <a href=\"http://v.calameo.com/2.0/cviewer.swf?bkcode=000362465232732dfe24c&amp;langid=en\" title=\"Calameo\">read a sample here</a>.</p><p>As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of £1 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers.</p><p>If you have not already joined in this week, you can do so today, but you will start on -3.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/sep/07/talking-horses-tipping-competition-terms-and-conditions\" title=\"Ts  Cs\">For terms and conditions click here</a>.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Click <a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings\" title=\"racecards\">here for all the day's racecards</a>, form, stats and results.</p><p><em>And post your tips or racing-related comments below.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420021683|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|7a02b0e6015f8ebbe4674b4064e6f8ff03c04048 -->",

        "body":"<p>The latest running of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/06/auroras-encore-grand-national-horses-fell\" title=\"Guardian report\">the world's most famous race</a>, the first to ditch the traditional timber-framed fences in favour of \"more forgiving\" obstacles made partly of synthetic birch, might become known in future years as the first \"plastic Grand National\", warn racehorse ratings experts at Timeform.</p><p></p><p>\"The latest National field was still intact approaching the eighth fence, the Canal Turn, a situation unprecedented in the long history of the race, and the changes to the fences seemed to compromise the challenge of the race which has always been regarded as 'the supreme test of jumping,'\" argues Timeform.</p><p></p><p>\"The Grand National engenders strong feelings amongst its opponents, but it is the biggest prize in jumping, with a rich and colourful history, and the authorities must be wary of making changes that risk turning the race into a parody or imitation of itself,\" it concludes.</p><p></p><p>The comment comes in a wide-ranging essay on the National winner Auroras Encore in the organisation's latest Chasers &amp; Hurdlers annual, out this week, in which it argues: \"Maintaining the essence of the race revolves around striking the right balance between the tradition of providing the ultimate challenge and the risks that the participants face, and also preserving the spectacle of the race.\"</p><p></p><p>Timeform lists the tinkering that has taken place with the National in recent years and, while making it clear that it is wholly opposed to any further alterations, points out that \"no one should be under any illusion that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/25/rspca-bechers-brook-may-have-to-go\" title=\"Guardian story\">to appease the RSPCA, for example, even more changes will have to be made\"</a>.</p><p></p><p>If there is a \"tinkerman\" in British racing it is Phil Smith, the British Horseracing Authority's head of handicapping, who introduced a significant new development when he decided to start giving the top weights in the National a distinct advantage in order to attract a higher quality of runner.</p><p></p><p>It is an alteration, which Timeform is very much opposed to. In its essay on Tidal Bay, who would have raced off a mark 9lb lower than in handicaps away from Aintree, if he had not been injured prior to the National, it states: \"The BHA handicappers have the discretion to treat some of the Grand National top weights relatively leniently, a policy that has always been hard to justify yet seems to go unquestioned.</p><p></p><p>\"The Grand National is far and away the most valuable race in the jumping calendar in Britain and Ireland, and in truth, the owners of the best chasers shouldn't need any more incentive than that.\"</p><p></p><p>Whether the lack of high-profile opposition among, for example, trainers will remain the case if one of the top-rated horses given preferential treatment wins is another matter.</p><p></p><p>It is safe to say that the top-rated British chaser, Sprinter Sacre, will not be lining up in the Grand National whatever weight he would be allotted. Timeform argues, though, that if the chaser is to scale the heights he is potentially capable of, both with regards to his rating and his perception as one of the all-time greats, then a crack at the Cheltenham Gold Cup should be seriously considered.</p><p></p><p>\"Sprinter Sacre undoubtedly has the potential to secure a place for all time in the steeplechasing pantheon, though he might have to win a Cheltenham Gold Cup to truly capture the wider public's imagination. He will be untouchable if it is decided to confine him to the two-mile division, but he gives the distinct impression that anything is possible with him and he would start a short-priced favourite for the Gold Cup,\"says Timeform.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.racingpost.com/news/horse-racing/nicky-henderson-king-george-vi-not-on-agenda-for-sprinter-sacre/1524135/#newsArchiveTabs=last7DaysNews\" title=\"Racing Post\">The trainer Nicky Henderson has already ruled out the King George VI Chase for Sprinter Sacre</a> this season and the prospects of a Gold Cup bid are not promising at present, but Timeform points to the example of Flyingbolt.</p><p></p><p>The brilliant Irish chaser, as dominant as Sprinter Sacre is in the two-mile division, went on to put up even more meritorious performances at longer distances. Indeed, victory in the 1966 Irish Grand National under 12st 7lb, then run over the Gold Cup distance, was one of the performances that put him, in Timeform's estimation, within 2lb of the legendary Arkle.</p><p></p><p>Sprinter Sacre is currently rated the third highest ever National Hunt horse with the organisation at 192p (the letter denoting the possibility of improvement on that figure in Timeform's estimation). That rating is already 1lb above that of Mill House and, incidentally, Kauto Star, who, along with Desert Orchid, concurrently held the titles of best two-mile chaser and best staying chaser.</p><p></p><p>\"Arkle [212] and his great contemporary Flyingbolt [210] are the only horses to have earned a Timeform rating of over 200, a mark that Sprinter Sacre could probably achieve in the right circumstances,\" it argues.</p><p></p><p>The entry on Sprinter Sacre ends with a warning: \"Nothing should be taken for granted given the extent to which illness, injury and loss of form decimate the ranks of the top jumpers each season. Therefore, the advice to jumping devotees is to enjoy Sprinter Sacre while you can. It might be a long time before his like is seen again.\"</p><p></p><p>Justified complaints about the distances races are actually run over and ground descriptions – two factors in which accuracy is vital for punters – are made by Timeform in its essay on Captain Conan and it seems ludicrous that British racing is still failing in these two areas.</p><p></p><p>\"Races should always be staged over the exact [trip advertised] and, if starts cannot be moved [following the moving of rails on racecourses for example] to maintain those correct distances, then at the very least the BHA should insist that racecourses provide the public with completely accurate race distances when such changes are made (at the moment the distances of races over jumps are advertised to the nearest half furlong, which gives clerks of courses far too much leeway).</p><p></p><p>\"At the same time, the BHA should also take a much harder line with racecourses on going descriptions, the accuracy of which has arguably reached an all-time low at some tracks in recent seasons.\"</p><p></p><p>There are countless other topics discussed in the 1,000-plus pages covering the A–Z of the 9,000-plus runners that competed on Britain and Ireland's tracks last season, as well as analysis of the up-and-coming contenders for the championship crowns. As with last season, it is Sprinter Sacre and another of Henderson's runners, Simonsig (still, in Timeform's opinion, the biggest danger to his stable companion's dominance), the ratings experts are most looking forward to seeing.</p><p></p><p><em>Timeform's Chasers &amp; Hurdlers is published by Portway Press at £75.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420003909|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|2bcc8503144fc2f1d389a2f87bdb764ed352a85a -->",

        "body":"<p>Camelot, who almost became the first Triple Crown winner since 1970, ended his career in a downbeat manner on Monday, having retirement thrust upon him by lameness. The four-year-old will stand at Coolmore Stud from next year.</p><p>A statement from Coolmore said the injury was not serious but would keep him out of exercise for a week. In the circumstances connections were not minded to go through with a possible tilt at the Breeders' Cup Turf a fortnight on Saturday. Camelot had also figured in betting lists for the Champion Stakes at Ascot on Saturday but it appears this was no longer a target for him in any case.</p><p>Camelot was unbeaten in his first five races, including last year's 2,000 Guineas, Derby and Irish Derby, establishing a huge reputation. But his was a weak year and, remarkably, the six horses who were second or third behind him in those three Classics have all failed to win a single race since then.</p><p>Sent off at 2-5 for the final leg of the Triple Crown, the St Leger, Camelot was beaten three-quarters of a length by Encke. The winner has since been caught up in the Mahmood al-Zarooni doping scandal and tested positive for an anabolic steroid in spring, causing Camelot's connections to be the object of additional sympathy for that defeat.</p><p>Camelot won only one of his final five races and appeared to have his limitations exposed when twice beaten by Al Kazeem in the early part of this Flat season. His fans believe a  midwinter bout of colic may have robbed him of some of his ability.</p><p>\"He was the perfect racehorse,\" said his trainer, Aidan O'Brien, \"a beautiful horse with a terrific action. Unfortunately, we never saw the same brilliance on the racecourse as we had done before his colic operation but he was showing signs of it at home in recent weeks, so it's obviously disappointing that he won't get the opportunity to run again.\"</p><p>Later, at Limerick races, O'Brien all but ruled out Champions Day for two of his other horses, Declaration Of War and Magician, explaining that both want a sound surface, whereas the going at Ascot was soft in places even before 3.5mm of rain in the area on Monday. Declaration Of War would probably go straight to the Breeders' Cup Classic, he said.</p><p>\"Ruler Of The World and Kingsbarns are in [races on Champions Day] and both of those have form with ease in the ground, so maybe they'll run if the rain keeps coming as it is,\" O'Brien added. Both are entered in the Champion Stakes over 10 furlongs, while Kingsbarns also has the option of the QEII over a mile.</p><p>Fifteen horses were left in the Champion Stakes, which offers £1.3m in guaranteed prize money, at Monday's entry stage but, as Sky Lantern is another unlikely to be risked on soft going, it appears the race has a maximum of 12 potential runners. The going may also scupper the hoped-for fourth clash between Dawn Approach and Toronado in the QEII, as Toronado's connections also have Olympic Glory in the race and believe he would cope better with soft.</p><p>Reckless Abandon was another big name to be retired to stud. Clive Cox's colt was unbeaten in five runs as a juvenile last year, winning the Morny and the Middle Park, but could not add to those successes against top-class sprinters this year. He joins Sheikh Mohammed's Darley stud in Ireland.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419946260|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|ecbc513129c53d4ad1c108cfd7f7fc89db8e0032 -->",

        "headline":"Talking Horses: Final entries for Champions Day, Thursday's best bets",
        "body":"<h2>Today's best bets, by Chris Cook<br /></h2><p>The final declarations are out for Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday, with the immediate point of interest being the fact that Ryan Moore is aboard Ruler Of The World in the Champion Stakes, rather than Hillstar. It appears that Sir Michael Stoute has let him off Hillstar, so that he can maintain his association with the Aidan O'Brien-trained Derby winner. If you'd backed Hillstar, you'd have to be worried about that, though Richard Hughes is a pretty darned good substitute.</p><p>Perhaps it's a one-off arrangement that has no significance for future riding contracts. Moore has yet to offer public comment but I don't imagine for a moment that he would be rash enough to do a Dettori and jump ship without making sure the boss was OK with it.</p><p>The fields for Champions Day have held up pretty well, despite the prospect of soft going, with an average of 11 runners in the Group races. The withdrawals were widely predicted: Toronado, Sky Lantern, Declaration Of War, Magician, Sole Power and Trading Leather are the most significant.</p><p>There has been a further 1mm of rain at Ascot this morning and the going remains soft all round. The rest of today is expected to be dry but showers are forecast tomorrow and on Saturday.</p><p>Here are the declared runners for the <strong>Queen Elizabeth II Stakes</strong>:</p><p>Burwaaz<br />Caspar Netscher<br />Gordon Lord Byron<br />Gregorian<br />Maxios<br />Soft Falling Rain<br />Dawn Approach<br />Elusive Kate<br />Kingsbarns<br />Leitir Mor<br />Olympic Glory<br />Top Notch Tonto</p><p>And here are those entered for the <strong>Champion Stakes</strong>:</p><p>Cirrus Des Aigles<br />Farhh<br />Hunter's Light<br />Main Sequence<br />Mukhadram<br />Parish Hall<br />Hillstar<br />Morandi<br />Ruler Of The World<br />Triple Threat<br /><a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings/0,14906,17-10-2013%5E2,00.html\"><br />You can see declarations for all Saturday's Flat races here</a>.</p><p>I like the look of the QEII. The Champion Stakes, I'm afraid, has not attracted the sort of field that the prize money deserves. Still, that's what happens when the ground turns at this time of year: the fast, flashy animals don't turn up.</p><p>But it seems there is no prospect of moving Champions Day to an earlier point in the year, so we're just going to have to keep hoping for unseasonably dry weather for Ascot in mid-October. Jumps fans will simultaneously be hoping for plenty of rain in the West Country, so that Cheltenham's first autumn fixture can offer safe, spongey ground on the same weekend.</p><p>Cheltenham's two-day meeting starts tomorrow. To tide us over, there's Wincanton this afternoon, when I think <strong>Sugar Hiccup (2.20) </strong>has an excellent chance of extending her winning run to four.</p><p>Sugar Hiccup is another of those Jim Best-trained beasts who showed nothing in novice hurdles, was given a break and then showed dramatic improvement in handicaps. Best is not uniformly popular among punters but at least we should all be familiar with the fact that his horses do sometimes follow this kind of career arc.</p><p>Eventually, arcs return to earth, of course, and Sugar Hiccup will be beaten one day soon. She has been raised 33lb, more than two stones, since the first of her three recent wins, on 22 August, and it is hard to believe she can still have anything in hand.</p><p>But she has had a month off since her last outing and should again be ready to put in her maximum effort. The runner-up that day has since won from a 5lb higher mark, while the third was beaten 20 lengths.</p><p>Sugar Hiccup really might be able to win again from a mark 8lb higher than last time. The market will be wary because Tony McCoy, who has such a great record for Best and was aboard for all three of the mares' wins, has gone to Uttoxeter today. The ride passes to Tom Scudamore, but he also has a good record for the yard (nine winners at 19% over five seasons) and I like their chances at the current 5-1.</p><p>The favourite is Buckthorn Tom, from the Colin Tizzard yard that has yet to hit its stride. Tizzard is 0/16 in October so far.</p><p>McCoy has a couple of good rides at Uttoxeter, notably <strong>Foundation Man (4.30)</strong>, making his chase debut in a novice handicap. He has always had the look of a chaser and has the family connections for this game, as well, being a half-brother to Captain Chris and a son of Function Dream, who won the Victor Chandler and beat Flagship Uberalles in the Game Spirit.</p><p>Foundation Man has been handicapped on his hurdles form and should have plenty in hand if ready to go today. Still, at 5-2, the bookies are not giving much away and it's a pity the going has gone soft.</p><h2>Flat racing tips, by Greg Wood<br /></h2><p>The going will be soft for the final afternoon of the season at Brighton and one of the shortest-priced horses of the year, too, in the opening maiden, but the bulk of the card is competitive, with a couple of very open handicaps later in the afternoon.</p><p><strong>Compton Bird (3.40)</strong> is up 8lb since winning over course and distance last week but did so in a style which suggested she stands every chance of following up. Smokey Oakey, a Group Three winner on soft ground in the past, has fallen a long way in the weights since then and will be a danger, but it was good to soft here last week and Hans Adielsson's four-year-old coped impressively.</p><p><strong>Sword Of The Lord (4.10)</strong> won at the same meeting and should also follow up in the next, while <strong>Hamis Al Bin (4.40)</strong> is a big price for a horse with a course and distance success this year who has now dropped back to his winning mark that day.</p><h2>Tipping competition, day four<br /></h2><p>Our winners so far:</p><p><strong>Monday</strong></p><p>Hasopop 7-2</p><p>Layla's Oasis 22-1</p><p>Eric The Grey 11-1</p><p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p><p>Embsay Crag 10-1</p><p>Dom Lukka 5-2</p><p>Ty Gwr 12-1</p><p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p><p>Grandads Horse 2-1</p><p>Tahaamah 6-1</p><p>The Great Gabrial 5-1</p><p>And our leader is:</p><p><strong>Tommy2002</strong> +29.50</p><p>… who is plainly not interested in tipping winners at 6-1 or shorter and struck out yesterday, as, indeed, did his only near pursuers, <strong>15244</strong> (+27) and <strong>ID3220887</strong> (+25). <strong>23skidoo</strong> (+13) had a double.</p><p>Today, we'd like your selections, please, for these races: <strong>3.40 Brighton</strong>, <strong>3.50 Wincanton</strong>, <strong>4.00 Uttoxeter</strong>.</p><p>This week's prize is a copy of <strong>Timeform's Chasers &amp; Hurdlers</strong> annual, the much-loved and lovingly produced book which serves as a complete record of the last jumps season (and, hopefully, offers some insights into the new one). Costing £75 if you actually pay for it, the latest annual is newly published and will shortly be reviewed on this site by m'colleague Tony Paley. You can <a href=\"http://www.timeform.com/show_article.asp?num=73\" title=\"Timeform\">buy a copy here</a> or <a href=\"http://v.calameo.com/2.0/cviewer.swf?bkcode=000362465232732dfe24c&amp;langid=en\" title=\"Calameo\">read a sample here</a>.</p><p>As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of £1 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers.</p><p>If you have not already joined in this week, you can do so today, but you will start on -9.</p><p>In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/sep/07/talking-horses-tipping-competition-terms-and-conditions\" title=\"Ts  Cs\">For terms and conditions click here</a>.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Click <a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings\" title=\"racecards\">here for all the day's racecards</a>, form, stats and results.</p><p><em>And post your tips or racing-related comments below.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246816|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|d152bfcbd56fdeed2dbea04adbe0ac0aba693ee3 -->",

        "body":"<p>A television company boss has described John McCririck's antics as \"pretty disgusting\", as he explained to a tribunal why the flamboyant betting pundit was dropped from Channel 4's racing coverage.</p><p>McCririck, 73, is suing Channel 4 and the TV production company IMG for alleged ageism after he was dropped in a revamp of the broadcaster's racing programmes.</p><p>But Graham Fry, managing director of sports production worldwide at IMG, said in a witness statement that McCririck was ditched because of concerns that his larger-than-life style grated with the public.</p><p>\"We were concerned that John McCririck's presenting style was over-dramatic, liable to offend and would not have mainstream appeal,\" he said.</p><p>\"I was also concerned about John McCririck's credibility as a betting presenter in the context of a more serious, journalistic style of Channel 4 Racing, given the public persona he had created through appearances on other television programmes.\"</p><p>Fry, who prepared IMG's winning bid to produce the programme, said he found McCririck's stints on reality shows \"pretty disgusting and shocking\".</p><p>Jennifer Eady QC, representing McCririck, challenged Fry about a message he wrote during the preparation of the bid which asked: \"Is there a sexier picture of Francesca Cumani we can put in?\"   Fry told the tribunal that it was a \"flippant comment to a colleague\" as he believed the presenter, suggested as a potential reporter for Channel 4 Racing but never used, looked \"quite severe\" in the initial picture.</p><p>Eady suggested it was evidence that IMG was really concerned with obtaining \"young, more glamorous, sexier presenters to appeal to the young audience\"  but Fry said the company was simply trying to identify new talent.</p><p>It also emerged that IMG considered using the supermodel Erin O'Connor for a fashion segment on the show.</p><p>\"We were looking for a look that appealed to a younger and broader audience, but we were always of the view that the most important thing was to get the best people and the best presenters as they would be the ones who could educate this younger and broader audience,\" said Fry.</p><p>In his witness statement he said McCririck's betting coverage was \"difficult to follow, since it was very technical and was delivered in a loud, brash, aggressive and long-winded style which I considered to be over the top and distracting\".</p><p>He described the Channel 4 Racing team, before the revamp, as having an exclusivity that resembled \"a country club environment\".</p><p>The tribunal has previously heard that all the companies that registered bids to make the 2013 Channel 4 Racing programme scaled back – or axed completely – McCririck from their pitches. The pundit, who is seeking £3m in damages and wants his job back, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">claims that his on-screen persona was encouraged by Channel 4 and that the sole reason for his sacking is his age. </a></p><p>The hearing continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418991114|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|383e27333a6686ceaa5713d6c91a456b5f019d8c -->",

        "trailText":"Champion British racehorse trainer whose career was crowned by the success of Frankel",
        "headline":"Sir Henry Cecil obituary",
        "body":"<p>Sir Henry Cecil, who has died of cancer aged 70, was one of the most successful and popular racehorse trainers of the past century. His tally of 25 classic winners is unsurpassed since 1900, while his achievement in becoming champion trainer 10 times has been bettered only once. In 2012 his career was crowned by his training of the \"wonder horse\" Frankel, regarded by many as the best racehorse worldwide of the past 40 years. Frankel gave Cecil two of his record 75 Royal Ascot wins.</p><p>Cecil's effete, theatrical manner might have suggested an artistic lifestyle rather than a role in a competitive, cut-throat sport, but single-minded ambition enabled him to succeed. At his peak, in the 1980s, he trained 220 horses, in two stables, for many of the world's most distinguished owners, including Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum and Prince Khalid Abdullah. But his career was overshadowed and almost destroyed by a catalogue of controversies, personal catastrophes and social misjudgments.</p><p>His home and stables, at <a href=\"http://www.sirhenrycecil.com/\" title=\"\">Warren Place, Newmarket</a>, were acquired through his marriage in 1966 to Julie Murless, daughter of the legendary trainer Sir Noel Murless. They were a formidable team. In 1990 Cecil won his ninth trainer's title, but that season saw his life, and career, begin to unravel. His affair with and subsequent marriage to the former stable girl Natalie Payne, 24 years his junior, brought about the gradual disintegration of all that had been built up in the past 25 years.</p><p>Following their divorce, Julie set up her own training business elsewhere in Newmarket. Many of the most valued staff left Warren Place, some to join Julie, while many key owners, notably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/1999/jul/12/guardianobituaries.davidhadert\" title=\"\">Lord Howard de Walden</a>, moved their horses elsewhere. The hammer blow came in 1995 when Sheikh Mohammed removed his entire string, with thinly veiled comments indicating his dissatisfaction with the new Mrs Cecil's involvement. By 2005, by which time the second marriage had been dissolved, and Cecil's heavy drinking had led to a five-year drink-driving ban, he was training just 56 horses, 22 of which were owned by the ever-loyal Prince Khalid.</p><p>But Cecil never forfeited his popularity with the racing public and the last years of his life brought about a remarkable transformation in his fortunes.</p><p>Cecil was born in Aberdeen, with a twin brother, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1373863/David-Cecil.html\" title=\"\">David</a>. He also had two older brothers. Their mother, Rohays, was the daughter of a baronet, their father, also Henry, the younger brother of Lord Amherst of Hackney and a descendant of the earls of Exeter. Just two weeks before the twins' birth, their father was killed in action with the Parachute Regiment in North Africa.</p><p>The widowed Rohays moved from her family home, Crathes Castle near the banks of the River Dee, to Wickhambrook, near Newmarket, where her late husband had been given a house and farm by his brother. There she met the distinguished Irish-born racehorse trainer Captain Cecil Boyd-Rochfort, who had bought the Freemason Lodge stables in Newmarket 20 years earlier after a distinguished war in the Scots Guards, and whose success resulted in his appointment as royal trainer in 1943. Within the year, Rohays had married the 57-year-old bachelor, who became the boys' rather austere stepfather.</p><p>Despite his racing pedigree, and the immediate proximity of a successful racing stable, Cecil showed little interest in racing during his days at Canford school, Dorset. On leaving school, with no career in mind, the twins were sent by their stepfather to work in Lord Derby's Woodland Stud in Newmarket. This kindled their interest in the thoroughbred, and after work experience at studs in France and America, and an animal husbandry course at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, Henry became assistant trainer to his stepfather in November 1964.</p><p>Boyd-Rochfort had enjoyed 40 years of consistent success as a trainer, but the anatomy of day-to-day racing was changing, and he no longer trained the quality of horse to pursue his traditional agenda at the top meetings. In 1968 he retired and returned to Ireland and Henry took over what remained of his string at Freemason Lodge.</p><p>In his first year, adopting the attitude \"anywhere for a winner\", he sent his horses to race on courses unfamiliar to the Captain, and won 27 races, including the Eclipse Stakes and the Observer Gold Cup. But his stepfather sold Freemason Lodge at the end of 1969, and Cecil began the following season in a stable rented from the Jockey Club in Hamilton Road, Newmarket.</p><p>It was in the autumn of 1976 – his first year as a champion trainer – that he was able to buy Warren Place, and that December he moved with his family and horses to what would be (except for a period in 1990) his home and workplace for the rest of his life.</p><p>In 1979 his association with Joe Mercer enabled the veteran jockey to become champion for the first time, aged 45, and the following season the partnership won the St Leger with Light Cavalry. But that autumn, amid some mystery, the jockey \"resigned\" from his position, and Lester Piggott, who had ridden for Cecil's father-in-law in the 1960s, took over as stable jockey.</p><p>In the four years that followed, the duo were rarely far from the headlines. The new team got off to the best possible start, when Jim Joel's filly Fairy Footsteps won the 1981 1,000 Guineas. The following season Cecil was champion trainer for the fourth time, with record winnings of £872,614, and Piggott champion jockey for the 11th time, with his biggest total of wins (188) since 1966.</p><p>But in 1984 a scandal erupted over an unofficial payment contract, not registered with the Jockey Club, that Cecil attempted to arrange with his owners on Piggott's behalf. Cecil, always shy and sensitive beneath his self-effacing, dilettante exterior, found the complications of \"life with Piggott\" too much, and on 5 June that year it was announced that the American Steve Cauthen would ride for the stable the following season.</p><p>The next five years were perhaps the happiest and most successful of Cecil's career. There were his first two Derby wins, Slip Anchor (1985) and Reference Point (1987); Sheikh Mohammed's great filly Oh So Sharp's wins in the 1,000 Guineas, Oaks and St Leger; two other Oaks winners in Diminuendo (1988) and Snow Bride (1989); a win in the French Oaks with the grey filly Indian Skimmer; and a fourth St Leger success in 10 years with Michelozzo (1989). His delight in training winners at Warren Place was matched by his pleasure in showing off his rose garden, often for a charitable cause.</p><p>But then came the headlines of 1990, which revealed the marital split between the Cecils. There was another threat to his dominance in the trainers' ranks: his long-time rival and near-neighbour Michael Stoute, who won his third trainer's title the previous year, and was gradually becoming the trainer of choice for the top owners, notably Sheikh Mohammed.</p><p>Two more Derby winners were to follow for Cecil, Commander in Chief (1993) and Oath (1999), but the number of winners, and of horses in the yard, declined. After his remarkable total of 180 wins in 1987, by 1994 the tally had dropped to 76. He continued to enjoy Classic success with homebred fillies, and won the 1,000 Guineas three times in four years, and the Oaks four years out of five, in the late 90s. But by the early years of the new century the great days appeared to be over. By 2005, Cecil no longer featured among the top 50 trainers. Royal Ascot winners, once plentiful, were now a memory. His only financial option was to rent out Warren Place's spare boxes to other trainers.</p><p>After six barren years from 2000, he bounced back to the delight of his friends, with an eighth Oaks success in 2007. He developed stomach cancer in 2006. In the following years he stopped drinking; his stable strength reverted to 150; he married Jane McKeown; he was knighted in 2011 in the Queen's birthday honours; and in 2012 his 2,000 Guineas winner, Frankel, was hailed as one of the all-time greats. Frankel went on to retire unbeaten in 14 races, the last of which was the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October 2012. It was a fitting and emotional climax to Cecil's legendary career.</p><p>Frankel was assessed as the world's best racehorse since official ratings began in 1977 and retired to stud in the spring of this year. He covered 133 mares at a reported fee of £125,000, justifying his estimated value of £100m.</p><p>Cecil's courage throughout this period was remarkable. The ravages of chemotherapy and his difficulty in digesting food saw his weight plunge. Yet at 6am every day, he would brave the sharp East Anglian winds to watch his string galloping and to welcome his friends.</p><p>He is survived by Jane; a son, Noel, and daughter, Katie, from his first marriage; and a son, Jake, from his second.</p><p>• Henry Richard Amherst Cecil, racehorse trainer, born 11 January 1943; died 11 June 2013</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410525101|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|1aa155952b836cca0f45a5f194da56c388e022bb -->",

        "headline":"Kentucky Derby: who will win America's most famous race?",
        "body":"<p>There's something elemental about the Kentucky Derby that taps into the nation's psyche. Against the backdrop of Churchill Downs' iconic twin spires, the Derby is a race that stirs America's penchant for a ripping yarn in a theater of high-stakes drama. Every year, it seems, America's most recognizable race comes attached with a story gilt-edged for the headlines, good and bad.</p><p>Last year was the furore surrounding Doug O'Neill, trainer of the winner, I'll Have Another. Before I'll Have Another had time even to remove his garland of roses, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/sports/trainer-of-kentucky-derby-winner-has-a-troubled-record.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">the attention was swiftly diverted to O'Neill's litany of drug offenses that have blighted his training career</a>. Barbaro's stunning win in 2006 was a story of brilliance marred by tragedy when he broke down in the Preakness Stakes, his next race. Stories mined from further back include Secretariat's win in 1973 that catapulted him to triple-crown immortality. The headlines surrounding this year's renewal seem sterile in comparison – to this point, at least.</p><p>Much of the news generated thus far by the 2013 Kentucky Derby surrounds the new qualification system, an overhaul of the old formula that rewarded graded-stakes earnings – earnings accrued at any point in a horse's career. Without going into great detail, the old system recognized a horse's whole career over more recent efforts. To put it bluntly, your Derby contender could go from Pegasus to pit pony between two and three, and still enjoy a Derby berth at the expense of a horse who had shown the same generational transformation, only in reverse – or so the thinking went.</p><p>The revamped system is an attempt to rectify that problem. Under its new guise, Derby hopefuls are given a 36-race window of opportunity to qualify. The top four finishers in those races are awarded points on a sliding scale. Special emphasis and more points are given to certain races run during a 10-week period between February 23 and April 27 in a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately kind of deal.</p><p>The new system, however, has its share of detractors. But one gets the impression that the machinery of the revamped formula is going to be tinkered with before the greater portion of leading racing figures are satisfied or appeased, albeit somewhat. But that's for the future.</p><p>This year, the experiment is over, and the leading contenders have come to the fore. Here's a look at the horses with the likeliest chances on Saturday.</p><h2>Verrazano</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Todd Pletcher</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> John Velazquez</p><p><strong>Post position:</strong> 14</p><p><strong>Wood Memorial win:</strong></p><p><em></em></p><p>If this year's Kentucky Derby were the World Poker Championships, trainer Todd Pletcher would be holding a royal flush. Chief among his cabal of Churchill contenders is Verrazano, whose resum&eacute; is an immaculate read of four wins from four starts. He's a smashing-looking colt with a pedigree smeared with Derby-winning DNA. His win last time out in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct was in a race that has supplied four of the last 20 Derby winners. What is more, jockey John Velazquez picked Verrazano over Orb – a decision more indicative, however, of the Pletcher-Velazquez connection than anything else.</p><p>With so many ticks in so many boxes, one could understand if Verrazano<br />was being discussed in the same hallowed whispers reserved for potential mega-champs. But he's not. This is primarily due to his victory over Normandy Invasion in the Wood Memorial that was heavier on slog than superlatives. Verrazano should have dismissed the Wood field with disdain. He didn't. Afterwards, one couldn't help but feel cheated of a more authoritative display. There is also the question of experience. Throughout Verrazano's four-race career, he has avoided the hustle-and-bustle and mud splattering kick-back of a tightly packed field. He might take to it like a cat to napping – one would rather not wait until the big race to find out.</p><h2>Orb</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Shug McGaughey</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> Joel Rosario</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 16</p><p><strong>Florida Derby:</strong> </p><p><em></em></p><p>John Velazquez's reject is Joel Rosario's gain. And Rosario is a jockey on fire right now. Trainer Shug McGaughey's colt has shown fine improvement since his maiden win at Aqueduct last November. Since then, he's added an allowance win and a rallying victory in the Grade II Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park to his gold-medal haul. Then came Orb's scene-stealing performance in the Florida Derby, a race that has proven a springboard to Derby success to no less than five horses in the last 20 years.</p><p>Sitting in midfield, Orb took the lead a furlong from home before stretching clear of Itsmyluckyday, the horse who had defeated Shanghai Bobby the time prior. A horse hardened at the grindstone of tough graded stakes action, Orb possesses many of the qualities necessary to win at Churchill – tactical speed and unflinching stamina perhaps being his most valuable. If one were searching for an Achilles heel, it would be his temperament. He's a nervous, free-sweating sort. It hasn't proven a barrier to success thus far – it might do during the cauldron of the big race preliminaries. He's shown an improved disposition with each run, however. And a bullet workout Monday—four furlongs in 47.89sec—shows that he's in fine nick. So much so, Orb's now looks likely to go off favorite Saturday.</p><h2>Revolutionary</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Todd Pletcher</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> Calvin Borel</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 3</p><p><strong>Louisiana Derby:</strong></p><p><em></em></p><p>In Revolutionary, trainer Todd Pletcher has a worthy understudy to Verrazano. And like Orb, Revolutionary has been showing improved form all spring to suggest that, come Churchill Downs on Saturday, he'll be a potent force. He broke his maiden in December, after which he overcame a troubled trip in the Grade III Withers Stakes at Aqueduct in February. That day, he showed an Astaire-like fleet of foot that is satisfying to see in a potential Derby candidate. At Fair Grounds at the tail-end of March, he set out his Kentucky stall with a hard-fought win in the Grade II Louisiana Derby.</p><p>The last Derby winner to hail from the Louisiana showpiece was Grindstone, who needed every inch of the trip to prevail at Churchill in 1996. Revolutionary's win at Fair Grounds in 2013 showed similar stamina-laden attributes: after being headed a furlong from home, Revolutionary clawed back to overhaul Mylute on the wire. It was a gutsy win – guts by the bucket load is what is needed come Saturday. The form of the race is suspect, however. A neck defeat of Mylute leaves one wondering as opposed to won over: will Revolutionary improve enough to follow in Grindstone's rose petal strewn hoof-prints? A few eyebrows were raised when he only jogged Tuesday morning, but he's a light framed individual who needs only to be kept ticking over. One huge plus: his post position. Three-time Derby winning Jockey Calvin Borel has got his favored spot down by the rail in three.</p><h2>Goldencents</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Doug O'Neill</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> Kevin Krigger</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Santa Anita Derby:</strong></p><p><em></em></p><p>The similarities between Goldencents and last year's Derby champ, I'll Have Another, are there in stark relief: Same trainer in Doug O'Neill, the same Derby prep victory in the Grade I Santa Anita Derby.</p><p>Goldencent's win at Santa Anita dispelled in one minute and 48 seconds the doubts hovering over him following his defeat in the San Felipe the time prior. That day, he was snared in a speed duel up front with Flashback, only to weaken close home, a spent force. Back at the Californian track a month later and the result was vastly different.</p><p>Ridden more conservatively, Goldencents prevailed in convincing fashion against his San Felipe nemesis, Flashback. But the form of the race – of the west coast form in general –&nbsp;leaves one questioning whether Goldencents has shown enough to gift O'Neill a double-whammy of Derby victories. As is usually the case, the best three-year-old form leading into the Derby has been the preserve of the east-coasters. But Goldencents' winning time at Santa Anita was good, and in a well-worn racing maxim: he can only beat what's put before him. He's settled in well at Churchill this week and the O'Neill camp are bullish on his chances.</p><h2>Overanalyze</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Todd Pletcher</p><p><strong>Jockey</strong>: Rafael Bejarano</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 9</p><p><strong>Arkansas Derby:</strong> <br /><em></em></p><p>Another leading contender and another horse whose head hangs over the<br />webbings at the Todd Pletcher barn. Overanalyze's berth at Churchill<br />is due largely to a fine win in the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park<br />last time out. That day, he angled wide around a large field before<br />being sent to the lead a furlong from home. Once there, he was<br />extended to romp clear by a visually impressive four and a quarter<br />lengths.</p><p>Given the paucity of top-notch competition that day, Overanalyze<br />needed to win in convincing fashion to achieve two things: to be taken<br />seriously as a Derby contender and to dispel the specter of his<br />lifeless performance in the Gotham Stakes the time prior. He did just<br />that. As an added plus, his works leading into the race have been<br />electric. But compared to his stable mates who have exhibited<br />stronger, more consistent, form, one has to exercise just a little<br />more imagination to see him claim gold on Saturday.</p><h2>Java's War</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Kenny McPeek</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> Julien Leparoux</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 19</p><p><strong>Blue Grass Stakes:</strong></p><p><em></em></p><p>Up until the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland earlier this month, Java's<br />War had shown enough to suggest that he was a capable enough sort -<br />but a capable enough sort who lacked what was necessary to triumph at<br />Churchill. Three stake-race defeats were capped with a second place<br />finish in the Tampa Bay Derby to Verrazano. Trainer Kenny McPeek then sent Java's War to Keeneland.</p><p>In the Blue Grass, Java's War stumbled out of the gates, relegating<br />himself to the rear of the field for much of the way. There he<br />remained, the class dunce, until brought wide and set for home at the<br />top of the stretch. He soared, and nailed Palace Malice on the wire in<br />taking fashion. He didn't beat much that day – Palace Malice was<br />coming off a seventh place finish in the Louisiana Derby. It was the<br />manner of Java's War's victory, however, that suggests he's improved<br />considerably since the Tampa Bay Derby when Verrazano beat him by a<br />comfortable three lengths. Young horses in the spring are capable of<br />remarkable physical and mental maturation within a brief window of<br />time. It's quite possible that Java's War has matured enough give<br />Verrazano a much sterner test on Saturday. His wide draw over in 19 is<br /> a concern – it's a problem, but not an insurmountable one.</p><h2>Normandy Invasion</h2><p><strong>Trainer:</strong> Chad Brown</p><p><strong>Jockey:</strong> Javier Castellano</p><p><strong>PP:</strong> 5</p><p>Another of Verrazano's vanquished foes, Normandy Invasion, was the horse that gave Pletcher's star colt a tough time of it in the Wood Memorial. Prior to that race, Chad Brown's runner had shown only reasonable form in a couple of Grade Twos: the Risen Star Stakes at Fair Grounds and the Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct, neither of which suggested that Normandy Invasion was going to make Verrazano roll up his sleeves.</p><p>Like Java's War, one gets the impression that Normandy Invasion is on the up. Unlike Java's War, we haven't been privy to another racecourse appearance to be able to gauge by what degree he has improved. If he wins on Saturday, he joins Giacomo and Mine That Bird as horses that succeeded at Churchill after last-time-out defeats.</p><p><strong>Win:</strong> Orb</p><p><strong>Bigger priced outsider:</strong> Java's War</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/408234988|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|a65256d07b2ef8661bf30d20c43f2a5c632ef02e -->",

        "headline":"Sheikh Mohammed: the ruler with real horsepower",
        "body":"<p>A couple of years before he succeeded his brother as ruler of Dubai in 2006, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/sheikh-mohammed-bin-rashid-al-maktoum\" title=\"\">Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum</a>, never a man plagued by self-doubt, developed an idea to have some of his own poetry written on the sea of the Persian Gulf. The poetry would be in the form of man-made islands, constructed by thousands of the indentured migrant workers who form the bulk of Dubai's population, and on which Premier League footballers and the like might be encouraged to buy ocean-front real estate. It was imagined that the lines, written in Arabic in concrete and sand, would be large enough to be read from space.</p><p>In devising such a plan, you imagine that most world-class self-mythologisers might have been content with a single line of verse. It gives you a measure of Sheikh Mohammed's exaggerated sense of Xanadu that he decided on a whole stanza. \"<a href=\"http://shamelabboush.hubpages.com/hub/The-Ninth-Wonder-of-the-World\" title=\"\">Take wisdom from the wise</a>,\" the script would run. \"It takes a man of vision to write on water/ Not everyone who rides a horse is a jockey/ Great men rise to greater challenges.\"</p><p>In the end, despite property on the planned islands being sold out in advance, this was one of the few wild schemes that was never realised in Dubai's decade of outrageous construction. Other ocean-and-desert-defying projects were made – the Palm Resort of frond peninsulas, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_(archipelago)\" title=\"\">the World,</a> a mini globe of islands out at sea – not to mention the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, and mile upon mile of gravity-mocking condos, hotels and office blocks. In that time, the joke has gone that only three words have been required to make overnight building miracles a steel and glass reality: \"Sheikh Mohammed says…\"</p><p>This development programme was just one aspect of the diminutive 63-year-old's singular drive toward world domination. At the same time as he was impressing the soaring power of the Maktoum bloodline on the Gulf skyline, he was taking an autocrat's obsession with hereditary principles to extremes in the world of thoroughbred racing, pursued with trademark determination on five continents. Every man needs a hobby. Sheikh Mohammed's has involved the creation of the largest and most expensive stable of fast horses in human history.</p><p>In his own mind, the twin aspects of his brand, joint expression of his familial riches and power, have been intertwined. In his vision, Dubai, a place that now features the world's most opulent racecourse, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/jan/28/dubai-meydan-open-carnival-meeting\" title=\"\">Meydan</a>, built at a cost of $1.25bn in two years, has itself been sold as the ultimate winners' enclosure for newly globalised wealth.</p><p>Sooner or later, though, every myth-making dictator is met with a dose of reality. For Sheikh Mohammed, this came first with Dubai's post-credit crunch bust, which saw a collapse in property prices, a great many unfinished ego developments and the humiliating need for an up to $20bn bailout from \"Uncle Abu Dhabi\" in 2010, a debt still to be repaid. At the time, an authorised biography of the sheikh was due; the rumour goes that his refusal to countenance an epilogue detailing the lessons of his emirate's recession meant that the book never happened.</p><p>And if the property slump marked the outer limit of his civic ambition, then the events of the last two weeks at the headquarters of his racing operation, Godolphin, in Newmarket, have been a defining moment in his private obsession, another line in the sand.</p><p>The random dope testing of horses under control of his joint head trainer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/apr/25/mahmood-al-zarooni-godolphin-doping-scandal\" title=\"\">Mahmood al-Zarooni</a>, which identified the widescale use of banned anabolic steroids, most notably in the sample of the top-rated two-year-old filly in Europe, Certify, has been a personal humiliation for Sheikh Mohammed.</p><p>It was a measure of his shame at this exposure that he took the highly unusual step of including his apologetic statement about the events that led to al-Zarooni's ban from British racing for eight years on his official website, which generally is a spotless expression of his distinctive personality cult: poet, statesman, sportsman, visionary. In the statement, he once again explicitly linked his vision for Godolphin with his vision for Dubai: \"I was appalled and angered to learn that one of our stables has violated [the] ethical standards and the rules of British racing. I have been involved in British horse racing for 30 years and have deep respect for its traditions and rules. I built my country based on the same solid principles.\"</p><p></p><p></p><p>The determined conviction behind that dubious latter assertion – Sheikh Mohammed's formidably stubborn personality has helped him to prevail as a sometime champion in gruelling horse endurance races over 10 or more hours – seems to have been derived in his own mind from twin formative influences. The first was that of his father, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al Maktoum, the shrewd initiator of modern Dubai, who saw that the comparatively limited oil wealth that drove development would quickly dry up and that the future had to be made from tourism and commerce. Rashid was, as he frequently said, only one generation removed from the camel-driving roots of his family and he inculcated his sons with those values: they grew up in a compound with no electricity or running water and were encouraged to be hardened horsemen and hunters.</p><p>The contrasting pillar of Sheikh Mohammed's wisdom was gained at what his website grandly terms \"the Bell School of Languages at Cambridge University\", actually just an international language college, at which he gained his still slightly awkward grasp of English. It is claimed that his gift for literature arose in his years in the university town, but any reader of his poetry might guess that he spent much more of his time at Newmarket up the road; he saw his first 2,000 Guineas race in 1967 and was immediately hooked.</p><p>In the years since, he has not so much sought to reconcile these influences as to pursue both avidly. At home, he is his father's son. He has 23 \"acknowledged\" children, mostly with his \"senior wife\", Sheikha Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma al Maktoum, who lives in Jameel Palace and is never pictured in public. Despite the supreme decadence of his gold-plated, air-conditioned ambition for Dubai, built by armies of wretchedly paid workers from the Indian subcontinent, he likes to project himself as a simple soul: \"I need little from my world. My prayer mat and water bottle are in my car wherever I go, together with my work documents and my vision.\"</p><p>He is haphazardly generous – the lifestyles of all United Arab Emiratis are richly subsidised; they pay no taxes and are awarded a share of the principality's wealth. Despite this, he argues with more complacent branches of the family for the virtues of meritocracy, education and hard work. His development plan was largely one of divide and rule; desert land was parcelled up for cousins and acolytes, with the implicit instruction to \"do something to make Sheikh Mohammed proud\". Predictable insanity ensued.</p><p>The other half of his life, his summers at the Godolphin operation he runs with his brother Hamdan in Newmarket and at the comparable facility in Lexington, Kentucky, or at the Darley stud with its outposts in Australia, Japan and Ireland, is on different terms. He spends most of it with his \"racing wife\", Princess Haya, Oxford-educated daughter of the King of Jordan, with whom he has two young children, and who, as an Olympic show-jumper, shares his love of horses.</p><p>That love runs deep. Racing broadcaster <a href=\"http://www.broughscott.com/consultancy.asp\" title=\"\">Brough Scott</a>, a long-time acquaintance who helped the sheikh establish the <em>Racing Post</em>, believes he has been a fundamentally good thing for racing and hopes the current scandal will at least lead to established international standards of anti-doping legislation. Scott suggests the embarrassment was all the greater for Sheikh Mohammed since his trainer, al-Zarooni, was very much promoted as his protege. Even so, \"the benefits of his involvement in British racing outweigh any negatives enormously\", Scott suggests. \"They have supported racing in a huge way, in terms of its employment, its economy.\"</p><p>Thousands of residents of Lexington, Kentucky, whose mortgages have indirectly been paid, and children educated through the sheikh's largesse, would no doubt concur. Despite some suggestions that the scandal might tempt Sheikh Mohammed to retreat from the UK, off-the-record insiders suggest the opposite will be the case. He is nothing if not persistent. Anyone who believes otherwise might try the endurance test of his poetry, in which the race is always hard, as those verses that might have been written in the sea went on to suggest: \"At times even the wise and experienced&nbsp;are tormented with bewilderment, fear and delusions/ Determined we moved along unwaveringly buoyant, riding the earth's saddle and steering its reins.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407943406|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|789705bf6b16327961b1e9690adeb03297e14208 -->",

        "headline":"Horse-doping scandal rocks racing as trainer admits 'catastrophic error'",
        "body":"<p>Mahmood al-Zarooni, the trainer at the centre of a horse-doping scandal involving a favourite for one of Britain's most prestigious races, is \"co-operating fully\" with  investigators, the British Horseracing Authority said on Tuesday, after 11 horses trained by him tested positive for anabolic steroids.</p><p>The horses, trained by Zarooni at Moulton Paddocks just outside Newmarket, Suffolk, have been banned from competition after testing positive for anabolic steroids during an inspection of the stable by BHA investigators on 9 April. They include Certify, an unbeaten three-year-old filly, who would have been a leading contender for the 1,000 Guineas, one of Britain's five Classics, on 5 May but will now be forced to miss the race. Formal charges against Zarooni are due to be made Wednesday.</p><p>Leading bookmakers including Ladbrokes, Coral and William Hill have agreed to refund bets placed on Certify prior to her ban from competition.</p><p>Zarooni, 37, trains about 150 horses at Moulton Paddocks, all of which are owned by Godolphin, part of the bloodstock operation of Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. The sheikh, whose passion for racing dates back to visits to Newmarket while studying at Cambridge in the 1960s, has invested hundreds of millions of pounds in Godolphin since its foundation in 1994, and seen its colours carried to success in dozens of significant races.</p><p>Zarooni, who joined Godolphin as one of its two principal trainers in March 2010, has sent out the winners of two British Classics. Blue Bunting, a 16-1 chance, took the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May 2011, while Encke, another outsider at 25-1, won the St Leger at Doncaster in September 2012. He also trained Monterosso to win the Dubai World Cup, the most valuable event in the sport with a first prize of $6m (£4m), in March 2012.</p><p>Zarooni is all but certain to be banned from racing for several years when he appears before the BHA's disciplinary committee, probably within the next two weeks. The authority is keen to resolve the case quickly to remove uncertainty from betting markets, and Zarooni has admitted the administration of performance-enhancing drugs, saying it was a \"catastrophic error\" on his part.</p><p>While punishment may be swift for Zarooni, however, the sense of astonishment, and even betrayal, that his actions have caused will persist in racing for many months to come. Positive tests for anabolic steroids after a horse has run in a race are all but unknown, although Howard Johnson, a leading National Hunt trainer, was banned from the sport in 2010 after evidence that steroids had been used in his stable emerged in paperwork found in his office.</p><p>Steroids are still viewed as a constant and significant threat to racing's integrity, however, because the effects of their use, such as an increase in lean muscle mass, can persist after the substance has left the horse's system. In a sport in which results can be decided by a nose – about 1cm – the unfair advantage that a horse might gain could be worth many thousands of pounds.</p><p>\"It is, without doubt, a performance-enhancing drug,\" said James Given, a vet who runs a racing yard in Yorkshire. \"It's not just active while the drug is in the body, and certainly many of these drugs will persist in the body for several months, but it's the effect on the muscle development beyond its natural capacity.\"</p><p>In Newmarket, the centre of British Flat racing since King Charles II instituted regular race meetings in the 1660s, the anger at Zarooni's actions runs deep in the tight-knit racing community.</p><p>\"It's just hideously disappointing,\" one resident of the town with close ties to a racing stable said on Tuesday. \"We've just finished defending the Grand National, and now we've got to defend ourselves against this.</p><p>\"It's bad for the sport, it's bad for the horses and bad for those who play by the rules. It's cheating, but it's also sickening from the horse welfare perspective. We know what these things do to humans, and it's just not right, full stop.\"</p><p>Zarooni's sole entry in a race in Britain on Tuesday was declared a non-runner a few hours before the race, but he has two horses entered to race at Wolverhampton  and six possible runners – including a filly called Controversy – on Friday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407723807|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|fc36c1cd95102b42d1e6ad307f32ccb83b696256 -->",

        "standfirst":"The Jockey Club has released footage of an artist's impression of how a new stand at Cheltenham Racecourse will look. The development includes a new royal box, balconies along the length of the stand's rear allowing them to look down on the paddock area and the site will be approached by a sweeping walkway that crosses over the route which runners take to the track. Both measures are intended to greatly increase the number of spectators who can assess the animals before each race",

Americain was 11th and Dunaden 14th.</p><p>Americain was ridden by Australian jockey Damien Oliver, who has been implicated in a scandal involving large bets the veteran rider placed on a rival horse in a race two years ago.</p><p>Green Moon paid $20.80 (£13) to win and the trifecta for the leading three horses $51,177 (£32,007) on the Victoria state betting agency.</p><p>Fiorente was the third Cup runner-up for leading Sydney trainer Gai Waterhouse, who is still yet to win Australia's biggest race. She previously trained Te Akau Nick (1993) and Nothin' Leica Dane (1995) to runner-up placings.</p><p>Irish galloper Jakkalberry was a further 1-1/4 lengths away in third.</p><p>Prebble said Green Moon, handled by local trainer Robert Hickmott, got a \"severe check\" about 250 metres from the start which put him on the fence.</p><p>\"But he's a quality horse, and I put it to him on the straightening,\" said Prebble. \"I was very confident they weren't going to pick him up he ran all the way through to the wire.\"</p><p>Two weeks ago, Green Moon started as favourite in the Cox Plate, Australia's richest weight-for-age race, but finished seventh, accounting for his generous odds on Tuesday.</p><p>Williams is a former business partner of one of Australia's richest men, Kerry Packer, and once owned Melbourne's Crown Casino. Now a property developer, Williams has been in poor health in recent years and was not at Flemington on Tuesday to watch the race.</p><p>\"He puts a lot into racing and he's a very good supporter of mine,\" Prebble said of Williams.</p><p>\"He's never here. He's going to be at home enjoying it. It's lovely.\"</p><p>Williams's son Nick was ecstatic after accepting the trophy from Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Charles and Camilla were among the crowd of more than 100,000 at Flemington in inner western Melbourne.</p><p>\"We put a lot of money in and a heck of a lot of effort so to get this result today is terrific,\" Nick Williams said. \"God bless everyone who wrote him off.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/398887710|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|7ffa203f06d09ed60578f779f827cbfbdbb5efde -->",

        "headline":"Ascot crowds cheer on Frankel as world's best ever horse exits to make £100m at stud",
        "body":"<p>It was still dark when Sir Henry Cecil peered nervously out of the window on Saturday morning. When you've been in the game as long as he has, you develop a sense of what to expect, even before your eyes have time to adjust. There had been rain, but just a few spots, nothing to derail a day that he had been building up to for five decades – 43 years to be exact – of nurturing exceptional racehorses.</p><p>Yesterday afternoon, on damp, sludgy ground at Ascot (technically: \"soft, heavy in places\"), the 69-year-old Cecil watched the final race of Frankel, the once-in-a-lifetime thoroughbred he trains. There was excruciating tension – for Cecil, for the 32,000 sell-out crowd, for millions at home and in betting shops – but as usual Frankel was the coolest head on the course and streaked home to win by two lengths.</p><p>It is a mark of Frankel's dominance of Flat (as opposed to jump) racing that his greatest challenge was always going to be meteorological. Since his maiden run at Newmarket in August 2010, the four-year-old was unbeaten in 13 races coming into Ascot's Qipco Champion Stakes, and commonly thought to be unbeatable. The only question was how he would cope running a mile and a quarter through sodden turf, but no one was too surprised that his devastating finishing explosion – when each stride swallows 22ft and he tops 40mph – was gloriously unaffected.</p><p>Before the race, the horse – deep mahogany with a star on its forehead and four white socks – was expected to be challenged by the French gelding Cirrus Des Aigles, known to like the heavy stuff. But, after a poor start, he won almost without breaking sweat. As they entered the winner's enclosure, Frankel's jockey, Tom Queally, punched the air and roared with delight.</p><p>Their prize was £737,230, a share of the richest purse in British horseracing. This added to the £2,261,072 Frankel had already brought home for his owner Khalid Abdullah, a Saudi Arabian prince. Even these figures are mere oats and carrots compared with the riches that the colt will soon be earning for Prince Khalid in retirement, as the world's most desirable stallion. The exact stud fee has not been set yet but experts suggest it could be exorbitant. He would be expected to cover between 140 and 200 mares each year, leading to a valuation of £100m. Not bad, considering there is no guarantee that any offspring will inherit Frankel's obscene acceleration.</p><p>But the appeal of Frankel has never been about money. The reason Ascot was so rammed, the grandstands full with sharp suits and extravagant plumages on an overcast afternoon, was the chance to watch history. To say you had watched a horse who will now be mentioned in the same breath as Mill Reef and Dancing Brave. One spectator, Kelsey Padjen, had painted her nails in turquoise with a pink sash, to match Frankel's colours. The Queen came to see her horse Carlton House in an earlier race, but no doubt had half an eye on the main event.</p><p>\"Frankel's the most extraordinary horse I've seen,\" said the broadcaster Clare Balding, whose father had trained the great Mill Reef. \"What makes him so special is the efficiency of his stride, his power. But more than that, it's what he does inside you – how he wins races. He's so exciting, he makes the other horses look ordinary. He's what I call 'a jaw-dropper' – you watch him and your mouth falls open.\"</p><p>At the winning post yesterday, there was extra goodwill for Cecil, one of the most popular figures in British racing. In the mid-2000s, his career looked stuck in a downward spiral, as he struggled to cope with the death of his twin brother, the break-up of his second marriage and his heavy drinking. Then in 2006, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He defeated that, but he is undergoing chemotherapy for another cancer, this time in his stomach. He looked frail in a three-piece suit and brown trilby yesterday on Saturday, but he is adamant that he has no plans to retire along with Frankel.</p><p>Last week, Cecil said: \"There will be a tear in my eye after his final race, because I don't expect to ever see another like him. But I can't quit, never. I have a family to support and feel I have a few more years left in me.\"</p><p>Even the bookies entered into the spirit yesterday. In a natty pinstripe blazer, Big Jim, from Betting With Big Jim, attempted to lure punters by saying that he would pay out as if Frankel was not in the race – that is, it was a foregone conclusion who would win, so this would at least keep it interesting. \"Better rates than you'd get at RBS,\" he promised. \"More guaranteed than RBS, too!\"</p><p>\"Every sport needs heroes, and that's what Frankel is,\" said Big Jim. \"He's not been great for the bookies, to be honest, but he's brilliant to watch. We're going to miss him.\"</p><p>In fact, Frankel has been so much better than his rivals that neither punters nor bookies have profited much from his success. After all, where's the gamble if you know who is going to win? He has been odds-on in all his races, apart from his debut: if you had staked £1 on each of his 13 victories, you would have been just £5.78 richer. For the Qipco Champion Stakes his odds were a miserly 2-11. For the casual flutterer, the winnings would not even cover the petrol to the betting shop.</p><p>There was another farewell yesterday as the BBC ended its association with Flat racing and Ascot, a relationship that goes back 61 years. For the next four years at least, all the major meetings – including the Grand National, the Derby, Royal Ascot and the Cheltenham Festival – will be screened on Channel 4. It would have been a small consolation for the corporation that the BBC era ended at the same time as the career of the greatest Flat racehorse of our times.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/398107649|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|d490c6856f28ded6926e9e79e408b445dcd19b71 -->",

        "body":"<p>The number of racehorses destroyed in the UK's abattoirs has more than doubled over the last year, triggering calls from animal rights groups for the racing industry to do more to help thoroughbreds once their racing careers are over.</p><p>The rise comes as charities warn that the recession is having an effect on the welfare of all types of horses and ponies, with many owners struggling to pay for the upkeep of their animals.</p><p>Yesterday's Epsom Derby, attended by an estimated 200,000 racegoers, proved the continuing popularity of horse racing. But critics say not enough money generated by the industry is being allocated for the welfare of thoroughbreds after their racing careers have finished.</p><p>A report by the British Horseracing Authority says that in 2011 the number of thoroughbreds reported dead to the horse passport issuing authority rose by 29%, from 1,994 in 2010 to 2,574.</p><p>The report, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:cRPrHTqmxg0J:www.britishhorseracing.com/resources/equine-science-and-welfare/new_recession.pdf+Effect+of+the+recession+on+the+welfare+of+British+thoroughbred+horses+2011+update&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi22Xc2xi-Xoz7vLKKahf51I89VeCNUn_H5-do2q9XmO9BkI8sKSb2gqFAVHY7GSgJYFvNNzwNSpJNPgkIFzNa3tIjPF2qOMTy8t_0czgAs3JRE12zKnlTyqx3eLx4NTiXanjlO&amp;sig=AHIEtbQ6TMDSd4BIkWRn9_mgOAJSNieBXw\" title=\"\">The Effect of the recession on the welfare of British Thoroughbred Horses</a>, notes: \"Of these, 1,127 horses either in training, breeding or out of training were reported as killed in abattoirs, from 499 horses in 2010, an increase of 126%.\"</p><p>Dene Stansall, horse racing consultant at Animal Aid, a charity that campaigns against horse racing, described the report's figures as disturbing. \"They [the horse racing authority] have not got to grips with the problem,\" he said. \"For years more horses have been bred than have been needed.\"</p><p>But Professor Tim Morris, director of equine science and welfare at the authority, said the figures should be seen in the context of the 1 million horses on the UK's equine database.  \"While a 126% increase may sound a lot, in absolute terms it's not a big number,\" Morris said, pointing out that the industry was heavily regulated so that the welfare of its animals was often to a higher standard than that afforded other types of horses and ponies.</p><p>\"To solve this problem we've got to stop breeding so many, and then we won't have to put so many down,\" said Carrie Humble, an independent equine welfare consultant. \"But I would rather see these overproduced horses dead than suffering.\"</p><p>Morris said the industry had taken steps to reduce the number of horses entering racing to ensure there was not an oversupply of thoroughbreds during the economic downturn.</p><p>The authority report notes: \"From 2008 to 2011 there has been an overall reduction of 38% in foals registered (falls of 45% in Ireland and 24% in Great Britain).\"</p><p>But Stansall questioned whether the trend would continue downwards: \"Whilst the supply has gone down, as soon as the economy picks up it will rise again.\" Stansall said that, as many racehorses were owned by syndicates, it made it difficult to determine who should take responsibility for the horse's future welfare after it had finished racing.</p><p>\"If you've got a racehorse you have to commit to that animal,\" he said, pointing out it often took a couple of years to calm the horse down so that it could be ridden by non-jockeys.</p><p>The disposal of horses in UK abattoirs is part of a wider European trend. The number of horses slaughtered at DAFF (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) abattoirs in Ireland rose from 3,220 in 2009 to 7,296 in 2010.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391056104|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|0a1b7b320cd3bb41a31e6e3d0f8980f252eea55b -->",

        "body":"<p>Campaigners are calling for a betting boycott of next weekend's Grand National, as latest figures reveal the death toll on Britain's racecourses.</p><p>Animal Aid has launched a Sanctuary Not Cruelty campaign, appealing to people to send money they might have put on the race to a horse sanctuary instead.</p><p>At least 23 horses died as a result of injuries on racecourses in March alone, with five animals dying in the first two days of the Cheltenham festival.</p><p>The death last week of Fox Hunt, a winner at Royal Ascot, caused an outcry <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/mar/31/dubai-world-cup-deaths-gold-cup\" title=\"\">at the Dubai Gold Cup</a>. The race was stopped after Fox Hunt broke a leg and collapsed during the running but was then re-scheduled for later in the day, when a further two horses were fatally injured.</p><p>There was huge controversy at last year's Grand National, when two horses died as a result of falls and Jason Maguire, the rider of the winning horse, Ballabriggs, received a five-day suspension for using his whip with excessive frequency.</p><p>Animal Aid spokesperson Fiona Pereira said: \"We are asking the public to remember how they felt about the 2011 race and to donate their usual 'flutter' to our two specially selected sanctuaries, both of which require funding to rescue horses in need – including ex-racehorses.</p><p>\"As well as individuals, we hope that company sweepstakes will support our initiative. Helping racehorses in their retirement is particularly important. It's one of horse racing's darkest secrets that many thoroughbreds face neglect or are slaughtered for meat when their racing careers are over or they are deemed financially unviable.\"</p><p>There have been changes to two fences at Aintree, near Liverpool, ahead of Saturday's race. From a field of 40 horses, only 19 finished the race in 2011. Twenty horses have died as a result of competing in the Grand National since 2000.</p><p>Television and radio commentators were criticised at the time for ignoring the falls as the race continued, with one BBC commentator only referring to the fatalities by calling the body of a dead horse \"an obstacle\".</p><p>This year television companies have also been targeted in the Animal Aid campaign, which calls on commentators to properly report on, and investigate, any deaths during this year's Grand National.</p><p>\"They seem to think they have to be sensitive for the viewer, but people do need to know what's going on on that course,\" said Dene Stansall, the grandson of an Aintree bookie who now keeps the country's only record of racehorse deaths for Animal Aid.</p><p>\"Racing is not unlike being in the army for horses,\" said Stansall. \"They're fed, kept fit and looked after, some even love it, but there is an ever-present risk.</p><p>\"That is a risk of dying. Unfortunately horses aren't given a choice.\"</p><p>Dr Mark Kennedy, senior lecturer in animal welfare at Anglia Ruskin University, says risk in horse racing has to be tackled by the industry. He said the five deaths at Cheltenham were a reminder of the high risk horses are exposed to in steeplechasing and hurdling.</p><p>\"In large meetings with more than 500 starts, such as the Cheltenham and Grand National meetings, we can expect two to three horses to die over the course of the meetings. These are not freak accidents; they are the predictable outcome of running horses at this level of risk.</p><p>\"I sincerely believe the vast majority of those involved in racing genuinely and deeply care about their horses and hate to see them injured or killed,\" he said. \"I do not suggest that I, or anyone else, have any right to demand a ban on jump racing. But I do believe we should clearly assess, acknowledge and discuss the risk horses are exposed to. If the risk is unacceptably high, we have to consider whether it is right to expose horses to risk of this magnitude.\"</p><p>Julian Thick, the managing director of Aintree, said: \"Aintree is racing's shop window. It's a national treasure, a national institution and very much in our national psyche.</p><p>\"We're very open about the risk, there is a risk in all sports and we never stand still on safety. This year we have put together a package of changes which will be very good for the race. This year is the 165th running. Last year we had a record 8.8 million people watching and 153,000 through the racecourse over the Grand National weekend.</p><p>\"They come to see a sport which is exciting and unpredictable.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/388432130|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|066af0f3551ace2bb53c55c13a67b51e105e25a2 -->",
