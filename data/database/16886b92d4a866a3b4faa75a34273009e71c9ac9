        "body":"<p>The UK is one of best places to live and work, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, although income inequality has risen by more than in other countries since the global financial crisis struck in 2007.</p><p>The Paris-based thinktank has been seeking to measure wellbeing for the 34 nations of the OECD, based on aspects of life such as incomes, education, housing and security. It says the UK ranks above the OECD country average on environmental quality, personal security, jobs and earnings and housing among other measures. It is close to average for work-life balance, but below in education and skills.</p><p>That puts the UK alongside Switzerland, Australia, Nordic European countries, Canada and New Zealand in a clutch of highest-performing countries on the latest work for the OECD's <a href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\" title=\"\">Better Life Index</a>.</p><p>The thinktank's &quot;traffic light&quot; system for how countries perform on various elements ranks the US, Ireland, Germany and France as average. Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Estonia, Hungary, Greece and Chile are among the countries with a relatively low performance.</p><p>Overall, the latest part of the OECD's attempt to find new ways to measure wellbeing beyond simple GDP numbers, paints a picture of substantial pain caused by the financial crisis.</p><p>The average British household was only &quot;modestly&quot; affected, said the OECD, but looking across its club of mostly rich nations many people were blighted by higher unemployment, involuntary part-time work, financial insecurity and poverty.</p><p>&quot;Life satisfaction and confidence in institutions declined substantially in countries severely hit by the crisis, while people reported soaring stress levels,&quot; the How's Life 2013 report says.</p><p>&quot;However, there was little or no change in health outcomes for the population at large.&quot;</p><p>Looking at the UK, the OECD says that over 2007 to 2011 there was a cumulative increase in real household disposable income of around 1%, while in the euro area, income dropped by 2%.</p><p>However, income inequality increased by more than average in the UK over that period.</p><p>The report adds: &quot;In the OECD as a whole, the poor employment situation had a major impact on life satisfaction. This trend is not visible in the United Kingdom where, from 2007 to 2012, the percentage of British people declaring being very satisfied with their lives increased from 63% to 64%.&quot;</p><p>In OECD countries most severly hit by the crisis, people's trust in institutions and in the way democracy works had also declined during the crisis. But the percentage of British people reporting that they trust the government increased from 36% to 47% between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>Looking at gender gaps in OECD countries, the research found British women were still less likely than men to have a paid job or be elected to parliament, and more likely to spend many hours performing household tasks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680273|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|96320a50955dde6257e30e0ddf046fd1208e075a -->",

        "body":"<p>Migrants coming to the UK since the year 2000 have been less likely to receive benefits or use social housing than people already living in the country, according to a study that argues the new arrivals have made a net contribution of &pound;25bn to public finances.</p> <p>People from European Economic Area countries have been the most likely to make a positive contribution, paying about 34% more in taxes than they received in benefits over the 10 years from 2001 to 2011, according to the findings from University College London's migration research unit. Other immigrants paid about 2% more than they received.</p> <p>Recent immigrants were 45% less likely to receive state benefits or tax credits than people native to the UK and 3% less likely to live in social housing, says the report written by Professor Christian Dustmann and Dr Tommaso Frattini.</p> <p>But going back further to 1995, the study found that non-EEA immigrants arriving between that year and 2011 had claimed more in benefits than they paid in taxes, mainly because they had more children than people already living in Britain.</p> <p>The academics also found that recent immigrants from the EEA &ndash;&nbsp;the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein &ndash;&nbsp;participated more in the labour market. Their study was based predominantly on official reports including the British Labour Force Survey as well as tax data and public expenditure statistics. The EEA immigrants were also more likely to have a university degree than British people.</p> <p>Dustmann said: \"Our research shows that in contrast with most other European countries, the UK attracts highly educated and skilled immigrants from within the EEA as well as from outside. What&rsquo;s more, immigrants who arrived since 2000 have made a very sizeable net fiscal contribution and therefore helped to reduce the fiscal burden on UK-born workers.</p> <p>\"Our study also suggests that over the last decade or so the UK has benefitted fiscally from immigrants from EEA countries, who have put in considerably more in taxes and contributions than they received in benefits and transfers.</p> <p>\"Given this evidence, claims about 'benefit tourism' by EEA immigrants seem to be disconnected from reality.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile a discussion paper published online by Professor John Salt and Dr Janet Dobson, also from UCL's migration research unit, argued the government's target to cut net migration to the UK to the tens of thousands by 2015 is \"neither a useful tool nor a measure of policy effectiveness\". The pair looked at progress towards the target since the coalition government was formed in 2010.</p> <p>In its most recent figures the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed a net flow of 176,000 migrants into the UK in the year to December 2012, up from 153,000 in the year to September 2012, ending five consecutive quarters of decline.</p> <p>In the paper the authors say: \"We have serious doubts that the net migration target is either a useful tool or a measure of policy effectiveness and we believe that recent experience provides a number of lessons for future migration policy, both in the UK and internationally.\"</p> <p>Net migration to the UK is calculated as the difference between the number of people entering the country and the number leaving. The target applies to all immigrants and emigrants, including British citizens and those from other countries in the EEA.</p> <p>The government has focused its policies almost entirely on non-EEA citizens, the paper says, making big cuts in highly skilled immigrants and foreign students. It adds: \"It is not clear what happens next &ndash; where further cuts would come from, what policies would be needed to maintain a net inflow below 100,000 or what happens if an improving economy requires more skilled labour.\"</p> <p>The paper argues that damage has already been done by actions to cut work-related, student and family migration, harming the UK's reputation as a good place to work and study. \"Too much of the debate about international migration in the UK is about 'immigrants' as an undifferentiated group, without getting to grips with who 'they' are, why they come, the jobs they do, the contribution they make and the length of time they stay.</p> <p>\"And there is almost no reference to the fact that international migration is a two-way street, involving British as well as non-British citizens, which is what net migration is all about.</p> <p>\"The flow of people out of the country is vital to achieving the target and is something over which the government has much less influence.\"</p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"We are building an immigration system that works in the national interest, with net migration down by a third since its peak in 2010.</p> <p>\"We have tightened immigration routes where abuse was rife while still encouraging the brightest and best to come here to study and work, but more needs to be done.</p> <p>\"This is why the immigration bill will prevent migrants from using public services which they are not entitled to and reduce the factors which draw people to the UK.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421672843|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|c536ff37d13c294abc8e79a1f27dd1d4d8426377 -->",

        "headline":"Paxman: Brand was right over public's disgust at 'tawdry pretences' of politics",
        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/27/jeremy-paxmans-greatest-clips\" title=\"\">once asked Michael Howard the same question 12 times</a> and questioned Tony Blair if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/27/jeremy-paxmans-greatest-clips\" title=\"\">he was familiar with Megaboobs and Horny Housewives magazines</a>. Now the Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, famous for giving ruthlessly short shrift to politicians, has confirmed that his irascible on-screen attitude towards Westminster is more than skin deep.</p><p>The rottweiler figurehead of the BBC2 programme gave both barrels to all three main parties in a no-holds-barred column in the Radio Times published on Tuesday.</p><p>The presenter, 63, revealed he once did not vote because the choices were so \"unappetising\" and said politicians' burning desire to order people about was \"one of the many reasons they are so odd\".</p><p>\"At the next election we shall have a choice between the people who've given us five years of austerity, the people who left us this mess, and the people who signed public pledges that they wouldn't raise student fees, and then did so – the most blatant lie in recent political history,\" wrote Paxman.</p><p>\"It won't be a bombshell if very large numbers of the electorate simply don't bother to vote. People are sick of the tawdry pretences,\" said the presenter who dubbed the \"whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster … a remote and self-important echo-chamber\".</p><p>Paxman's withering critique followed his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\" title=\"\">much-discussed Newsnight interview with Russell Brand last week</a>. The 10-minute encounter, in which Paxman upbraided the comedian because he \"can't be arsed to vote\", became an unlikely YouTube hit, with 10 million views – nearly 20 times Newsnight's average audience.</p><p>But despite his criticism of Brand for never voting, Paxman confessed he too had once failed to vote in an election. \"I think part of Russell Brand's diagnosis is right. There is a huge sense of disillusion out there,\" he said.</p><p>\"Russell Brand has never voted, because he finds the process irrelevant. I can understand that: the whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster looks a remote and self-important echo chamber. But it is all we have. In one recent election, I decided not to vote, because I thought the choice so unappetising.</p><p>\"By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write 'none of the above' on a ballot paper – disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.\"</p><p>He warned: \"We ignore the democratic process at our peril … People died for the right to choose their government, because otherwise power is wielded by the rich and strong for the benefit of the rich and strong.</p><p>\"Whether you bother to vote or not, someone is going to sit on those benches and tell you what to do.\"</p><p>Recent Newsnight guests to have been \"Paxoed\" include Tory MP Chloe Smith, when she was economic secretary to the Treasury last year, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/sep/29/jeremy-paxman-european-commission\" title=\"\">Amadeu Altafaj-Tardio, a European commission spokesman who walked off the show after Paxman called him \"Mr Idiot\"</a>.</p><p>Paxman, who will complete 25 years on the programme next year, admitted he had low expectations of Brand, whom he interviewed on the show after the comedian guest-edited the New Statesman.</p><h2>'Spawn of the devil'</h2><p>\"A multimillionaire with a house in California talking about the need to take from the rich and give to the poor. That is – what's the word? – rich,\" said Paxman.</p><p>\"But we really ought to admit it, Daily Mail columnists may think Russell Brand the spawn of the devil. But there is something irresistible about him. The energy, the loquacity, the camp manner, the apparent frankness. He stands squarely in the British tradition of cheeky chappies.\"</p><p>He added: \"He [Brand] thinks the wrong people are in charge. Well, perhaps they are. But the people in charge are always people who want to be in charge … I have no burning desire to order people about. Politicians do; that is one of the many reasons they are so odd.\"</p><p>The BBC traditionally frowns on its presenters, especially those in BBC News, using columns to comment on news and current affairs. Strict guidelines were introduced 10 years ago after several controversies caused by corporation presenters and journalists speaking out in newspapers and magazines.</p><p>Days after the Tory party chairman, Grant Shapps, complained about a lack of \"fairness\" in the BBC's reporting, Paxman appeared to be equally dismissive of all three parties.</p><p>The BBC declined to comment on Paxman's statements.</p><p>In last week's Newsnight interview, Brand asked Paxman: \"Aren't you bored, aren't you more bored than anyone? Ain't you been talking to [politicians] year after year, listening to their lies, their nonsense, then it's this one gets in, that one gets in, but the problem continues? Why are we going to continue to contribute to that facade?\"</p><p>Brand, it appears, may have been closer to the truth than he realised.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421642267|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|34d35621aa4d1fe95b85bcb6af77bf726b1131eb -->",

        "body":"<p>Congolese rebels have surrendered  after a 20-month uprising, offering the best hope of peace for years in the country's war-ravaged east.</p><p>The M23 rebel group declared a ceasefire and said it was ready to disarm and demobilise troops and pursue a political solution to end the crisis.</p><p>\"The chief of general staff and the commanders of all major units are requested to prepare troops for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration on terms to be agreed with the government of Congo,\" the M23 leader, Bertrand Bisimwa, said.</p><p>The announcement came hours after Democratic Republic of the Congo government forces drove the rebel fighters out of their  two remaining strongholds. \"Tshanzu and Runyoni were taken by the army around 3am,\" government spokesman Lambert Mende told Reuters. \"Many M23 fighters are surrendering. Militarily this is finished.\"</p><p>The Kinshasa government expects peace talks mediated by neighbouring Uganda to resume soon, Mende added.</p><p>Al-Jazeera showed pictures of  M23 military leader General Sultani Makenga's abandoned home in the village of Chanzu and quoted witnesses saying  he had fled to neighbouring Rwanda.</p><p>The M23 is made up of fighters who deserted the Congolese army in April 2012 following a mutiny. Its name <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20438531\" title=\"\">is a reference to a 23 March 2009 peace deal</a>  the CNDP militia accused the Congolese government of betraying. Eight hundred thousand people have fled their homes since the insurgency began.</p><p>The rebels' capitulation marks a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/world/africa/a-reason-for-hope-in-congos-perpetual-war.html\" title=\"\">dramatic turnaround</a>. Less than a year ago they marched into and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/20/congo-rebel-m23-take-goma\" title=\"\">captured the major eastern city of Goma</a> and bragged  they were ready to march on the capital. UN peacekeepers were passive spectators and the Congolese army descended into a drunken, defeated shambles.</p><p>But the lightning reversal appears to be a vindication of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/05/un-force-democratic-republic-congo\" title=\"\">UN decision to create its first fighting force with a mandate to go on the offensive</a>. Tanks and helicopters from the 3,000-strong UN intervention brigade have supported a reorganised, better paid and more disciplined Congolese army in the recent advances.</p><p>Perhaps most crucially of all, the backing that the M23 received from neighbouring Rwanda has virtually dried up in recent months, <a href=\"http://congosiasa.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/as-m23-nears-defeat-more-questions-than.html\" title=\"\">regional analyst Jason Stearns blogged last week</a>. \"According to several reports from the frontlines, despite indications of some cross-border support in the Kibumba area, the M23 was largely left to its own devices,\" Stearns wrote. \"'The Rwandans just wouldn't pick up their phone calls,' one source close to the M23 leadership told me.\"</p><p>Rwanda has always denied the charge made by the UN's group of experts that it was providing military and logistical support to the M23.</p><p>African leaders meeting in Pretoria, South Africa, congratulated Congolese government forces and the UN peace enforcement mission in eastern Congo for \"recapturing M23 strongholds and restoring government control\". Kabila was present at the meeting but the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, sent his foreign minister.</p><p>Conflict in eastern Congo goes back two decades to the Rwandan genocide and has claimed millions of lives,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/16/congo\" title=\"\"> earning the label \"Africa's first world war\"</a>.  The collapse of the M23 marks a hopeful breakthrough but numerous other armed groups continue to operate in the vast area.</p><p>Russell Feingold, US special envoy to the Congo and the Great Lakes region, told a briefing in Pretoria: \"In a region that has suffered so much, this is obviously a significant positive step in the right direction.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421684474|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|fd9b0bfae3492c2bc5b583f4f6bc6822b0aded97 -->",

        "body":"<p>Payday lender Wonga has defended its record ahead of an expected grilling by MPs on Tuesday.</p><p>The company's chief operating officer, Niall Wass, warned against \"jumping to conclusions\" about his company, which has come under fire over the way it treats customers.</p><p>\"I am not sitting here today saying that everything we do is perfect; what we are trying to do is use great technology to give a really fair, transparent service to customers,\" he said in an interview with ITV News at 10.</p><p>Wass challenged the Archbishop of Canterbury,  Justin Welby, who has criticised  payday loan companies, to use Wonga services.</p><p>\"What I am asking him and others to do – go use the service, see if you think it is fair and transparent. Take out £30 for 10 days, pay it back after a week and then judge us by our customers,\" he said.</p><p>His remarks came as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/wonga-film-premieres-london\" title=\"\">Wonga made a film showing the positive experience of the \"silent majority\" of its customers</a>, ahead of a session in the House of Commons when MPs will question payday loan companies.</p><p>Representatives from Wonga, QuickQuid and Mr Lender – three of the biggest payday lending firms – will appear before the Commons business, innovation and skills select committee.</p><p>MPs are expected to follow up on a damning report by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which found \"deep-rooted\" problems in the way payday loans attract and treat customers.</p><p>Lenders have come under intense scrutiny from the Competition Commission and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) since the OFT report was published in September amid reports of widespread impropriety in the sector.</p><p>The committee hearing pre-empts the transferral of regulatory powers in the consumer credit market from the Office of Fair Trading to the FCA on 1 Apri 2014. The new body, which came into being in April this year, has promised to strengthen protection for consumers.</p><p>It has been equipped with the power to impose unlimited fines and compel businesses to give people their money back when they have lost out due to poor treatment.</p><p>New curbs proposed by the body in October will force lenders to place \"risk warnings\" on their promotions and advertising, urging consumers to \"think\" before taking out a payday loan.</p><p>Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which?, will also appear before the committee on Tuesday. He welcomed the FCA's new role but said \"the government and regulators must go further to clean up the wider credit market\".</p><p>Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice Bureau, will also address the committee.</p><p>She said: \"MPs have the opportunity to hammer home some hard truths from their constituencies. The payday loan industry has boomed as people struggle to cope with the rising cost of living, but it has failed to act responsibly.</p><p>\"When I speak to MPs at the select committee, I will tell them how evidence from Citizens Advice finds that people are being given loans without any proper checks to make sure they can afford to pay them back. This sends borrowers into a spiral of debt which is very hard to get out of.</p><p>\"Some payday lenders are misusing continuous payment authorities by emptying their customers' bank accounts without prior warning – leaving them without any money to get to work, pay the bills or buy food.\"</p><p>Payday lenders have also been criticised for aggressive advertising campaigns that reportedly mislead potential consumers. In July, the FCA's chief executive, Martin Wheatley, indicated that offending firms could face a complete advertising ban.</p><p>He said previously: \"Clearly that is an option that could be considered if it was felt that the way that advertising was being used couldn't be dealt with through any other measures short of that.\"</p><p>The MPs' intervention follows research by a government-backed body that found more than 1 million people plan to take out a payday loan to cover the cost of Christmas.</p><p>The Money Advice Service (MAS) said one in 40 (2.44%) people surveyed for its research, equating to around 1.2 million across the UK, is thinking about turning to a payday lender to fund their seasonal spending.</p><p>One-third (32%) of the 2,000 consumers questioned also said they will increase their credit card debts to pay for the festivities, while one in  11 (9%) people said they are still paying off what they owe from last Christmas.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680058|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|90d00d2627eff7459b0040b3b4a0fedaae349487 -->",

They generate energy. They are wholesalers and retailers. They sell it to themselves before they sell it to us.\"</p><p></p><p>Flint again promised that during its proposed 20-month price freeze a Labour government would break up the big energy companies and  create a market in which the country could be clearer about the true costs of energy.</p><p></p><p>Labour is to stage debates on its plans for a price freeze in both the House of Commons and Lords on Wednesday. In a speech later on Tuesday at Battersea power station, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/05/ed-miliband-tax-living-wage\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband will put his proposals for an energy freeze in the context of his wider cost of living agenda</a>. The party is aware that it has to broaden the cost of living agenda to include economic competence and a future vision of the economy.</p><p></p><p>But Labour is also delighted  it has forced the government on to its chosen battleground of living standards, as opposed to the causes for the return of growth.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680469|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|adcc39389f4af6e35d60a1c973b3b7330fe943ab -->",

        "body":"<p>Marks &amp; Spencer has suffered its ninth consecutive quarter of falling sales, with chief executive Marc Bolland warning on Tuesday that there was little evidence of improved confidence boosting consumer demand.</p><p>Bolland, now in the final year of his three year turnaround plan for Britain's biggest clothing retailer, said he remains cautious on the outlook for the rest of the year, although he pointed to some \"early signs of improvement\" in womenswear as it battles to turnaround its ailing clothing business.</p><p>Bolland said: \"While consumer confidence appears to be improving, there is little evidence as yet of this translating to increased spending in the retail sector.</p><p>\"Given continued pressure on disposable incomes, we remain cautious about the outlook for the remainder of the year.\"</p><p>The retailer reported a 1.5% fall in underlying sales of general merchandise – mainly clothing – in the six months to the end of September. The second quarter decline was 1.3%, only a slight slowdown on the first quarter fall of 1.6%, despite the much-vaunted new clothing range.</p><p>This was in the stores for three weeks of the first half and Bolland said it had been \"well received by customers\". He would not be drawn on whether management are expecting third quarter like-for-like clothing sales to grow.</p><p>\"This is the start. We are seeing gradual improvement and we expect that to continue step by step. We should [see] gradual progression, improving over quarters. That's the journey we're on,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p><p>Groups sales rose to £4.9bn in the first half, up 4% compared with the same period last year, boosted by growth in its food and international businesses.</p><p>Like-for-like food sales were up 2.5% in the first half, pushing overall UK like-for-like sales up 0.7%.</p><p>International sales grew by 8% over the period.</p><p>Pre-tax profit fell to £261.6m from £287.3m on an underlying basis, and the retailer said the trading backdrop was \"challenging\" throughout the first half of the year, with high levels of discounting among retailers. Despite the results, the company's shares were up 2.2% at 498p in morning trading.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/17/marks-spencer-belinda-earl\" title=\"\">Bolland has revamped his team</a> in a bid to revive the fortunes of the women's clothing ranges, but remains under pressure to transform declining sales into growth.</p><p>The performance was in contrast to clothing retailer Primark, where like-for-like sales rose 5% in the year to 14 September.</p><p>Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: \"The underlying picture is one of flattish sales, rising operating costs and gross margin pressure, trends that obviously need to change for the better in the second half if M&amp;S want to meet full-year profit expectations.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421682670|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|02274dd9103131dbc25e1260b48a93f380cecb35 -->",

        "body":"<p>More hospital staff are to be switched to seven-day working patterns while some treatments will be transferred to the private sector to help relieve crisis-hit A&amp;E departments this winter, according to the medical director of the NHS.</p><p></p><p>Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said he shared concerns about the pressure facing emergency care departments and conceded they were facing an \"inexorable climb\" in admissions.</p><p></p><p>Emergency doctors warned that A&amp;E departments are facing their worst winter yet as a result of staff shortages and \"toxic overcrowding\".</p><p></p><p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Keogh said there was \"a feeling that this year is worse\" in terms of the pressure on A&amp;E departments.</p><p></p><p>He said the NHS had already taken action to deal with the expected problems this winter, including allocating funds earlier than usual. And he confirmed that some treatments would be outsourced to private care providers to help ease the burden.</p><p></p><p>\"We are looking to see how we can decongest hospitals by moving some services during winter into the private sector,\" he said. He added that waiting times at A&amp;E departments would be published every Friday this winter to allow the public to assess the performance of their local hospitals.</p><p></p><p>His comments come after NHS figures showed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/02/winter-hospitals-crisis-nhs-warning\" title=\"\">43% increase in the numbers waiting more than four hours in A&amp;E departments </a>compared with two years ago.</p><p></p><p>Next week Keogh is due to publish an eagerly-awaited report into the future of urgent care services.</p><p></p><p>He suggested it would focus on ways of treating more patients at home as he pointed out that 40% of patients left A&amp;E without needing any treatment. \"We need a better offer outside of hospitals,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>\"We know that of the 5m admissions that come in through A&amp;E, just over 1m of those are avoidable if we could offer better services in the community – going to their GPs or GPs going to them or ambulance services helping them at the scene.\"</p><p></p><p>Keogh said he would also publish a second report looking at how more out-of-hours care could relieve emergency departments.</p><p></p><p>\"Before the end of the year you will see some thoughts on how we can move more closely to a seven-day service in the NHS,\" he told the BBC.</p><p></p><p>Keogh said difficulties in A&amp;E departments highlighted broader problems in the NHS. \"Although this is manifest in A&amp;E  this is a problem of the whole system,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>\"Winter is going to be a particular issue. We have to address the problems coming up this winter and we have to address the longer-term problem.\"</p><p></p><p>Bernadette Garrihy, from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, predicted that A&amp;E was facing its worst winter yet.</p><p></p><p>In a separate interview on the Today programme she said A&amp;E departments were already under huge pressure.</p><p></p><p>She said: \"We have what we are describing this year as toxic overcrowding of our departments due to bed-blocking in our hospitals. We are very concerned about providing a safe and quality service this winter.\"</p><p></p><p>Calling for seven-day working patterns for all health and social care staff,  Garrihy said: \"We need other parts of the health service to be working on a seven-day basis, the way we are. Providing out-of-hours cover too. The whole health service needs to be looking at seven-day working, and indeed social services as well, because a lot of our patients have interlinked health and social demands.\"</p><p></p><p>Garrihy said changes so far introduced represented a drop in the ocean, and said she hoped Keogh's review would lead to sweeping changes.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421686427|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|a6d0c99bebad29dc3ec16e46764fe21cf6a17e74 -->",

        "body":"<p>The terror suspect who escaped surveillance by disguising himself as a woman in a burqa was under restrictions to stop him travelling overseas to support terrorism, the home secretary has told MPs.</p><p>Theresa May defended the use of terrorism prevention and investigation measures, or Tpims, after the disappearance of the Somali-born suspect, Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, from a west London mosque on Friday.</p><p>Mohamed, 27, is a British citizen and is the second suspect on a Tpim order to go missing in the last year. The first, Ibrahim Magag, disappeared off the security service's radar after he ripped off his tracking tag and jumped into a black cab in Camden Town, north London.</p><p>Mohamed went missing from the mosque in Acton, west London, only hours after an Old Bailey prosecution against him for tampering with his electronic tag was discontinued when the crown offered no evidence.</p><p>May said the police and security services did not believe Mohamed represented a direct threat to the British public. But he has been linked with the Somali militant group al-Shabab, and is believed to have helped various individuals to travel from Britain to Somalia to engage in terrorism-related activity.</p><p>The Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command has launched an intensive hunt. His photograph and details have been circulated to all ports and airports. May said the police held his UK passport.</p><p>She defended the Tpims regime, saying its abscondence record was little different to that of the control-order regime, which it replaced last year, under which seven terror suspects disappeared in six years.</p><p>\"The police and security service have confirmed that they do not believe that this man poses a direct threat to the public in the UK,\" she said. \"The reason he was put on a Tpim in the first place was to prevent his travel to support terrorism overseas.\" In the Commons, May also repeatedly had to reject calls from backbench Tories to ban the burqa and other face coverings after Mohamed's disappearance: \"It is not for the government to tell women how to dress,\" she told them.</p><p>The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, claimed the replacement of control orders with Tpims last year had made it easier for terror suspects to abscond. So far, two out of the 10 suspects placed on Tpims have gone missing.</p><p>Cooper particularly blamed the scrapping of \"internal exile\"or relocation orders, which would have left Mohamed unable to return to London to keep in contact with his network. Court documents show that the first suspect to abscond, Magag, was also a member of the same UK-based network supporting terrorism-related activity in Somalia.</p><p>\"She was warned about changing the law, she was warned about weakening controls, she was warned more people would abscond and they have – twice -but still she won't act. The question on everyone's lips is how many more warnings does this home secretary need?,\" said Cooper.</p><p>But May insisted that lessons had been learned since the first Tpims subject had disappeared. She said that resources for surveillance had been increased in the wake of the move from control orders to Tpims. The home secretary said it wrong to claim that control orders could prevent absconds – 7 had disappeared in the six years they had been in force.</p><p>Perhaps most surprisingly, the home secretary, faced demands from three Tory MPs to introduce a ban on face coverings, including the burka, as a result of the case. One, Sir Gerald Howarth, said the burka should be banned \"because it is alien to our culture, and has enabled this man to abscond\". It was a demand May found easy to dismiss saying while there were times, such as at the border or in court, when it was right to require face coverings to be removed, but as a matter of principle \"it is for an individual woman to decide how she dresses herself\".</p><p>The Tpims regime allow the home secretary to impose restrictions on travel, communication, finance and an overnight curfew of terror suspects who cannot be prosecuted or deported. Tpims can be extended for a year for another 12 months before they expire.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421645372|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|eb68fda2a82f3db78b8f5b4f743d83b6f27ad486 -->",

        "headline":"Phone-hacking trial told of Rebekah Brooks' attempt to 'hide evidence'",
        "body":"<p>Rebekah Brooks and her husband hatched a complicated plot to hide evidence from the police only to be foiled by a conscientious cleaner, an Old Bailey jury has heard. It was a curious tale involving an underground car park, two pizzas and a famous movie line of Richard Burton's.</p><p>The story was told by the Crown as part of a wider allegation that, as the chief executive of News International, Brooks had tried to conceal evidence of wrongdoing at the News of the World by deleting email records and destroying her journalistic notebooks. She denies two counts of conspiring to pervert the course of justice.</p><p>The jury at the phone-hacking trial also heard an opening speech on behalf of Andy Coulson that the Crown had mis-stated his role as editor of the News of the World and that \"it is his case that he was never party to an agreement to hack phones whatever others might have been doing on his watch\".</p><p>Completing his three-day opening argument for the Crown, Andrew Edis QC took the jury back to July 2011, to the aftermath of the Guardian's disclosure of the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone. \"A media firestorm was about to engulf the News of the World,\" he said. \"You can imagine the extremely anxious, if not panic-stricken approach to these developments that must have been going on at the News of the World.\"</p><p>With a Scotland Yard inquiry closing in, Edis said, News International announced it would close the News of the World, and Brooks, a former editor of the paper, realised she faced arrest when she kept an appointment with police on Sunday 17 July. It was in this context, Edis claimed, that she and her husband Charlie Brooks came up with a plan to stop police finding computers and records at their country home, Jubilee Barn in Oxfordshire, and their flat at Chelsea Harbour, central London.</p><p>That Sunday morning, a chauffeur drove the pair in their Audi from Oxfordshire to London. Back at Jubilee Barn, Edis alleged, the head of security at News International, Mark Hanna, collected items which were to be concealed and set off in a black Range Rover to the company's office in Wapping. Hanna, meanwhile, was in charge of protecting the Brookses from \"newspaper people\" and others in what had been named internally Operation Blackhawk.</p><p>By noon the chauffeur had dropped off Charlie Brooks and driven Rebekah Brooks to Lewisham police station, waiting while she was formally arrested and questioned. At 12.15pm, Edis said, Charlie Brooks was caught by CCTV cameras at Chelsea Harbour going down to the underground car park, carrying a jiffy bag and a laptop computer which he appeared to leave in or around a waste bin. Two hours later, the CCTV recorded Hanna apparently removing both items. According to cell site information from his mobile phone, Hanna then returned to head office at Thomas More Square.</p><p>That afternoon the police searched both of the Brookses' homes. Edis suggested to the jury that among the material concealed from there were two iPads and an iPhone which, according to electronic records, the couple had been using recently. \"The coast is clear,\" he said. \"The police have been and gone. But of course, it may not be entirely clear because there may be police or press keeping an eye on what was going on.\"</p><p>This became important, the jury heard, when it was decided to return some \"safe\" items to the Brookses that evening.</p><p>Hanna texted one of his men: \"Have plan. Can you call please?\" Edis suggested to the jury that this security man had been tasked to go to News International headquarters at Wapping, to collect a big bin bag containing some of the concealed items and to take them to Chelsea Harbour where there was some risk of being spotted by police or press. \"There has got to be some sort of pretext,\" he said. Which is where the pizzas allegedly became involved.</p><p>According to Edis, the security man had picked up two pizzas, phoned Charlie Brooks, delivered the pizzas to an unnamed man who came down to the underground car park, left the bin bag behind a bin and then texted his immediate boss with a line famously used by Richard Burton when communicating with his commanding officer in Where Eagles Dare.</p><p>\"Broadsword to Danny Boy\" he texted, adding: \"Pizzas delivered. The chicken is in the pot.\"</p><p>His boss texted back: \"Amateurs! We should have done a DLB or a brush contact on the riverside. Log the hours as pizza delivery.\" Edis explained that a DLB is a dead letter box of the kind used by spies and that what the text as a whole meant was: \"You have done the secret little job. We could have done that better. Log in the hours as pizza delivery because you can't log in the hours as perverting the course of justice.\"</p><p>\"The whole exercise,\" said Edis, \"was quite complicated and quite risky and liable to go wrong.\" On the following morning, the prosecutor told the jury, it had indeed gone wrong: when the chauffeur drove the Brookses to see their solicitor, leaving the bin bag still behind the waste bin.</p><p>In their absence, a cleaner, Mr Nascimento, had noticed the bag and its contents and taken it to his manager. When the Brookses returned, CCTV records showed, Charlie Brooks had searched the area around the waste bin and texted the security man who had left the bin bag there: \"Need to get Rebekah some lunch. Pizza.\"</p><p>But by then, said Edis, Nascimento's manager had decided to call the police \"which is how the police ended up with the bin bag\".</p><p>Separately, the jury heard that in the previous week, on Friday 8 July, the day after the closure of the News of the World was announced, Rebekah Brooks and her personal assistant, Cheryl Carter, had arranged to remove from the company archive seven boxes allegedly containing all the notebooks Brooks had used from 1995 to 2007. Carter had falsely told the archivist that they were her own notebooks, Edis said, and then falsely told police that Brooks had not been in the office on this day. \"It was quite dishonest,\" the prosecutor said. The notebooks had never been found.</p><p>Rebekah and Charlie Brooks, Cheryl Carter and Mark Hanna all deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice.</p><p>The trial continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421653953|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|f4020e26f533e3b26a696c98c482c20581dadaec -->",

        "body":"<p>A court in Bangladesh has sentenced 152 people to death for their actions in a 2009 border guard mutiny in which 74 people, including 57 military commanders, were killed.</p><p>Dhaka's metropolitan sessions court judge Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman also sentenced 157 others, mostly border guards, to life in prison while 271 people were acquitted. The extensive case involves 846 accused, and the verdicts are still being announced.</p><p>The mutiny on 25-26 February 2009 took place two months after the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, took office. The  military was unhappy over the response of the government, which did not allow troops to attack the border guards' headquarters in Dhaka where military commanders were killed.</p><p>Hasina offered an amnesty to quell the revolt but rescinded the offer when dozens of bodies were found in sewers and in mass graves.</p><p>Bangladesh's military has staged 21  coup attempts. The amnesty offer and the government's handling of the case strained the military's relationship with Hasina, and she pledged to try those responsible.</p><p>The country's criminal investigation department investigated and pressed charges against 850 people with serious crimes including murder and arson. Four of the accused died and 20 were tried in absentia.</p><p>Human rights groups have criticised Bangladesh for the mass trial, saying it will not aid justice. New York-based Human Rights Watch last week said at least 47 suspects have died in custody while the suspects have had limited access to lawyers, and to knowledge of the charges and evidence against them.

        "body":"<p>The chances of keeping the global temperature increase below 2C will &ldquo;swiftly diminish&rdquo; unless the world takes immediate action to escalate cuts in carbon emissions, the United Nations has warned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unep.org\">The UN Environment Program</a> said that even if nations meet their current emissions reduction pledges, carbon emissions in 2020 will be eight to 12 gigatonnes above the level required to avoid a costly nosedive in greenhouse gas output.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unep.org/publications/ebooks/emissionsgapreport2013/EmissionsGapReport2013/tabid/130755/ctl/Login/language/en-US/Default.aspx?returnurl=%2fpublications%2febooks%2femissionsgapreport2013%2fDefault.aspx\">The Emissions Gap Report 2013</a>, which was compiled by 44 scientific groups in 17 countries, warns that if the greenhouse &ldquo;gap&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;closed or significantly narrowed&rdquo; by 2020, the pathway to limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C will be closed.</p> <p>At UN talks in 2010, the international community agreed to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 2C by 2100, based on pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>Scientists at the recent IPCC gathering warned that the world could emit enough carbon to surpass <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/27/ipcc-world-dangerous-climate-change\">the 2C limit within 30 years</a>, and this latest UN analysis heightens concerns that the world could be heading for a temperature rise of 4C or even 6C, triggering damaging sea level rises, extreme weather events and food insecurity.</p> <p>The Emissions Gap Report, released ahead of climate talks in Warsaw next week, found that although the 2C target could be achieved with higher emissions by 2020, failure to significantly reduce CO2 levels will &ldquo;exacerbate mitigation challenges&rdquo; after this time.</p> <p>&ldquo;This will mean much higher rates of global emission reductions in the medium term; greater lock-in of carbon-intensive infrastructure; greater dependence on often unproven technologies in the medium term; greater costs of mitigation in the medium and long term; and greater risks of failing to meet the 2C target,&rdquo; the UN Environment Program stated.</p> <p>In order to avoid this scenario, the report recommends that emissions should reach a maximum of 44 gigatonnes of CO2 by 2020, falling to 40 gigatonnes by 2025 and further to 22 gigatonnes by 2050.</p> <p>However, given that the 2C target was set based on the assumption that action would start in 2010, the report warns it will become &ldquo;increasingly difficult&rdquo; to meet this goal. Global greenhouse gas emissions for 2010, the latest year for which data is available, stood at 50.1 gigatonnes.</p> <p>Although the report states the window for action is &ldquo;narrowing&rdquo;, the 2C target could still be achieved by implementing ambitious emissions reduction promises, tightening the rules of existing pledges and international co-operation on areas such as energy efficiency, renewables and fossil fuel subsidies.</p> <p>Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/30/climate-change-abbott-emissions-target\">Climate Change Authority said</a> that Australia&rsquo;s 5% emissions reduction goal is &ldquo;not a credible option&rdquo; and should be increased, possibly to 15% or 25%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/28/australia-should-reduce-carbon-emissions-by-at-least-25-by-2020\">A separate analysis</a> by WWF found that Australia has already burned through two-thirds of its share of a &ldquo;carbon budget&rdquo; that would keep the temperature rise under 2C.</p> <p>Achim Steiner, UN Environment Program executive director, said that delayed action to reduce emissions would increase the rate of climate change-fueled impacts.</p> <p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;lock-in&rsquo; would slow down the introduction of climate-friendly technologies and narrow the developmental choices that would place the global community on the path to a sustainable, green future,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, the stepping stone of the 2020 target can still be achieved by strengthening current pledges and by further action, including scaling up international co-operation initiatives in areas such as energy efficiency, fossil fuel subsidy reform and renewable energy.</p> <p>&ldquo;Even agriculture can contribute, as direct emissions from this sector are currently responsible for 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions &ndash; more if its indirect emissions are taken into account.&rdquo;</p> <p>Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who was recently accused of &ldquo;talking through her hat&rdquo; by Tony Abbott for linking bushfires to climate change, added: &ldquo;As we head towards Warsaw for the latest round of climate negotiations, there is a real need for increased ambition by all countries: ambition which can take countries further and faster towards bridging the emissions gap and a sustainable future for all.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, increased national ambition will not be enough to meet the scientific realities of climate change, which is one reason why a universal new agreement &ndash; able to catalyse international co-operation &ndash; is urgently needed by 2015.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421674669|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|f1cbdf06280a8303b13e2cdba5248d8de8042917 -->",

        "body":"<p>An audacious attempt is to be made to delay the lobbying bill for three months in the Lords by putting its controversial plans for limiting the campaigning activities of charities into a special committee for detailed consideration.</p><p>The move is to be made on Tuesday by the crossbench peer Lord Ramsbotham with Labour backing, and is likely to prove a difficult test for government whips in the Lords.</p><p>The referral of part two of the bill to a special select committee would also delay consideration of other aspects of the bill.</p><p>The move would result in the part of the bill on regulating third-party campaigning to go to a special select committee until 13 February 2014.</p><p>The call for a pause is being made by an alliance of charities, thinktanks, faith groups and unions.</p><p>It is being argued that a pause would allow the government to get the bill right, and to hold the consultation it failed to hold before the bill was published.</p><p></p><p>Ministers argue that they have already made substantial concessions in the Commons to meet the fears of charities and pressure groups, who say the bill will have a chilling effect on their campaigning ahead of the general election.</p><p>Simon Barrow, the co-director the Christian thinktank Ekklesia, has warned the bill is too weak in bringing corporate lobbyists to account but unjustifiably limits the freedom of expression on charities, civil society organisations and thinktanks - restrictions that amount to gagging orders.</p><p>The House of Lords constitution committee warned \"effective parliamentary scrutiny matters in relation to every bill but it is of manifest importance where legislation is of constitutional significance. The present bill directly affects the ability of people and organisations to engage with the government and to participate in political and electoral campaigning.\"</p><p>The committee asked whether part two was necessary.</p><p>The joint select committee on human rights also called for the bill to be paused, as did the Commons political and constitutional reform select committee.</p><p>Charities claim lowering the registration thresholds for third party organisations would impose an undue burden on small organisations, and the definitions of permitted campaigning in a general election period were wrong-headed.</p><p>The Electoral Commission has also questioned the need to lower the spending limits of charities.</p><p>Underlying the dispute is likely to be a government fear that charities tend to be left-leaning or critical of government spending cuts, and so likely to be critical of the government during an election period.</p><p>Ramsbotham has warned ministers they \"must avoid giving the impression they own the voluntary sector\". Lord Phillips, a Liberal Democrat, has called for a fundamental review.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680083|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1c8985e3dbfc314b17607536fcbf4bab9e54546f -->",

        "body":"<p>French police investigating the murder of a British family at an Alpine beauty spot have issued a sketch of a man seen near the scene.</p><p>The motorcyclist, described as bearded and wearing a full-face helmet, was spotted by two witnesses above the parking area at the top of a narrow country road near the village of Chevaline where<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/french-alps-shootings\" title=\"\"> Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and mother-in-law, Suhaila, were gunned down</a> on 5 September last year.</p><p>The victims were shot in the head. A French cyclist, Sylvain Mollier, who detectives believe stumbled upon the scene, was also killed.</p><p>French investigators, who suspect the family may have been targeted by a professional hitman, have known of the bearded motorcyclist since the beginning of the inquiry. They say he was wearing an unusual helmet, produced by the company GPA, of which only 8,000 were made.</p><p>However, searches at the homes of known owners of similar helmets and monitoring of internet sales sites such as eBay have yielded no information.</p><p>Prosecutor Eric Maillaud, who is overseeing the inquiry, told French journalists on Monday: \"It's always useful to see if anyone might recognise the motorcyclist because he could have seen something that might interest us.\"</p><p>A second motorcyclist was reportedly seen in the area after the killings, but did not appear to be fleeing the scene, he added.</p><p>Saad al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old wife and her mother, 74, were on holiday in the area, near Annecy, when they were killed.</p><p>The couple's elder daughter, Zainab, then aged seven, was pistol-whipped by the attacker and left for dead with serious head injuries. Her sister, Zeena, four, cowered under the skirt of her dead mother in the rear of the family's BMW estate car for eight hours before she was found by police.</p><p>Detectives are still hunting a BMW X5, a dark-coloured, four-wheel drive vehicle, spotted in the area. The car stood out as it was a right-hand drive, but investigators say they are not yet linking the car and the motorcycle.</p><p>A French hotline has been opened on 0800 002 950.</p><p>The photofit shows a man with a moustache and beard wearing a black or dark coloured helmet that is unusual because it has a lateral opening at chin level. Police said they were appealing for \"anyone who recognises the man\" to call them.</p><p>Detectives had held back on issuing a portrait of the man they want to speak to, hoping to be able to trace him through his relatively rare helmet.</p><p>The man was seen by members of the National Forests Office (ONF) near where the bodies of the murdered al-Hilli family members were discovered by a British cyclist only moments after they had been killed. \"What is more interesting then the photofit itself is the type of helmet,\" Lt Col Benoît Vinnemann, the gendarme heading the investigation, said.</p><p>Police said the helmet was produced in Italy by French specialist company GPA - based in the south of France - and was a \"ISR type\", unusual because it has a hinged opening at chin level to allow the wearer to hold a conversation without removing their helmet.  Only 8,000 models in black or a dark colour were made by the company.</p><p>\"This man was riding along the Combe d'Ire at Doussard - Chevaline between 3.15pm and 3.40pm on 5 September 2012. The only helmet on the market that matches the description we have is the ISR-type GPA helmet,\" police said in a <a href=\"http://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/fre/Sites/Gendarmerie/Actualites/2013/Octobre/Appel-a-temoins\" title=\"\">statement</a> on Monday. Despite checking with distributors, police have been unable to trace the owner.</p><p>More than a year after the assassinations, police are still unable to establish whether the al-Hillis were killed as a result of a family dispute over an inheritance, over the family's Iraq connections, as a result of industrial espionage or by a lone gunman unconnected to the victims.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421637081|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|70239bed9975793f900fc41f78943932cc01fb5c -->",

We expect it to move below 7% by mid-2015, a year ahead of the Bank of England's current forecast. However, given the positive developments in the last couple of months, the Bank is likely to downgrade its unemployment forecast in its next Inflation Report due next Wednesday. This will probably be accompanied with upward revisions to growth as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers, World First, said:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The services sector is flying.&nbsp;Records in both output and employment have guided the PMI to the highest level since Tony Blair took power in the UK back in 1997, as confidence around the long-term ability for recovery continues to increase. Combined with the manufacturing figure from Friday and yesterday’s 6 year record construction number, we can safely say that momentum is firmly gathering in the UK economy. The wind is very much in our sails.</p> <p>We would have to say that growth is now running at close to 5% on an annualised basis, on these initial estimates, and, at the moment, shows little sign of abating. We must now wait for the Bank of England’s appraisal of this run of numbers. There will be a fair few of the economic fraternity of who will be looking forward to next week’s Quarterly Inflation Report and expecting some form of outlook change from the MPC; a change that will see rates rising sooner than the 2016 expectation that was originally forecast…</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andy Scott, associate director at HiFX:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following positive surprises in the manufacturing and construction sector indexes, the early indicators for the fourth quarter look like 2013 could see the economy grow at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Markit, the company that measures and releases the data for all three sectors, said that combining the three indexes points to GDP growth this quarter of 1.3%. This should serve to ease some concerns that have arisen over the past few weeks that the recovery won’t be sustained. The buoyancy of the housing market where prices have been rising steadily helped by increasing mortgage approvals and the government’s help to buy scheme has been what a lot of commentators have put the recovery down to but clearly it’s broader based. With unemployment continuing to fall at a modest but steady pace, confidence will be maintained which should boost consumer spending and corporate investment. </p> </blockquote> <h2>And here's our full story:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\">Service sector growing at fastest pace since 1997</a></h2> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c878e4b08cac6a3300fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:29:47.754Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">MPs grill Wonga: Payday lenders admit making changes</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Wonga has also admitted it was forced to make changes to its sales practices following an Office of Fair Trading investigation,as the hearing before MPs continued...</strong></p> <p>It was told to highlight risk factors more prominently on its website and make clearer disclosures around APRs (percentage interest rates).</p> <p><strong>QuickQuid</strong> and <strong>Mr Lender</strong> admits that they have been ordered by the Office of Fair Trading to change their procedures on 'roll overs' where hard-pressed borrowers ask for a loan to be rolled over at the end of the term.</p> <p>In total, Mr Lender admits that it was told to make around 30 changes to its procedures.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:31:44.278Z\">at 10.31am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c778e4b00d1cb164472b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:28:59.928Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Back to parliament, and&nbsp;MPs are pressing payday lenders on how they check whether borrowers can afford a payday loan. </strong></p> <p>Adam Freeman, chief executive of Mr Lender, admits that it has no idea if a borrower is taking out new loans from Wonga or other lenders at the same time.&nbsp;</p> <p>He gives an example of a person taking home &pound;1,500 a month with &pound;600 left after rent and other expenses.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We might then lend them &pound;300 or &pound;350.

Swat teams were concentrating their search in the north-east corner of the 200,000 square metre mall in Paramus.</p> <p>Baratta said a call was received saying shots were fired at the facility shortly before the mall's 9.30pm closing time on Monday night.</p> <p>Paramus police chief Kenneth Ehrenberg said early on Tuesday that the suspect had been dressed in black and wore what was believed to be a motorcycle helmet. A weapon had not been recovered.</p> <p>Witnesses said the sound of gunfire sent customers and employees rushing for the exits and hiding places.<br />Baratta said authorities found one bullet casing.</p> <p>Hundreds of law enforcement officers converged on the mall, which was put on lockdown. New Jersey state police landed a helicopter in the parking lot of one of the state's largest and most popular shopping malls.</p> <p>Baratta said Swat teams and police with canine units were going through the mall and working to evacuate anyone still inside. As of early Tuesday authorities believed there were still people in the mall, she said.</p> <p>Nick Woods was working in a Lego store when a woman ran by shouting that there was a shooting.<br />Woods said his supervisor locked them in a back room, along with a woman, a man and a child.</p> <p>When they peeked out two hours later, they saw police officers standing outside and he called the police emergency dispatcher to ask that the officers be told they were coming out. He said the emergency operator told him she could not contact individual police officers and that he should walk out with his hands in the air.</p> <p>\"I had to go out of the store shouting at the officers with my hands up and they turned and pointed their guns at me,\" Woods said. \"It was one of the scariest experiences of my life.\"</p> <p>Jessica Stigliano, 21, of Richfield, New Jersey, said she was sitting in the mall's food court when she saw people running and yelling \"shots were fired\".</p> <p>Carlos Sinde, 36, of Astoria, Queens, said he was ushered out of a cinema screening of the movie Gravity. \"Once the security guards started telling us what was going on, that's when there was hysteria,\" he said.</p> <p>The mall is located in Bergen county, about 15 miles (24km) north-west of Manhattan.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421670781|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|8c002cb3e2ac58b06c91364d01e133aa03f94c74 -->",

        "headline":"Two billion planets in our galaxy may be suitable for life",
        "body":"<p>Our galaxy probably contains at least two billion planets that, like Earth, have liquid water on their surfaces and orbit around their parent stars in the \"habitable zone\" for life. The nearest, according to astronomers, could be a mere 12 light years away.</p><p>A new study, <a href=\" http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319909110\" title=\"\">published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, suggests that Earth-like planets capable of supporting life are far more common than previously thought. Using measurements from Nasa's Kepler space observatory, scientists led by Erik Petigura the University of California, Berkely, estimated that 22% of our galaxy's sun-like stars had rocky planets circling them that were within the zone that meant they got roughly the same amount of light energy as Earth gets from the sun. There are around 100bn stars in our galaxy, of which 10% are like the sun.</p><p>So far Kepler has studied more than 150,000 stars and identified more than 3,000 candidate planets, but many of these are \"gas giants\", similar to Jupiter, that orbit close to their parent stars. If there is life out there, it is far more likely to have evolved on rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces, similar to Earth.</p><p>To get their results, Petigura's team looked for planets in Kepler data that had a radius up to double that of Earth. They searched for planets that orbited far enough from their star that liquid water would not evaporate, but not so far that the water would all freeze.</p><p>Subhanjoy Mohanty, an astrophysicist at Imperial College London who was not involved with the study, said: \"This is the first estimate of the frequency of Earth-like planets around sun-like stars, in orbits large enough to lie in the habitable zone of their stars. The finding that roughly one in five sun-like stars may host such planets is an incredibly important one, probably exceeding the expectations of most cautious astronomers.\"</p><p>He added that the latest analysis increased the chances that there might be life somewhere among the stars. \"Previous analyses of Kepler data had shown that red dwarfs – the most common type of star in the galaxy, making up about 80% of the stellar population – very frequently harbour Earth-size planets, including in their habitable zones. This new study shows that the same is true as well around stars more like our own sun.  This is certainly an added impetus for planned future missions which will study the atmospheres of these potentially habitable planets, enabling us to investigate whether they are in fact habitable or not, and also whether their atmospheres show actual biosignatures of existing life.\"</p><p>Nasa also announced on Monday that the Kepler probe would be given a new lease of life, following fears that it would have to end its mission after only four years in space. In May 2013, scientists discovered that one of the gyroscopic wheels – known as \"reaction wheels\" – that kept the probe pointing in the right direction had stopped working and, try as they might, Nasa engineers could not get it working again. Unable to point itself at the stars with any accuracy, the probe could no longer be used to collect data about the position of new exoplanets.</p><p>But it looks as though there could be a solution that reorients the probe to look along the plane of the galaxy, which will allow it to remain stable with only two of its reaction wheels working. \"The old saying 'necessity is the mother of invention' has rung true here, with engineers and scientists from Nasa and the spacecraft manufacturers having figured out this way to, we hope, recover much of the performance we thought we had lost. We are very excited,\" said Bill Chaplin, an astrophysicist at the University of Birmingham in the UK.</p><p>If all goes well, the new Kepler mission – dubbed \"K2\" – will look for planets around smaller stars than the sun, and will also study the stars themselves. \"There are a wealth of fantastically interesting targets for astrophysics that can be observed in the ecliptic plane, which were not accessible in the original Kepler field, notably brighter clusters of stars – where the common origins and distances to these stars make the clusters excellent laboratories for testing our understanding of stars – and young, star-forming regions,\" said Chaplin.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647297|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|645aa93cdcaa6dbb99bc6357a2e89f4d5ca5fe9f -->",
