        "headline":"British Gas raises energy prices by 9.2%",
        "body":"<p>British Gas will raise energy prices by an average of 9.2% next month, piling further financial pressure on 7.8 million households and reigniting the political row over soaring gas and electricity prices.</p><p>Parent company Centrica became the second of the big six energy firms to announce a price rise after SSE raised prices last week. The average annual dual-fuel bill with British Gas will increase by £107 to £1,297.</p><p>Centrica blamed the above-inflation hike on higher costs for wholesale energy and delivering gas and electricity to homes, and government's \"social and environmental programmes\" which are paid for through customers' bills.</p><p>Electricity bills will rise by 10.4% and gas bills by 8.4% from 23 November. With usage and regional variations this equates to an average price rise of 9.2%, Centrica said.</p><p>The move escalated the row between energy providers and the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who accused SSE of \"ripping off\" customers after it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill\" title=\"\">announced an 8.2% price rise for its 7 million customers</a>.</p><p>Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, said the latest rise by British Gas showed \"clearer than ever\" why Miliband's proposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/sep/25/centrica-sse-labour-miliband-price-freeze\" title=\"\">20-month energy price freeze</a> was needed.</p><p>British Gas said on Thursday that although it recognised energy bills were a \"real worry for hard-pressed households\", the decision was down to rising costs \"that are not all directly under our control\".</p><p>Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas residential energy, said: \"I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes aren't keeping pace. We haven't taken this decision lightly.\"</p><p>He said the best way to keep bills down was by increased energy efficiency, and urged customers to check whether they were eligible for measures such as insulation.</p><p>Tom Lyon, an energy expert at uSwitch.com, said the rise would leave customers feeling \"betrayed\".</p><p>\"Today's price hike will be seen by many as a broken promise after the supplier suggested in May that it would use the extra profits it made last winter to hold off from any price hikes.</p><p>\"British Gas customers have had the rug pulled from under their feet and I suspect that many will be feeling let down and betrayed.\"</p><p>The company, however, insisted it was making \"fair profits\" for \"keeping homes warm and keeping the lights on\".</p><p>It said it was offering a new tariff which guarantees that prices will not go up until 30 November 2014. If standard prices fall, the fixed tariff will fall too, it said.</p><p>Clare Francis, editor-in-chief of Moneysupermarket.com, said other energy providers were likely to follow the move.</p><p>\"It won't stop there. We can expect the other four major providers – EDF, E.ON, npower and Scottish Power – to also announce price hikes over the coming weeks.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420240604|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|f0f3f12fd1ae65db89729a7bce01946cd695b54f -->",

        "body":"<p>Nick Clegg has welcomed the decision of parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC) to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/17/uk-gchq-nsa-surveillance-inquiry-snowden\" title=\"\">launch an inquiry into the extent and scale of mass surveillance</a> undertaken by Britain's spy agencies.</p><p></p><p>The deputy prime minister said it was right to assess how \"big, new, powerful technologies\" are used by the intelligence agencies.</p><p></p><p>Clegg spoke out on his weekly LBC radio phone-in after the ISC, the body tasked with overseeing the work of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6, announced an investigation in response to concern raised by the leaks from the whistleblower Edward Snowden. The Guardian has published a number of articles based on the leaks.</p><p></p><p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the committee chair, said an informed and proper debate was needed. One Whitehall source described the investigation as \"a public inquiry in all but name\".</p><p></p><p>Clegg told LBC radio that it was right to examine the oversight of the intelligence agencies and to examine the extent of the new technologies. He said: \"I think it is entirely legitimate to ask ourselves whether the oversight arrangements – the way in which we make sure the agencies, who by definition have to work in secret, do so in a way which is accountable. If you don't have proper accountability in a way that the public trusts and understands – because quite a lot of the accountability mechanisms we have got at the moment are very much kind of Westminster village stuff – the problem then is people start losing faith in the whole system.</p><p></p><p>\"Then of course there is the bigger issue, a debate which is happening here and on the other side of the Atlantic, which is just how these big, new, powerful technologies are used both by security agencies and indeed by people who wish to do us harm.\"</p><p></p><p>Clegg raised concerns about the leaking of information that could help terrorists. Asked by a caller whether he was pleased that the Guardian could face a police investigation into the publication of the Snowden files, after the Conservative MP Julian Smith called on the Metropolitan police to examine the matter, he said: \"Anything that helps terrorists and other people to learn more about the technical methods used by our agencies to keep us safe, and so allow them to do more harm to us, is a very bad thing.\"</p><p>The announcement of the new inquiry comes four months after the Guardian and leading media groups in other countries, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, began disclosing details of secret surveillance programmes run by Britain's eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency.</p><p>The Guardian has been encouraging a debate about programmes such as GCHQ's Tempora and the NSA's Prism, which allow the agencies to harvest vast amounts of personal data from millions of people – intelligence that is routinely shared between the two countries.</p><p>In a change from its usual protocol, the normally secretive committee announced that part of its inquiry would be held in public.</p><p>It will also take written evidence from interested groups and the public, and assess secret material supplied by the intelligence agencies. The Guardian will also consider submitting evidence.</p><p>Conceding that public concerns had to be addressed, Rifkind, a former foreign secretary, added: \"There is a balance to be found between our individual right to privacy and our collective right to security.\"</p><p>The ISC, which has been criticised for being too close to the agencies, has been under pressure to provide more robust scrutiny of the intelligence community. In recent weeks Lord King, a former chair of the committee, Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, and Stella Rimington, a former head of MI5, have all raised concerns about the laws governing the secret services and the amount of scrutiny they are subjected to.</p><p></p><p>Formally, the committee has decided to broaden an existing inquiry into whether the intelligence laws are \"fit for purpose\".</p><p></p><p>Rifkind said: \"In recent months concern has been expressed at the suggested extent of the capabilities available to the intelligence agencies and the impact upon people's privacy as the agencies seek to find the needles in the haystacks that might be crucial to safeguarding national security.\"</p><p></p><p>The admission that legitimate issues have been raised by the Guardian investigation also undercuts those on the Conservative benches demanding that the primary response to the Guardian disclosures should be prosecution of the newspaper for breaking the Official Secrets Act. Those demands surfaced again in parliament on Wednesday.</p><p></p><p>At prime minister's questions David Cameron criticised the Guardian and urged select committees to hold inquiries, following a question from the former defence secretary Liam Fox asking whether it was a double standard to prosecute newspapers that hacked the phones of celebrities but not those papers that released information that endangered national security.</p><p></p><p>Responding, Cameron said: \"The plain fact is that what has happened has damaged national security and in many ways the Guardian themselves admitted that when they agreed, when asked politely by my national security adviser and cabinet secretary, to destroy the files they had, they went ahead and destroyed those files.</p><p>\"So they know that what they're dealing with is dangerous for national security. I think it's up to select committees in this house if they want to examine this issue and make further recommendations.\"</p><p></p><p>A spokesperson for the Guardian said: \"The prime minister is wrong to say the Guardian destroyed computer files because we agreed our reporting was damaging.</p><p></p><p>\"We destroyed the computers because the government said it would use the full force of the law to prevent a newspaper from publishing anything about the NSA or GCHQ.</p><p></p><p>\"That is called 'prior restraint' and it is unthinkable in the US, where the New York Times and Washington Post have been widely applauded – along with the Guardian – for reporting on the Snowden files. That reporting has so far led to a presidential review and three proposed bills before Congress.\"</p><p></p><p>Shortly after Cameron's intervention, it emerged that the Commons home affairs select committee would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/16/mps-investigate-guardian-edward-snowden-leaks\" title=\"\">mount an investigation into the issues raised by the Guardian disclosures</a>. It will also look into whether the paper has endangered national security and potentially broken the law, as part of a wider current investigation into counterterrorism. Rifkind said the ISC would be seeking contributions from outside the agencies \"to ensure that the committee can consider the full range of opinions expressed on these topics. Once it has considered those written submissions it will also hold oral evidence sessions, some of which it expects to hold in public\".</p><p></p><p>Julian Smith, the Tory MP for Skipton who has written to the Metropolitan police calling for the newspaper to be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act and the Terrorism Act 2000, has been granted a debate in parliament next week in which \"he will lay out the reasons why I believe that the Guardian has crossed the line between responsible journalism and seriously risking our national security and the lives of those who seek to protect us\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420234685|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|7f9245584147bf4f2eca30d161b8e86d2a29542a -->",

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13406.htm\" title=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13406.htm\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a> has appealed to Washington to sort out its finances after the US pulled back from the brink of a debt default and hundreds of thousands of federal employees prepared to return to work after a 16-day government shutdown.</p><p>As the US president, Barack Obama, warned: \"We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis,\" the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, appealed for more stability.</p><p>\"It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner,\" she said.</p><p>\"We also continue to encourage the US to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phased-in measures that would not harm the recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan.\"</p><p>A Senate-drafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to the conservatives who had driven the country to the precipice of a new financial crisis was passed by the Republican-dominated House of Representatives just hours before a deadline to extend the US debt limit was to pass.</p><p>The World Bank too expressed its relief that the global economy had \"dodged a potential catastrophe\", with its president, Jim Yong Kim, urging policymakers in all countries to \"continue to focus on crafting and implementing policies that promote economic growth and boost jobs and opportunity for all\".</p><p>Stock markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea initially reflected relief after the Republicans finally capitulated in their failed attempt to undermine Obama's healthcare reforms. But in Asia and Europe stock markets overall displayed a muted reaction with traders apparently expecting another battle in Washington early in 2014.</p><p>The shutdown is estimated to <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/16/government-shutdown-has-cost-us-economy-15bn-a-day-sp-says\" title=\"\">have cost the US $24bn – £1.5bn a day – according to the ratings agency Standard and Poor</a>. China's official Xinhua news agency had accused Washington of jeopardising other countries' dollar assets. China is the US government's largest creditor.</p><p>Obama signed the necessary legislation to fend off a default shortly after midnight on Thursday after a Republican split in the House of Representatives. The bill had passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement. It offers a temporary fix, funding the government until 15 January and raising the debt ceiling until 7 February.</p><p>But the president made clear he did not expect another bitter budget fight and shutdown next year.</p><p>In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would \"lift the cloud of uncertainty\" that had hung over the country in recent weeks.</p><p>\"Once this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately,\" he said, in a statement delivered at the White House. \"Hopefully next time it won't be in the 11th hour. We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.\"</p><p>As he left the lectern after his Wednesday night press briefing, the president was asked by a journalist whether the crisis would happen all over again in a few months. Speaking over his shoulder, Obama replied: \"No.\"</p><p>Earlier, the Republican senator Mike Lee had struck a defiant tone, perhaps indicating more trouble ahead: \"The media keeps asking: 'Was it worth it?' My answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing,\" he said, adding: \"This is not over.\"</p><p>However, the political deal on Wednesday was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans. None of their stated goals were achieved and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420229420|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|6693367f639e586daa03d78c5a110dde616959de -->",

        "body":"<p>Michael Gove has suffered a \"devastating blow\" to his flagship free schools policy after a new school in Derby was <a href=\"\" title=\"\">condemned as dysfunctional in a hard-hitting Ofsted report,</a> the shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has said.</p><p>Speaking in an emergency Commons debate after the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/interactive/2013/oct/16/oftsed-report-on-al-madinah-school-derby\" title=\"\">published a leaked copy of the report</a>, Hunt said Ofsted's findings into the al-Madinah school in Derby showed that Gove's free schools programme was a dangerous ideological experiment.</p><p>The report declares that the Islamic school in Derby is in chaos and has \"not been adequately monitored or supported\". It says teachers at the faith school are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training.</p><p>The shadow education secretary told MPs: \"What today's Ofsted report exposes is that the government's free school programme has become a dangerous free-for-all – an out-of-control ideological experiment that has closed a school, leaving 400 children losing an entire week of learning. It is a devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy.</p><p>\"It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen.\"</p><p>Hunt was granted an urgent question by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, after the Guardian published a leaked copy of the Ofsted report, which shows that teachers were appointed without proper qualifications and that the school was not properly overseen.</p><p>Labour believes the report has significance across England because it has highlighted key flaws in Gove's free schools programme. These include the appointment of unqualified teachers and inadequate levels of supervision, because local education authorities have little role in monitoring schools.</p><p>Hunt told MPs: \"In a city where every child needs to be supported and educated to the highest possible level, the education secretary has sacrificed learning for ideology. It is not just al-Madinah school which is dysfunctional. It is the education secretary's free schools policy.\"</p><p>The Ofsted inspection, which had been due to take place by the end of the year, was brought forward by two months on the recommendation of the education department after allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear headscarves and pupils were segregated. The school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, closed during the inspection.</p><p>The report says pupils are given the same work regardless of their different abilities and that the governing body is ineffective.</p><p>The Ofsted report also says boys and girls eat lunch in separate sittings, although it puts this down to the small size of the canteen. Older boys and girls are seated on either side of classrooms, although younger children sit together.</p><p>The report concludes: \"This school is dysfunctional. The basic systems and processes a school needs to operate well are not in place. The school is in chaos and reliant on the goodwill of an interim principal to prevent it totally collapsing.\"</p><p>David Laws, the education minister who stood in for Gove, who is abroad, told MPs that the government had taken action and had requested the Ofsted report after concerns were raised about the school in the summer. The school opened in September last year.</p><p>Laws told MPs: \"After a steady start by the school we became aware of potential breaches of the conditions in its funding agreement late this summer. At the end of July we began a wide-ranging investigation into the financial management and governance of the school.</p><p>\"Our investigations did indeed find significant and numerous breaches of the conditions in its funding agreement. Our concerns were such that we requested Ofsted to bring forward its planned inspection.\"</p><p>Laws added that his ministerial colleague Lord Nash had made clear to the school's trust that it would lose its funding unless it dealt with the concerns raised by the department and in the Ofsted report. \"We will not let any school, whether a free school, an academy school or a local authority school, languish in failure. The Ofsted report confirms we are taking the right actions. We are not prepared to allow a school to fail its parents, its children and its community. We said we will take swift action in these cases and that is exactly what we are doing.\"</p><p>Laws accused Hunt of inconsistency because he told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 on Sunday that he now favoured free schools. The shadow education secretary told the programme that he favoured parent-led academies that would be different from free schools in three respects: they could only open in areas where there was a shortage of schools places; teachers would have to be qualified; and there would be greater oversight.</p><p>Hunt illustrated his final point on Sunday by pointing to al-Madinah school. He told the Andrew  Marr Show: \"You're going to have systems of financial accountability, transparency, because what is going on at the al-Madinah School in Derby is a terrifying example of the mistakes of Michael Gove's education policy. You have had a system which allows essentially financial irregularities, allegations of extremist curriculum, teaching ideas contrary to British values, because there's no oversight there.</p><p>\"I'm in favour of parent-led academies, which are going to be good parent-led academies and we will keep the good free schools when we get into government. But have no doubt that what we have seen recently is an ideological experiment with our young people and as a result of that, four hundred kids in Derby have been sent home for the week.

These issues are much better raised bilaterally,\" one senior official told the Guardian this week.</p><p>Human rights activists in Sri Lanka have accused Cameron of being naive.</p><p>The principal charge made in the MPs' report is that a timid and inconsistent approach has given the government no option but to attend the meeting in Colombo despite widespread reservations in Whitehall and elsewhere.</p><p>The report notes that during discussions at the 2009 Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Port of Spain about venues for future meetings, the Foreign Office opposed a proposal that Sri Lanka might host the 2011 meeting on human rights grounds \"but did not obstruct a proposal that it might do so in 2013; nor did it insist that Sri Lanka's right to host in 2013 should be conditional on improvements in human rights.\"</p><p>Last year the committee, staffed by backbench MPs from all parties, recommended that Cameron \"should publicly state his unwillingness to attend [the 2013 meeting] unless he receives convincing and independently verified evidence of substantial and sustainable <a href=\"http://www.hrdreport.fco.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">improvements in human and political rights in Sri Lanka</a>.\"</p><p>\"There is scant evidence of progress in political and human rights in Sri Lanka,\" the new report notes.</p><p>The Foreign Office's 2012 human rights and democracy report lists Sri Lanka as one of 27 countries of concern. Others include Afghanistan, China, Zimbabwe, Turkmenistan, Iraq, Russia and Belarus.</p><p>Sri Lanka's economy has grown by 6-7% annually in recent years. Tourist arrivals have risen significantly since the end of the war.</p><p>Following pressure from the international community, Colombo held an election last month for a provincial council in the north, dominated by the Tamil minority. Despite significant economic development, there is widespread resentment among Tamils in northern towns such as Jaffna and Kilinochchi, the former headquarters of the violent separatist Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam (LTTE).</p><p>Sri Lankan officials say they are repeatedly denied credit for \"good things like all the construction and clearing of mines and resettlement\" in the war-battered areas of northern Sri Lanka.</p><p>The new report asks the Foreign Office whether it has revised its previous view that there is no substantiated evidence of torture or maltreatment of people who have been returned by UK immigration authorities to Sri Lanka. This year the UK Border Agency was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/28/border-agency-tamils-sri-lanka\" title=\"\">ordered to halt the removal of Tamils</a> who have been refused asylum.</p><p>\"It is a matter of concern … that the UK Border Agency's assessment of risk to Sri Lankans on being returned from the UK to Sri Lanka, which will have been partly based upon information provided by FCO staff in Sri Lanka, was found by the courts to be flawed and in need of revision,\" the report says.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420182870|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|7d84925f21461e22d1f939dd90e7faa4684a226e -->",

In the landmark decade-long trial, culling was completed in 8-11 days to minimise perturbation, and scientists have repeatedly warned that drawn-out culls could in fact increase TB infections.

This has enabled us to test the safety, humaneness and effectiveness of controlled shooting as a means of reducing badger numbers and so reduce significantly disease in cattle. Having the two separate pilot areas has similarly enabled us to see how different environmental factors, field and other conditions affect the practical delivery of our objectives. Experience gained on the ground has been invaluable.\"</p><p></p><p>Mark Jones, executive director of Humane Society International UK and a Gloucestershire resident, said: \"Whilst I am relieved that marksmen failed to slaughter the number of badgers they intended to in Gloucestershire, it's clear that their inability to achieve their kill target in both cull zones represents the latest in what has become a catalogue of failures of these disastrous pilot culls to deliver against Defra's own criteria.</p><p></p><p>\"Instead of lurching towards an extension to prolong this pointless waste of resources, time and animals' lives, Defra must surely now admit that its badger cull policy is in tatters and and must be abandoned in favour of a more science-led, humane and acceptable approach to controlling bovine TB.\"</p><p></p><p></p><p>More than half of the British public deem the pilot culls to be a failure, <a href=\"http://www.hsi.org/world/united_kingdom/news/releases/2013/10/badger_cull_failure_poll_101613.html\" title=\"\">according to a YouGov poll of 1,805 adults published on Wednesday</a> and commissioned by the HSI-UK, which found just 15% thought the culls had been a success.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420233709|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|33ca9a58a31b629cfc69fa4aeb2b6a957d8d1c3b -->",

        "headline":"Social mobility tsar: ministers not doing enough to tackle inequality and poverty",
        "body":"<p>The government's attempts to achieve greater social mobility in Britain are being trumped by the economic and fiscal headwinds driving inequality, the first report from the social mobility and child poverty commission has concluded.</p><p>The commission, chaired by the former Labour minister Alan Milburn, finds that the coalition will miss its child poverty target by a long way and that pensioners are not bearing their share of the burden of fiscal consolidation.</p><p>The government is making efforts to correct this,but not enough \"to move the dial\", the commission concludes, calling for pensioners' perks such as the winter fuel allowance and free TV licences to be withdrawn.</p><p>Milburn says a fundamental change is underway in which there is growing insecurity among average income families, not just lower income families. \"Material disadvantage is more pronounced at the bottom of society but is far more widespread than people imagine,\" he says.</p><p>\"When combined with rising house prices, university fees and youth unemployment these factors may have induced a sense of fear among many average income families parents that their children will be worse off than they were.\"</p><p>Milburn said: \"[The] ambition to end child poverty that the previous government set is going to be missed by a considerable margin, possibly by as much as 2 million children in relative poverty.</p><p>\"There is precious little sign of a decade-long trend of bottom half stagnating in terms of earnings coming to an end.\"</p><p>The report warns: \"If, as seems likely, the recovery sees the trend of the last decade continuing - where the top part of the society prospers and the bottom half stagnates – inequalities will grow and the rungs of the social ladder will grow further apart.\"</p><p>It says social elites have not opened up, whether at the top universities or top professions. \"We see a danger that social mobility, having risen in the middle of the last century then flatlined in the end, could go into reverse in the first part of this century.\"</p><p>On child poverty, the commission finds that the UK has gone from having one of the highest levels in Europe to a rate near the average over the last 15 years.</p><p>Numbers of children in relative poverty have fallen recently but those in absolute poverty increased by more than 275,000 in 2011-12. Two thirds of poor children are now in working households. It adds that numbers of young people unemployed for more than two years or more is at a 20-year high.</p><p>Overall, the report finds: \"Fiscal consolidation has been regressive, with the bottom 20% in society making a bigger contribution than all but the top 20%.</p><p>It has also been inter-generationally unfair. Pensioners have been protected but families with children (32% of working-age families) bear half the cost of tax and benefit changes and almost two-thirds of spending cuts.</p><p>On education, the report finds \"most deprived areas still have 30% fewer good schools and get fewer good teachers than the least deprived. Schools in London are improving most but other places are falling behind for disadvantaged students including parts of middle England; top universities have not progressed as far as universities as a whole.\"</p><p>Responding before the report was published, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said the report \"makes some debatable assertions, including about the appropriate fiscal consolidation between different age groups – punishing pensioners is not going to help a single child achieve more in life\".</p><p>He also said the government needed to make childcare work for those on low incomes because \"the cost of dealing with these problems is now falling unfairly on working families\".</p><p>He added: \"In opposition I accused Labour of having squandered a golden age during their time in office. It was not until I came into government that I realised how true this was. The coalition has faced difficult times and yet has done far more to solve long-term problems and build an open society than Labour managed at a time of plenty.\"</p><p>The commission says two-thirds of Britain's poor children are now in families where an adult works; this compared with less than half in 1997. The principal problem is those working parents simply do not earn enough to escape poverty.</p><p>\"The UK has now one of the highest rates of low pay in the developed world. The national minimum wage is now worth £1,000 less in real terms than it was in 2008.</p><p>\"Today 4.8 million workers earn less than the living wage. Too often the working poor are the forgotten people of Britain. A comprehensive approach to tackling in-work poverty is the missing piece of the government's policy jigsaw.\"</p><p>In what is likely to lead to a row with business, Milburn says employers will need to pay staff more and provide more training. The report recommends half of all firms should offer apprenticeships.</p><p>It suggests the government should renew its drive to eliminate long-term youth unemployment, and give the low pay commission a wider remit. It also calls for the government to reallocate funding for childcare from higher rate taxpayers to help those on universal credit meet more of their childcare costs.</p><p>The report says there should be a fairer inter-generational share of the fiscal consolidation plan, recommending higher pay for teachers in deprived areas, and further education colleges.</p><p>Setting out how pensioners are benefitting in this parliament, Milburn points out that state pension costs are going up by 17.5% during the course of the parliament – £13bn in 2013-14 prices – a sum equivalent to more than half of the savings from welfare reforms planned for 2014-15.</p><p>Milburn's report said: \"We do not believe favouring pensioners over their children and grandchildren will be a sustainable position over the long-term if a meaningful dent is to be made in the UK's high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility.\"</p><p>The 250-page report is likely to mined by the political parties for the figures that suit their cause most, but also by social scientists seeking out long-term trends in society.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420230618|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|937a236748aff85c1f23d60f582943147f8a7800 -->",

        "headline":"Labour vows to impose new tax on payday lenders",
        "body":"<p>Labour would impose a levy on the profits of payday lenders that would be used to double the amount of public funding for low-cost alternatives, such as credit unions.</p><p>The levy is intended to raise an additional £13m from the much reviled payday loans industry, and will be seen as another attempt by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, to take the side of the consumer against \"profiteering capitalism\".</p><p>Miliband will also confirm that Labour would impose a cap on the cost of credit and give councils the power to stop the spread of payday lending shops in town centres.</p><p>He will announce the next steps in his cost of living campaign as he also reveals Stella Creasy, the new shadow minister for competition and consumer affairs, will lead Labour's campaign against legal loan sharks.</p><p>It comes on the day that the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, urges Anglicans to help the formation of credit unions in their localities as a way of beating back the payday lenders.</p><p>Creasy has been campaigning energetically on the issue for more than two years, and has played a part in forcing the Office of Fair Trading to demand reforms from the industry. Her transfer from shadow home affairs team to the shadow business team gives her formal party responsibility for the issue for the first time.</p><p>Miliband will say the levy will be in addition to the levies the payday industry is due in April to hand to the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to help fund services such as debt advice.</p><p>He will claim the payday loans industry is making very high profits, and this levy need not lead to an increase in the cost of loans.</p><p>Labour says it will consult on the level of rate of the proposed cap on the cost of credit and details of its addition to the levy, but the intention is to double the income due to be received from existing levies, bringing £26m in total from the industry.</p><p>David Cameron said he was open to the idea of a cap on payday lenders at prime minister's questions on Wednesday, saying: \"We continue to look at the issue of a cap and I don't think we should rule that out.\"</p><p>But he added: \"We do have to bear in mind what has been found out in other countries and through our own searches about whether a cap would prove effective.\"</p><p>Earlier in the year the coalition allowed amendments to give powers for the FCA to introduce a cap.</p><p>But Labour claims the FCA is reluctant to use these powers, and the party has criticised the government for not doing more to speed up the decision.</p><p>Miliband has also promised to change planning law to make it easier for councils to prevent payday lenders filling a high street where banks close. Labour suggests that councils should be given powers to assert that a change from a bank to payday lender represents a change of planning use and can therefore be blocked by the council.</p><p>Miliband is on Thursday expected to say: \"The market in payday lending has doubled in just four years. Almost a third of payday loans taken out in Britain at the moment are to cover the cost of people's gas and electricity bills. For too many people the end of the month is their own personal credit crunch.</p><p>\"It is right that companies that benefit from people's financial plight accept their responsibilities.\"</p><p>Creasey will say: \"Across the country Sharkstoppers and Debtbusters campaigners are working to address the damage payday lending debt is doing to the finances of millions of families.</p><p>\"Whether helping to increase the capital that credit unions have to enable them to lend more, kicking these companies out of football grounds and shopping centres or supporting debt advice to those caught in the spiral of debt by the practices of these firms these are the people that are dealing firsthand with this government's failure to learn from other countries in capping the cost of credit.\"</p><p>Welby said the aim was to double the number of credit unions over five years, adding the church could do more to help the formation of credit unions themselves, including through the formation of a Church Mutual Credit Union.</p><p>In a message on Thursday he writes: \"Our faith in Christ calls us to love the poor and vulnerable with our actions. That is why churches must be actively involved in supporting the development of real lending alternatives such as credit unions. That is not an optional activity, but a fundamental part of our witness and service to God's people.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420227569|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|a7088c70e60648f82c80e595925969afd8158ddb -->",

        "body":"<p>Teaching unions have claimed significant success from the latest in a series of one-day strikes over pay, pension and working conditions, with many hundreds of schools completely or partly closed across London and the south-east as well as the north-east and south-west of England.</p><p>However, the Department for Education disputed the scale of the disruption, saying its figures suggested only 27% of schools in affected regions were entirely shut.</p><p>The NASUWT, which is organising the walkout along with the other main teachers' union, the NUT, said the strike had gained significant support and caused major disruption. Teachers in the east of England, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside walked out on 1 October, and there will be a national one-day strike later this year, part of a bitter and increasingly personal confrontation with the education secretary, Michael Gove.</p><p>The unions have held public rallies in Durham, Bristol and London to coincide with the strikes. An NASUWT spokeswoman said around 2,000 people marched in Durham, and had enjoyed significant support from passersby: \"When we marched through the city centre we got cheered and clapped all the way. It seems like we've got a lot of parental support and public support.\"</p><p>The union did not have a figure for the school closures, but the spokeswoman said it appeared significant: \"We haven't got any numbers or percentages, but the overwhelming majority of members have joined the strike action, and most schools are either closed, partially closed or affected in some way.\"</p><p>Details from local authorities and newspapers have suggested significant disruption. A list of schools in the Newcastle Chronicle showed the majority closed or partially open. <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/schools-strike-chaos-forces-parents-to-take-the-day-off-to-look-after-children-sent-home-8886282.html\" title=\"\">Reports from London</a> suggested the worst-affected local authorities saw up to 90% of schools affected, with only <a href=\"http://www.hounslow.gov.uk/index/education_and_learning/schools_and_colleges/strike.htm\" title=\"\">eight out of 70 fully open in Hounslow</a> and seven of 75 fully open in Redbridge.</p><p>The picture in the south-west was more mixed. Cornwall council <a href=\"http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Parents-face-disruptions-teacher-strikes-hit/story-19948865-detail/story.html#axzz2hydOqQCD\" title=\"\">has given a tally</a> of 107 out of 272 schools affected. Devon council <a href=\"http://www.devonschoolclosures.info/\" title=\"\">listed several dozen closed or part-closed schools</a>, with a <a href=\"http://www.somerset.gov.uk/irj/public/news/directory/articles?rid=/guid/f0bac483-b346-3010-3d8a-ebe00c417eab\" title=\"\">similar situation in Somerset</a>.</p><p>In Kent, meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/Teachers-strike-October-17-List-Kent-schools/story-19940660-detail/story.html#axzz2hyiVc5aS\" title=\"\">36 schools were entirely shut for the day with another 67 not fully open</a>.</p><p>A DfE statement said its figures, based on a tally of relevant local authorities, said 27% of schools were entirely closed. A DfE spokeswoman called the strike \"disappointing\", saying all it did was disrupt parents' lives, harm education and \"damage the reputation of the profession\".</p><p>The unions argue they have been pushed into strike action because the DfE, and particularly Gove, have refused to properly negotiate over changes to pay, working conditions and pensions, notably the planned introduction of performance-related pay and an end to automatic incremental pay rises. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/05/teachers-england-strike-pay-pensions\" title=\"\">Announcing the strike plan last month</a>, the general secretary of NASUWT, Chris Keates, said the responsibility lay \"entirely with the secretary of state\".</p><p>The DfE argues that the majority of parents support performance-related pay and don't want teachers to walk out.</p><p>Gove is in the US this week. The junior education minister, David Laws, called the strike \"bad for pupils and bad for parents\". He said: \"I don't believe this strike is justified and it is not going to change government policy.\"</p><p>Speaking on ITV's Daybreak, Laws said: \"These are reforms that are taking place across the whole of the public sector. They are, I'm afraid, necessary in these very difficult times where we have to get the budget back under control. Most teachers, I believe, accept that.</p><p>\"The right way to fix education policy is either by talking with the government or through the ballot box, and not taking industrial action. I think that is the view of the vast majority of teachers who I don't think will be striking today even in those areas where the NUT and NASUWT are trying to take action.\"</p><p>Keates said teachers were dedicated and \"do not take strike action lightly\". She added: \"No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or  unreasonableness of teachers. It is the failure and unreasonableness of the secretary of state, who day in, day out is disrupting the education of children and young people through his attacks on the teaching profession.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420254629|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|9b58358e7deb66db5212c3236b98500f74eb06b7 -->",

A Kremlin statement about the leaders' telephone call made no mention of the activists.</p><p>The Greenpeace members, who come from nearly 20 countries, have been ordered to be held until late November pending further investigation.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/08/russia-rejects-bail-appeals-greenpeace-piracy\" title=\"\">Courts have denied bail to a number of them in the past week</a>, including the American captain of the Arctic Sunrise. On Wednesday, judges in the northern Russian city of Murmansk denied bail to four more people – Anthony Perrett of Britain, Gizem Akhan of Turkey, Jonathan Beauchamp of New Zealand and Francesco Pisanu of France.</p><p>The piracy charges, punishable by up to 15 years' jail, appear aimed at sending a message that Moscow will not tolerate attempts to disrupt its development of the resource-rich Arctic.</p><p>Greenpeace says the protest at the rig, owned by state-controlled Russian energy company Gazprom, was peaceful and calls the piracy charges absurd and unfounded.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/25/vladimir-putin-greenpeace-kenya-mall-attack\" title=\"\">Putin has said the activists were not pirates</a> but that they had violated international law. The head of the Kremlin's human rights advisory body has said he would ask prosecutors to withdraw the piracy charges.</p><p>Investigators have also said more charges will be pressed against some protesters as drugs and other suspect items had been found on the ship. Greenpeace denies there were any illegal items aboard.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420233088|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|901ce09a84bb538bed50057cdb5e98e0315482ce -->",

        "body":"<p>Crime levels are continuing to fall steadily, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_331209.pdf\" title=\"\">according to the latest statistics,</a> with offences recorded by the police in England and Wales dropping by 5% over the past year.</p><p>Latest responses to the annual crime survey – the other official measure of offending, based on interviews rather than police figures - show an even greater decline of 7%. to a level that is less than half its peak in 1995.</p><p>Within that overall pattern, however, there are significant exceptions: muggings have risen sharply by 8% and sexual offences are up by 9% over the past 12 months. Fraud is up 21%.</p><p>The increases in sex offences may be due, according to the Office for National Statistics, to a \"Yewtree effect\" following the police operation investigating allegations against Jimmy Savile and other historic sex offences. The publicity is thought to have encouraged more victims to come forward.</p><p>The rise in muggings, which comes under the category of \"theft from the person\", is likely to reflect the fact that more people are carrying expensive mobile phones and electronic gadgets, which makes them easy street targets.</p><p>The increase in fraud is partially attributed to more centralised recording of dishonesty offences by the police. In the year ending June 2013, 230,335 fraud offences were recorded.</p><p>The figures show that there were 3.7m crimes recorded by police to the year ending June 2013, making it the lowest level since the current method of recording offences was begun in 2002/3.</p><p>The higher figure of 8.5m crimes, detailed in the Crime Survey for England and Wales from the past year, is the lowest level since the series of interviews began in 1981. The survey traditionally produces different statistics from police figures because not all crimes are reported to police.</p><p>The survey showed that as many as 800,000 children aged between 10 and 15 experienced crimes.</p><p>There were an additional 1m offences dealt with by the courts in the year ending March 2013 (the latest period for which figures are available), which are not included in the police recorded crime figures. These cover less serious crimes such as speeding offences, which are dealt with by magistrates courts.</p><p>Welcoming new crime statistics for the year to June 2013, the crime prevention minister, Norman Baker said: \"Police reform is working and crime is falling. Recorded crime has dropped yet again, by more than 10% under the coalition government and the crime survey says that crime has more than halved since its peak in 1995.</p><p>\"This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings while cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public.</p><p>\"England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging issues.</p><p>\"That is why we have recently launched the National Crime Agency to tackle the growing threat of serious and organised criminality. The agency also incorporates the new National Cyber Crime Unit to relentlessly pursue cyber-criminals.\"</p><p>Max Chambers, the head of crime and justice, at the Policy Exchange thinktank, said: \"Whether you believe it's as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family.</p><p>\"While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hard core of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable.\"</p><p>Jon Collins, the deputy director of the Police Foundation, an independent policing thinktank, said: \"Nobody knows exactly why some, but not all, forms of crime captured in the official statistics have fallen so substantially and continue to fall, particularly given the current economic circumstances. It is likely to be the product of a number of related factors, including improved security and better policing.</p><p>\"While crimes such as burglary and car crime are clearly not the problem that they once were, it's possible that the official crime figures are just not picking up the extent to which new opportunities for crimes like fraud and counterfeiting have emerged, particularly online.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420236470|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|1432dc0cfd50ea3e9c810c1d0304c234e370ee31 -->",

He added at the time that the initiative was on track to \"fully deliver\" for BBC North and Salford through the course of 2011 and ruled out any \"significant further delays\" in its introduction.</p><p></p><p>However, in May 2013 the BBC Trust announced that the project had \"delivered little or no assets\" and would be scrapped to prevent \"throwing good money after bad\". The initiative was branded a \"complete catastrophe\" by the BBC rrustee Anthony Fry when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/10/bbc-chiefs-accused-misleading-parliament?guni=Article:in%20body%20link\" title=\"\">gave evidence to MPs in June</a>.</p><p></p><p>In a statement, Thompson insisted he gave testimony before MPs \"honestly and in good faith\". He added: \"I did so on the basis of information provided to me at the time by the BBC executives responsible for delivering the project.\"</p><p></p><p>The Commons committee, which scrutinises public spending, is understood to be in the process of securing other BBC witnesses for the hearing – which has been pencilled in for January – but none have been confirmed. It is possible that Thompson will give evidence via video link rather than fly to London.</p><p></p><p>Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, on behalf of the BBC Trust, was expected to have completed its independent review into the failed project last month, but the deadline is now understood to have slipped to before the end of the year. Its conclusions will then be passed to MPs on the public accounts committee. The National Audit Office (NAO) will also be invited to undertake its own review into the project after the PricewaterhouseCoopers inquiry has concluded.</p><p></p><p><em>• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

        "headline":"Plebgate: Mitchell right to feel 'pretty sore' about police treatment, says Clegg",
        "body":"<p>Nick Clegg has said that Andrew Mitchell is right to feel \"pretty sore\" about his treatment at the hands of three police officers who called for him to resign as chief whip last year after allegedly providing a false account of a meeting.</p><p></p><p>The deputy prime minister backed the home secretary, Theresa May, who called for disciplinary action against the representatives of the Police Federation who met Mitchell a month after an altercation with armed officers in Downing Street in September last year.</p><p></p><p>Clegg spoke out after the Independent Police Complaints Commission questioned the behaviour of three representatives of the federation from Warwickshire, West Mercia and West Midlands – Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones – who called on him to resign as chief whip after a meeting in his Sutton Coldfield constituency in October last year.</p><p></p><p>The officers issued their statement on the grounds that Mitchell had failed to give a full account of the Downing Street incident in which he allegedly called an armed officer a \"fucking pleb\" after he refused to allow the then chief whip to wheel his bikes through the gates.</p><p></p><p>But in the IPCC's own report into the incident, issued on Tuesday, the police watchdog called for a panel to determine whether the officers had given a false account after a transcript showed that Mitchell had outlined in some detail the circumstances of the Downing Street incident. Mitchell had told the federation representatives that he had sworn in the presence of the armed officers in Downing Street but had not described them as plebs.</p><p></p><p>Speaking on his weekly phone-in show on LBC radio, Clegg said the IPCC report raised questions about the behaviour of the Police Federation representatives at the meeting.</p><p></p><p>The deputy prime minister said: \"They came straight out of that meeting and claimed that he had not provided them with his side of the story when the subsequent revelation that the meeting had been recorded shows that he made every attempt to try and explain what happened. He said he didn't use the pleb word but he did have an outburst and he apologised for it.</p><p></p><p>\"I think quite rightly people feel: 'Hang on a minute, why did these police officers go into that meeting in his constituency office and then come out and basically say that he needed to resign and give an account of the meeting, which certainly doesn't seem to conform to what happened in the meeting?' I think it is perfectly legitimate for Andrew Mitchell to feel pretty sore about that.\"</p><p></p><p>The deputy prime minister, who was answering a question from a retired police officer who criticised politicians for denigrating the police, said that neither he nor Mitchell wanted to inflame relations with the police. But he said that Mitchell had been treated unfairly.</p><p></p><p>Clegg said: \"I don't think anybody wants – I am sure Andrew Mitchell doesn't want – this to descend into some long-standing slanging match between politicians and the police. That is a bad state of affairs. But on the facts of the case as revealed by the report from the Independent Police Complaints Commission it seems to be pretty clear that those three representatives of the Police Federation who went in to see Andrew Mitchell had every intention not to listen to what he said and every intention to go out and condemn him. Basic fairness says that is not right and it is correct that the IPCC has revealed that.</p><p></p><p>\"The IPCC report doesn't pull its punches. It says there are serious question marks about their honesty and their integrity. When the independent body that is there says there are questions about the integrity and honesty of police officers of course you should consider disciplinary action&nbsp;… Something clearly went wrong when these&nbsp;… representatives went into Andrew Mitchell's office with what appears to be only one intention in mind: to basically go out and tell the world's press that he needed to resign.\"</p><p></p><p>Clegg's remarks came after the IPCC indicated that three forces had watered down the conclusions of an investigation into the Police Federation meeting with Mitchell.</p><p></p><p>Hours after David Cameron said his former chief whip was owed an apology, it emerged that the IPCC's deputy chair, Deborah Glass, had written to confirm that an initial investigation had concluded that three officers from the federation who met Mitchell should face a misconduct hearing.</p><p></p><p>On Wednesday, 24 hours after the IPCC issued its report, Glass sent a letter to Ron Ball, the police and crime commissioner for Warwickshire, to clarify her position..</p><p></p><p>She said: \"We had no concerns about the quality of the investigation carried out by West Mercia police. It was the conclusion we disagreed with. In that regard, I note that in the first draft report submitted to the IPCC in July the senior investigating officer did in fact conclude that there was a case to answer for misconduct, although their final report, submitted in August, did not.\"</p><p></p><p>It is understood that the call for a misconduct hearing was dropped after more senior figures in the three forces said they disagreed with the initial findings of the West Mercia investigating officer. The Warwickshire, West Mercia and West Midlands police forces said that it had been decided that the three officers should not face misconduct proceedings.</p><p></p><p>Richard Ottaway, a Tory MP who is close to Mitchell, told Channel 4 News: \"[The chief constable of West Mercia] has got to explain exactly what has happened. If it is apparent that he has been a part of the change of the conclusions then frankly he has got to consider his position. If they [the West Midlands and Warwickshire chief constables] were part of it as well they are in the same position.\"</p><p></p><p>In a statement rejecting a disciplinary hearing, the three forces said on Tuesday: \"Despite a thorough investigation under the supervision of the IPCC we do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to support the view that the officers concerned should face misconduct proceedings.</p><p></p><p>\"Our view is that the officers have demonstrated poor judgment in arranging and attending the meeting in the first place. In light of this, our position is that management action is a proportionate response.\"</p><p></p><p>Glass had written to Ball after he criticised her report. He said: \"This is extremely disappointing. The officers concerned have not been given justice.\"</p><p></p><p>There was no response from the West Mercia force to the Glass letter on Wednesday.</p><p></p><p>The IPCC deputy chair wrote: \"While the circumstances of this case may have been unusual, it is not at all unusual for the IPCC to disagree with the findings of a supervised investigation. This is in fact explicitly provided for in the Police Reform Act, when a complainant can appeal to the IPCC against the outcome of a supervised investigation.\"</p><p></p><p>The row between the IPCC and the police and crime commissioner came after the prime minister said the conduct of the officers who met Mitchell had been unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>Cameron told MPs he supported Theresa May, who had said the police were \"quite wrong\" not to take disciplinary action.</p><p></p><p>He said: \"I agree 100% with what the home secretary said yesterday and I think we should be clear about what we are discussing here. The whole case about what happened outside 10 Downing Street, that's with the CPS and we have to leave that on one side until they make their decision.</p><p></p><p>\"What's being discussed here is the fact that … the former chief whip had a meeting with Police Federation officers in his committee where he gave a full account of what had happened, they left that meeting and claimed he had given them no account at all.</p><p></p><p>\"Fortunately this meeting was recorded so he has been able to prove that what he said was true and what the police officers said was untrue. He is owed an apology. The conduct of these officers was not acceptable. These things should be properly investigated, as the home secretary has said.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420239464|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|d46635f331753f850636a91e9fee2dda84a89cbc -->",

        "body":"<p>More than 29 million people are living in slavery, according to the <a href=\"http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/\" title=\"\">first index to attempt to measure the scale of modern-day slavery</a> on a country-by-country basis.</p><p></p><p>The index, published by the Walk Free Foundation on Thursday, ranks 162 countries and identifies risk factors for enslavement and the government responses.</p><p></p><p>The research found that around 10 countries hold about 70% of the world's slaves. India has the highest number of people enslaved in absolute terms, approximately 14 million, almost half the total worldwide. China has 2.9 million enslaved and Pakistan is third, with an estimated 2 million.</p><p></p><p>Lack of data has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/aug/29/slavery-forced-labour-data\" title=\"\">long frustrated anti-slavery campaigners</a>, who argue that without knowing who is being exploited and where, it is impossible to properly tackle the problem.</p><p></p><p>Nick Grono, CEO of the Walk Free Foundation, said: \"There is no index out there, and it's critical to measuring the scale of the problem on a country-by-country basis because that informs policy responses. Measuring a hidden crime is very challenging, but there are efforts to measure domestic abuse and drug trafficking. A lot of it boils down to taking the best data on reported issues and then looking at the scale of the unreported or 'dark' problems.\"</p><p></p><p>The index builds on statistics compiled by the  International Labour Organisation, which estimates  <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_181961/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">21 million people worldwide are in forced labour</a>.</p><p></p><p>\"It's very similar to our method,\" said Grono, \"going country by country, taking the reported data and then estimating the 'dark' figures. They haven't published country-by-country data.\"</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/socsci/staff/academic-staff/bales,-kevin.aspx\" title=\"\">Kevin Bales</a>, the lead academic behind the index, has written extensively about the issue of modern-day slavery. He said the index is the culmination of many years work looking at how to make campaigns more effective. \"I've been anxious to do this for getting on 15 years. It's a hidden crime, but there is a lot of collection of secondary source of information, NGO records, police records. We basically ransacked the planet to get those.\"</p><p></p><p>For Bales, the data is the first step in being able to tackle exploitation, wherever it exists. \"Let's really focus on those countries, all of those countries are going to get some very devoted attention,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Grono acknowledged the controversial nature of any attempt to compile hard facts on slavery and human trafficking, which are by their nature conducted in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>\"We recognise the data is not that strong; we want to be open about this. If a government says they don't agree [with the data], we will say great, let's work with a national statistics office to do a study across the country to try and analyse the scale of the problem.\"</p><p></p><p>As well as a tool to hold governments to account, part of the challenge for the index authors will be to persuade researchers that the data is useful.</p><p></p><p>Not everyone is convinced. Bridget Anderson, deputy director of the <a href=\"http://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/?id=50\" title=\"\">Centre on Migration, Policy and Society</a> at the University of Oxford, who has researched and written about human trafficking, said any attempt to gather \"unjust situations\" across the planet and label them as \"slavery\" is already getting off on the wrong foot.</p><p></p><p>\"I wouldn't find it useful. You have a definitional problem, everything depends on the definition and if you use tricky words like 'forced', you are already straying into difficult territory,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>\"Say with sex trafficking: if you are dealing with people who have very constrained choices, and you are so horrified with the choices, you say you are not allowed to make that choice, it's too terrible for me on my nice sofa to tolerate. Is it right that you shut that choice down? It's unjust that someone could be in such a situation where poor options are seen as great opportunities.\"</p><p></p><p>\"Slavery is such an emotive term. It has an incredible emotive power, which is what a lot of campaigners use and draw on productively, but then people engage with their emotions but don't think about it politically. It becomes de-politicised.\"</p><p></p><p>But Bales is already working on next year's index, in which he plans to include more research on the ground in the form of random sample surveys. He is passionate about his cause and believes the accurate labelling and tracking of the \"disease\" of slavery is the first step in beating it.</p><p></p><p>\"It's a lot like epidemiology,\" he said, \"we have to get in there and vaccinate – but first we have to figure out where the disease is, what are the risk factors. So in the same way that you do that with an epidemic, it's not always in the same place, there are different supporting factors … It's been a lot of work but it's been very exciting.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420175205|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|458362118dafa84693917fa35aa089a55158086f -->",

        "body":"<p>The shadow equalities minister, Gloria De Piero, has appealed to the press to \"call off the hunt\" for topless pictures that she posed for as a teenager after learning a news agency was offering thousands of pounds for them.</p><p>The former political journalist and television presenter tackled the issue of media intrusion directly by writing an article saying she must be allowed to get on with her job.</p><p></p><p>It came after De Piero gave an interview saying she understood why young girls posed naked for photoshoots because she had done the same aged just 15, thinking it was a way of improving her circumstances.</p><p>\"I've always said I don't blame the girls. I understand how they might think it would be a way out,\" she told the Times earlier this week.</p><p>After giving that interview, De Piero learned a news agency claiming to be acting on behalf of a national newspaper had offered several thousand pounds to obtain the pictures.</p><p>Writing on her website, De Piero said: \"The offer was made to the owner of a building in Bradford. I understand that he was offered money for access to the building and a further payment if the pictures were found.</p><p>\"I have talked about why I posed for these pictures in interviews before. I thought at the time it was a way of improving my circumstances. This is part of my story and part of who I am. I can't change it now but this happened over 20 years ago.</p><p>\"It is now time to call off the hunt for these pictures and let me get on with the job I was elected to do, representing the people of Ashfield and serving in the shadow cabinet.\"</p><p>The 40-year-old MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire argued that people of diverse backgrounds should be able to go into politics without fear of being haunted by things they had done in their teens.</p><p>\"I don't think anyone wants politics to be open only to those people who were planning their political careers in their teens,\" she said.</p><p>\"I would like to see a politics that represents our country, including many more women from all walks of life, and that is something I am passionately committed to help bring about.</p><p>\"No one should have to worry that something they did when they were young might prevent them from serving their community or getting involved in politics at a local or national level.\"</p><p>In her interview with the Times, De Piero said Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader, had been very supportive when the existence of the photographs was revealed.</p><p></p><p>She said Harman urged her not to change or get \"buttoned up\", saying: \"Don't worry, it's absolutely fine, Gloria, we wouldn't judge you for that.\"</p><p></p><p>The MP also revealed she decided to concentrate on her political career rather than having children several years ago.</p><p></p><p>\"I'm 40 now and I've always said I don't want kids, but that decision will be removed from me incredibly soon,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>\"Different rules seem to apply to women. When do you ever hear someone saying: 'Oh you might not want to employ a dad, he might have to take time off for the kids'?</p><p>\"The most important thing is being fulfilled and this job makes me very fulfilled.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246257|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|a2430a7c57470e12658ba72c2eddfb56f836b3d3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Outdoor air pollution has been officially classified as carcinogenic by the cancer arm of the World Health Organisation.</p><p>The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said air pollution from traffic and industrial fumes was a definite cause of lung cancer and also linked to bladder cancer. The strong verdict from IARC, a cautious body that pronounces only when the evidence is strong, will put pressure on governments to take action.</p><p>\"The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances,\" said Dr Kurt Straif, head of the IARC monographs section, which assesses evidence and publishes official warnings. \"We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths.\"</p><p>Air pollution is already known to increase the risks for other diseases, including heart and respiratory disease. The numbers of those exposed to air pollution have risen rapidly as countries have industrialised. The most recent data suggests there were 233,000 deaths from lung cancer caused by air pollution around the world in 2010.</p><p>IARC monitors studies on cancer risks and issues official monographs when it has come to conclusions about a potential carcinogen. It has put out warnings about individual chemicals in the air. Diesel engine exhaust, solvents, metals and dusts have all been labelled carcinogenic. This is the first time it has classified air pollution in general as a cause of cancer.</p><p>\"Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants,\" said Dr Dana Loomis, deputy head of the monographs section.</p><p>\"The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution.\"</p><p>The main sources of air pollution are traffic, power stations, industrial and agricultural emissions and heating and cooking fumes from the home, the IARC said. The levels of air pollution vary from place to place, but every country in the world was affected and should do something about it, it said.</p><p>\"Classifying outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic to humans is an important step,\" said the IARC director, Dr Christopher Wild. \"There are effective ways to reduce air pollution and, given the scale of the exposure affecting people worldwide, this report should send a strong signal to the international community to take action without further delay.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420243863|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|4f24b7b27eecbcaf34fde5ff13830dcd45ec1106 -->",

with lung disease and heart disease to closely monitor their symptoms. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Already smoke from bushfires burning in the Blue Mountains region and Muswellbrook areas has been blown east to Sydney city and coastal suburbs.&nbsp;Particle levels are likely to be higher outdoors than indoors, so people sensitive to fine particles should limit the time they spend outside.</p> <p>Bushfires can result in a large amount of smoke particles in the air, even great distances from the fires.&nbsp;The best way to avoid breathing in the smoke is to remain inside with the windows and doors closed, preferably in an air-conditioned building.</p> </blockquote> <p>NSW Health says the particles can&nbsp;cause a variety of health problems, such as itchy or burning eyes, throat irritation or runny nose and aggravate existing illnesses including bronchitis, emphysema and asthma.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525fb0ece4b0010b6627a928\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T10:42:06.111+01:00\">8.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ndrewg/statuses/390769526935003136\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The view North from Newcastle this evening.

        "body":"<p>China's corruption watchdog is investigating the mayor of Nanjing, it has announced, in one of the highest-level cases since the party's crackdown on official abuses began last autumn under the country's new leader, Xi Jinping.</p><p>According to state media, Ji Jianye is being investigated for \"severe violations of discipline and law\" – a euphemism for embezzlement, bribery and other official abuses.</p><p>Such announcements usually lead to charges, trials and convictions for senior officials, but the process can take months or years.</p><p>Although disgraced politburo member <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/china-move-on-bo-xilai\" title=\"\">Bo Xilai</a> and former minister of railways <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/liu-zhijun-sentenced-death-corruption\" title=\"\">Liu Zhijun</a> were convicted in recent trials, their cases began under the previous administration.</p><p>Ji became acting mayor of the prosperous eastern city in 2009, and was formally appointed the following year. He was previously mayor and party boss of Yangzhou, the hometown of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin.</p><p>The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said only that he was under investigation, but the website of the People's Daily, the official party newspaper, drew links to Ji's oversight of mammoth infrastructure projects in the city and his connections to a detained construction tycoon. Nanjing media claimed that a sum of about 20m yuan (£2m) was involved in the case.</p><p>\"This is not a high-profile item on the Nanjing news websites and the announcement was terse. I suspect this is the beginning of a wider effort to look at Nanjing city government,\" said Russell Leigh Moses, an expert on Chinese politics and dean of the Beijing Centre for Chinese Studies.</p><p>\"Increasingly, central news coverage has taken a more jaundiced view of certain events in Nanjing and has been more critical of some circumstances there, particularly related to property and the economy.\"</p><p>The redevelopment of the city in the runup to next year's Youth Olympic Games has led to friction, with public protests when <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4191-The-battle-for-Nanjing-s-trees\" title=\"\">trees were uprooted</a> due to subway construction.</p><p>Xi has pledged to root out corruption at all levels, in the latest of the party's repeated campaigns against the problem. High-profile recent cases include that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/13/chinese-official-investigated-corruption\" title=\"\">Liu Tienan</a>, the deputy head of China's main economic planning body.</p><p>Most striking have been the investigations of numerous officials <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/xi-jinping-china-communist-leadership\" title=\"\">with ties to former domestic security chief Zhou Yongkang</a>, who retired from the politburo standing committee in the once-a-decade transition of power to a new generation of leaders.</p><p>They include Jiang Jiemin, the director of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. He was previously chairman of the China National Petroleum Corporation – formerly overseen by Zhou – where <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/business/global/china-expands-inquiry-on-graft-to-oil-executives.html\" title=\"\">four senior staff</a> are being investigated. Numerous officials and business people have been questioned or detained in Sichuan province, which Zhou ran for several years, including his former secretary.</p><p>The focus on the oil sector and Sichuan, and investigators' interest in the business activities of his son, Zhou Bin, have led to suggestions that Zhou is the ultimate target. That would be a bold move since senior party leaders have previously avoided targeting their peers or predecessors; sceptical political analysts say the inquiries may be intended to send a message to Zhou, others in his position and the oil industry, without further action being taken.</p><p>Critics of the overall anti-corruption drive say increased transparency and accountability are required to eradicate the problem and warn that individual cases often have as much to do with political manoeuvring as the egregiousness of an individual's offences.</p><p>\"Using legal means against political rivalries has become fashionable, especially with the anti-corruption campaign. If you want to get rid of a political competitor, people can use legal or disciplinary measures,\" said Bo Zhiyue, an expert on elite Chinese politics.</p><p>\"It's a very interesting political game going on. Everyone wants to claim some credit for the anti-corruption campaign; it's very much like in the 1950s when you had to find a rightist in your locality and there was even a quota system.</p><p>\"I don't think there's a quota system now, but different localities like to make some show of their efforts in the campaign. It will be a shame if they can't find any corrupt officials and will be to their credit to find someone relatively high-ranking.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420225333|2013-10-17T12:53:07Z|3671b35d112d70cd96a8f655589d93e0022153e6 -->",
