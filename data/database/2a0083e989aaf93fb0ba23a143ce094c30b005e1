        "headline":"Yes, Angry Birds Go! could knock Nintendo's Mario Kart off its perch",
        "body":"<p>Hot on the heels of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/sep/18/angry-birds-star-wars-2-review-iphone-ipad-android\">Angry Birds Star Wars II</a>, Finnish firm Rovio has announced plans for its next game. <a href=\"http://go.angrybirds.com/\">Angry Birds Go!</a> breaks out of the bird-hurling formula though: it's a Mario Kart-style karting game.</p><p>It will be released on 11 December for iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8 and BlackBerry 10 devices, making it Rovio's most ambitious cross-platform launch yet. Like Angry Birds Star Wars II, there'll be physical \"Telepods\" toys capable of being scanned in to the game, as well as a blitz of licensed products.</p><p>Angry Birds Go! will also be Rovio's first game \"built from the ground up as a free-to-play title\", with revenues coming entirely from in-app purchases and advertising. Neither is new to the Angry Birds series, but until now the games have only been free-to-play on Android.</p><p>Rovio originally <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/jun/12/angry-birds-go\">announced plans for Angry Birds Go! in June</a> with a teaser animation, but revealed full details at this week's Brand Licensing Europe conference in London, while publishing a gameplay trailer on YouTube:</p><p>So, Angry Birds Go! versus Mario Kart. Even talking about these two games in the same breath may see steam coming out of the ears of hardcore Nintendo fans. But here are a few reasons why it's not a ridiculous idea at all.</p><p>First, Mario Kart isn't available on the billion-ish Android and iOS devices that are currently out there in the wild, so there's no direct competition here. Rovio may be racing onto Nintendo's turf in terms of genre, but for devices, this is the Finnish firm's home territory.</p><p>Second, there's a generation of children growing up who've not played Mario Kart, don't own a DS or 3DS, but who a.) love Angry Birds and b.) have access to a smartphone or tablet to play games on. They're ripe for Rovio's brand to spread its wings into other genres.</p><p>Here's an interesting tag cloud from a recent survey by children's marketing firm SuperAwesome, which asked British children what present they'd most like to unwrap on Christmas morning:</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420132967'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381920524398/superawesome.jpg' alt='SuperAwesome word cloud' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This is a big part of the potential audience for Angry Birds Go. Squint, and you'll spot Nintendo, Pokemon and other traditional gaming brands.</p><p>These kids don't come with preconceptions that Mario Kart is the yardstick by which all other karting games should be judged, and even if their Apple-dominated present requests turn out to be wishful thinking, they'll be able to play Rovio's next game on their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/23/tesco-hudl-tablet-computer-review\">Tesco Hudl</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/kindle-fire\">Amazon Kindle Fire</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/15/argos-mytablet-android-tablet-hudl-kindle-nexus-7\">Argos MyTablet</a> or whatever other device ends up in their stocking.</p><p>British telecoms regulator Ofcom's recent <a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/media-literacy/october-2013/research07Oct2013.pdf\">Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes</a> report claimed that 42% of British 5-15 year-olds now use a tablet, and 23% of them play games on it. That's still less than the 60% of 5-15 year-olds using a dedicated handheld games device, but the latter percentage has fallen from 69% in 2012:</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420132968'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381921587595/ofcom-stats.jpg' alt='Ofcom stats' width='460' height='492' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ofcom's stats comparing devices that children use to play games at home</figcaption></figure><p>That's some context to the suggestion that Angry Birds Go! should be seen as a viable challenger to Mario Kart, particularly for younger gamers. Of course, the game itself will have to be excellent: the trailer makes it look good, but that's what trailers are designed to do.</p><p>One final point on the risks for Rovio, though. Angry Birds has fans of all ages, but a lot of them are children, which is why going fully free-to-play has to be handled carefully by the company.</p><p>You've been able to buy power-ups in Angry Birds games for a long time now, and they were more to the fore in Angry Birds Star Wars II than ever. But with regulators scrutinising children's apps' use of in-app purchases carefully, Angry Birds Go! has a challenge ahead.</p><p>To put it another way: no child ever spent £1,000 of parental cash on mushrooms in Mario Kart. Going free-to-play with a new genre is a big opportunity for Rovio, but it will be firmly in mind that the Angry Birds brand it created from scratch is trusted by parents around the world. Keeping that trust will be the company's priority.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420124806|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|753f927781b6920eb094c385c3f70d9af9e18c6a -->",

        "body":"<p>Ah, the Isle of Skye, famed for its incredible natural beauty, it's huddled towns, it's looming castles – and now for its association with blockbusting video game franchise, Skylanders. In a bizarre yet no doubt canny joint marketing exercise, the jewel of the Inner Hebrides has been virtually twinned with Skylands, the fantasy setting of the Skylanders series, which has made over $1.5bn (£935m) in revenue for publisher Activision. The announcement marks the imminent release of the latest title, Skylanders: Swap Force.</p><p>\"The Isle of Skye is renowned for its stunning landscapes, which possess an almost ethereal quality, and its abundance of wildlife, making it the perfect place to virtually twin with Skylands, home to Skylanders Swap Force,\" said VisitScotland's Alan Mackenzie. </p><p>\"We're thrilled to be teaming up with the Skylanders franchise for this unique partnership, which will help raise the profile of this beautiful part of the world, encouraging families to enjoy a real-life adventure on the Isle of Skye – nowhere else on Earth comes close!\"</p><p>The Skylanders games pitch an array of fantastical creatures against the evil portal master Kaos, in a series of child-friendly adventures. The game is famed for its compatibility with a  range of action figures, which can be placed on a 'portal of power' (or 'plastic USB peripheral'), thereby transferring their digital likeness into the onscreen action. Wash Buckler, one of the new characters from the Swap Force game has apparently visited the island in a sort of diplomatic mission.</p><p>\"We're thrilled to welcome the Skylanders characters to the Highlands,\" said councillor Thomas Prag of the Highland council's planning environment and development committee. \"This is an unusual project, as we can't sign an actual deed of twinning due to the limitations getting paper work to the Skylands.\"</p><p>Anyway, it is certainly more amusing than the time the BBC One Show twinned itself with my home town of Frome. Plus, this story naturally got us thinking about other possible twinning endeavours between real and video game locations. This is the best we could come up with at short notice:</p><h2><strong>Four other possible twins between real and video game locations</strong></h2><p><strong>Oakvale, the Fable series</strong><br />A quaint seaside town in the fictitious land of Albion, famed as the birthplace of the game's lead protagonist.<br /><strong>Oak Vale, Mississippi</strong><br />A quaint inland town in the south of the state, between Lawrence and Jefferson Davis counties, famed for … well, it has quite a nice <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Oak-Vale-MS/164884613592205\">historical FaceBook page</a>.

        "headline":"Watch Dogs and The Crew delayed",
        "body":"<p>Ubisoft has announced that two of its key forthcoming releases, Watch Dogs and The Crew, have been delayed. In an investor conference-call on Tuesday, the publisher suggested that both of the ambitious projects needed more development time. </p><p>Cyberpunk surveillance thriller Watch Dogs was due to be a launch title on the forthcoming PlayStation 4 and Xbox One machines. However, all versions of the title, including current gen iterations, have been delayed until spring 2014. </p><p>&quot;Our ambition from the start with Watch Dogs has been to deliver something that embodies what we wanted to see in the next generation of gaming,&quot; Ubisoft announced in a statement. &quot;It is with this in mind that we've made the tough decision to delay the release.&quot;</p><p>The game, which takes place in an open-world alternative version of Chicago and allows players to hack into city computer networks, was considered one of the most intriguing third-party titles in the next-gen launch lineup. Ubisoft has high hopes for the title, expecting it to potentially outsell the respected Assassin's Creed series.</p><p>Meanwhile, the publisher's pan-American open-world racing game, The Crew, which brings massively-multiplayer adventure elements to the driving genre, has been delayed from spring to summer/autumn 2014. &quot;Our long-term goal is to win the next generation,&quot; explained Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot in a statement. </p><p>&quot;The tough decisions we are taking today to fully realise the major potential of our new creations have an impact on our short-term performance. We are convinced that, longer term, they will prove to be the right decisions both in terms of satisfaction for our fans and in terms of value creation for our shareholders. We are building franchises that will become perennial pillars of Ubisoft's financial performance.&quot;</p><p>As a result, the publisher has <a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/433948/ubisoft-to-lose-560m-this-fiscal-over-watch-dogs-and-crew-delay/\">revised down</a> its revenue projections for the fiscal year, chopping $560m (&pound;349m) from the original expectations of $1.94bn. Consumers who have pre-ordered special Watch Dogs bundle packages of the next-gen consoles are being reassured that they won't lose their places in the queue. In the states, Amazon and Gamestop <a href=\"http://www.shacknews.com/article/81598/so-what-happens-to-watch-dogs-ps4-and-xbox-one\">have stated</a> that they will honour pre-orders by swapping out the bundled game for another title. We're waiting to hear similar assurances from UK retailers.</p><p>What the delays show are the pressures of producing original products in the console transition period, when current and forthcoming hardware have to be supported by development teams.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420107601|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|03af7b959c16805f76f4656fdd90940d5e3affce -->",

        "body":"<p>A selection of links, hand-picked by the Guardian games writers.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pokemon-x-y-sell-4m-in-opening-weekend/0122604\">Pokemon X &amp; Y sell 4m in opening weekend | MCV</a></h2><p>Some impressive figures from the world of Pokemon:</p><blockquote><p>The games – the first entries in the Pokemon series on 3DS – sold 4m units between them on Saturday October 12th and Sunday October 13th.</p><p>And Friday October 11th in the UK.</p><p>The impressive number is a new record for the series, although of course that is largely to do with the fact that it's the first time a new Pokemon entry has released simultaneously worldwide.</p><p>The pair also became the fastest selling 3DS games of all time.</p></blockquote><p>GameFreak director Junichi Masuda has teased a Wii U outing in the past, but Nintendo could really do with some Poke-magic on its home console system...</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-14-is-dark-souls-2-going-soft\">Is Dark Souls 2 going soft? | Eurogamer.net</a></h2><p>Guardian regular Simon Parkin hits the dark Souls 2 beta and finds to his shock that he is unable to kill the first shopkeeper he stumbles across – a common feature in most narrative adventure games, but not in Dark Souls. Uh-oh, has the series gone mainstream?</p><blockquote><p>It's a fear exacerbated by the introduction of life gems, glowing pick-ups dropped at random by enemies that regenerate some of your character's health without the need to drink a draft from your precious Estus flask (the main non-magical ways in which to restore your character's life in the previous game). As the Estus Flask could only be refilled by resting at one of the game's intermittent bonfires, one of the few sanctuaries in the Dark Souls universe, life gems appear to be a generous concession to struggling players. </p></blockquote><p>Don't worry though, things go back to normal after this...</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.geek.com/games/image-reveals-the-2ds-is-just-one-giant-display-behind-its-casing-1573990/\">Image reveals the 2DS is just one giant display behind its casing | Geek.com</a></h2><p>A rather amusing discovery about the new 2DS hardware:</p><blockquote><p>It may surprise you to find the 2DS does not contain two displays, even though looking at the device suggests there are two. Nope, as predicted what Nintendo has done is to use one giant screen, but use the casing to block most of it from view.</p></blockquote><p>But why?</p><blockquote><p>Well, it's likely because such a setup works out cheaper than placing two separate displays and double the wiring and supporting components required to make them work. And lets face it, unless you decide to dismantle your 2DS, you'd never know.</p></blockquote><p>Must. Not. Dismantle. 2DS.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-10-14-modern-warfare-2-is-amazon-uks-biggest-seller\">Modern Warfare 2 is Amazon UK's biggest seller | GamesIndustry International</a></h2><p>To celebrate its 15th birthday, Amazon UK has revealed the top ten biggest selling video games on the site. Only one surprise here:</p><blockquote><p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2<br />Call of Duty: Black Ops<br />Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3<br />Grand Theft Auto V<br />Call of Duty: Black Ops II<br />FIFA 10<br />FIFA 13<br />FIFA 12<br />The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim<br />Zumba Fitness</p></blockquote><p>Zumba Fitness?! I'd forgotten what a huge hit this was a couple of years ago!</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/10/11/bayonetta-2-wild-wicked-and-completely-unbelievable\">NYCC: Bayonetta 2 is Wild, Wicked, and Completely Unbelievable | IGN</a></h2><p>Earlier this week, Nintendo was showing off the latest Bayonetta 2 gameplay at the new York Comic Con:</p><blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the rest of the world spun around in the distance. In the midst of this out-of-control thrill ride, the developer's intent becomes clear: Bayonetta, and her snazzy new hairdo, sit at the center of the action. And god forbid if you're her opponent.</p></blockquote><p>Here it is:</p><p>Pretty lively.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.paste.com/issues/week-112/articles/just-dance-2014-the-power-of-pop-music\">Just Dance 2014 - The Power of Pop Music | PASTE.COM</a></h2><p>It's another regular Guardian contributor - this time Cara Ellison, on Ubisoft's dance game and the power of pop:</p><blockquote><p>There's still something delicately placed, finely tuned, almost manipulative about most big trashy pop beats. There's a time, isn't there, when you swagger into a place where the bass is so loud and thrilling and magnetising that everyone forgets that they were halfway through a sentence and are drawn, hypnotised, into the lights. There are moments where you look over and smile because the sweaty limbs you are seeing could be completely mistaken for your own.</p></blockquote><p>Just go and have a look at the photo of Cara, though.

        "headline":"London's Tech City welcomes its first mainland Chinese firm",
        "body":"<p>London&rsquo;s Tech City is getting its first mainland Chinese firm, now that mobile gaming company Rekoo is moving to the capital and building a new development team.</p> <p>The company is one of China&rsquo;s leading mobile game firms, with 500 employees across Asia and 20 million active daily players worldwide. As well as China, it also has a subsidiary in Japan which opened in 2009 and employs 30 people.</p> <p>To begin with, Rekoo will hire 10 people to work out of its tech city offices, but plans to expand this to 25 within three years. The staff members in the new office will market the games to European consumers, but also be involved in localisation work.</p> <p>&ldquo;As a leading light in China&rsquo;s tech scene, Rekoo&rsquo;s decision is another huge boost for the capital&rsquo;s digital industries,&rdquo; said the Mayor of London Boris Johnson. &ldquo;Making the most of the great minds, talented workforce, and market opportunities within immediate access of our Tech City makes absolute sense which is why London is fast becoming the digital capital of the world.&rdquo;</p> <p>As well as convincing Rekoo to come to the UK, Tech City has also been instrumental in getting it set up so quickly. The company has already appointed a European MD, Tony Hughes, and is moving into a full-service office in Shoreditch. &ldquo;They just have to plug in the computers, and they&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; said David Slater of London and Partners, the capital&rsquo;s official promotional organisation.</p> <p>&ldquo;This is a company with 200 million users,&rdquo; Slater added. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve got a customer base like that, they can choose anywhere in the world to build their global business. They&rsquo;ve chosen London, not only London but Tech City, which I think is a great vote of confidence for the Tech City initiative.&rdquo;</p> <p>Rekoo is one of the first Chinese companies to provide games on Facebook, a platform which is still struggling to penetrate the mainland. In its IPO prospectus last year, the social network said its market share in the country was almost zero, and home-grown alternatives like WeChat have filled in the gap.</p> <p>Moving onto Facebook is evidence of Rekoo&rsquo;s outward expansion, but Slater emphasises the &ldquo;two way relationship&rdquo; Rekoo Europe will have. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got 100 million people in asia who are potential customers for UK developed games&hellip; the opportunity it gave as a channel for UK exporters was always part of that greater plan for Rekoo.&rdquo;</p> <p>The company&rsquo;s most popular game, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.funship.findsomething.channel_91\">Find Something</a>, has been played by 100 million gamers, and is already available on the Android app store in the UK, France and Italy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420053837|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|45a034938980a19d0ffd40a24646ffb7a3d9f25e -->",

        "body":"<p>Chinese telecoms equipment firm Huawei and the country's largest social gaming company Rekoo have pledged to create hundreds of technology engineering jobs in the UK.</p><p>Huawei is to build a $200m (£125m) research and development facility in Britain, with engineers working on smartphone design, software and broadband technologies. The location has yet to be announced, but the centre will boost Huawei's British engineering headcount to 300 by 2017.</p><p>Rekoo, which attracts 15 million daily gamers on personal computers and 10 million on smartphones, will become the first high-profile Chinese company to open an outpost in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/27/tech-city-digital-startups-shoreditch\" title=\"\">London's Tech City development</a>.</p><p>Lisa Pan, vice-president of Rekoo, said the London office would allow the company to be the bridge between mobile gaming markets in China and Europe. \"Companies in the UK produce very high quality games,\" said Pan, \"and being in London means we can attract world-class talent and find new business opportunities with UK and European developers.\"</p><p>Rekoo already has ties with western digital businesses, having published and developed games in China for Zynga, Disney and Facebook. Pan said Rekoo will use its London office to export more European games to China, with contracts signed in the UK benefiting from the protection of local laws. Rekoo's revenue runs into the tens of millions of dollars, and 60% of its earnings are from mobile phone games.</p><p>The announcements followed a visit to Huawei's Shenzhen headquarters by George Osborne. The chancellor has been  accompanied on his trade mission to China  by British technology entrepreneurs such as Lee Cameron, the deputy chief executive of mobile banking group Monitise, and software billionaire Mike Lynch.</p><p>Lynch runs the technology investment group Invoke Capital. He also founded corporate search software group Autonomy, which was sold to Hewlett-Packard for £7bn, and whose book-keeping is currently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/12/autonomy-investigation-hp\" title=\"\">being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office</a>.</p><p>\"I am delighted to be introducing some of China's tech giants in Shenzhen to some of Britain's leading tech entrepreneurs,\" said Osborne. \"Huawei and Rekoo's investment into the UK is a great testament to Britain's tech industry and I am here to make sure that relationship goes from strength to strength.\"</p><p>The R&amp;D centre is the first initiative to be announced under the $2bn (£1.2bn) <a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240163034/Huawei-commits-to-spending-12bn-in-the-UK\" title=\"\">UK investment programme </a>pledged by Huawei last September.</p><p>Huawei already has a team of 80 engineers working on photonics research after acquiring the Centre for Integrated Photonics in Ipswich last year from the East of England Development Agency. The centre specialises in the use of light to transmit high volumes of data, particularly over fibre optic wires.</p><p>Its founder and chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, was received in Downing Street by David Cameron last year amid a political backlash against the company in the US, where questions were raised over whether equipment from the Chinese manufacturer should be used in sensitive telecoms infrastructure.</p><p>\"The UK is home to some of the best hi-tech professionals in the world,\" said Ren. \"Combined with a free-trade economy, this makes it a very good investment environment for Huawei.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420048293|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|c69cceb2866e724df420e507ed093f77d2e522ef -->",

However, all versions of the title, including current gen iterations, have been delayed until spring 2014. </p><p>&quot;Our ambition from the start with Watch Dogs has been to deliver something that embodies what we wanted to see in the next generation of gaming,&quot; Ubisoft announced in a statement. &quot;It is with this in mind that we've made the tough decision to delay the release.&quot;</p><p>The game, which takes place in an open-world alternative version of Chicago and allows players to hack into city computer networks, was considered one of the most intriguing third-party titles in the next-gen launch lineup. Ubisoft has high hopes for the title, expecting it to potentially outsell the respected Assassin's Creed series.</p><p>Meanwhile, the publisher's pan-American open-world racing game, The Crew, which brings massively-multiplayer adventure elements to the driving genre, has been delayed from spring to summer/autumn 2014. &quot;Our long-term goal is to win the next generation,&quot; explained Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot in a statement. </p><p>&quot;The tough decisions we are taking today to fully realise the major potential of our new creations have an impact on our short-term performance. We are convinced that, longer term, they will prove to be the right decisions both in terms of satisfaction for our fans and in terms of value creation for our shareholders. We are building franchises that will become perennial pillars of Ubisoft's financial performance.&quot;</p><p>As a result, the publisher has <a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/433948/ubisoft-to-lose-560m-this-fiscal-over-watch-dogs-and-crew-delay/\">revised down</a> its revenue projections for the fiscal year, chopping $560m (&pound;349m) from the original expectations of $1.94bn. Consumers who have pre-ordered special Watch Dogs bundle packages of the next-gen consoles are being reassured that they won't lose their places in the queue. In the states, Amazon and Gamestop <a href=\"http://www.shacknews.com/article/81598/so-what-happens-to-watch-dogs-ps4-and-xbox-one\">have stated</a> that they will honour pre-orders by swapping out the bundled game for another title. We're waiting to hear similar assurances from UK retailers.</p><p>What the delays show are the pressures of producing original products in the console transition period, when current and forthcoming hardware have to be supported by development teams.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420107601|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|03af7b959c16805f76f4656fdd90940d5e3affce -->",

        "headline":"Beyond: Two Souls - review",
        "body":"<p>&quot;Can a video game be art?&quot; asked David Cage, the writer and director of Beyond: Two Souls, at the recent Bafta annual games lecture. I suspect he already knew the answer was yes, or at least he would have done if he'd ever heard the intro music to&nbsp;Streets of Rage 2, which more than comfortably satisfies the most useful definition of art I've come across, formulated by Scottish author Alasdair Gray: anything that stimulates people into &quot;thinking about their feelings, and feeling about their thoughts&quot;. The complication being that, in reaching laudably for emotive, meaningful content, Beyond lurches so forcefully towards cinema that a more pertinent question for us to ask is, &quot;Can this art be considered a video game?&quot;</p><p>Beyond tells the story of a young woman, Jodie Holmes, who for unknown reasons is tied to an entity called Aiden. Her life is presented as a fragmented timeline, jumbled moments from tender infancy to defiant adulthood stacked upon each other non-chronologically. Players – if that is the right term – control both Jodie and Aiden during most of these scenes, hopping to Aiden's hovering perspective with a button press, gradually piecing together a story of laboratory experimentation, CIA induction and subsequent rebellion.</p><p>So why wring hands about whether or not it's a game? Because there's not much gameplay. Beyond is technically extraordinary, and certainly one of the finest looking things that run on PS3, but its points of interaction are building block-simple. Mostly they involve guiding Jodie through conversations with simple choices, or activating pre-determined physical motions with single button presses. Exploring scenes with Jodie or wandering through rooms (and walls) with Aiden grants more obvious freedom, but there is nothing skill-based here. You can only be better than someone else at Beyond if you shift the regular expectation of what &quot;better&quot; means – to experience the story more profoundly, perhaps, or to unobtrusively input button presses to allow the story to continue smoothly (and absolutely not raise and lower Jodie's can of beer repeatedly while saying &quot;Emotion&quot; in a thick French accent).</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419611711\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381415491207/Beyond-Two-Souls-009.jpg\" alt=\"Beyond: Two Souls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Beyond: Two Souls: stars Ellen Page as Jodie Holmes</figcaption></figure><p>So, Beyond might open up a troubling, legitimate gap in our use of the term &quot;video game&quot; to describe all interactive electronic media (or, you know, it might just be a starry-eyed evolution of the point-and-click adventure). More urgent is the issue of whether it's worth your time, and on this point it helps that Beyond looks fantastic. This isn't just a result of Quantic Dream's technology, but the artistic eyes behind it, and like the studio's previous game, Heavy Rain, Beyond is a triumph of both visual imagination and image quality. Like discontented Saturday night spouses we often complain that games have the ability to take us anywhere yet we always seem to end up in the same brown, dark corridors. Beyond gives us flair and spectacle – a warm, autumnal park at sunset; a still sheriff's office with dust motes illuminated by moonlight; a long, hazy road stretching through a baked orange desert.</p><p>But the core of Beyond is its story. Beyond is a predominantly narrative experience that has introduced elements of interactivity in order to heighten the emotional involvement of the player/viewer/interactee. One is only as enjoyable as the other, and both are imperfect, clumsy, and occasionally maddening, and yet somehow still compelling.</p><p>It helps that while Cage talks so earnestly about meaning and art he finds himself endearingly, irresistibly drawn to hokey sci-fi plotting. As talk of &quot;the other side&quot; and gateways built in government facilities take centre stage, it's clear that Beyond is exploitation dressed as art house – if not full-on Roger Corman, then at least John Carpenter, genre nous mixed with sporadic intelligence. This is no bad thing, as the juicy hook of this sci-fi pitch – who is Aiden, and where did he come from? – provides the mystery that gives the narrative its driving momentum.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419611712\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381415853461/Beyond-Two-Souls-009.jpg\" alt=\"Beyond: Two Souls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Beyond: Two Souls: a young Jodie</figcaption></figure><p>But there are significant problems of choice and agency. This single hook is problematic when compared, say, with the multi-threaded structure of Heavy Rain. There Cage's writing weaves together an ensemble cast whose choices and interactions cumulatively represent a significant set of potential outcomes. There are substantial, plot-changing decisions (and mistakes) to be made, tension borne of consequence, of knowledge that each of those characters can die. Beyond features expensive Hollywood star Ellen Page as Jodie Holmes, a single protagonist essential to the narrative, which consequently must be driven in a largely pre-determined direction. This means choices are limited, or often (even more infuriatingly) illusory, which in turn means that there is no grander interactivity to compensate for the lack of moment-to-moment mechanical control.</p><p>And yet, as flawed and constricting as this format can feel, it still offers some extraordinary experiences. Many of Beyond's most touching moments are non-essential in narrative terms, and only discovered through exploration – like Jodie singing a mournful song on guitar as she busks for dinner money as a freezing down-and-out, or infant Jodie in her bedroom trying to play make-believe with dolls only for her real imaginary friend to disrupt her game.</p><p>Beyond deserves credit for presenting us with ideas and situations few other games (especially of this budget level) would touch, or even think of. The disrupted doll play is just part of a series of scenes in which young Jodie struggles to come to terms with her unique ability – Beyond is strongest here, in these early years, capturing the mannerisms and heartache of childhood with pinprick accuracy, turning a neighbourhood snowball fight into a rush of escape and excitement. When an older Jodie joins the CIA, she becomes a physically commanding action heroine – admittedly, the action moments aren't particularly fun to sort-of-play, but my young daughter, catching a glimpse of this section, fist-pumped at the very idea of a leading lady who can handle herself. Later, in a disorienting change of pace, several minutes are given over to Jodie alone in her apartment, preparing for an imminent dinner date – a rushed tidy, a flick through a cook book, a frantic decision about what to wear.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419611713\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/10/10/1381415666928/Beyond-Two-Souls-009.jpg\" alt=\"Beyond: Two Souls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Beyond: Two Souls: Willem Dafoe as Dr Dawkins</figcaption></figure><p>The complicating factor is that, as well as doing things no other game does, Beyond also does some things really badly. There's a teenage party scene which seems like an excruciating parody of what teenage party scenes would be like if they were all written and conceived by middle-aged games designers (rule breaking, sexual frisson, rejection – it's Carrie in five clanging minutes). There's a lengthy portion in which Jodie lives with some Navajo indians (&quot;Because they're a bit mystic too&quot; seems the general reasoning). And the climactic escalation of Beyond's final scenes will be familiar to anyone with a working knowledge of Brian Yuzna's films, the works of HP Lovecraft, or derivative cautionary science fiction in general.</p><p>All of this makes it difficult to plot the quality of Beyond on a regular scale. It's technically extraordinary, but mechanically base. The quality of its drama is wildly inconsistent, with elegant emotional moments followed by clumsy cliche. And it contorts itself in service to a story that's both deeply derivative but also reliably compelling. It's a maddening flux of excellence and overambition that rejects many overplayed conventions of big-budget gaming, but fails to provide a comprehensive alternative. Beyond feels like an unfinished – and often unconvincing – theory of where games can go next. It is not the way forward, but it might help show the way for others, and it's worth exploring for yourself.</p><p><em>• Nathan Ditum has opted not to provide a score for this review</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419608294|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|9a06809945bb174975cbca42806175507a9d96bb -->",

        "headline":"EVE Valkyrie – the future of space combat in games and virtual reality",
        "body":"<p>A decade on from its launch, EVE Online remains one of the most engrossing persistent game worlds ever produced. A space-faring epic set in the deep future, players can traverse thousands of star systems, build (and work for) interstellar corporations, and eke out an existence by mining and managing resources. The game is unusual for allowing users increasing freedom to govern the fictional reality themselves.</p><p>&quot;The core element is that EVE, in so many ways, is made by the players of the game,&quot; says Hilmar Petursson, CEO of Icelandic developer CCP Games. &quot;So much of the experience is what the players are doing, how they're interacting with each other, the trust and relationships that are built and broken, and all those stories coming up all over the world as they occur.&quot;</p><p>The broken trust Petursson speaks of is part of what makes EVE fascinating to observe, even for non-players. A 2005 assassination of a high-level in-game CEO lead to a theft of 30bn ISK – EVE's currency – and considerable assets, such as rare starships. The plan required months to set up, with real players infiltrating the target corporation to launch the devastating co-ordinated assault. A year later, a single player set up the EVE Investment Bank, eventually defrauding his investors to the tune of 700bn ISK.</p><p>CCP's backdrop is one that gives rise to true human ingenuity, greed, collaboration and callousness in ways the team never imagined.</p><p>&quot;Initially, we were more hands on, and more of the game was controlled by us or non-player characters, with an NPC economy. Then we systematically unwound those controls, gave them over to players in some way,&quot; says Petursson. &quot;Players elect a Council of Stellar Management that comes to Reykjavik twice a year and discusses with our development team and designers on where to focus our efforts and what needs to improve. That helps a lot, that there is this collaboration between the dev team, the community, and the core design of the game.&quot;</p><p>Now, EVE is only a few steps removed from complete player autonomy, with Petursson's team taking on a janitorial role – &quot;maintaining the operating system of the universe,&quot; he says. Internally, focus has shifted to expanding that universe. The free-to-play first-person shooter Dust 514 launched for PlayStation 3 in May this year, offering a more action-oriented experience set on planets throughout EVE's universe, where events in one game will affect the other. It feels relatively safe though – a sci-fi shooter in a medium awash with them. CCP's next release will be anything but safe.</p><p></p><h2>Stars in your eyes<br /></h2><p>EVE Valkyrie seems alluringly dangerous on two fronts. One, it's a 3D space shooter, a genre all but abandoned by developers in recent years. Two, and more importantly, it will be released for Oculus Rift, the upcoming virtual reality headset offering players complete audio-visual immersion into their games. Valkyrie places gamers into some of EVE's signature space fighters, with a 360-degree view of the cockpit and the great void surrounding them. It looks thrilling, serving as a showcase for the flexibility of EVE's universe and the potential of the Oculus Rift hardware. Turning to a long-ignored genre on an unreleased piece of hardware may seem risky at best, but Petursson is excited by the potential.</p><p>&quot;It started when the Kickstarter for Oculus Rift came about. CCP became one of the first backers, along with a lot of people at the company who backed it on their own time,&quot; he says. &quot;People were trying out games and there was a group who wanted to do something using EVE assets to do a demo of something related.</p><p>&quot;I tried it for the first time when we had a demonstration in the kitchen at CCP. I sort of imagined what it would be, [but then] I put it on and was like 'Wow! This is pretty damn cool!' You look at your own avatar in the cockpit and it was such a 'whoa' moment. It's more compelling than I thought, to feel this connected to it. That's obviously what we want to do, we want to immerse people even more in the universe we're creating, to have people expand what they can do in a truly open world.&quot;</p><p>Although little has been shown of the in-progress Valkyrie as yet, the creative team forming around it is promising. Most prominently, Owen O'Brien has taken on a producer role, who should know a thing or two about first-person immersion from his work on cult hit Mirror's Edge. Valkyrie has also shifted development from Reykjavik to CCP's Newcastle studios, where Petursson is pushing for bold ideas.</p><p>&quot;We try to cultivate an environment for innovation. I think we can improve a lot on that. We've experimented with 20% time for staff's own projects and in-company game jams. How we can further foster creativity, whether it's its own project, inside EVE Online, or inside our current games, is absolutely something we're thinking about.&quot;</p><p>It's unknown whether Valkyrie will integrate with EVE Online and Dust 514, or similarly reflect player democracy in the shared universe, though such connections are likely to feature eventually. Petursson adds: &quot;We very much have the opportunity, we have the technology and infrastructure for it. It's just not the focus right now.&quot;</p><p>Comparing Valkyrie's potential to the game that started it all, Petursson reflects &quot;We were much more interested in creating a playground, which would be self-reinforcing. But it became much bigger and has lived on for much longer than we ever thought, or even dared think. Now when we look at it, and think of the fundamentals of it, EVE in all its forms is going to outlive us all.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419676066|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|c8463b81b36cd9f6fb84523f9421ac81d8499227 -->",

        "headline":"F1 2013 – review",
        "body":"<p>For Formula One fans, F1 2013 is an item of rare desirability – but strangely, that is due more to Codemasters' skill at negotiating political minefields, rather than its programming prowess. That's because the latest iteration of its expensively licensed game charting the pinnacle of motorsport contains something that motorsport enthusiasts have wanted for years: retro cars, drivers and tracks.</p><p>The corporate nature of the F1 world dictates that, in any game depicting it, every sponsor's logo, advertising hoarding and so on has to be authentic, which is why it's physically impossible for developers to get their games out before a chunk of each season has passed. So adding cars of yore to the equation adds another level of licensing complexity, but with consummate skill (and, one suspects, infinite patience), Codemasters has somehow managed to pull off that juggling act. Boot up F1 2013, negotiate the Young Driver Test (which dictates the car you will be allowed to pilot in Career mode), and you will find a new menu item entitled F1 Classics.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418970774'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380806500137/F1-2013-5-008.jpg' alt='F1 2013 5' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Pretend you're Nigel Mansell <br /></h2><p>Not since 2006's F1 Championship Edition (a PS3 exclusive, from a time when Sony held the Formula One games licence) has a Formula One game contained any cars from days gone by, and even then, you could only drive them in time-trials. But in F1 2013, you can choose from five cars from the 1980s – ravening beasts with turbocharged engines, some of which even have the swiftly outlawed ground-effect skirts that suck them to the tarmac.</p><p>There are two tracks – Brands Hatch and Jerez, in their 1980s configurations, both of which have long since fallen off the Formula One calendar. And you can take on, or pretend to be, legendary drivers like Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, Emerson Fittipaldi and many more. You can also buy a Classic Edition of the game, which adds six cars from the 1990s, drivers including Michael Schumacher, Eddie Irvine and David Coulthard, and the tracks Imola and Estoril (that 1990s pack will also be available as downloadable content).</p><p>The return of retro to a Formula One game is very timely, given the wave of nostalgia currently sweeping the sport in the wake of the film Rush, chronicling the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. And F1 2013 adds to the wistfulness by applying a sepia visual filter to the F1 Classics section (which you can turn off if you want), and drafting in the inimitable Murray Walker for commentary duties.</p><p>But it's the cars that are the stars – they are incredibly powerful and, because they are turbocharged, that power is delivered in sudden, screaming high-rev bursts that can easily catch you out. The non ground-effect cars have laughably low amounts of grip compared to their modern counterparts, and they generally offer a much greater test of your innate driving skills. In F1 Classics, you can race split-screen against a mate, undertake full Grands Prix and get stuck into a selection of scenarios taken from real races from the era.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418970775'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380806384261/F1-2013-3-008.jpg' alt='F1 2013 3' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Back to the present day <br /></h2><p>As far as the modern-day component of F1 2013 is concerned, Codemasters has opted for tweaking rather than wholesale alterations. One of the first aspects you notice is that this year's tyre-disintegration controversy looms large: in the Young Driver Test, for example, you have to lap the Yas Marina track on a set of badly worn tyres, setting your tyre strategy before a race is key, and the manner in which the tyres degrade both visually and in terms of feel is striking.</p><p>As in the real races, you can be left as a grip-less sitting duck in the latter stages if you pitted too early. You have to be very careful about how quickly you can get on the throttle after exiting corners, and smoothness is rewarded. The AI-controlled drivers, too, have noticeably upped their game so, if your driving skills are less than God-like, you might want to set the game on its easiest difficulty setting, before turning off some of the more annoying and intrusive driver aids, like the braking assist.</p><p>Structurally, F1 2013 is much the same as last year's model, although the pit view, from which you begin each session of a Grand Prix, has been simplified and cleaned up somewhat, and there's a new (and gratifyingly logical) Hub screen detailing your career.</p><p>The scenarios, in which you're plunged into various race situations with specific goals, have been arranged more logically to reflect the different stages of a driver's career, and there are more of them, constituting a pretty meaty slice of gaming on their own.</p><p>Season Challenge — in which you have 10 races to notch a win, working your way up to a top car by setting a rival driver for each race, whose drive you acquire if you beat him – is back, too. And head-to-head races against your mates can be enacted split-screen or via system link.</p><p>The multiplayer is more or less exactly the same as last year's, with one notable and very welcome difference: this year, it's free, whereas last year, you had to pay for a VIP pass. As before, up to 16 humans can race each other, with the rest of the grid filled with AI-powered bots.</p><p>F1 2013 looks fantastic – it will be fascinating to see what Codemasters can do on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One – and sounds and feels utterly authentic. However, it isn't without flaws. The feedback you get from your pit crew is minimal, to say the least, and sometimes reacts to proceedings much more slowly than you do; it would also be nice if it included more praise (such as when you lead a race despite being at the helm of a Force India) rather than censuring you for marginal corner-cutting escapades. The AI drivers also seem able to get away with transgressions that you would be penalised for, and loading times, although much shorter than in any of Codemasters' F1 games, are still noticeable.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418970776'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380806458047/F1-2013-4-008.jpg' alt='F1 2013 4' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>However, F1 2013 oozes quality, fully living up to the illustrious nature of its official licence, and the presence of the 1980s and 1990s cars, drivers and tracks gives motorsport nuts a real reason to buy it – which is much-needed for such an annual franchise. If the retro Grand Prix action is what appeals, we would recommend the Classic Edition, but either version provides racing enthusiasts with a truly meaty and authentic experience in which they can lose themselves for months.<br />.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418968324|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|5042429753722aa7418b6c9d18a1780396c95191 -->",

        "headline":"Should gamers be accountable for in-game war crimes?",
        "body":"<p>Don't shoot the civilians. This is something military games have been telling us for many years. I remember my first go on Taito's explosive arcade title Operation Wolf – it was the late-80s and this frenzied blast-'em-up, with its jungle environment and hostage rescue missions, was clearly gunning for a generation of Rambo II fanatics. It even let you control the action with an Uzi-style sub-machine gun bolted to the cabinet. But what it wouldn't let you do was kill passing civilians: collateral damage of this sort took a big chunk off your health bar. </p><p>Of course, this was really more about mechanics than ethics: players were being tested on their reactions and visual awareness, and failure meant a reduction in game time rather than a few moments' reflection on innocent victims. These days, if you accidentally (or otherwise) shoot a civilian or comrade in a military shooter, you'll probably get a 'mission failed' message and a one-way trip back to the last checkpoint. What you won't get is a military tribunal and a dishonorable discharge. </p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24318061\">a BBC news report</a> earlier this week, however, Francois Senechaud from the International Committee of the Red Cross told a reporter that, due to the increasing verisimilitude between first-person shooters and real-life combat, games should start to abide by the international laws of armed conflict. &quot;Video games that represent contemporary battlefields are very close to reality,&quot; he said. &quot;It's difficult to make out the difference between real footage and the footage you get from video games.&quot;</p><p>What the Red Cross wants to see then is the player being penalised for carrying out such actions as willfully killing civilians or torturing enemy combatants, both of which are punishable under international law. <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/film/2013/09-28-ihl-video-games.htm\">A Q&amp;A document posted on the organisation's website</a> explains:</p><blockquote><p>The ICRC is suggesting that as in real life, these games should include virtual consequences for people's actions and decisions. Gamers should be rewarded for respecting the law of armed conflict and there should be virtual penalties for serious violations of the law of armed conflict, in other words war crimes. </p></blockquote><p>And importantly it adds:</p><blockquote><p>Our intention is not to spoil player's enjoyment by for example, interrupting the game with pop-up messages listing legal provisions or lecturing gamers on the law of armed conflict. We would like to see the law of armed conflict integrated into the games so that players have a realistic experience and deal first-hand with the dilemmas facing real combatants on real battlefields. </p></blockquote><p>The ICRC says it is now working directly with the developers of modern military simulations and the BBC report contains an interview with Marek Spanel of Bohemia Interactive, creator of the Arma series, who claims the studio's games will now be implementing the suggestions.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419001569\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380798855863/Arma-4-008.jpg\" alt=\"Arma 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Arma 2: The Red Cross believes that as video games become ever more realistic, they should also adhere to international rules of warfare.</figcaption></figure><h2>Feasibility studied</h2><p>The question is, how feasible are the ICRC's aims and will players really take on board the lessons about humanitarian law? It is difficult to imagine a Call of Duty or Battlefield title in which shooting a civilian leads to a mission where the player is detained in a military prison for several months before being tried and sentenced. But then if the consequences of illegal operations are subsumed into the gameplay mechanics – i.e. shoot civilian, fail mission – the player will usually read these instances in ludic terms. Within the action, civilians are are not people who deserve humane treatment, they're walking fail states to be avoided in the pursuit of success. </p><p>We do often see the consequences of player actions being threaded into gameplay, but this tends to be in the adventure genre. Titles like Fable, Heavy Rain, Walking Dead and Dishonored all provide different paths for a player depending on their moral decisions during play – and because the action is combined with a confirming narrative element, the meaning and weight of transgression can come through. The idea of an action adventure that put the player into a series of defining humanitarian situations allowing the story to spin-off in the player's moral direction is interesting – but it's hugely unlikely in the action cinema world of the modern shooter.</p><p>Furthermore, the ICRC statement makes clear that it is not interested in other genres – it is concentrating on combat games that depict and concentrate on contemporary battlefields. So how can players be made accountable for their actions beyond simple gameplay devices? How do you move beyond the simple message, &quot;Mission failed, you have broken international law and will spend the next ten years in prison. Re-start mission?&quot; </p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419001567\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380793379957/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfa-008.jpg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2: shootouts often occur in areas where civilians are in the line of fire.</figcaption></figure><h2>Moral dilemmas</h2><p>There have been two stand-out examples. In Modern Warfare 2's notorious No Russian mission a US soldier is embedded with a Russian terrorist organisation and must take part in a mass killing at an airport. Success means blending in with the terror squad, and it's up to the player to decide whether that extends as far as shooting civilians. The sequence was brave, but also clumsily handled, exploitative and incongruous; however, it did place the player in a position where many felt they genuinely had to weigh up their moral proclivities with the demands of the gameplay mission.</p><p>Much more intriguing, though, is the scene in Yager Development's criminally overlooked shooter, Spec Ops: The Line, where three soldiers are stranded in a wrecked Dubai facing a crowd of angry locals. In a scene reminiscent of the Black Hawk Down incident, they must decide whether to shoot their way out or face death. Although actually, it's more interesting than that, because the first shot fired sends the group fleeing – something the player won't know until they commit to pulling the trigger. And vitally, those who point their gun in the air before firing get the same dispersal effect without casualties. In the heat of the game, facing a furious mob, many players will take the lethal option – but they sure as hell think about it. It is these sorts of split-second decisions that really suggest something about the complexities of combat.</p><p>But then, of course, these examples offer more than a mere punishment mechanic – which is what the ICRC seems to be asking for. If all transgressions automatically lead to failure, it's a zero-sum game that invites only functional thinking. Players need to be able to live with the consequences of actions in more subtle ways. In both Heavy Rain and Walking Dead, players face lethal moral decisions that don't end the game, or even have ludic consequences for the player, but yet play on the mind and colour the experience. The game may be over but the choices remain – and by ending chapter of Waking Dead with a guide to the actions of other players, developer Telltale Games cleverly addresses and confronts the process.</p><p>Often the most affecting moments are those hidden in momentary or supplementary features. The ability to name characters in titles like Cannon Fodder and XCOM, for example, provided a heightened level of emotional attachment for many players. The way we learn little snippets about the lives of the characters passing through our border gates in Papers, Please. The way that mobile phone hacking lets us see into the personal problems of potential targets in Watch Dogs. In games, moral depth is much more about humanisation than it is about punishment. The latter is too intricately tied in with atavistic gameplay systems for us to extrapolate anything deeper than game over.</p><p>We are, though, surely heading into an era where gamers will have to take greater responsibility for their actions – if only because the visual fidelity will be there to splatter our violent failings across the screen in HD detail. In Operation Wolf, accidentally machine gunning a glitching sprite that vaguely resembled a non-military human could be easily divorced from the reality of armed conflict. In Battlefield 5 or Call of Duty 27, it may not be so simple to dismiss the sight of a photo-realistic person lying in the dust, eyes rolling back, limbs spasming. </p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419001568\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380793814696/Battlefield-4-008.jpg\" alt=\"Battlefield 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Battlefield 4 – the siege of Shanghai level</figcaption></figure><p>I don't even think that's what the ICRC wants – it doesn't want moral doubt to arise purely through aesthetics, it wants designers to think about international law, and about how warfare should operate. It wants developers to say, in this mission you must fly an armed drone over a school where terrorists are known to be hiding, and you must decide whether to open fire. And it wants players to understand the consequences of such an action, not just in terms of the score or progress, but in terms of the real world of warfare – the one that all military games reflect and fetishise.<br />.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418869488|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|9df123a853bbb47d98dd126784ac605df0da4728 -->",

        "trailText":"<p>Not a lot has changed in the latest instalment, but even with clumsy new match biometrics, it's still, somehow, better than PES. By <strong>Ben Griffin</strong></p>",
        "headline":"Fifa 14 – review",
        "body":"<p>\"Come quick!\" the PES fan shouts, as if peering from his bedroom window and seeing fresh snow. \"It's back!\" It happens every year – this hoped for resurgence. Later, brash words are rescinded and shoelaces gazed at. PES 2014 earned a deserved four stars in our recent review, but against what a hopeful community tells you, this is not the year PES beats Fifa. That's the curious thing about their great rivalry. PES continually improves and Fifa doesn't – at least to the naked eye. Yet, Fifa is, still, better.</p><p>After a decade of juggling between the two, I've settled on this analogy: PES is chess, Fifa is draughts. Both have their virtues, but draughts works better as a video game, more immediate, easier on beginners, and generally more fun. Fifa 14's new Pure Shot mechanic fits all three criteria in one. Essentially, efforts on goal have a greater tendency to dip, bend and rise, giving them ferocious unpredictability. It's difficult not to feel a flutter in your gut as the ball falls to your long distance specialist on the edge of the box.</p><p>Thunderous volleys, first-time belters and off-balance lashes — they look natural and feel right, thanks to improved ball physics and a slew of new contextual animations.</p><p>Keep in mind, long shots aren't a magic button. They're actually less frequent, and this is thanks to EA's other new back-of-the-box feature – Precision Movement. So-called 'stepbased location' is a technical triumph, players now weightily planting feet when running and pushing off from pivots, but it's an awkward fumble of a feature in practice.</p><p>For one, players take ages to get going. The effectiveness of a simple turn, bread and butter of football, has been neutralised in the maelstrom of 22 men on the pitch, all dizzyingly scrambling for ball possession and losing it just as quickly. In Fifa 14, thanks to clumsy new biomechanics, space is a truly rare commodity.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418447820'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/27/1380274884890/Fifa-14-3-008.jpg' alt='Fifa 14 3' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Attacking is revitalised by Pure Shot, but Precision Movement clogs midfield and defence. Matches aren't ruined by any means – rather, they're simply thrown off in a second. Problem is, in a high-tempo game like Fifa, with its tight margins for error and all-important timing, that second counts. However slight, the complexion is altered.</p><p>Off the pitch, things could have been equally clogged if not for revitalised Windows 8-style menus that cleanly whizz you through skill games (navigate imposing gauntlets of yellow plastic men and knock down evil towers of cardboard boxes), a creation centre (create and share custom players, teams and tournaments) and market (buy vintage kits, virtual pro boosts and cocky celebrations with coins earned online).</p><p>Most substantial is Ultimate Team, which, EA is keen to tell us, hosts 3.5m matches daily. No huge improvements here, but it does streamline the previously arduous organisation of online single matches and seasons, and the ability to change kit numbers and set-piece takers in addition is community wish fulfilment. New chemistry styles are welcome, too. There are a variety of them; you can, for instance, apply a defensive chemistry style to a defender in order to boost their performance. It's contributes fresh complexity towards chasing the rainbow of your dream team.</p><p>Likewise, the career sees only minor changes. It's still split between player and manager – both options let you control the entire team, but the former can use their virtual pro and skip all the management gubbins. It still serves up emails from the board and transfer gossip on the wire to keep you involved (Soldado isn't happy at Spurs. Oh). And it's still meshed together by an agonisingly slow calendar system that ticks through each day like the life cycle of a star. Transfers have at least had a facelift, though.</p><p>Along with more hurdles to jump for a signature, such as promising players match time and checking they're nice and marginalised at their current squad before prowling, there's a new global scouting network. Here you'll employ up to six scouts of varying knowhow, set parameters, and send them off. You can find and nurture an unknown prodigy in the youth team or get beads on established names, learning cost and wage demands so you can make a bid that won't be laughingly dismissed. As a result, wheeling, dealing, and finally securing that hot prospect is much more rewarding.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418447821'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/27/1380274813476/Fifa-14-2-008.jpg' alt='Fifa 14 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Online, aside from two v two co-op seasons, Fifa 14 doesn't have any big new mode to show off. But that's OK because they've just about got the entire sport covered anyway, from user-made pro clubs with customisable kits, to 10-game seasons where players fight each other for promotion, to full on 11 v 11 matches. Any one could easily see you through to next season.</p><p>The game's difference-maker is entirely on the pitch – that new movement system. In multiplayer especially, where the absence of an all-knowing AI sees imperfect humans make repeated mistakes, it leads to slightly clumsier, boggier, slower matches. All the same, the change is only incremental, and doesn't ruin the game by any means.</p><p>You know this by now – things in EA Sports land either get slightly better or slightly worse, and whatever side of the dial the year's instalment ticks into, what you're getting remains the same: the most fun and feature-rich sports games on the planet. Still.</p><p><em>• Game reviewed on Xbox 360</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418437934|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|b6666786f1cf18ce33326393c8b87ea094254e15 -->",

        "headline":"Ireland's game scene back on its feet",
        "body":"<p>Sometimes you have to see a place through fresh eyes to appreciate it. This writer, having grown up in Dublin, takes for granted a lot of the best things about the city: its size, its nightlife, its people, instead focusing on its bad weather and worse economy. Beyond these shores, media horror stories paint an even bleaker picture of Ireland, with property crashes, bad banks and game office closures including Big Fish and PopCap.</p><p>But there's a veritable infestation of start-ups in Dublin at the moment. And thankfully, entrepreneurs, investors and high-level employees from outside the country are coming here for reasons beyond tax breaks and location.</p><p>\"Derelict warehouse, plus IKEA, equals the Digit offices,\" says Richard Barnwell, founder and CEO of Digit Games, a new company that employs dozens of people for Kings of the Realm, an ambitious cross-platform online MMO. So far, Digit has received total investment of $3.75m (£2.3m) to date. Their office sits in Dublin City between the prestigious Trinity College and the banks of the river Liffey, and is a stone's throw away from Google's European HQ.</p><p>To say that the past few years have been turbulent for Ireland is an understatement, but some government bodies like Enterprise Ireland are doing real, tangible work in helping start-ups; providing finance (in the form of investment), guidance and even help with contacts across different industries. Enterprise Ireland (or \"EI\") comes up in just about every conversation I have with developers.</p><p>\"The reason we came here was the interest from the likes of Enterprise Ireland,\" says Barnwell. \"When we started talking to people, saying it was a serious start-up, going out the gate with a million [pounds] worth of funding; we had offers from five countries. We had a lot of interest about doing game things here that we didn't get from other countries, nowhere near the level. As soon as we started talking to people like EI, they were incredibly keen to support us. Not really financially, we didn't need investment from them, but actually just opening doors – giving access to their west coast US offices and their German offices, literally they were saying 'let us help you meet people in developing territories' which has been incredibly useful; the kind of support which nobody else was offering. You can't really put a price on that because they've made introductions which could be worth an absolute fortune for us.\"</p><h2>Political power-ups<br /></h2><p>Irish politicians have generally been supportive. I have fond memories of seeing Taoiseach Enda Kenny at the launch of Bioware's call centre in Galway, making a speech about steep learning curves and then being shown how to play the Star Wars MMO. Yes, there have been some embarrassingly old-fashioned comments, including President Michael D Higgins dismissing the pursuit outright and TD [Teachta Dála – member of parliament] Mary Mitchell O'Connor's misbegotten press release condemning Call of Duty and advising parents to buy their kids books instead of games. But more often, the politicians see the games for what they are: a thrilling, creative, and sometimes lucrative young industry and possibly a way to connect with younger constituents.</p><p>Paschal Donohoe, a former senator who's recently been promoted to minister of state for European affairs, has been a long-term advocate for the Irish games industry. \"There's more of an understanding of [gaming among Irish politicians] than you might expect,\" he says. \"An example I'd give, it might be apocryphal, but it does illustrate a point, is around 18 months ago I set up a session in Leinster House to brief people on the digital games industry and what more we could do. And normally, when you organise these kinds of briefings, you get a handful of Oireachtas [parliament] members and a lot of staff. The room was packed. Packed. We had a huge number of TDs and senators, government ministers, and I've never seen a briefing ever as full as that.</p><p>\"I think that was a real illustration of the fact that there's a growing recognition amongst the political groups and classes. The simple reason is the advent of casual gaming. If you have a group of people for whom the use of a mobile phone is an integral part of their day-to-day life or how they communicate with the outside world, how can you avoid the advent and development of casual gaming on those devices? And that's so apparent. Because of that there's been a percolation into politicians, including here in Ireland.\"</p><p>Donohoe believes that interactive storytelling is a natural progression of Irish traditions: \"There is a part of our Irish culture, spirit and soul that is creative. There is an interest in the development of storytelling, whether it's through music, short stories or books. And I think some of our young men and women who might have looked to be the next David Lynch or Neil Gaiman now think of digital gaming as a way to express themselves and create worlds and tell stories.\"</p><p>The carrot for outside investment seems to be financial, and there is an entrepreneurial spirit here. But in an industry as young as gaming, competition is also fierce for high-end employees. Barnwell, a Cambridge native, claims that the size and vibe of Dublin is an attraction. \"Those that worked in London, or any major city, will appreciate the beauty of Dublin being so small,\" he says. \"You just walk everywhere. If someone's got a meeting, I leave half an hour before it and walk there. It's a nicer way to live a life. You can enjoy the city. In London you don't get that.</p><p>\"We had offices all over [London] city. I'd leave the house at 5.30 in the morning just to be in the office for seven, because you had to get the train, the tube. You'd spent the entire time in tubes getting in and out of them to get from place to place. And you still wouldn't get home until eight or nine at night. And it's not like you get anything done, because you don't. You just spend the whole time squeezing in and out of trains.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419341780'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/8/1381224272985/Kings-of-the-Realm-008.jpg' alt='Kings of the Realm' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Kings of the Realm</figcaption></figure><h2>Extra lives<br /></h2><p>However, for many Dubliners, jaunty commutes don't quite compensate for fickle employers: The departure of PopCap's European HQ (and with it, nearly 100 jobs) and then Jolt leaving, and taking 50 jobs with them, were major blows for the city. The problem with jobs from foreign investment is that they can – and do – up sticks and leave at a moment's notice.</p><p>The departure of these games companies is reminiscent of the Don Bluth situation: Sullivan Bluth Studios was a Dublin-based animation company best-known for An American Tale (a Disney collaboration) and The Land Before Time. After a few high-profile flops, they closed up shop here in 1995, but left a legacy of a world-class third-level animation course (still running in Ballyfermot, west Dublin) and some of its former employees went on to form multi-Oscar-nominated Brown Bag Films, Jam Media (who make BBC's Roy) and the Emmy-nominated Boulder Media.</p><p>Seadna Long, one of the founders of SixMinute Games, is a former employee of PopCap. He claims that the industry in Dublin is much better than it was this time last year because of the volume of indies and the experience they've acquired. \"It's a fair comparison,\" he says when I mention Sullivan Bluth. \"We know some of the guys who went through that [in animation]. The quality that came from the [big] studios is amazing. We know guys in Boulder who went through that. We still have a lot to prove to say that we could be successful as one of those companies. If we're anywhere near Brown Bag, we'll all be quite happy.\"</p><p>SixMinute is one of many young Irish developers that works in an \"incubation\" centre – cheap and sometimes free space given by patrons of the industry, be they government or corporate. Two of Dublin's most exciting developers work within a few feet of one another in a room in the corner of Digit's building: bitSmith and BatCat. The former made Kú, a Zelda-style mobile game that was critically acclaimed (by the Guardian and Edge among others) and BatCat, which made the nifty twin-stick shooter P-3 Biotic and is working on a promising hack-and-slash called Honour Bound.</p><p>\"On one hand, I feel tremendously supported by the government and everything they've done for us,\" says Owen Harris, studio head for bitSmith. \"This company wouldn't exist without the help of EI and Foras na Gaeilge [an organisation that promotes the Irish language] and all the other bodies that have helped us along the way. That's been huge. On the other hand, sometimes you can't help but look at either games education or the film industry and get slightly jealous of what they have.\"</p><p>But compared to even 12 months ago, Harris is optimistic about the scene: \"I think it's maturing. There are opportunities and dangers. I think it's wonderful that many of us are working on our second game. It takes time to learn this craft and to get better at it. And you can see certainly, what I see across the room, it's tremendous the way Honour Bound is coming together. And in our second game, FranknJohn you can see a real jump in quality, in game design and production.\"</p><p>\"We're only learning this through mistakes and failures and eventually you stumble upon something that works and you try to incorporate that into your routine. It's an ongoing process. Where we are now from a year ago, we have more experience in the country. More experience through making mistakes and making games. So that's the exciting thing. They way we combat the problem of inexperience is by having a very open relationship between different companies and trying to help each other out wherever we can.\"</p><p>Andrea Magnorsky, CTO for BatCat, agrees with Owen: \"From last year, I totally agree on the point about evolution. You see some people still there, some sadly gone, but now there are loads of new [indie developers]. Or some people changing things as well, but I guess that's expected and good. I'm glad we're still here. It's like a surprise: Surprise! We're still here another year!\"</p><p>\"But yeah, we've learned a lot by mistakes. It's evolving and it's also dangerous, because we're in a crucial point where there's a level of support and knowledge that needs to come into place for this to go bigger. Otherwise we could all survive … ish.\"</p><p>Magnorsky concedes there are sceptics in Irish business and government, but one or two high-profile successes will be enough to win people over: \"I think there are a few key companies who need success for people's perceptions to be positive; for them to say 'oh yeah' and stroke their chins.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419339507|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|be53c184154095cf2282b0fa8e8085da2dfb7e04 -->",

        "body":"<p>The long-awaited online version of Grand Theft Auto Online was released on Tuesday, replete with the much-anticipated connectivity problems that had long been feared.</p><p>In line with other major online game releases, Grand Theft Auto V's online launch was plagued by server errors and connectivity problems.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/01/gta-online-launches-server-issues\">The console version of GTA V was released on 17 September</a> and is required to play the online version, which gives the classic game a multiplayer mode.</p><p>Shortly after its online launch, gamers said they were unable to access the game because of server issues, the game failing to load and disconnection issues. In response, the company created a webpage on its support site dedicated to providing updates on issues.</p><p>\"We apologize for any inconvenience, and thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this,\" GTA maker Rockstar Games <a href=\"http://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200426246\">said on its support site</a>. It is also offering a service for users to receive automatic email notifications whenever an update is posted on the site. The company did not respond to requests for comment. </p><p>The console version of GTA made $1bn in its first three days on sale, according to the game's publisher Take-Two. Video game experts said that the problems were to be expected because of the game's popularity.  </p><p>\"It seems they've been trying to scale their hardware quickly to cope with the expected requirements based on their incredible sales,\" Simon Barratt of UK studio Four Door Lemon told the Guardian.</p><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/01/gta-online-grand-theft-auto-v-live\">Even if they were using an existing server infrastructure provider</a> such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure – which is unlikely and their wording suggests not – they would probably need to be adding to their cloud server farms to support the numbers they're expecting.\" </p><p>Last week, Rockstar also warned that its servers might not be able to handle GTA's popularity. </p><p>\"One thing we are already aware of, and are trying to alleviate as fast as we can, is the unanticipated additional pressure on the servers due to a significantly higher number of players than we were anticipating at this point.</p><p>\"We are working around the clock to buy and add more servers, but this increased scale is only going to make the first few days even more temperamental than such things usually are.\"</p><p>Rockstar's problems echo those felt by the release of Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo 3 and Maxis's Sim City, which were overwhelmed on their launch days.</p><p>Maxis's network collapsed when the newest edition of SimCity launched in March 2013, and the hashtag #error37 started trending in May 2012 when Diablo 3 customers faced that error message and were unable to play the game.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418786107|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|c1a11c8559237697a0fa5aaacd346e164be3cea9 -->",

        "body":"<p>Put simply, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> is a British creation that says big things about America. While <em>GTA IV</em> was a classic New York immigrant's tale, <em>GTA V</em> crosses coasts to comment on the hectic and the hollow that is Los Angeles, on the city's fascination with surface and its industries of image and light. So long as we're listening, anyway – otherwise it's a familiar, technically astounding playground of male power fantasies and might.</p><p>Mirroring the frantic intersections of LA, <em>GTA V</em> has three heroes with entwined stories that players can leap between at any time. This banishes the occasional complaint of past games – becoming mired in a particular area or mission – and is part of a wider move towards playability. <em>GTA V</em> is confident enough in its pleasures to dissolve the structures that once propped them up. The huge map, for instance, is explorable all at once and not in instalments, while mid-mission checkpoints remove lengthy restarts.</p><p>The result efficiently speeds players into the game's action, and even better, improves the action. Missions are more varied, mechanics more robust and even divergent tasks – trying yoga – feel purposefully embedded into the story. But for all the effort spent on<em> GTA V</em>'s story-led experience, the greatest thrill is breaking away from it. The world captures the texture and sound of California with uncanny precision, providing the tools to race through, fly over or thoroughly destroy it as one sees fit.</p><p>This clash of sophistication and savagery is central to the contradictory heart of <em>GTA</em>. Its radio stations deliver a cruel, precise mimicry of media fear-mongering even as you lightheartedly torture terrorism suspects. In a way, this is a key characteristic – <em>GTA</em> demands to be irreverent on its own terms. But the expertise and brilliance of the best game of the series by far has enough of weight to say without the needless noise of outrage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417770937|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|70a1f0c8c5fe34b65485dbcb67ac853b2e4daeac -->",

        "body":"<p>So it's been a bad week. On Monday, I had to switch off Classic FM when it played Wagner, since he was an antisemite. Then I burned my copy of <em>The Hunger Games</em>, because it's all about children killing one another for entertainment. Finally, I threw my television out of the window because <em>Breaking Bad</em>'s Walter White is a drug-dealing psychopath, and the show's fans love him for it.</p><p>OK, I didn't do any of that, because that would be absurd. If we rejected every creative work that is in some way &quot;problematic&quot;, the canonical cupboard would be bare. So why are so many people I meet so shocked that, as a woman and, whisper it, a feminist, I enjoy playing <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>?</p><p>The GTA series certainly isn't female-friendly. Loved by teenagers, it has become one itself: yet in the 16 years of its existence, it hasn't once offered players the chance to experience its sprawling scenery and high-octane thrills as a female character. In the latest instalment, released last week, women are once again pushed to the margins.</p><p>You can rescue one whose car has broken down, spy on another having sex with her boyfriend while she checks her phone, and, of course, visit the obligatory strip club and &quot;make it rain&quot; bank notes. There aren't any female characters to root for, be impressed by, or even fall in love with. It was the same in the last game: women were there to nag you, or be bribed – whether with fancy dinners or cold, hard cash – into having sex with you. Women are GTA's wallpaper.</p><p>Given all this – and the way the series has allowed you to visit a prostitute, then kill her to get your money back – perhaps the horrified reactions shouldn't be surprising. When I went on<em> Channel 4 News </em>to talk about <em>GTA</em>, Jon Snow asked: &quot;Aren't you worried, as a woman, that the whole thing isn't a bit creepy?&quot;</p><p>Well, yes, it is creepy, but worried isn't the right word. I'm bored, more than anything, as well as irritated that another generation of young players isn't being offered something more exciting than this. &quot;The medium has grown up, and now the GTA franchise is a giant juggernaut that appears to be punching down instead of up,&quot; says female games journalist Leigh Alexander. &quot;I think that's why its problematic elements rankle – not because I'm 'offended', but because it seems lazy, repetitious. I'm not 'offended' that I can't play as a woman; I'm disappointed at the missed opportunity.&quot;</p><p>That feeling isn't unique to video games. Playing the new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, I realised I feel about it the way I feel about Martin Amis novels. I admire the cold brilliance, the execution, the imagination: but I will never love that world, and I never feel inclined to return to it once the story is over. In both <em>London Fields</em> and <em>GTA</em>'s Los Santos there's no place for me; I can visit, but I'll never feel welcome.</p><p>What distinguishes games from books, or films, is that the dodgy sexual politics and wanton violence of one is used as a stick to bash them all. Partly, this is down to the old hangover of the idea that games are for children, when the average age of a player is now 30. Then there's the idea that games are a &quot;niche&quot; or &quot;geek&quot; pursuit, even though<em> GTA V </em>took an astonishing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/19/grand-theft-auto-5-first-day-record\" title=\"\">&pound;500m worldwide in its first day on sale</a>. Finally, there's the spectre of violence. Games are an easy scapegoat for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/anders-breivik-call-of-duty\" title=\"\">horrific acts committed by those who happen to play them</a>, despite the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2013/sep/19/neuroscience-psychology\" title=\"\">lack of evidence of any causal link</a>.</p><p>An unpleasant feedback loop has developed: between the sneers and the moral panics, gamers have become hyper-sensitive to criticism. We have a chip on our shoulders the exact shape of a tabloid front page. And that makes it hard to articulate the idea that while the medium is thrilling, exciting and innovative, individual titles can too often be derivative, nasty and riddled with stereotypes.</p><p>The <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series is certainly guilty on the last two counts. The novelist and critic Tom Bissell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/mar/21/tom-bissell-video-game-cocaine-addiction\" title=\"\">has described the protagonist's Jewish lawyer</a> in 2002's <em>Vice City</em> as &quot;an anti-Semitic parody of an anti-Semitic parody&quot;, while in the new game one of the main character's daughters has a tattoo that reads &quot;skank&quot;, and one mission involves you helping a paparazzo capture a starlet's &quot;low-hanging muff&quot;.</p><p>That's enough to make me sigh, but not give up. My own red line in games is the unthinking use of rape, whether as a &quot;character building&quot; incident for female protagonists (but, strangely, not for male ones) or as an &quot;edgy&quot; version of a sex scene. In the run-up to <em>GTA V</em>'s release, a disturbing forum posting went viral. &quot;I want to have the opportunity to kidnap a woman, hostage her, put her in my basement and rape her every day, listen to her crying, watching her tears,&quot; it read.</p><p>Now, I would flat out refuse to play a game where you could do that, regardless of whether it was forced on me by the storyline, or merely an option in sandbox play. So am I being a hypocrite running people over in my virtual car without a pang of remorse? I don't think so. &quot;In games the aim is, usually, to beat your opponent before they beat you,&quot; says Simon Parkin, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/grand-theft-auto-v-how-evil-should-a-video-game-allow-you-to-be.html\" title=\"\">who writes for the <em>New Yorker</em></a>. &quot;It's a game of reactions, speed and quick planning based upon principles of fairness – or of the protagonist overwhelming the odds. This is in no way analogous to rape, which is all about an assertion of power in an unequal equation. If you're threatened with rape, you don't respond in kind.&quot;</p><p>For the same reason, I am uncomfortable about <em>GTA</em>'s torture scene, where you extract information, along with a tooth, with a pair of pliers. Enjoying violence when it's not a &quot;fair fight&quot; feels very different to being quicker on the draw than an armed enemy.</p><p>This is where game fans' defensiveness becomes a problem. It takes a brave critic to slaughter a sacred cow – particularly by pointing out sexism in games – because the backlash can be so fierce. Anita Sarkeesian, who appealed for crowdfunding to make a web series about female characters, became the subject of an internet hate campaign as a result. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/nov/28/games-industry-sexism-on-twitter\" title=\"\">On the #1reasonwhy hashtag</a>, hundreds of women vented about why they were such rarities in the game industry: they felt their work was dismissed, their opinions were ignored, and some were subject to sexual harassment at conventions.</p><p>That is not a message that many gamers want to hear, nor do they want to confront the fact that this is a mature enough medium to face proper scrutiny. When Carolyn Petit of GameSpot called <em>GTA V</em> <a href=\"http://uk.gamespot.com/grand-theft-auto-v/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review-6414475/\" title=\"\">&quot;politically muddled and profoundly misogynistic&quot;, </a>the review attracted more than 20,000 comments, many of them viciously hostile. &quot;GameSpot shouldn't have given GTA V to a woman to review … their input is pointless,&quot; was one of the most printable.</p><p>Yet Petit was incredibly positive overall about the title, giving it 9 out of 10, and she tells me that the <em>GTA</em> series is one of her all-time favourites. &quot;I'm much more engaged by a game that makes meanings I find problematic than by a game that doesn't attempt to mean much of anything at all,&quot; she says. &quot;If creators genuinely want to put out works that celebrate misogyny, they are free to do so, and we are free to talk about their work critically.&quot;</p><p>She's right: the conversation needs to be more sophisticated. Without decrying game violence as a symptom of our moral decline, we need to explore how that violence is presented, and what it means within the game world. The same goes for misogyny.</p><p>So yes, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> is offensive – deliberately so, because controversy sells. Yes, it is &quot;problematic&quot; in its treatment of gender, race and sexuality. And yes, it is also an incredible technical and artistic accomplishment. In other words, it is just like any other milestone in any other creative field. Fans and detractors alike need to stop the special treatment.</p><p></p><p><em>Helen Lewis is deputy editor of the New Statesman</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417889369|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|ffc8c31c3bc60f129422c99ec8b2046f0b4948df -->",

        "body":"<p>He was known as \"the godfather of the console\", building the Japanese firm Nintendo from a playing cards manufacturer into one of the world's most powerful computer games businesses. Now the gaming industry is paying tribute to the company's former president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, who diedon Thursday  at 85.</p><p>For a generation of gamers, Yamauchi's Nintendo represented a golden era of mainstream gaming, dominated by classic titles like Super Mario Bros, Legend of Zelda and Metroid. In the early 90s, the company's mascot Mario, a moustachioed Italian plumber, became one of the world's most popular animated characters. A 1990 survey found he was more recognisable to American children than Mickey Mouse.</p><p>Yamauchi installed the company's central doctrine – that gameplay is always more important than technology. It is the philosophy that would continue to define the company after his retirement, leading to the hugely successful Nintendo Wii, which introduced a motion control device for gaming but relied on cheap off-the-shelf hardware, unlike its expensive rivals, the PS3 and Xbox 360.</p><p>The company said it was \"in mourning today from the sad loss of the former Nintendo president Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, who sadly passed away this morning.\"</p><p>Yamauchi took over the company after his grandfather, the previous president, suffered a stroke. He transformed Nintendo from a little-known manufacturer of Japanese <em>hanafuda</em> playing cards into the most powerful force in the global video game industry, and stood as president of the company from 1949 to 2002.</p><p>Yamauchi had a reputation for spotting talent and at a Nintendo factory he picked out engineer Gunpei Yokoi, who would eventually go on to develop the Game Boy handheld console. Yokoi had built a robotic arm for his own amusement, but Yamauchi saw the potential to mass-market the device as a product, kickstarting Nintendo's expansion into the toy and gadget market.</p><p>Noting the boom in video games, Yamauchi later asked young artist Shigeru Miyamoto to create an arcade machine that would appeal to the growing global audience. The result was Donkey Kong, a massive success in its own right and the origin of the Mario character.</p><p>The long-standing president would go on to oversee the company's entry into the home console business, which it dominated in the 80s and early 90s with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) consoles. At its height, Nintendo enjoyed a 90% share of the console hardware market.</p><p>Importantly, in the wake of the video game crash in 1983, where a glut of mediocre third-party releases for consoles such as the Atari VCS effectively devalued the whole industry, Yamauchi oversaw the introduction of Nintendo's \"seal of quality\" programme, which restricted the numbers of developers that could release games on its systems.</p><p>He intrinsically understood the importance of good games and talented game designers, rather than engineers and hi-tech hardware. In 2004, he told one Japanese newspaper: \"Cutting-edge technologies and multiple functions do not necessarily lead to more fun. The excessively hardware-oriented way of thinking is totally wrong, but manufacturers are just throwing money at developing higher-performance hardware.\"</p><p></p><p>A shrewd businessman, Yamauchi ensured that Nintendo remained debt-free throughout his long period in charge. Unlike the consoles marketed by most of his competitors, Nintendo machines were always sold at a profit rather than as loss-leaders for software sales; he also ensured that game publishers paid in advance for the manufacturing of game carts, removing the risk for his own company. In this way, he helped to revolutionise the way the games industry functioned.</p><p></p><p>Although Yamauchi stepped down in 2002 to be replaced by current president Satoru Iwata, he remained a major shareholder and retained an advisory role.</p><p>\"Hiroshi Yamauchi transformed a run-of the-mill trading card company into an entertainment empire in video games,\" said Ian Livingstone, co-founder of Games Workshop and life president of games developer Eidos. \"He understood the social value of play, and the economic potential of electronic gaming. Most importantly, he steered Nintendo on its own course and was unconcerned by the actions of his competitors. He was a true visionary.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417792824|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|0467da76509135aa8c88528f8fe39fc1bae8a686 -->",

        "body":"<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 has smashed its way into the record books with the largest ever first-day takings for a video game.</p><p>The latest instalment of the British-produced franchise took more than $800m (£498m) worldwide on Tuesday, underlining the appeal of the medium as Sony and Microsoft prepare to launch a new generation of consoles.</p><p>Billed as one of the most ambitious and expensive games ever created, the California-based crime epic has already more than recouped its $270m development and marketing budget.</p><p>Sales dwarf the previous $500m record set in 2012 by Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, and beaten in a single day the $500m in revenue which Grand Theft Auto's fourth instalment generated in its first week nearly five years ago.</p><p>\"The last major Grand Theft Auto title sold just under 13 million [units] in the course of the year. This did that in a day,\" said Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research.</p><p>The success of a game which features mafia bosses, motorcycle gangs, man-eating sharks and cynical movie producers running riot in a fictional town loosely based on Los Angeles, has underlined once again the console's ability to host entertainment franchises more valuable than those produced in Hollywood.</p><p>The biggest ever opening weekend for a feature film was achieved by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 in 2011, when it took $480m worldwide at the box office – a fraction of Grand Theft Auto's single day achievement.</p><p>Described by the Guardian's games critic as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/16/gta-5-review-grand-theft-auto-v\" title=\"\">\"a monstrous parody of modern life\"</a>, the game unleashes the player's inner thug with missions to steal cars and rob banks. It has defied predictions that lavish video game productions will soon be sidelined by a multitude of cheaper and more disposable smartphone apps.</p><p>News that consumers are still prepared to part with £38 for a single title will cheer Sony, which releases Playstation 4 in the United States on 15 November, and its rival Microsoft, whose Xbox One goes on sale a week later.</p><p>\"No one title is an indicator of success of upcoming platforms,\" said David Riley, executive director at market researcher NPD Group. \"You can't say because of GTA the industry would be saved. But it is a boost in the arm of the industry that it has needed for quite a while. We are going to have a great holiday season worldwide.\"</p><p>In August, NPD found US sales of hardware, accessories and software grew year on year for the first time since October 2011, albeit by a modest 1%. But the boost was entirely due to new titles, with sales of consoles down 40%.</p><p>Take-Two chairman and chief executive Strauss Zelnick <a href=\"http://ir.take2games.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86428&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1856046&amp;highlight=\" title=\"\">praised</a> the Edinburgh-based team at Rockstar North which produces the GTA franchise for \"setting the entertainment industry's new standard for creativity, innovation and excellence\". He said in north America alone, 8,300 shops had opened their doors at midnight to make the most of the release.</p><p>Sony said Thursday it expected sales of its new PlayStation 4 console to reach 5 million units this financial year, about 40% more than its third console generated in the same period seven years ago. But smartphones already far outsell consoles, and less complex games like Angry Birds, Candy Crush and Dots are booming.</p><p>\"A lot of kids don't want $40 games any more, they want 40 $1 games,\" Nancy MacIntyre told Bloomberg. A former executive at game studio LucasArts, she now runs a social-gaming network Fingerprint Digital.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417772947|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|7f5b78373f80968b08ca49ef68be83dca7befb4b -->",

        "body":"<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-417432152\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/9/16/160913GTA5gameplay-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/9/16/160913GTA5gameplay_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>There has been a particular theory going round for the last year or so, that \"box set\" TV has replaced movies as the preferred form of mass, culturally meaningful entertainment. It is the likes of Breaking Bad, The Wire and Homeland that are telling us about modern life now, rather than Hollywood's simplified three-act confections. Grand Theft Auto V, however, <em>hints</em> at a future in which that role is taken by games – or at the very least actively sought by them. Unlike the vast swathe of wondrous entertainment the video game industry produces, this series cannot be safely pigeon-holed or ignored by non-players. For the last decade, Rockstar has wielded a sledgehammer over public perceptions of what video games are or can be; now it has struck with merciless force.</p><p>Set mostly within the glitzily superficial city of Los Santos, a warped mirror of Los Angeles, GTA V is a sprawling tale of criminal maniacs self-destructing on a blood-splattered career trajectory to hell. Michael is the middle-aged thug, obsessed with movies, who pulled a witness protection deal with the feds after a failed heist many years ago. When his old partner Trevor, a sociopath who bakes meth out in the desert, turns up in town, the two join forces with a young black kid, Franklin, who's set on leaving his gang-infested neighbourhood behind. The aim is a few final high-paying jobs, but there's a festering resentment between Trev and Michael that goes back a long way, a fizzing fuse that trails all the way through the carnage.</p><p>This three-character format emancipates the narrative, jettisoning the awkward requirement for one protagonist to be everywhere, witnessing everything in this vast world. Switching between the characters can be done at any time while off mission, and all three have their own little pet projects to get involved with, adding variety and a few amusing surprises: switching to Trevor usually involves some bodily function or weird violent episode, while Michael has his dysfunctional family to manage. And overlaying all this is a huge plot about warring government agencies and corrupt billionaires.</p><p>The result is a freewheeling joyride through genre cinema and literature: there are psychopathic mafia bosses, insane motorcycle gangs, xenophobically sketched triads, corrupt secret agents and cynical movie producers – their stories twist and interconnect, slithering around the lives of our protagonists. It's dizzying at times, but also daftly compelling, and the influence of multi-strand dramas such as The Wire is obvious.</p><h2>On a mission</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558272'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379335926701/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: Trevor feels the Heat</figcaption></figure><p>GTA veterans will still recognise how the game underneath it all works. There is a backbone of narrative missions that gamers must complete in order to progress, but beyond them is a vast range of dynamic encounters, side-quests and money-making ventures, from buying property to managing clubs and playing the stock exchange (which cleverly reacts to in-game events, allowing you to make extra cash by buying the right shares at the right time). Most story tasks are variations on one theme – drive somewhere, shoot something, drive back – but as with all video game feedback loops, the joy of the system is in the execution. And boy does GTA V execute.</p><p>To say much more would be to ruin the fun of discovery, but rest assured there are insane stunts, there is massive destruction, there is military-grade weaponry, and you will be required to jump out of planes. And helicopters. Combining the sheer scale of the environment with the excellent physics engine, these escapades throw everything at you, from rural bank-heists to jet-ski chases, to operating huge industrial machinery. The bigger heists require mini-preparatory missions (hiding getaway cars, picking novelty masks) which help build the tension, and subtly add to the feeling that what we're all doing here is acting in our own version of Michael Mann's film Heat. While certain ideas are repackaged and chucked straight back at you several times, you're carried along on a rush of euphoric action and shock – mostly because the world looks and behaves as though all this makes sense.</p><h2>Satirical scope</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558273'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336812314/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: sharp-suited Michael</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, Rockstar North has built an extraordinary universe that functions not only as an exciting, diverse setting but also as a pulverising, nihilistic satire on western society. Reality TV, celebrity magazines, social media, plastic surgery, pop psychology books – all get savaged via the often hilarious commercials on the game's many radio and TV stations. Even games themselves get hit: an advert for Righteous Slaughter 7 promises \"the realistic art of contemporary killing\".</p><p>This isn't just confined to extraneous detail, it slides into the narrative. At one point we see the offices of a giant social network, Lifeinvader, a spot-on amalgam of Facebook, Apple and Google. The staff all wear cargo shorts, whine on about organic lactose-free dairy products and treat their CEO with religious deference. We also get corrupt FBI and CIA agents (called FiB and IAA in the game), trading drugs and manufacturing terrorist threats to keep their budgets topped up. Everyone is on the make, everyone is dangerous, and the game delights in thrusting us into the middle of it as a willing participant.</p><p>Gunfights, meanwhile, are furious, visceral ballets, fuelled by regular visits to the well-stocked Ammu-Nation stores. while GTA has learned a lot about organic environments from Red Dead Redemption (the rural areas of San Andreas are abuzz with wildlife), it has learned its game systems from Max Payne. The combat is ultra-smooth with a variety of decent, functional aiming options and a cover mechanic that works almost imperceptibly – the greatest compliment you can pay to this concept. Limited more by the player's imagination than by ability, most set-piece encounters are not overwhelmingly challenging, but they are spectacular - and this is the point. You have to understand that Grand Theft Auto V is not really a game about story or mechanics, even if it wants to be – it is a game about spectacle and experience.</p><h2>Forgivable flaws</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558274'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379334561650/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: there's a lot of driving</figcaption></figure><p>This is really important because it allows us to forgive the game's flaws. You have to do a <em>lot</em> of driving. There are no shortcuts, so every mission involves hitting the highways to get to the trigger point; and yes sometimes you think \"Ugh, not another car ride\". Rockstar North has also developed a slightly irritating narrative trope that I'll call \"the exposition expedition\": there are a lot of long journeys that just seem to be there so that the lead characters can chat about back-story, or engage in meandering expletive-drenched conversations on pop culture and psychology – something we probably have Tarantino to thank for.</p><p>Furthermore, the designers don't always make the rules of the system clear. Some missions will only end successfully if you carry out the correct action after a specific prompt, while others don't provide a prompt at all and then fail you if you miss the mandatory sweet spot. The game also has the habit of simultaneously providing mission instructions via in-game dialogue and an on-screen text prompt, which at the very least means you miss plot details, but at the worst means you can be left wondering what the hell you're supposed to do next because you paid attention to the wrong thing. Or at least that was my experience; others may be better at ludological multitasking.</p><p>Women are, once again, relegated to supporting roles as unfaithful wives, hookers and weirdos. The one successful female character in the story is suspected of just wanting to screw her boss. Of course, GTA is essentially an interactive gangster movie, and the genre has a long history of investigating straight male machismo at the expense of all other perspectives, but it would have been wonderful to see Rockstar challenging that convention. It's fine to parody the idiotic misogyny of violent men, but how about doing it by providing their opposite? It seems Rockstar North's all-male writing team is too in thrall to Tarantino and Brett Easton Ellis to really consider this.</p><h2>Seductive vision</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558275'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336519788/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: Los Santos is glitzily superficial</figcaption></figure><p>Ah but… The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing – just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead.</p><p>The world drags you in. It begs you to explore – and then it rewards you. You feel every millimetre of the landscape has been thoughtfully handcrafted with the curious gamer in mind. This seems an odd compliment – surely every video game landscape is crafted in this way. But so often, open worlds are built from architectural filler – bland unending landscapes and cardboard box tenements. San Andreas is a state of contrasts and extraordinary detail, there is always some interesting new nook to chance on, some breathtaking previously unexperienced view across the hills toward the capitalist spires of downtown. Designers often talk about rewarding the player for exploration, but usually do so with facile Easter eggs, hidden away in mundane backwaters. From the raging rivers running through the mountain wilderness parks to the beautiful modernist architecture tucked way in the Vinewood hills, Grand Theft Auto V is – like Fallout and Skyrim before it – a form of virtual tourism.</p><p>The talent too is in the emergent moments the system produces. Driving to a violent heist with Don Johnson's Heartbeat playing on the radio, the freeway clear before you; flying a crop-dusting plane up the contour of Mount Chiliad, so that you reach the peak just as the red sun falls, sending rainbows of lens flare through your cockpit screen; clipping a police car during a chase, sending your own vehicle spinning off the overpass onto the roof of an liquor store. All fun, all about you the player.</p><h2>Complicity and culpability</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417558276'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336675892/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: explosive action</figcaption></figure><p>And however familiar the GTA set-up is, it still works. Blasting your way out of impossible face-offs with private armies, streaking through the city streets in a new car – some will hate the sheer amorality, the relentless seething darkness of the narrative. <strong>[Spoiler]</strong> Many too will be horrified by an interactive torture scene that pushes the player to perform acts of cruelty on a defenceless victim <strong>[spoiler ends]</strong>. But GTA is all about complicity and culpability – what is the player prepared to do in this world? How much are they responsible for? During the game, Michael makes several visits to a shrink, complaining that he feels someone else is controlling him. Rockstar wants to interrogate the relationship between player and game – or at least snigger at the psychopolitics of it all.</p><p>Yes, some people will hate GTA V. Some, like me, will thoroughly enjoy it while acknowledging its complications, its shortcomings as a narrative adventure. Last of Us says more about humanity in five minutes than GTA V does in its 70-plus missions. Five stars for such a troubled proposition? That'll confuse and anger a few people, I know it. But no one constructs worlds like Rockstar and this one is worth many, many hours of exploration. It is fun, so much guilty, ridiculous fun. It is beautiful to look at, it is jammed with ideas, and when the free add-on, Grand Theft Auto Online, comes out in October, it will offer a compelling multiplayer experience, where participants combine and face off in gigantic turf wars.</p><p>And then GTA V is also a monstrous parody of modern life – our bubbling cesspit of celebrity fixation, political apathy and morose self-obsession. I half expected it to end with the Houser brothers dressed as Papa Lazarou from League of Gentlemen staring into the camera and whispering seductively, \"you all live in Los Santos now\". But they don't need to, of course. This misanthropic masterpiece says it all for them.</p><p><em>Tested on Xbox 360.

The launch of Grand Theft Auto V at midnight on Monday will see long queues snake down high streets at daybreak as the first copies go on sale.</p><p>The video game series is as controversial as it is successful. So far, it has sold more than 100m copies since it was developed in Edinburgh in 1997.</p><p>Players take on the role of a criminal in a fictional US city and rise through the ranks of organised crime with action-adventure and shootouts.</p><p>The latest version – known as GTA V – is the biggest and most ambitious yet, with an imagined world larger than the rest of the series put together, and follows three criminals as they steal, shoot and shop their way through the fictional city of Los Santos.</p><p>It has taken Rockstar – the firm behind it – four years to develop at a cost, according to one analyst, of about $137.5m (£87m) even before you include its marketing budget.</p><p>Rob Crossley, associate editor of gaming news site CVG, predicts that GTA V may sell twice as fast as Call of Duty: Black Ops, which in 2010 became the fastest selling game in the UK with 1.4m copies sold in one day.</p><p>\"Rockstar has reportedly allocated 3m copies for the UK launch,\" he says. \"It's unlikely all will be sold on day one, but it's an astonishing figure nevertheless. Put it this way, that launch allocation accounts for a quarter of all combined Xbox 360 and PS3 owners in the UK.\"</p><p>The central plot revolves around retired bank robber, Michael de Santa, returning to a life of crime with a young protege, Franklin, and his psychotic cohort, Trevor. But the appeal of the game is as much to do with the extracurricular detail. The world of GTA is full of diversions – from shopping malls to strip clubs and sports events, all open to the player.</p><p>\"Fans appreciate the sheer amount of thought that goes into the GTA games,\" says Nick Underdown, founder of fan site Rockstar Resource. \"A lot of the things people are looking forward to don't involve any criminal activity at all – a lot of the fun will come from the racing, parachuting, playing golf or tennis and all the other sports on offer – and it seems like a small thing, but the soundtrack is so important, it plays a massive part in the setting.\"</p><p>GTA V has more than 200 tracks for players to listen to while driving the game's miles of streets and motorways, from country classics to leftfield electronica and chart hits.</p><p>It's a key part of the appeal – the 2002 title GTA: Vice City featured seven CDs of 80s pop, which enhanced the game's narrative homage to that decade's film and TV shows such as Scarface and Miami Vice.</p><p>\"Lots of my customers have told me they've booked the day off to play it,\" says Gareth Rowbotham, owner of the Playtime chain of video game stores in Nottingham, Sheffield and Doncaster. \"I'm not being derogatory, but our customers aren't high-flying ABC1s with two cars and three holidays a year. They're on minimum wage, working 40-50 hours a week. They'll come in, buy GTA and play it for 12 hours straight. It's a way of escaping the banality of normal life.\"</p><p>Jevon Farr, a fan of the series who helps run community site GTAnet.com, explains the game's appeal. \"It's the freedom, the humour, the atmosphere, multiple concurrent protagonists, a gigantic and detailed world map, a dynamic economy, elaborate customisations and a multiplayer mode that becomes self-perpetuating with user-generated content … however, one of our team just said, 'I want to hurl cars down the mountains.'\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417384702'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/12/1379002664335/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-010.jpg' alt='Grand Theft Auto V' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA V is more than a car game or a shoot-em-up, say industry experts and gamers. Photograph: Rockstar</figcaption></figure><p>For Adam Saltsman, a game designer, it is the sense of a living, dramatic world that gives the game wider cultural significance and appeal. \"The Grand Theft Auto series is the closest thing games have to a prestigious HBO or BBC series – it is like really high-end TV. There is lots of visceral low art – and I do not use that pejoratively, but there's also lots of high art too. The game is very large and very rich, not just geographically, but almost vertically. It has the gangster story and the sandbox stuff, but then it has all these satirical radio stations, and even weirder, deeper jokes and commentary.\"</p><p>Jesper Juul, a video game theorist and author, says the great expectations are down to GTA V being \"better than 99% of the cinema or novels. It is better for giving players a chance to consider what they would do in a fictional world.\"</p><p>The game's co-writer Dan Houser has described it as a satire on Los Angeles, and more specifically a modern Hollywood fading into insignificance in an era of outsourced production. GTA V is filled with failed actors, drug-soaked producers and various hangers-on. Every aspect of the society it creates was researched, mostly through first-hand interviews.</p><p>\"We just wandered around LA,\" said Houser. \"Our researchers did an incredible job of finding us some of the strangest people: retired cops, former FBI agents, entrepreneurs who'd retired on a massive fund of money at 28, people who specialised in knowing the underworld of LA – and everyone in between. We'd just hang out with them for a few days to see what happened.\"</p><p>GTA V is available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. There are rumours an enhanced version will be available on the next-generation consoles, which launch in November. But many already see GTA V as a \"next generation\" game. It hints at a future in which games become more like virtual holidays, a form of all-encompassing escapism.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417148362|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|da330f9d9f983534daf3db273a32295db02386dc -->",

        "trailText":"On the eve of Sonic Lost World's launch,  leader of team Sonic Takashi Iizuka discusses the evolution of Sega's mascot. By <strong>Simon Parkin</strong>",
        "headline":"Sonic the Hedgehog: past, present and future",
        "body":"<p>In recent years Sonic's appeal has waned or, perhaps, curved downwards, towards an ever-younger audience. But on his 1991 debut, Sonic the Hedgehog seemed unstoppable. Bristling with high-energy verbs – spin, roll, streak and ricochet – Sega's video game mascot-in-waiting made his rival Super Mario's clutch of moves seem sedentary by comparison. Leave MegaDrive Sonic unprompted on screen and, after a few seconds, he turns to glare out of the screen, tapping an irritable foot as if you're wasting his time, keeping him from his mission. Spinning at 200 fierce rotations per minute, Sonic was immediately a source of renewed vigour and direction for Sega, a company whose first decade in the video game industry had been characterised by mediocrity.</p><p>Indeed, at the time of Sonic's debut, Sega's rival Nintendo laid claim to 92% of the video game market share.</p><p>At the time Takashi Iizuka was a student at the Tokyo Denki university, studying electrical engineering. Iizuka's peers began to apply for jobs at Sony, Hitachi and the other Japanese electronics giants to where the university's orderly graduates traditionally progressed. \"When I was a kid I wanted to become a manga artist,\" he says. \"At university I learned to put those dreams aside. My parents encouraged me to look at more realistic options. Everyone was expected to go on to work for an electronics maker. It was almost a set path. But in my final year I decided to revisit those dreams and to focus on what I really wanted to do: create something fun and enjoyable.\"</p><p>That summer Iizuka played Sonic the Hedgehog. \"I couldn't believe the game and the technology on which it ran. It was a marvel,\" he says. Iizuka applied to Sega, much to his parents' chagrin (\"Sega wasn't well known at the time. It took a while for my family to come around\") and, in 1992 joined the company and the character, that would come to define his life.</p><p>Until the launch of Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega's approach to making video games was to develop cheap and quickly. Mark Cerny, the architect of Sony's forthcoming PlayStation 4, worked for Sega in Japan at the time, a company he joined after working for Atari. He recalls: \"Moving from Atari to Sega was like night and day. At Atari it was all about creativity, if the concept wasn't 100% original you weren't allowed to make it. Non-original ideas were thrown out. But Sega was about shovelling the titles out of the door.\"</p><p>Most of Sega's titles at the time were built within a strict three-month deadline, with a single programmer and one artist. \"They made 40 games in this way,\" says Cerny.</p><p>\"But by my judgment only two were really worth playing. Sega didn't get out of that philosophy till Sonic the Hedgehog, where the president decided to put three people on the project for 10 months. They ended up having five people for 13 months. It was Sega's first million seller.\"</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog was designed by one of Sega's artists, Masato Oshima, who worked to a specific brief to come up with an appealing mascot character. \"At the time I had never been outside Japan,\" he says, \"so the experience of moving to America in my first working year was entirely daunting.\" And while the first game was a system-selling success for Sega, it was still unclear whether Sega had, in their restless hedgehog, a mascot of Super Mario's power and appeal. \"We had no concept that the character and series would become what it is today,\" says lizuka. \"For me it was one of those crucial chances we take in life; one of the ones that change everything.\"</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 vastly outsold its predecessor and Iizuka continued to shadow Naka in America, working on two more sequels. But in 1995 the pair returned to Japan to begin work on a new game for Sega's 32-bit system, the Saturn. Iizuka was promoted to lead designer and, while Nights into Dreams shared visual similarities with the Sonic titles, it was a dreamy relative, Sonic through a glass darkly. \"It was the first time I'd worked on a new IP that wasn't Sonic,\" says Iizuka. \"We knew we wanted to create a game that was based on flying, not running, but there were immense challenges doing so within the confines of a so-called 'platform game'. How do you make a platform game without any platforms? We went back and forth for the longest time trying to get the design right.\"</p><p>During these years Yuji Naka led the so-called Sonic Team through a string of inventive hits, from Burning Rangers to Phantasy Star Online. But, contrary to perception, Sonic Team itself doesn't exist. \"There was never a set team as such,\" explains Iizuka. \"Whatever group of people was working on one of Naka's games at the time were referred to as the Sonic Team. But Naka had a keen idea of what Sonic Team's games should stand for.\"</p><p>Naka left Sega in 2006 and stewardship for Sonic Team passed to lizuka. What is the Sonic team essence for Iizuka, the quiddity of Naka's approach to game design and execution? \"One of the most important lessons that Naka taught me was the importance of game feel,\" he says. \"What a video game feels like in the hands is essential. That was there from the very beginning, and still is a core value today. Also, Naka was adamant that we should never be making copies of other games. He would always strive to create new things. That has stuck with me and become my goal.\"</p><p>Iizuka has another chance to prove his adherence to Naka's rules with the launch of Sonic Lost World on Nintendo's Wii U next month. \"For me it's a rethink of all that a platform game is and can be,\" says lizuka. \"One of the main things with Sonic games is speed: we wanted to make this more a controllable game, where that speed can be harnessed in a more effective way than perhaps in the past. It's a case of trying to marry the speed of the earlier Sonic games with the action of the more recent ones.</p><p>It's difficult to keep the classic Sonic feel. But we've kept the way that he moves, and that sense of speed.\"</p><p>One key challenge for the Sonic the Hedgehog series in moving from the 2D graphics of the 16-bit era to contemporary 3D is the increase in costs associated with a character who can fly through scenery quicker than most. \"It's true that, when you feature a speed-based character you require far longer levels,\" says lizuka. That immediately means the production is longer and development is more costly. Crafting background details keeps the costs up. We've tried to keep it to a manageable level while keeping the feel and fidelity of the game world. It's a balancing act, but one that we continue to improve at.\"</p><p>However, lizuka rejects the idea that Sonic has significantly changed over the past 22 years. He says: \"The surroundings have changed. The supporting characters and enemies have changed. But Sonic himself retains the same character as he did in the beginning. I've lived with Sonic ever since then. He's been a part of my life. He keeps me young.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417231376|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|0962140259e2f3dc686799fc8cb7fe2207cfc885 -->",

After a year of pre-publicity and a five-year wait since GTA IV, the latest instalment in Rockstar's gangland opus is almost upon us. Featuring a game world larger than than any other title in the series, hours of cinematic sequences and a truly epic cast of crazed characters, Grand Theft Auto V has a scale and ambition that exceeds most triple A development on the current consoles. Indeed, people are already calling GTA V the first next-generation video game.</p><p>Last October I travelled to New York to get one of the first demos of the game. While there, I met Dan Houser, co-founder of Rockstar and co-writer of the Grand Theft Auto titles. There, I asked him about the process of building a new GTA from scratch, and how the different parts of Rockstar North combine to allow its complicated interplay of story, side-missions and sand box freedom. </p><p>In the first part of that interview, he tells us about the creative process, about how the characters are written and how they are brought to life; and about the complexities of marrying narrative and gameplay in such a large adventure. </p><p>Part two follows on Monday.</p><p><strong>How do you begin a Grand Theft Auto game? Are you always thinking of the next one?</strong></p><p>We don't see it as a production line in that way. We have a lot of guys on the team – it's not like a freelance unit that gets taken down and put back together again, so of course, when it finishes we do need to roll on to something <em>fairly</em> quickly, but there's a certain amount of downtime. Not till the very dying embers of this will we give the next one a moment's thought. And that's if we're going to do another one – we always said that if we couldn't think of something interesting to do then we'd stop – for this or Red Dead, but particularly for GTA. As much as anything they are a response to what we think went well or what we could do better or what could be different from the last one.</p><p><strong>GTA IV felt like a real change in direction – or at least a maturation – for the series…</strong></p><p>After San Andreas, with the move to high definition, we really wanted it to be focused and very tight – apart from anything else, we couldn't do any more than that – because of the complexities of just making an HD game at the time. This time, we wanted to make something very broad in scope because we have a bit more understanding of the tech and we wanted to use that to put a big landscape in there and lots of outdoor aspects to it. That was the first sliver of a concept.</p><p><strong>And how do things usually progress after the first kernel of an idea? How do you decide where to go next?</strong></p><p>I think it's Sam [Houser] and Aaron Garbut who decide… they'll certainly discuss it with Leslie [Benzies, producer], myself and a few other people, but it's between the two of them – Aaron especially because he has to plan it and build it. Sam gets really heavily involved in that early stage of where it's going to go. For GTA V, they were keen on LA for a bunch of reasons but in particular because we hadn't done it properly. We made San Andreas, but LA was only a tiny bit of that – it was a section of three small villages linked together by some cool countryside – so we felt that we could do something that was very different. Having a developer in San Diego and business in LA all the time, we all go over there at different points throughout the year – it's a city we know very well and feel we haven't done justice to. We felt we could do something very fresh and new there. So the very first decision is the place. LA gives us the countryside around Southern California, which is spectacular and good for the kind of game we wanted to make. You get the mountains, the desert – that seemed very appealing.</p><p><strong>And what do you think about next?</strong></p><p>On previous games, the next thing has been the character and the reason why they're in the world and what we're going to do with them in the world. That's the normal process – and alongside that, a feature set of things we want to do differently and things we want to improve. This time, we thought about Niko and John Marston: they're kind of single-player odysseys for want of a better word. They were so epic in scope. We thought, what can we do with one player that's better than that? Who, as Franklin, are you most likely to want to follow or believe or not believe? That process began to set the story in motion and the narrative evolved out of the characters' past and their future. As soon as we had those characters, that side of the game came together fairly organically – as it should do. Every time we get the lead character and what their reasoning in the world is, if we're doing a good job and it's the right thing, the rest of it… I mean, maybe the ending needs some work and some of the things driving it forward – but the overall feel of the story should feel very organic to us. If we get that feeling, we know we've got a story that people are going to find compelling.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-417225384\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/12/1379002289829/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-010.jpg\" alt=\"Grand Theft Auto V\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Grand Theft Auto V's appeal, and that of the rest of the series, is as much to do with the extracurricular detail that creates a world full of diversions, say fans. Photograph: Rockstar</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Do you feel receptive to influences during this period? The first few GTA games felt cinematic. It felt like you were channeling movie culture – has that changed?</strong></p><p>I think we tried to move away from that, quite consciously, after San Andreas. That was for a bunch of reasons, but I suppose primarily we felt that we wanted to say something that was not speaking about movies but about the wider media world. And also, when you're making something about the 80s, you want to talk about 80s media as much as anything else, but with something about 2008 or 2013, I believe we're as equipped to say that as much as anyone else. It no longer felt relevant to us to [pastiche movies]. We'd had a good experience doing that but it was time to move on and do our own thing.</p><p><strong>Where do you think games sit in terms of modern culture?</strong></p><p>I don't know, you tell me? Where do you think they sit?</p><p><strong>Well, it seems to me that because they are interactive and the way we live now is very fast and hyper social, they better reflect our lives than linear media. I think they're the natural story-telling medium of this century. How about you?</strong></p><p>I think that's a very interesting idea and I hadn't really thought about it in those terms. I wouldn't necessarily have the confidence to think in those terms – but <em>you</em> should as a games journalist because it's up to people like you to push those theories… It's up to <em>us</em> to make the best stuff we can make – it's not necessarily up to us to shout from the rooftops about how clever we are, how progressive we are, or how sophisticated we are. It's our place to make stuff that's as good as it can be.</p><p>And I suppose we're not really seeing the limitations in games… movies have limitations as a storytelling medium and so do games, but the limitations are different. Our job is to be aware of the limitations, find the strengths, and work toward those strengths. And I think as we get more experiences and the medium gets more mature, we do a better job of achieving that. That's not to say that games are perfect or flawless, it's still a very, very young medium.</p><p>Look at the evolution of our games from GTA 2 to GTA 3, through Red Dead. I'm not saying we do a good, bad or indifferent job, I'm just saying there's a clear evolution in technique, if not in talent – the technique at least has clearly moved on. In terms of what we're doing, our understanding, and the technology needed to support that understanding, the way that story and missions and off-mission stuff in the open world games all interplay – it's getting more sophisticated, that's definitely the case. We are hopefully treading ground that hasn't been trodden before and finding a better way of treading it each time. And I don't just necessarily mean as writers, but as technicians in terms of things like how we use the cameras to get you in and out of cut-scenes, the seamless interrelation of cut-scenes and the game, things like that. We've made so much progression – we've got better tech and better technicians working on it.</p><p><strong>One thing that really stands out is the quality of the cut-scenes, the acting, the interplay of the characters on screen – it feels a lot more naturalistic now...</strong></p><p>It used to be like watching youth theatre! The most you could possibly get in the world at one time was three people. It felt so amateurish, but we used to have to push it into the game and hope we could make it just about okay. Now, it's not <em>like</em> they're shooting a big budget Hollywood movie, they are. It's just that there's more of it and they're chopping it into smaller pieces. It's incredible to watch it going on, I feel like a complete spare part. I watch our incredibly talented director, Rod Edge, who's been with us since GTA IV, and occasionally give him a note. But fundamentally, it's their territory, I stay in the background. It's phenomenal what they're doing there – we have a mo-cap set-up that only Weta and James Cameron can match.</p><p><strong>And this is about full performance capture these days?</strong></p><p>We gave up the phrase voice actor in 2008 and we haven't used it since. We don't have voice actors anymore, because they're the same as the mo-cap actors. This is something we discovered by chance. We used to use famous actors, partly because the mo-cap process was so cumbersome and we could only have three people anyway. But on San Andreas, a guy, a sort of second-rate comedian, got offended by the script and stormed out of the recording studio, shouting, &quot;I'm not doing this, it's offensive.&quot; We just thought, well your agent did some great research there.</p><p>We were wondering who we'd get to do it and I was watching the videos of the mo-cap sessions and I was like, 'the guy who's doing it on set is really good, why don't we just use him?' And we did, and the proximity of the performance to the animation was much fresher than we were getting anywhere else. We did Bully straightaway afterwards and that was using kids - there weren't enough famous kids to do it anyway, so we used the same actors and it really brought it to life.</p><p>It's all based on a sound stage now. It's the same performance for voice and body. You do it all in one capture. Any one character might have a range of actors, you might have a stunt man doing some moves or a weapons specialist doing others, but for us, we're forgetting about the concept of an actor and just capturing the person who feels alive in this world. When we get it all feeling seamless, like we did with John Marston, we've done a good job.</p><p><strong>How do you build your characters for GTA? Do you take inspiration from people you know?</strong></p><p>I hope not! It's a sort of collaborative effort, there's not really a formula. Sometimes you see someone, someone on TV or walking down the street, or you meet someone and you think, 'There's an aspect of this person that's so ridiculous, I just want to capture that'. Or one of the other guys will go, 'I just met this maniac who walks like <em>this</em>!' – and the character will evolve from there. The first thing we speak about might actually get dropped, but it will be the atmosphere, some veneer of over-confidence or some rabid insecurity beneath it – that's what we'll wrap a character around. Or sometimes it will be one of us watching a terrifying documentary about a serial killer, and there will be one thing about him…</p><p><strong>So they're not people you know?</strong></p><p>The only one that I would confess to being fully autobiographical to me was this horrible character in Bully who was based on a kid I went to school with. The rest of them, they're all composites from me, from Sam and a bunch of other guys coming up with ideas. Then it's a question of getting the look right. But then once it's written, it's about the combination of animating, game design and acting.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us a little about this collaborative process early in a GTA game?</strong></p><p>So me, Rupert Humphries and Imran Sarwar, one of the main designers, will sit around early in the game, talking about stuff, then Sam, Aaron and Leslie will look at it and sign off on it or offer feedback on it. But it doesn't really matter what we put down on the page, we might imagine certain characters are going to be very strong, and they're not, and others start out okay and turn out fantastic. It's all combined with Mike Kane, who's the chief character designer, and his guys. It's also the actors and Rod and the mo-cap guys bringing these character to life – everyone has input.</p><p>The idea, the page, is one thing, but the end result is often miles away. I think that's a strength rather than a weakness. Sometimes, a character will come back from the first round of mo-cap and you'll go, 'Oh, that's so wrong', and we'll say, 'Get rid of it and do it again'. But usually, they'll come up with something that's different from what we were thinking of – and much better. If we've cast a good actor and they really attack it, they'll help find a direction for it. We have a fairly low attrition rate on that stuff. But getting it to life is definitely a group effort. At all stages. Cameras, different techniques for different characters… there are lots of little tricks to bring it to life and make characters memorable – even though you're only with them a very short amount of time sometimes.</p><p><strong>Do you think about the meaning of the game in the early stages? Do you look to convey specific messages?</strong></p><p>Because of the nature of games, this combination of narrative and freeform experience, they can give you an experience that is very different from what someone else discerns – it can mean different things, which I think is their greatest strength as an immersive medium. We're very hands off in that regard, the authorial presence <em>should</em> be hands off in terms of determining interpretation, otherwise it's not remotely sophisticated. But I'm not saying <em>we </em>are sophisticated!</p><p><strong>You talk about collaboration a lot – it seems very important at Rockstar. Are you constantly having to rewrite narrative based on feedback from the game designers?</strong></p><p>Well… we chop it up. We have an overview that gets turned into a game design and a game flow and the missions. We do bits of it, I'll do some on one mission, the others will do some – it's very easy to fix bits that way. We're not precious about it... well, we're precious at the end – is it any good?</p><p>But it's only occasionally that we'll have real problems We have a couple of game designers with us all the time while we write, so we're not working against game design. It used to be back in the day that there was a bit more of a structural break between game design and story writing and we've really worked hard to get rid of that so we all feel like we're equally invested in it. There shouldn't be this big space: the story needs this and the game designers need that. Hopefully, if we've planned it all together, we should all feel one and the same, we shouldn't feel like separate departments. When it comes to actually writing the exact dialogue for within the body of the mission, the writer and the designer sit together and go through it line by line by line. But even before that, it should feel collaborative all the way along. The conflicts are usually: 'This idea looked great on paper but for whatever reason it aint working,' so we all have to agree on replacing it.</p><p><strong>Do you have creative flashpoints?</strong></p><p>Not really, it doesn't really work like that. The flash points are these: this bit's needed for the story, but it's not working in terms of gameplay – the mission is not fun, it needs to go. We always have missions that get cut out for whatever reason. We either have to rejig bits of the story to make it all tie together or we have to cut that bit of story onto a different mission. This game is very tightly bound because it has three interconnected stories the whole way along, it's complex. But everyone approaches them in the spirit of, 'How do we fix it?' If we all understand what each bit needs, how do we make it all gel together?</p><p>It's a bit like editing a movie in that you need to get it to a certain length. The tech is better now, it makes it slower to work but you can fix things more easily, you can repurpose bits, throw things away, fix them up again. We've always lost bits – 'Oh it's not making any sense!' – then you just redo one scene and it makes perfect sense. That's just a standard part of the process.</p><p>We pride ourselves on not being too pig-headed internally. Our goal as a company isn't for people to say that Rockstar has got good game design but shit stories, or good stories and shit game design; we want them to say Rockstar make good games. Ideally, they can't think about anything except, 'I love the whole experience'. The goal is to have the whole thing feel indivisible.</p><p><strong>Which is something that games criticism has to catch up with…</strong></p><p>You know, game reviewing, when it sort of breaks down into checklists, you feel like you may as well have made a lawnmower. It feels odd to me. I mean, games <em>are</em> sort of like a machine in some ways, but I still think that's a strange way to think about them. Don't think about the graphics or the music or whatever, just think about the whole. Was the experience engaging? That's what we're going for. We tailor our stories and our mission designs to make this total experience that will feel good alongside the graphics, alongside the physics – it should all feel cohesive, it should feel that the whole world exists and you can't really separate the elements. It's all got to gel together – that's when we think we've been successful.</p><p><strong>Part two on Monday covers the making of Los Santos, the emphasis on male characters and the chances of ever seeing another GTA title set in Britain...</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417198952|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|aadbc99574a1b9c2b2e3768cf878487136718db2 -->",
