        "headline":"Senate leaders close in on debt ceiling deal after talks on Capitol Hill",
        "body":"<p>Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate were scrambling towards a deal that would avert the looming crisis over the US debt ceiling, as the threat of failure to reach an agreement finally appeared to have concentrated minds in Washington.</p> <p>Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority and minority leaders, held two lengthy meetings on Monday in an attempt to nail down terms of a possible compromise. The urgency of the talks was matched by the scale of the crisis facing them: unless an agreement is reached on raising America’s borrowing limit by midnight on Thursday, the US will begin to default on its payments, with possible global economic ramifications.</p> <p>Obama postponed a 3pm White House gathering of congressional leaders to give McConnell and Reid extra time to fine-tune a package.</p> <p>&quot;My hope is that a spirit of co-operation will move us forward over the next few hours,&quot; the president said earlier in the day, adding the ominous note that &quot;if we don't start making some real progress in the House and the Senate, and if Republicans aren't willing to set aside some of their partisan concerns in order to do what's right for the country, we stand a good chance of defaulting.&quot;</p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average added 64.15 points, or 0.4%, to close at 15,301.26. The index was down as much as 100 points earlier in the day.</p> <p>Reid and McConnell, under massive pressure to find a way out of the impasse, made positive noises upon emerging from their negotiating sessions, though without anything concrete to show. McConnell said he was optimistic that a deal acceptable to both sides was within reach, and Reid went further, saying he hoped an outcome would now be sealed that would reopen the government – now in its 14th day of partial shutdown – ensure that the country continued paying its bills, and begin “long-term negotiations to put our country on sound fiscal footing”.</p> <p>&quot;I'm very optimistic that we that we will reach an agreement that's reasonable in nature this week,&quot; Reid said.</p> <p>Though the detail of any final settlement was still in the balance, the broad terms of a compromise appeared to be emerging. On the most urgent problem – the threat that come Friday the US would begin to default on its payments – the warring parties were working towards a peace deal that would raise the debt ceiling through at least next February and possibly into the spring.</p> <p>That has been the central concern of Obama and fellow Democratic leaders, who have said they are not prepared to see the financial credibility of the US held to ransom by Republican negotiators. When the US came close to defaulting in 2011 it led to one agency downgrading America's credit rating.</p> <p>The toxicity of the current crisis is partly the result of the entanglement of the debt crisis with fraught political fighting over Obama’s healthcare law, and over the national budget and deficit. The sinking approval ratings Republicans have suffered since 1 October appear to have persuaded party leaders to detach the battle against Obamacare from the current wrangle, meaning health provisions are likely to feature minimally, if at all, in any final deal.</p> <p>The other major element, the US budget, also appears to be nearing resolution, with party bosses homing in on an agreement that would see the government reopen until a fresh deadline of 15 January, giving them time to come up with a longer-term formula for how to reduce the deficit.</p> <p>The see-saw on Capitol Hill was reflected in the reactions of the markets. Stocks fell moderately on Monday morning as talks stood at a standstill, but rose later as the mood improved.</p> <p>Agreement between Reid and McConnell would not be the end of the trauma that has engulfed Washington these past few weeks. A Senate deal would then have to be put before the House of Representatives, where most of the hardline and Tea Party-aligned Republicans who spearheaded the showdown with the White House are concentrated.</p> <h2>What it could mean</h2> <p><strong>What is the debt ceiling?</strong> <br />Congress has imposed an annual borrowing limit on the US Treasury, which this year is about $16.7tn (&pound;10.4tn). Like most western countries, the US has borrowed heavily in recent years to maintain spending while tax revenues dipped. Treasury secretary Jack Lew believes the government will run out of money on Thursday. Unless a deal can be done to raise the ceiling.</p> <p><strong>Will the US default on its entire debt? </strong><br />Technically, the next time government debt comes up for renewal the Treasury will be unable to repay its lenders. Any time from 17 October lenders around the world could in theory consider the US bankrupt and demand all their money back. But that is unlikely – Treasury bonds could be even more sought after as other areas of the financial system become more precarious.</p> <p><strong>Would it endanger the world economy?</strong><br />Stock markets have dipped on fears of a default and could dive in reaction to the real thing, sparking a collapse in confidence akin to the 2008 Lehman Brothers crash. Confidence is key to investment and private sector spending. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore’s finance minister and chairman of the International Monetary Fund’s key policymaking committee, said: “Private investment relies on confidence and if we don’t see a resolution of the US &shy;fiscal dispute it is hard to see how that is going to come back.”</p> <p><strong>Will it threaten the UK economy? </strong><br />Britain would be hit hard by a US &shy;recession. Many of the UK’s exports go to America. Without growth in the US the UK could see its fragile recovery snuffed out. BAE Systems, Britain’s &shy;biggest manufacturing employer, is warning of problems ahead. BAE has half its business in the US and has &shy;frozen the wages of 1,200 staff in &shy;Washington. &shy;Fellow arms firm Chemring saw its shares plummet last week. Meanwhile, outsourcing firms G4S and Serco have US staff unable to work.</p> <p><strong>Will the consequences be similar to the credit crunch? </strong><br />A loss of confidence in financial markets could undermine the crucial $2tn repo market – the system by which banks keep their funding ticking over with short term loans to each other, often backed up by US government bonds. The market is lightly regulated and any problems could ripple out into a wider credit crunch. <em>Phillip Inman</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419957868|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|7bc09797d5d5b6f6124ed40a3c758f1f5f221d03 -->",

        "headline":"Americans need to discover how the world sees them",
        "body":"<p>On Monday, government offices were closed in Washington DC, to mark <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day\" title=\"\">Columbus Day</a>. Except that most of them had been closed anyway, because of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-government-shutdown-2013\" title=\"\">US government shutdown</a>. As everyone knows, Christopher Columbus was an Italian navigator who, in the service of the Spanish crown, supposedly &quot;discovered&quot; America and reported its potential to a wondering world. I have spent the summer in the United States watching, with growing alarm, a country engaged in a degree of self-harming which, if observed in a teenager, would lead any friend to cry &quot;call the doctor at once&quot;. As I set course back to Europe, my conclusion is this: America should do a reverse Columbus. The world no longer needs to discover America; but America urgently needs to discover the world's view of America.</p><p>Ordinary Americans, and especially the small minority active in Democrat and Republican primaries, must learn more of what people across the globe are thinking and saying about the US. For if you follow that, you realise that the erosion of American power is happening faster than most of us predicted – while the politicians in Washington behave like rutting stags with locked antlers.</p><p>The 24/7 US news coverage follows every last lunge and twist of the stagfight. It is the political equivalent of ESPN, the non-stop sports network. Just occasionally, the rest of the world breaks through: for instance, when the World Bank and the IMF hold their annual meetings – right there in Washington – and the heads of both institutions, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/13/us-shutdown-threat-global-recovery-bankers\" title=\"\">Jim Yong Kim</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/03/christine-lagarde-us-debt-crisis-shutdown\" title=\"\">Christine Lagarde</a>, warn of dire consequences. That gets a few column inches. Or when the government shutdown and debt-ceiling brinkmanship leads Barack Obama to cancel a major trip to Asia, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24424552\" title=\"\">including the Apec summit in Bali</a>, leaving the floor wide open for president Xi Jinping to assert China's regional leadership (&quot;<a href=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/se-asia/story/apec-2013-xi-says-china-and-asia-can-only-prosper-working-together-20131\" title=\"\">the Asia-Pacific cannot prosper without China</a>&quot;).</p><p>A more direct taste of foreign news is available just a few clicks away. On my cable TV control, if I scroll down to channel number 73, or 355, or whatever it is, I can get Al-Jazeera, China's CCTV and Russia's RT. Their reporters often speak perfect American-accented journalese, and sometimes actually are career American journalists, lured away from job-shedding US news organisations to give credibility to these channels. CCTV's Washington bureau chief, for instance, is Jim Spellman, formerly of CNN. These channels' take on the Washington <em>d&eacute;gringolade</em> is much harder edged than the ESPN version. The website of the Russian state-backed RT quotes an editorial published by the Chinese state news agency, <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/\" title=\"\">Xinhua</a>, proposing that, in the light of this crisis, &quot;several cornerstones should be laid to underpin a de-Americanised world&quot;.</p><p>Of course these channels are representative of their undemocratic states, not their peoples. And you may ask, well, who on earth watches CCTV or RT? Does anyone take them seriously? In Europe and North America the answers are still &quot;not many&quot; and &quot;not very&quot;. (That is somewhat less true of Al-Jazeera.) But in Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia, it's already a different story. In the global competition of international broadcasting, these well-funded networks are gaining influence.</p><p>It's not just in the arena of soft power that perceptions are also realities. As <a href=\"http://www.georgesoros.com\" title=\"\">George Soros</a> keeps pointing out, that's true of financial markets. Just as a reminder: the US hit its debt limit of $16.699 trillion in May this year. (For comparison: the World Bank estimates its 2012 GDP at $15.685tn.) Since May, the federal government has been using so-called extraordinary measures to pay its bills and refinance its debt.</p><p>These measures are what treasury secretary Jack Lew said <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-10-10/politics/42878760_1_debt-ceiling-debt-limit-full-faith-and-credit\" title=\"\">would reach the end</a> of their tether on October 17. A few days ago he told the Senate treasury committee that rates on short-term treasury bonds had almost tripled in a single seven-day period. And last week Fidelity, the largest American money market mutual fund manager, sold all its short-dated US government bonds. Just a temporary precaution, you understand. But if the US goes on like this, then one day – one year, one decade – the copper bottom of investors' confidence will fall out.</p><p>Even the hardest form of hard power, military action, involves a significant element of perception. Vietnam has just said farewell to its war hero, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/general-vo-nguyen-giap\" title=\"\">General Vo Nguyen Giap</a>, credited with driving both France and the US out of his country. As obituaries pointed out, his Tet offensive of 1968 was a military failure, since the Viet Cong were thrown back with huge losses. But politically, it played a key role in turning American public opinion against the war. Similarly, there is no purely objective truth about the wars in&nbsp;Afghanistan and Iraq, but in the view&nbsp;of a large part of the world, the US&nbsp;military did not exactly win.</p><p>At the time of writing, it looks as if the rutting stags in the Senate and House of Representatives will step back from the canyon's edge at the last minute. But even if they do, huge damage has already been done. Politically, in the eyes of the world, the &quot;full faith and credit&quot; of the US has been further eroded.</p><p>Americans need to see those views from outside. Some understand this need: that's one reason so many visit the US version of the Guardian's website. It's also a service the digital International New York Times (formerly International Herald Tribune) may help provide, with a wider range of international voices – although its target audience is modestly described by the responsible assistant managing editor, in a New York Times piece about itself, as &quot;the political, business and cultural elite of the world&quot;. But what about those proudly less cosmopolitan, non-elite Americans back home, including the active minorities who pre-select Democrat and Republican representatives in Washington, in partisan primaries for gerrymandered constituencies?</p><p>So here's my au revoir suggestion. Let some public-spirited American billionaire set up a mainstream TV and internet channel dedicated to conveying to a wider American audience, in a vivid and accessible way, how the US is seen around the world. In Britain, people still occasionally use an old-fashioned slang phrase to express incredulity at something that is at once amazing and a bit ludicrous too – such as what's been happening in Washington. They say: &quot;Christopher Columbus!&quot; Complete with Yahoo!-style exclamation mark, that might be a good name for the channel.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fromTGA\" title=\"\"><em>@fromTGA</em></a></p><p>• This piece was amended on 16 October. The article originally stated that the US had exceeded its debt limit of $16.699 trillion in May this year, when in fact it hit its debt limit. This has now been corrected.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420057426|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|28dcabb9f44c3546885bd15b9cf287790cd9b1b8 -->",

        "body":"<p>Two senior senators have taken on the fraught process of finding a congressional deal to reopen the US government and raise the country's borrowing limit, just four days before the Treasury is scheduled to run out of money.</p><p>The Democratic Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, long-time adversaries, met on Saturday morning after it became clear that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/11/shutdown-deal-hopes-obama-senate-republicans\">a separate attempt to broker a deal, between the Republican-dominated House of Representatives and the White House, had failed</a>. </p><p>Focus shifted to the Senate when President Barack Obama rejected a plan from House Republicans to extend the so-called debt ceiling by just six weeks and made no offer lift the US government shutdown. Reid told reporters his meeting with McConnell had been \"cordial\" and added that they were only at preliminary stages. </p><p>\"We don't have anything done yet – there's a long way to go before something like that will happen,\" he said, adding that he hoped to achieve a deal \"in the next 48 hours\".</p><p>Reid, McConnell and two other senators – the Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander and New York Democrat Charles Schumer – met in Reid's office at 9am on Saturday, for just under an hour. Later in the day, Reid and Schumer met Obama in the Oval Office at the White House. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419832975'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/12/1381618446629/df092a79-b997-4436-b3e5-c76e4b6b81ca-140x84.jpeg' alt='Senator Charles Schumer speaks to reporters in the US Capitol on plans to end the federal government shutdown.' width='140' height='84' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Charles Schumer. Photograph: EPA</figcaption></figure><p>The four senators were described by a senior congressional aide as a \"nucleus\" that could now rescue the country from default. However at a press conference, Reid and Schumer expressed only cautious optimism, and after a strategy meeting with fellow Democrats, the California senator Dianne Feinstein said she could not see any way through the current impasse. \"There are people that have different proposals – there are probably four or five of those,\" she said. \"But the proposals that will get the leadership of the House, the Senate, and the president, are not out there at this time.\"</p><p>On the Senate floor, a Democratic procedural measure that would have moved the Senate to a vote to extend the debt ceiling through the end of 2014, with no contingencies attached, fell after it failed to secure the 60 votes required. </p><p>There was then hope that a bipartisan bill, by the Maine Republican senator Susan Collins with input from a West Virginia Democrat, Joe Manchin, might offer a way forward. That would have increased the borrowing limit until January 2014 and reopening the government until March, in return for concessions aimed at pleasing Republicans, who precipiated the crisis when they failed to pass a budget resolution to  ontinue the funding of federal services without measures designed to undermine the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature healthcare reform.</p><p>However in a sign of the disarray that has affected an apparently directionless Capitol Hill, interest in that proposal lasted no more than a few hours.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419832973'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/5/1380993883776/us-shutdown-what-will-hap-008.jpg' alt='us shutdown what will happen who will it affect' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Furloughed federal employees attend a protest outside the US Capitol to demand an end of federal workers' lockout after the shutdown. Photograph: Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media</figcaption></figure><p>The risk of a possible US default – which most economists agree would be catastrophic and reverberate across the world – has concentrated minds on Capitol Hill. Some Repulbicans have become increasligly concerned that they are being blamed for the crisis. They hoped that by focusing on the unpopularity of Obamacare and characterising the president's stance as a refusal to negotiate, that the White House would be seen as responsible for the first shutdown since 1996.</p><p>But an <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/10/20903624-nbcwsj-poll-shutdown-debate-damages-gop?lite\">NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll </a>this week showed the public largely blaming Republicans, with the party suffering its all-time worst rating since the survey began. Support for Obama's health reforms, which were introduced on the day the shutdown began, has increased despite early problems with enrolment websites.</p><h2>Procedural complications</h2><p>There appears to be little prospect of a deal before markets opened on Monday. All eyes are now on a deadline of Thursday when, according to the Treasury, the $16.7tn debt limit must be raised in order for the US to continue paying its creditors. Even if a deal between Reid and McConnell is reached over the next 24 hours, procedural complications mean a vote might not be taken until Wednesday or even Thursday, a senior congressional aide said.</p><p>Republican members of the House gathered for a private meeting with the speaker, John Boehner, on Saturday morning. The Republican leader informed his fellow representatives that discussions with the president had not yielded any prospect of a deal. \"The president rejected our deal,\" said the Idaho representative Raul Labrador, immediately after the meeting. \"It is now up to the Senate Republicans to hold firm.\" Representative Thomas Massey, of Kentucky, added: \"We made an offer to the president and he turned it down. He's still refusing to negotiate – the president is refusing to offer anything.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419832974'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/13/1381618876658/2c3cbd18-5b76-43c6-ab2a-694360dc87ee-460x276.jpeg' alt='House Speaker John Boehner leaves a Republican conference in the US Capitol.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>House Speaker John Boehner leaves a Republican conference in the US Capitol on Saturday. Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>Obama has repeatedly said he will not be taken \"hostage\" by House Republicans, and will only enter into formal negotiations once they remove the treat of a US default and reopen the government. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/12/obama-pressures-republicans-debt-ceiling-shutdown\">Speaking in his weekly address, on Saturday morning</a>, Obama said he was against any stop-gap measures which would buy time but still leave the country under the shadow of a possible default.</p><p>\"It wouldn't be wise, as some suggest, to just kick the debt ceiling can down the road for a couple months, and flirt with a first-ever intentional default right in the middle of the holiday shopping season,\" he said.</p><p>Even if a deal is reached between Reid and McConnell, with backing from the White House, the challenge will lie in securing the support of the Republican-dominated House of Representatives. Republican leaders now appear to have all but given up their initial efforts to defund Obamacare, or delay the \"individual mandate\" of Obamacare, which compels US citizens to obtain healthcare or face fines. </p><p>They now appear to be seeking some kind of concession that will justify a course of action that resulted in an initial 800,000 government workers being furloughed, or temporarily suspended from work, and damaged local economies across the country which are dependent upon federal funds.</p><p>The shutdown, now entering its 13th day, has laid bare the bitter divisions in the Republican Party. What began as classic congressional deadlock between a Republican-dominated House and a Democratic-controlled Senate has become an internecine dispute between the Tea Party movement and more moderate Republicans.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419832976'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/12/1381618331291/208e4c5c-76aa-4822-b924-a5575beb30d7-460x276.jpeg' alt='The Statue of Liberty will reopen to the public after the state of New York agreed to shoulder the costs of running the site during the federal government shutdown.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Statue of Liberty will reopen to the public after the state of New York agreed to shoulder the costs of running the site during the federal government shutdown.

At least 500,000 government workers are still thought to be furloughed. But across America federal outposts have also felt the squeeze, particularly in the many rural, local economies dependant upon national parks. One of the worst affected area is in the rural <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/11/shutdown-north-carolina-standoff-pisgah\">North Carolina district which elected Tea Party Republican congressman Mark Meadows</a>.</p><p>He was described as the \"architect\" of the shutdown after orchestrating a petition among House Republican members to force the leadership to use the federal budget as leverage to undermine Obamacare.</p><p>Meadows denied he was particularly instrumental in starting the shutdown, telling the Guardian that he was striving to reopen the government for his constituents, many of whom are reliant on tourism from nearby national parks. \"Honestly, if they're angry with me, I'm doing all I can to get the government back open and make sure the harmful affects don't hurt people back home.\"</p><p>Under a deal agreed reached late on Friday, the Statue of Liberty, Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore as well as some national parks in Colorado and Utah reopened this weekend, after the government allowed them to be temporarily funded by state money and other non-federal sources.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419789681|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|4776901217739b57b544119636c1c3d83cc179d3 -->",

        "headline":"IMF eyes tax potential of the world's super-rich",
        "body":"<p>It was impossible to find anybody at last week's meeting of the International Monetary Fund willing to believe that the US will actually default on its debts. The universal belief was that the game of chicken would end before Thursday's deadline for raising the debt ceiling, if perhaps only at the eleventh hour.</p><p>Even so, the budget battle overshadowed the meeting of the fund. The first question for every finance minister or central bank governor was: \"How bad could it get if there is no deal?\" Very, very bad was the unsurprising reply. Five years ago this weekend, Alistair Darling and Mervyn King flew home early from the IMF meeting to put the finishing touches to the bail-out plan for Britain's banks. Other governments were doing likewise. Nobody wants to go through that again.</p><p>In reality, a replay of the events following the collapse of Lehman Brothers looks unlikely, and that would be the case even if the US went into technical default. There is a difference between a US treasury bond and the trash that passed for AAA-rated assets five years ago, and Washington would eventually honour its debts in full.</p><p>That doesn't mean the budget row is a storm in a teacup. On the contrary, it is of great significance, although not for the reasons that have been prominent in the past few weeks.</p><p>The reality is that the short-term budgetary position in the US has been improving rapidly. After avoiding the temptation to front-load austerity, the US began its recovery before most other advanced countries and is experiencing a period of modest growth. The IMF estimates the US budget deficit will be down to 3.6% next year, much lower than the 5.8% pencilled in for the UK.</p><p>The US's budgetary problems – as with most other developed nations – are medium-term ones, caused by the cost of benefits to an ageing population. In recent years, the US has seen its growth rate fall and its labour participation rate plummet. These trends are not compatible with rising bills for social security and medical entitlements. Especially not when corporations and rich individuals are becoming ever more skilled at minimising their tax bills.</p><p>This tension was acknowledged by the fund in its fiscal monitor, its half-yearly analysis of how well member countries are doing when it comes to balancing the books.</p><p>Traditionally, the fund has been seen as siding with those who believe licking the public finances into shape is really just about cutting spending. Many developing countries that have been subjected to harsh structural adjustment programmes would testify there is some truth in that reputation.</p><p>But the current fiscal monitor belies that because it suggests there are ways of raising extra tax revenue, beyond the fund's long-term support for broadening the tax base through the wider application of VAT.</p><p>First, it supports the idea of a financial activities tax, which would be levied on the wages and profits of financial institutions. This would be the equivalent of levying VAT on financial services, which are currently exempt. It is the fund's alternative to the financial transaction tax.</p><p>Second, the IMF thinks it is time to do something about an international tax system that allows companies such as Google and Starbucks to pay little corporate tax. The fund says they can do this because the global tax order is mind-bogglingly complex and outdated. Instead of a race to the bottom where countries compete with each other to offer the lowest rate of corporate tax, it urges co-operation. This is not going to be easy, as the fund freely admits, but it adds: \"The chance to review international tax architecture seems to come around about once a century; the fundamental issues should not be ducked.\"</p><p>Finally, the fund comes out in favour of having a long hard look at whether those on the highest incomes should pay more. In some countries, the US in particular, the IMF research suggests the rich are substantially under-taxed.</p><p>Over the past quarter of a century or so, tax systems have tended to become regressive due to the increased reliance on indirect taxes, which weigh more heavily on the less well-off. Despite that trend, income tax is still progressive because the rich pay a  large proportion of revenue from that source. The top 10% of earners account for 30%-50% of all revenue from personal income tax and social contributions, with the top 1% accounting on average for 8%.</p><p>The IMF study looked at whether there is untapped revenue potential at the top. It compared the current tax rate paid by highest earners with the tax rate that would maximise revenue, taking into account a number of factors such as whether rich people would work less hard if they were taxed more heavily, and whether they would find ways round a tougher regime.</p><p>This is quite a complex process, and sensitive to the assumptions made by those doing the calculations. So while the fund concluded the top rate of tax that maximised income was 60%, it was careful to set a range for each country studied. In the US, the current top rate of tax was more than 10 percentage points below the bottom of the range following the reductions in taxes on the rich in the past three decades.</p><p>Returning the top rate of tax on the US's rich to the level in the 1980s would, the fund estimates, raise about $150bn a year for the US treasury. That would comfortably solve the country's budget problems.</p><p>In the UK, the position according to the fund is less clear cut than it is in the US, but also less clear cut than George Osborne would have had us believe when he cut the top rate to 45%. The IMF's calculations for Britain use data for 2010, when the 50% tax rate introduced by Alistair Darling was in force. Even then, the UK only just crept into the bottom end of the revenue-maximising range. The fund's conclusion is that \"in many countries it might indeed be possible to raise more from those with the highest incomes\".</p><p>How much more? \"The implied revenue gain if top rates on only the top 1% were returned to their levels in the 1980s averages about 0.25% of GDP but the gain could in some cases, such as that of the United States, be more significant.\" Applying the IMF's formula to Britain would mean that the exchequer would raise an additional £4bn from taxing top earners, since 1% of national output is about £15bn.</p><p>This is not exactly a fortune but in tough times better than nothing. The Treasury's argument is that cutting the top rate to 45% is raising more tax. But that claim is based on little hard evidence; the IMF work suggests it should be scrutinised extremely carefully.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419831706|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|09f99ce80517cccd145a2e50d0f3af0e71a5405d -->",

        "headline":"World shivers with fear as US heads for new debt crisis",
        "body":"<p>Without a budget in place, the US government has run out of the cash needed to pay thousands of government workers in Washington and keep national parks open. But this week an even more critical issue comes to the fore. On Thursday, the country could be forced to default on its borrowings if it does not secure a rise in the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling.</p><p>Republican leaders, aware that their intransigence over the budget has hit the party's popularity, last week proposed a six-week postponement of the deadline. John Boehner, leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, has dropped a previous demand that talks could only take place following a Democrat concession to review President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act – or \"Obamacare\" – although a format for discussions has yet to be agreed.</p><h2><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h2><p>The road towards a default that would risk plunging the world economy into recession began last year in the wake of Obama's return to the White House. The radical Tea Party wing of the Republicans decided that the only way to block Obamacare, which for them exemplifies hated \"big government\", was to hold up the president's entire budget plan.</p><h2><strong>Why has Washington suffered a shutdown?</strong></h2><p>A six-month fight over the budget between the two houses of government – the Republican lower house and the Democrat-controlled Senate – has meant no formal funding has been agreed and left government departments struggling to pay their bills. For the first time in 17 years, parts of government spending have been shut down. Some 800,000 government workers were initially sent home – equivalent to the combined workforces of Exxon Mobil, General Motors, Google and giant US retailer Target.</p><p>Even the Pentagon sent home 350,000 staff in that initial wave, though it later called them back when funds were made available. National parks remain closed and applications for most permits and licences are being badly delayed. Schools are open and hospitals are unaffected, though health research has been disrupted.</p><h2><strong>What is the debt ceiling?</strong></h2><p>This is the government borrowing limit set by Congress. The government actually bumped up against the $16.7tn limit five months ago as the budget dispute got under way. Ever since, the treasury department has taken a series of \"extraordinary measures\" to raise an extra $303bn. But that money will not last much longer.</p><h2><strong>Why is 17 October significant?</strong></h2><p>US treasury secretary Jack Lew has warned that this is when the treasury will exhaust those extraordinary measures. Without the means to pay both multibillion-dollar interest payments and social security bills, it will default.</p><h2><strong>What are the implications?</strong></h2><p>Nobody knows what a default would mean in practice. Investors around the world have lent the US money by buying its treasury bonds. In theory, a failure to pay a single interest payment on a tranche of debt will trigger a demand from all bondholders for their money back. In practice this is unlikely.</p><h2><strong>What will happen to the US economy?</strong></h2><p>American businesses with public-sector contracts will suffer a delay in payments and could go bust – unemployment has already risen as a result of the shutdown. More broadly, the US economy has been the main driver of global growth. Should the government be forced to default, it could trigger an estimated 4.5% fall in GDP and the rest of the world would fall back into recession.</p><p>The extent of nerves in the markets was shown when the news of a possible six-week extension of the borrowing limit sent the Dow Jones index of leading shares soaring by more than 300 points.</p><h2><strong>What</strong> <strong>about</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>UK?</strong></h2><p>Britain would be hit hard by a US recession. Many of our exports go to America, especially manufactured goods. Without growth in the US, the UK could see its still-fragile recovery snuffed out. Already,  BAE Systems, Britain's biggest manufacturing employer, is warning of problems ahead should the two-week-old shutdown become a crisis. BAE has half its business in the US and has already frozen the wages of 1,200 staff in Washington. Fellow arms firm Chemring saw its shares plummet on Friday after it warned the shutdown would affect its profits. Meanwhile, outsourcing firms G4S and Serco have US staff unable to work.</p><h2><strong>And the rest of the world?</strong></h2><p>The Chinese are panicked. China's Xinhua news agency labelled US domestic politicians \"dangerously irresponsible\" for wrangling over debt. In an editorial, the state-run media organisation said the rest of the world had been \"kidnapped\" by American politics, which was involved in \"a game of chicken\". The Germans are also anxious. Anton Böner, president of the Federal Association for German Wholesalers and Foreign Trade, warned: \"If the Americans shoot themselves in the foot right now, it is highly dangerous for the entire global economy, and of course for the German export economy.\"</p><h2><strong>Why are the Republicans proposing a six-week delay to the debt ceiling?</strong></h2><p>An opinion poll by NBC News and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> last week gave the Republican party the lowest standing in the history of the poll. It showed that more than twice as many Americans had a negative view of it than a positive one. While 31% held Obama responsible for the shutdown, 53% blamed Republicans. Boehner said he wanted six weeks to debate all aspects of the budget, but White House sources said they were convinced his aim was still to scupper Obamacare.</p><p>• This article was amended on Monday 14 October to clarify that the US debt ceiling is $16.7 trillion. </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419769268|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|953aa24013122f18e39e65766e74bbede47ec20e -->",

        "body":"<p>Two weeks into the US government's partial shutdown, new funding is being provided to some services to reopen closed programs, while other agencies that were at first spared now face closure.</p><p>The Obama administration said last week that states could pay for national park operations. Arizona, Colorado, New York, North Dakota and Utah have accepted the offer. Even with this new funding, the list of agencies operating as usual is dwindling.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/federal-shutdown-runs-out-money\">Ten days ago</a>, we provided a list of the services that would immediately be affected by the shutdown. Now, an update on those facing imminent closure. </p><h2><strong>Travel</strong></h2><p>Along with national parks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/12/us-shutdown-grand-canyon-statue-liberty-mount-rushmore\">opening on a state-by-state basis</a>, the fish and wildlife service said it is reopening several refuges to allow pheasant and duck hunting, as the hunting season gets under way.</p><p>More than 2,900 Federal Aviation Administration inspectors were initially furloughed, putting an end to inspections of plane, pilot and aircraft repair stations. The FAA asked 800 employees to return to work last week. </p><h2><strong>The courts</strong></h2><p>Federal courts have sufficient alternative funds to run until Thursday, and possibly Friday. From then on, courts will shut down all non-essential work. It is up to each court to determine what is or isn't essential. Court-appointed lawyers and jurors could be asked to work, but might not be compensated until the shutdown ends. </p><p>Some districts have requested a blanket halt to civilian cases because agencies involved with these cases have been furloughed. Attorneys have had to file stay requests for cases that have approaching deadlines.</p><p>Immigration court proceedings scheduled before the shutdown are being canceled, impeding green card applications. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/\">The US supreme court says</a> it will continue with normal operations through Friday, and its building is still open to the public as usual. If Congress does not resolve its issues by that date, the court will provide another update.</p><h2><strong>Energy</strong></h2><p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission closed most of its operations on Thursday, though on-site inspectors will remain on the job and the government says it will handle any immediate safety or security issues. </p><h2><strong>Education</strong></h2><p>The school systems continues to operate, though some research facilities cannot apply for government grants or access government databases. The US merchant marine academy canceled classes this week because unlike other academic institutions, nearly its entire staff is subject to furlough. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/us/10-million-gift-to-help-head-start-through-shutdown.html\">A Texas couple donated $10m</a> to the Head Start pre-school program for children in low income families, which was shut down. The money is considered a no-interest loan and will be repaid if funding is restored at the end of the shutdown. (The loan has been criticised <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/10/10/the_rights_sinister_new_plot_against_pensions/\">by some on the left</a>, because it comes from John Arnold, a former Enron trader.)</p><p>Five states had to close their Head Start programs, while other states relied on contingency funding. The donated funds are directed at these closed programs and programs close to running out of money. On 1 November, 41 states and one US territory could lose federal money for the program.</p><h2><strong>Food programs</strong></h2><p>States have been relying on contingency funds to cover the WIC program, which provides healthy food to 9 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children. The USDA warned that this funding might not last after October and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/11/north-carolina-government-shutdown-wic_n_4085041.html\">some state programs have temporarily shut down</a>, then reopened with emergency cash. </p><h2><strong>Military</strong></h2><p>Military personnel remain on duty and nearly all civilian employees have been ordered back to work. President Obama signed an order on Thursday to ensure families of fallen soldiers will continue to receive death payments, which were suspended in the early days of the shutdown. </p><h2>Social security</h2><p>The government traditionally announces the annual cost-of-living (Cola) increase for next year's social security payments in mid-October. Because of the shutdown, that announcement – estimated to be about 1.5%, the smallest in years – has been delayed indefinitely. </p><h2><strong>Science</strong></h2><p>Funds for the National Science Foundation's US Antarctic program will be depleted on Monday, <a href=\"http://www.usap.gov/\">the agency announced last week</a>. The USAP is entering \"caretaker status,\" which staffs the program at a minimal level at its three primary research stations, ships and other associated facilities. Some of the research operates in specific seasonal windows because of Antarctic's harsh climate, and could be indefinitely curtailed depending on the length of the shutdown. October is usually when research programs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/08/us-government-shutdown-antarctica-penguins\">ramp up their activities in Antarctica</a>.</p><h2><strong>Taxes</strong></h2><p>The more than 12 million people who requested automatic extensions on their spring tax return must still file their returns, which are due on Tuesday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419939310|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|20f34851fbc8383b2972d22f5cf82df262b060fc -->",

        "headline":"US shutdown threatens global recovery, bankers warn",
        "body":"<p>A still-fragile global recovery is being put at risk by Washington's squabbling politicians, finance ministers and governors of central banks have warned as they stepped up the pressure on the US to avoid a catastrophic debt default this week.</p><p>In a series of attacks encouraged by the Obama administration, policymakers gathered in the US capital for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund used the platform to call for an agreement before Thursday's deadline to raise America's $16.7 trillion (&pound;10.5tn) debt ceiling.</p><p>Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said: &quot;It is unthinkable that an agreement won't be found. If this situation were to last a long time this would be negative, very negative for the US economy and the world economy and could certainly harm the recovery.&quot;</p><p>Financial markets rallied strongly at the end of last week as hopes were raised that a deal might be achieved by the weekend. But after talks broke down on Saturday, there were concerns that dealers would take fright at the show of brinkmanship taking place in Washington.</p><p>Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore's finance minister and chairman of the IMF's key policymaking committee, said: &quot;It's a clear negative when you think about the key element of the recovery – private sector investment – that has to take place over the next one to two years.</p><p>&quot;Private investment relies on confidence and if we don't see a resolution of the US fiscal dispute it is hard to see how that is going to come back.&quot;</p><p>Asked to grade politicians in Washington as if he were a school teacher, Tharman replied: &quot;Clearly room for improvement.&quot;</p><p>Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, said: &quot;We are now five days away from a very dangerous moment. I urge US policymakers to quickly come to a resolution before they reach the debt ceiling deadline. The closer we get to the deadline, the greater the impact will be for the developing world. Inaction could result in interest rates rising, confidence falling, and growth slowing.</p><p>&quot;If this comes to pass, it could be a disastrous event for the developing world, and that in turn will greatly hurt the developed economies as well. I urge US policymakers to avert this potential crisis.&quot;</p><p>US administration sources said they had been encouraging the IMF and the G20 group of developed and developing countries to ratchet up the pressure on policymakers on Capital Hill to reach a budget deal.</p><p>A communique released by the IMF said: &quot;The US needs to take urgent action to address short-term fiscal uncertainties.&quot; This echoed word-for-word a communique released by the G20.</p><p>Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank's president, ruled out the possibility of a default. &quot;I don't think it's a realistic scenario. I think one can trust that now, as in the past, the political [opponents] will manage to unite on a solution.&quot;</p><p>The IMF believes that the impasse in Washington is holding back what would otherwise be a recovery in the global economy. It singled out Britain as one of the areas where progress had been made.</p><p>&quot;The recovery in the US has gained ground, stimulus measures have induced a recovery in Japan, the euro area is emerging from recession, and in some other advanced economies including the UK growth is already picking up.&quot;</p><p>The IMF told emerging market economies to prepare for likely volatility when the US starts to reduce the amount of stimulus it is providing for the world's biggest economy – the timetable for which is likely to be put back for several months by the government shutdown.</p><p>It said that in certain circumstances, countries should seek to manage capital flows but the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, said they should not &quot;be the first tool that should be relied on&quot;.</p><p>The IMF meeting came five years after emergency action taken to bail out banks caught up in the financial panic that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.</p><p>Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, said the most important part of the reform programme prompted by the near-collapse of the financial system was to find a way of resolving the problems of the world's biggest banks without the need for taxpayer support.</p><p>In his last speech before leaving the Bank at the end of the week, Tucker said: &quot;It is absolutely essential that the 'too big to fail' problem is cracked. Nothing is more important to the success of the international reform agenda. Without it, global finance would remain fragile; and to protect against that, the international financial system would balkanise as individual countries sought to protect themselves. The stakes are high.&quot;</p><p>Tucker said countries would have no excuse if they didn't solve the &quot;too big to fail&quot; problem through resolution regimes and reforms. &quot;The necessary technology is clear. The necessary restructuring of firms is clear. The necessary degrees and forms of cross-border co-operation are clear. It is a matter of: just do it,&quot; he said.</p><p>The Bank of England was in principle prepared to step aside and allow the UK subsidiaries of big US financial groups to be reformed as part of a group-wide resolution led by the US authorities, Tucker said. Britain wants the US to offer a reciprocal deal, but has so far not happened.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419826884|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|6d48ade53d6f6a4df9035274f338e4d4c52a9745 -->",

        "headline":"US markets in modest decline as threat of debt default sends stocks wavering",
        "body":"<p>Stocks opened modestly on Monday as Wall Street traders continued to respond with patience to the threat of a US default and continued to expect a last-minute deal to allow the Treasury to pay its bills.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 of the most influential companies in the US, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Nasdaq were all down only half a percent in morning trading.</p> <p>That was a modest dip considering that stock futures were down sharply&nbsp;on Sunday&nbsp;night, hinting at a darker opening session than the one that resulted. Futures are often a good indicator of market reaction the next day, and are used by policymakers and investors during weekend negotiations as a way to predict how stocks will react to crises. Still, there are fewer people who buy and sell futures compared to stocks &ndash; particularly on weekend nights &ndash; so they can be misleading.&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;is also the Columbus Day bank holiday in the US, which means less trading activity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since the US government shut down in early October, stock markets have remained stable amid legislative chaos in at the Capitol.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"The political scene is a whipsaw of news flows and surprises. As a money manager, we know that this is a dangerous way to make investment decisions,\" said David Kotok,&nbsp;of Cumberland Advisors in a note to investors.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last week, stocks rose sharply, up 2%, after Washington appeared on the brink of compromise, with holdout House Republicans proposing a short-term extension to the debt ceiling.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Just because politicians are talking with each other, for two days stock markets have again exploded. I guess the market is celebrating its relief that politicians are talking at each other rather than past each other,\" Kotok wrote.&nbsp;</p> <p>TIAA-Cref, an influential pension fund, said in its weekly markets update that&nbsp;\"despite Washington gridlock, we remain optimistic on the US economy and equity markets\".</p> <p>\"We are encouraged by the fact that equity markets, while volatile, have not been subject to panic selling in the face of the recent uncertainty,\" said head of equity investments William Riegel and head of global public fixed-income markets Lisa Black in a note&nbsp;on Monday. \"If we do see a sharp market drop, we believe it will be a buying opportunity.\"</p> <p>While leaders on Wall Street and the corporate world have consistently said that default would be \"utterly catastrophic\" in the words of Deusche Bank chief Anshu Jain, few believe that Congress will allow the US to skip out on its scheduled payments. The Treasury has to pay $32bn in interest payments on government bonds as well as social security payments for the remainder of October. The big payment comes on&nbsp;1 November, when the Treasury has to pay $67bn in benefits to social security recipients as well as payroll for the military.&nbsp;</p> <p>Money managers have been patient, if cautious. \"We never thought the odds of default were very high, but the intensity of the rhetoric was sufficient to raise them above zero,\"&nbsp;Kotok said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Others were even more sanguine. \"In my opinion, we will not default,\" JP Morgan Chase chief executive <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/global-banking-leaders-sound-default-alarm-government-shutdown-debt-ceiling-98225.html\">Jamie Dimon said</a>&nbsp;last week at a panel at the Institute of International Finance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dimon also said that <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/10/12/j-p-morgan-offers-to-front-benefits-if-government-doesnt-pay/?mod=WSJBlog&amp;mod=MarketsMain\">JP Morgan would continue to process</a> $6bn to $8bn of government benefits, like social security, even in the event of a default. That would allow benefits recipients to continue to draw money from their bank accounts even if the government hasn't technically paid them.&nbsp;</p> <p>In two previous iterations of the debt-ceiling debate in 2011 and 2012, stocks reacted sharply to Washington negotiations, only to stabilize once a deal was struck at the last minute. That has created the expectation among investors that last-minute deals are the congressional custom when it comes to the debt ceiling.&nbsp;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419934667|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|32a0be9b0432bef9121ec7350049a3498de1ea41 -->",

        "headline":"Senate leaders close in on debt ceiling deal after talks on Capitol Hill",
        "body":"<p>Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate were scrambling towards a deal that would avert the looming crisis over the US debt ceiling, as the threat of failure to reach an agreement finally appeared to have concentrated minds in Washington.</p> <p>Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority and minority leaders, held two lengthy meetings on Monday in an attempt to nail down terms of a possible compromise. The urgency of the talks was matched by the scale of the crisis facing them: unless an agreement is reached on raising America’s borrowing limit by midnight on Thursday, the US will begin to default on its payments, with possible global economic ramifications.</p> <p>Obama postponed a 3pm White House gathering of congressional leaders to give McConnell and Reid extra time to fine-tune a package.</p> <p>&quot;My hope is that a spirit of co-operation will move us forward over the next few hours,&quot; the president said earlier in the day, adding the ominous note that &quot;if we don't start making some real progress in the House and the Senate, and if Republicans aren't willing to set aside some of their partisan concerns in order to do what's right for the country, we stand a good chance of defaulting.&quot;</p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average added 64.15 points, or 0.4%, to close at 15,301.26. The index was down as much as 100 points earlier in the day.</p> <p>Reid and McConnell, under massive pressure to find a way out of the impasse, made positive noises upon emerging from their negotiating sessions, though without anything concrete to show. McConnell said he was optimistic that a deal acceptable to both sides was within reach, and Reid went further, saying he hoped an outcome would now be sealed that would reopen the government – now in its 14th day of partial shutdown – ensure that the country continued paying its bills, and begin “long-term negotiations to put our country on sound fiscal footing”.</p> <p>&quot;I'm very optimistic that we that we will reach an agreement that's reasonable in nature this week,&quot; Reid said.</p> <p>Though the detail of any final settlement was still in the balance, the broad terms of a compromise appeared to be emerging. On the most urgent problem – the threat that come Friday the US would begin to default on its payments – the warring parties were working towards a peace deal that would raise the debt ceiling through at least next February and possibly into the spring.</p> <p>That has been the central concern of Obama and fellow Democratic leaders, who have said they are not prepared to see the financial credibility of the US held to ransom by Republican negotiators. When the US came close to defaulting in 2011 it led to one agency downgrading America's credit rating.</p> <p>The toxicity of the current crisis is partly the result of the entanglement of the debt crisis with fraught political fighting over Obama’s healthcare law, and over the national budget and deficit. The sinking approval ratings Republicans have suffered since 1 October appear to have persuaded party leaders to detach the battle against Obamacare from the current wrangle, meaning health provisions are likely to feature minimally, if at all, in any final deal.</p> <p>The other major element, the US budget, also appears to be nearing resolution, with party bosses homing in on an agreement that would see the government reopen until a fresh deadline of 15 January, giving them time to come up with a longer-term formula for how to reduce the deficit.</p> <p>The see-saw on Capitol Hill was reflected in the reactions of the markets. Stocks fell moderately on Monday morning as talks stood at a standstill, but rose later as the mood improved.</p> <p>Agreement between Reid and McConnell would not be the end of the trauma that has engulfed Washington these past few weeks. A Senate deal would then have to be put before the House of Representatives, where most of the hardline and Tea Party-aligned Republicans who spearheaded the showdown with the White House are concentrated.</p> <h2>What it could mean</h2> <p><strong>What is the debt ceiling?</strong> <br />Congress has imposed an annual borrowing limit on the US Treasury, which this year is about $16.7tn (&pound;10.4tn). Like most western countries, the US has borrowed heavily in recent years to maintain spending while tax revenues dipped. Treasury secretary Jack Lew believes the government will run out of money on Thursday. Unless a deal can be done to raise the ceiling.</p> <p><strong>Will the US default on its entire debt? </strong><br />Technically, the next time government debt comes up for renewal the Treasury will be unable to repay its lenders. Any time from 17 October lenders around the world could in theory consider the US bankrupt and demand all their money back. But that is unlikely – Treasury bonds could be even more sought after as other areas of the financial system become more precarious.</p> <p><strong>Would it endanger the world economy?</strong><br />Stock markets have dipped on fears of a default and could dive in reaction to the real thing, sparking a collapse in confidence akin to the 2008 Lehman Brothers crash. Confidence is key to investment and private sector spending. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore’s finance minister and chairman of the International Monetary Fund’s key policymaking committee, said: “Private investment relies on confidence and if we don’t see a resolution of the US &shy;fiscal dispute it is hard to see how that is going to come back.”</p> <p><strong>Will it threaten the UK economy? </strong><br />Britain would be hit hard by a US &shy;recession. Many of the UK’s exports go to America. Without growth in the US the UK could see its fragile recovery snuffed out. BAE Systems, Britain’s &shy;biggest manufacturing employer, is warning of problems ahead. BAE has half its business in the US and has &shy;frozen the wages of 1,200 staff in &shy;Washington. &shy;Fellow arms firm Chemring saw its shares plummet last week. Meanwhile, outsourcing firms G4S and Serco have US staff unable to work.</p> <p><strong>Will the consequences be similar to the credit crunch? </strong><br />A loss of confidence in financial markets could undermine the crucial $2tn repo market – the system by which banks keep their funding ticking over with short term loans to each other, often backed up by US government bonds. The market is lightly regulated and any problems could ripple out into a wider credit crunch. <em>Phillip Inman</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419957868|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|7bc09797d5d5b6f6124ed40a3c758f1f5f221d03 -->",

That comes at 4.30pm BST.</strong></p> <p>EU finance ministers are gathering for an <strong>ECOFIN</strong> meeting in Luxembourg, following yesterday's eurogroup gathering.</p> <p>We also get the latest<strong> UK inflation data</strong> at 9.30am, and the <strong>ZEW</strong> survey of German investor confidence.</p> <p>And in the City,<strong> Royal Mail shares</strong> will begin trading fully on the stock market, after two days of conditional trading in which they rocketed almost 44%, from the 330p float price to 475p last night.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T07:36:06.995+01:00\">at 7.36am BST</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419975234|2013-10-16T18:19:28Z|c9b7357d372887423280ccd75c42a5acc4fd2a2f -->",

No weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.<br /> 3. The collapse of the housing market (property values go up forever).<br /> 4. The collapse of Lehman Brothers and near collapse of the financial system.<br /> 5. The collapse of the stock market (stocks go up forever).<br /> 6. The loss of America's AAA rating.</p> <p>There are more, but the short list makes the point. Lately, we have experienced too many unthinkable events. Sadly, just because we refuse to think of them, does not mean they will not happen. This feels like Katrina, a lot of complacency, and the evacuations are beginning too late. Hopefully, all will end well. And, let’s hope global financial leaders learn to prepare better for the next storm. Even if the debt ceiling is raised, it will likely be temporary, and the clouds will gather again.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/daveweigel/statuses/390136862654103552\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Having spent two hours talking to House Republicans, my expert investment advice is: Short everything</p>— daveweigel (@daveweigel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveweigel/statuses/390136862654103552\">October 15, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>N.B.: There's no sound investment strategy in the case of an unprecedented catastrophic market event such as a default, and that includes &quot;short everything&quot;.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d6746e4b0667d2b3c66d9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T17:04:51.784+01:00\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Senator John McCain of Arizona</strong> has been hard on fellow Republicans during the shutdown, not taking much care to hide the fact that he thinks it's their fault.</p> <p>But now McCain thinks the Democrats are being unreasonable, for not accepting what he believes was a good-faith House effort to deal:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobertsDan/statuses/390145535027335168\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>no middle ground left right now. an angry senator McCain urges Democrats to &quot;reconsider their categoric rejection of good faith House offer&quot;</p>— Dan Roberts (@RobertsDan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertsDan/statuses/390145535027335168\">October 15, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d6356e4b0667d2b3c66d1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T16:47:17.252+01:00\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&quot;Speaker Boehner decides to <strong>light a match and throw it on the gasoline that already is all over the place</strong>,&quot; Sen.

Now most of the major US markets are down, marginally. The Dow is down over 43 points (0.28%) and the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 4 points (0.24%).</p> <p>Any real moves are likely to come after more concrete news from Washington. Part of the reason that stock markets are behaving so sanguinely may be that investors don’t actually believe that October 17 is really the day that the US runs out of money.</p> <p>Capital Economics published this note this morning: “Despite the more promising tone of the recent discussions on Capitol Hill, there remains a risk that the debt ceiling will not be raised before Thursday. But a detailed look at the Treasury’s spending schedule shows that it should be able to meet all its obligations for another two weeks, not least because it still has $36bn of cash in reserve. Under those circumstances, it would not be a disaster if a deal isn’t agreed to raise the debt ceiling until a few days after Thursday 17th October.”</p> </blockquote> <p>That last bit of analysis may be key. Some in the market believe the Treasury &quot;should be able to meet all its obligations for another two weeks.&quot; The Treasury secretary and others have warned that they really don't know exactly when they'll run out of money. It depends on the willingness of investors to continue to hold T-bills, the orderly collection of revenue without big surprises and the orderly coming-due of bills without big surprises. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d4c39e4b0081898d6dec5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T15:10:26.482+01:00\">10.10am <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The <strong>meeting of Senate Republicans scheduled for 11am has been canceled</strong>, Roll Call reports:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nielslesniewski/statuses/390116041084653568\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The scheduled 11 a.m. Senate GOP meeting has been scratched.

That provision had been in the mix in early versions of the Senate deal but it was rejected.</p> <p>Issa also reports the House GOP bill would include a provision that prevents the Treasury from taking extraordinary measures to stay ahead of default after government hits the debt ceiling, which in this case technically happened in May. Treasury secretary Jack Lew has been holding it together with duct tape ever since. He has warned that the extraordinary measures will run out on 17 October, at which point the Treasury will be running on $30bn in reserve cash, which with big interest and entitlements payouts on the near horizon is close to zilch.</p> <p>The GOP would portray stopping the Treasury from using extraordinary measures as a way of ensuring budget discipline. Of course if there's no discipline on the spending side, no rule governing debt servicing can enforce it.

Legislators are struggling simultaneously to find a way to reopen the government.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Senators appear to be close to a deal. Republican leaders in the Senate are meeting with their caucus at 11am, apparently to sell them on an agreement with Democrats that was pieced together over the weekend and on Monday. However that agreement was still on the workbench Monday evening and may yet fall apart.&nbsp;</p> <p>The House is a big question mark. Speaker <strong>John Boehner</strong> has as yet given no public indication of whether – and how soon – he would bring legislation passed by the Senate up for a vote. He could face a backlash from the hard-right faction if he does so. That would not necessarily stop the legislation from passing but it could endanger his speakership. He goes into a meeting with his caucus at 9am.</p> <p>What could stop the legislation from passing in time to avert default is a filibuster or series of procedural objections in the Senate by one or two unruly members. On Monday evening, Texas senator <strong>Ted Cruz</strong>, known for pointless soliloquies on the Senate floor, declined repeatedly to comment on how he planned to handle the current prospective deal, saying he'd wait to see the specifics.</p> <p>Washington is abuzz this morning with news of a meeting last night between Cruz and members of the House kamikaze caucus in the basement of the Washington eatery Tortilla Coast.
