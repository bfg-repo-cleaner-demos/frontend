        "body":"<p>When Peter Morgan wrote Rush <a href=\"http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/rush-screenwriter-peter-morgans-10-year-rule-for-biopics.php\">he didn't include any motor racing in the screenplay</a> as he assumed that, even if the film was ever made, it would not be backed with a budget large enough to afford F1 cars. Morgan should have shown a little more faith in his creation.</p><p>Rush took over £2m on its opening weekend, climbed to the top of the UK box office charts on its second week in cinemas, and audiences have scored it 93% on Rotten Tomatoes and 8.3 on IMDB. Even Niki Lauda approved. \"When I saw it the first time, I was impressed,\" said the driver whose rivalry with James Hunt is captured onscreen. \"It was very accurate. There were no Hollywood changes. I wish James had been here to see the movie. It would have been the best.\"</p><p>The success of Rush may have surprised Morgan, but we are now living in the era of the credible sports films. A few years ago Ron Howard would have struggled to find the $50m required to make a feature film about a sport that remains of niche interest to American viewers. The suits would probably not have thrown their money behind a story about two drivers who contested an F1 season 37 years ago until one of them stopped racing due to heavy rain. </p><p>But sports films have moved on from the days when down-and-out sportsmen came back from the brink to overcome the odds and bore their viewers with a tale of rags-to-riches success. Gone are the clichéd days of Goal! III, Mike Bassett and There's Only One Jimmy Grimble. </p><p>Instead we are now treated to serious films made by serious film-makers. Alex Gibney, who has previously shot documentaries about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron:_The_Smartest_Guys_in_the_Room\">Enron</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Steal_Secrets:_The_Story_of_WikiLeaks\">WikiLeaks</a> and the death of an Afghan taxi driver who was beaten by American soldiers, will show his new film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=ukOJ_1b-8lQ\">The Armstrong Lie</a> at the London Film Festival this week. Stephen Frears, whose documentary about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/04/muhammad-ali-vietnam-draft-richard-williams\">Muhammad Ali's refusal to fight in the Vietnam War </a> aired on Sky Atlantic last weekend, is reportedly lined up to shoot a feature film about Armstrong. For viewers without access to the London Film Festival and Sky Atlantic, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/oct/17/why-the-crash-reel-is-the-one-film-you-should-see-this-week-video\">this week's must-see cinema release, The Crash Reel,</a> is about a champion snowboarder laid low by a traumatic brain injury. </p><p>Howard was attracted to Rush – and was able to fund his movie – on the back of the worldwide success of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/ayrton-senna-alain-prost\">Senna</a>, which broke <a href=\"http://edendale.typepad.com/weblog/2011/07/senna-breaks-uk-box-office-records-for-documentary.html\">UK box office records on its release</a> and went on to win the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9M_o9INS_o\">Bafta for best documentary in 2012</a>. </p><p>The success of films such as Rush, Senna and The Damned United has made sports movies a legitimate genre again. If films about Brian Clough's six weeks with Leeds United can bring in viewers and Oscar-winning directors want to tell the story of the 1976 F1 World Championship, what could come next? The forgotten story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/14/forgotten-story-reading-1985-86-season\">Reading's record start to the 1985-86 season</a>? The day <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/sep/05/harry-redknapp-played-fan-west-ham\">Harry Redknapp brought a fan on to play for West Ham</a>?

        "body":"<p>\"Boxing is tainted,\" said Floyd Mayweather a few weeks ago. \"There are too many belts, too many champions.\"</p><p>Anyone at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on September 14 would have noticed an Elvis-worthy display case featuring Mayweather's robes, gloves and boots from past bouts. Several acronym-emblazoned \"championship\" belts were also featured. In a moment of clarity, the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet waved them off – \"I think we should have one belt and that's it.\"</p><p>\"It's so crazy how I beat Miguel Cotto for the WBA Junior middleweight championship, right?\" Mayweather said. \"So how did Austin Trout beat Cotto for the WBA Championship and how is Canelo the WBA Champ?\"</p><p>The WBA is the same cockeyed governing body that stripped Muhammad Ali when he gave Sonny Liston a rematch in 1965, prompting a laugh from sports writer Jimmy Cannon: \"One word from them and the fight mob does as it pleases.\"</p><p>In 1970, they ranked Joe Frazier No7 after he refused to participate in a tournament they were sponsoring. He was at his peak. In the 1980s bribes and pay-offs for higher rankings came to light. Today, despite the fact that there are only 17 weight divisions, they identify 35 champions with an assortment of belts and vivid imaginations.</p><p>The WBA is one among many sanctioning bodies flourishing in an unregulated era where anyone and everything is up for grabs. Their trick titles are unwittingly propped up by fighters and puffed up by network executives operating under misguided assumptions about what fans really want.</p><p>What do fans really want? It begins with the truth.</p><h2>Strict reasoning and common sense</h2><p>The <a href=\"http://www.tbrb.org/\">Transnational Boxing Rankings Board</a> was formed one year ago on behalf of every fan, fighter, writer and media figure fed up with 50 years of confusion and corruption. Our mandate springs from the best efforts of the past to \"provide boxing with <a href=\"http://www.tbrb.org/all-rankings/\">authoritative top-10 rankings</a>, identify the singular world champion of every division based on strict reasoning and common sense, and to insist on the sport's reform.\"</p><p>What began with 25 boxing writers and record keepers representing 12 countries between the Americas and Australia has since increased to 35 representing 15 countries, now including Japan, New Zealand and the Philippines.</p><p>What began as monthly rankings was soon switched to <a href=\"http://www.tbrb.org/\" title=\"\">weekly rankings published online every Tuesday</a>. Boxing historians in the membership pointed out that the tradition of official monthly rankings stretches back to 1928 and is worth preserving, so <a href=\"http://www.tbrb.org/archives/\" title=\"\">these now appear in archive form</a>.</p><p>We have also added <a href=\"http://www.tbrb.org/p4p/\" title=\"\">a pound-for-pound list</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.tbrb.org/successions/\" title=\"\">successions section presenting an abbreviated history behind each divisional throne</a>. A <a href=\"http://www.tbrb.org/charter-en-espanol/\" title=\"\">Spanish-language version</a> of the charter recently appeared on the website and there are plans to establish multi-lingual versions of the site.</p><h2>The importance of allies</h2><p>The success of this initiative is dependent on the support of fans and media buzz. Over the past year, we have much to be grateful for. Barely two weeks after our inaugural rankings were published, the initiative was mentioned on the Wall Street Journal website; founding member <a href=\"http://theclassical.org/articles/top-rank-getting-to-know-the-transnational-boxing-ranking-board\" title=\"\">Tim Starks was interviewed by The Classical</a>; and the rankings earned a place on <a href=\"http://www.boxing.com\" title=\"\">Boxing.com</a> and were adopted exclusively by <a href=\"http://www.thesweetscience.com/\" title=\"\">The Sweet Science.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eastsideboxing.com/\" title=\"\">East Side Boxing</a>. A number of other websites have also adopted the rankings, including Mexico's <a href=\"http://esquinaboxeo.com/\" title=\"\">Esquina Boxeo</a> and Italy's <a href=\"http://news.boxeringweb.net/index.php\" title=\"\">BoxeRingweb</a>, and they have been featured in the New Yorker, the Guardian and NPR.</p><p>Early in 2013, ESPN commentator Teddy Atlas contacted me to learn more about what we are trying to do for boxing. He decided to support the effort and on the March 29 edition of Friday Night Fights, he did so. The segment began with an on-air question posed to Atlas: Is something like this good for the sport? \"It's not good. It's great.\" Atlas replied. \"It might save the sport.\"</p><p>In August, Friday Night Fights included a featherweight bout between Jesus Cuellar and Claudio Marrero. Neither fighter was ranked in the Transnational Boxing Rankings, though the WBA inexplicably had Marrero at No2 and Cuellar at four. Atlas shook his head at that. \"It makes you wonder about some of these ratings,\" he said. \"When are we going to get some real ratings committees? I think there's one out there.\" The Transnational Boxing Rankings, he said, is \"a group of national and international writers that have no biases. They have no agendas. They call it the way it is and they rate it the way it is.\"</p><h2>The Robbery Clause</h2><p>\"We wuz robbed!\" Manager Joe Jacobs shouted into a radio man's microphone minutes after Max Schmeling lost a decision to Jack Sharkey for the heavyweight championship of the world. Since that night in 1932, the term \"robbery\" has been used as a descriptive whenever the wrong man is declared the winner.</p><p>Eighty years to the month later, we introduced the robbery clause into our charter to address a major problem in boxing. If more than 75% of the board believes that the judges' decision in a non-championship fight is egregious enough to constitute a robbery, we reserve the right to rank the official loser over the official winner, effectively overturning the decision.</p><h2>The divisional thrones</h2><p>Upwards of 90% of those routinely announced as champions are actually contenders. This is a focal point of a charter that rejects shortcuts and appointments to the top of the division. We look toward the path of combat to fill each divisional throne. If vacant, only the two top ranked contenders can fight for it. This iron rule, controversial to some, is all that makes sense in boxing. And it is working better than we anticipated.</p><p>When we began one year ago, we recognised four successions that began the moment a victor was declared in a bout between the rightful top two Ring-ranked contenders. Since then, Wladimir Klitschko has finally and convincingly assumed the heavyweight throne. Three more thrones have also been seized under our auspices as the new authority for a total of eight.</p><p>The seventh was seized in September when Mayweather defeated Canelo Alvarez, his next-best rival in the junior middleweight division. The bout was announced as a defense of his WBA \"Super Title\" which isn't worth a fraction of the $1,245,000 sanctioning fee. The truth is far more significant than seven figures or silly belts. The truth is, Mayweather has the last laugh; someone should tell him he's a king.</p><p>His throne, recognised by a new rankings board with an old mandate, is not for sale. Four of us were there bearing witness – and keeping our hands in our own pockets.</p><h2>The rankings</h2><p><strong>Top 10 pound-for-pound boxers (as of October 8)</strong></p><p>1.

        "headline":"Orlando Cruz's WBO title tilt cut short by Orlando Salido",
        "body":"<p>Orlando Cruz's dream of becoming the first openly gay boxer to win a world title was unceremoniously cut short on Saturday night, as Orlando Salido stopped him in seven rounds to capture the vacant WBO featherweight belt.</p><p>A year had passed since the 32-year-old Cruz garnered global attention and support from the boxing community for publicly announcing his sexual orientation. The southpaw donned rainbow flag-themed trunks for the fight and had vowed to continue his historic run by upsetting the favoured Salido.</p><p>However, neither experience nor the crowd were on Cruz's side. Salido had twice held a piece of the title during a career that started 17 years ago aged 15 in his native Mexico. Ultimately he proved too tough an assignment for Cruz, who was appearing in his first major title bout after winning four consecutive fights against lesser competition.</p><p>Following an uneventful first round in which both men mainly gauged their striking distance, the second round featured the type of fight most observers expected, as the rugged Salido applied his signature pressure out of the orthodox stance, with the crafty Cruz attempting to utilise his tact and footwork to box his way out of trouble.</p><p>But the Mexican's lunging lead right hand became maddeningly effective and it snapped the Puerto Rican's stationary head back numerous times. Salido would often follow the punch with left hooks to the temple and to the rib cage, with the shots serving as further medicinal punishment for Cruz's lack of cranial movement.</p><p>Though Cruz would sporadically find a home for his right jab and counter right hook, his arsenal failed to inflict the type of damage that might have bothered a buzz saw of Salido's calibre.</p><p>As the discrepancy in punching power became readily apparent, Cruz switched his tactics in the fifth round. In a brief role reversal he became the aggressor and forced Salido's back to graze the ropes. Cruz subsequently tagged him with a couple of three-punch combinations in what was arguably his best round of the fight.</p><p>Salido blunted that momentum in the sixth, once more digging his head into his rival's chest to close the distance between them. The Mexican then systematically delivered hammers from both fists on a backpedaling Cruz, who pushed his right jab out but could not deter the Mexican from pressing forward.</p><p>The end came abruptly in the seventh round. As Cruz retreated toward the ropes, Salido stepped in and threw a flurry but missed with a left uppercut that capped the bombardment. As the Puerto Rican refrained from returning fire, Salido unleashed his final salvo of the night, a looping right hand followed by a left uppercut that connected with enough influence to send Cruz to the canvas for good.</p><p>The referee, Kenny Bayless, administered the full 10 seconds and counted the pioneering fighter out. After gingerly rising to his feet, a dejected Cruz sat motionless on a stool in the neutral corner for a few moments – perhaps reflecting on the courageous journey he has travelled but just as likely the dream that was deferred.</p><p>While Cruz was unavailable for comment, Salido shared his interaction with the Puerto Rican after the fight. \"I told [Cruz] that he was a good, strong fighter and I thanked him for the opportunity,\" Salido said. \"He will be back.\"</p><p>As for what awaits the new titleholder, the Top Rank CEO, Bob Arum, is eager to pair him with the twice Olympic gold medallist Vasyl Lomachenko for a bout on 25 January in New York City's Madison Square Garden. In a bold move the 25-year-old Ukrainian decided to fight a world-rated featherweight in his pro debut and stopped Jose Ramírez in four rounds via a vicious blow to the midsection.</p><p>If Lomachenko pulls out of the fight, the former junior featherweight world champion Nonito Donaire (31-2, 20 KOs) has expressed his desire to face Salido, but the Filipino must first get by his nemesis Vic Darchinyan (39-5-1, 28 KOs) on 9 November in Texas.</p><p>When asked if he would prefer to face Lomachenko or Donaire, Salido shrugged his shoulders and uttered as logical an answer as one could hope for in this business. \"Whichever guy can make me more money,\" Salido said, laughing.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419848243|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|31d7e550b844e5f4cedb7f88d6d81339842f952a -->",

        "headline":"Timothy Bradley retains WBO title but Juan Manuel Márquez is fuming",
        "body":"<p>Though 10 years his senior, Timothy Bradley warned the boxing world that Juan Manuel Márquez would be the toughest opponent of his career, and after Saturday night, it would be hard to disagree.</p><p>For the third consecutive fight, Bradley had his hand raised amid controversy, as he defeated the Mexican fighter by a 12-round split decision to retain his World Boxing Organisation welterweight title. Judges Patricia Morse Jarman (116-112) and Robert Hoyle (115-113) scored the bout for Bradley, overruling Glenn Feldman's 115-113 tally for Márquez.</p><p>A heavily pro-Márquez crowd of 13,111 at the Thomas and Mack Center jeered the verdict, but Bradley was confident he deserved to win a bout featuring several close rounds that could have gone either way on the cards. \"I didn't think the fight was that close,\" Bradley said. \"When [Márquez] caught me on the ropes, a lot of shots were missing. I felt I controlled the fight.\"</p><p>The clash involved the last two men to officially beat former pound-for-pound king Manny Pacquiao in 2012. While Bradley aimed to alter public perception after being awarded a seemingly dubious decision over Pacquiao, the 40-year-old Márquez  was determined to demonstrate that his shocking stoppage of the Filipino icon did not signal the end of his prime.</p><p>\"I knew that this was my moment,\" the unbeaten American said. \"I made adjustments. He's a veteran. I expected that. I had to stay solid with my defence and stay hungry.\"</p><p>Utilising his speed, agility, and ability to strike from distance, Bradley resisted the urge to brawl. He boxed beautifully throughout the fight, showing few signs of his war of attrition with Ruslan Provodnikov in March that left him slurring his words for a month.</p><p>However, Bradley was forced to weather a late surge from the powerful Márquez in an affair where both orthodox fighters exhibited the type of tactical brilliance expected of elite boxers. Referee Robert Byrd had an easy job, as the fight was mainly devoid of clinches, butts, or the garden variety of low blows that can plague a high-profile contest. \"I like to step in there and fight but I had to listen to my corner and get that win because Márquez is a big puncher,\" Bradley said. \"He could hurt me at any time so I had to stay focused on getting that victory.\"</p><p>Bradley had appeared to take early control largely by slipping Márquez's shots and finding a home for his counter right hand over the top. As the bout progressed, the Mexican's body punching took effect, and his foe's punch output suddenly decreased in the middle rounds.</p><p>The fans rose in unison in the 10th when Márquez pounded Bradley with one such left hook and the two grazed shoulders during a furious exchange. But the American answered back with an accurate right hand that stopped the charging Márquez in his tracks, and the mystery continued as to who held the advantage on the scorecards.</p><p>Following a competitive 11th round, the final frame produced substantial drama. A screaming straight right hand from Márquez blasted Bradley, who then walked to his right with his hands down and glared at his rival as if to signify he was not stunned.</p><p>With seconds left, the warriors traded blows, and a left hook from Bradley jolted Márquez backward to the point where his glove almost touched the canvas. While the Mexican eventually recalibrated his balance and stayed upright until the bell, his act of resilience came to nothing. Even if he had won the 12th on all three cards, the result would have remained the same.</p><p>Márquez, no stranger to rebuking officials, had some choice words after falling short in his bid to become the first Mexican to win world titles in five divisions.</p><p>\"To be here in Vegas, I need to knock the person out to get a victory,\" Márquez said on the dais. \"Unfortunately, I need to be scared of the judges more than my opponent.\"</p><p>Márquez's trainer, Nacho Beristáin, echoed his sentiment moments later.</p><p>\"Not only is [Bradley] a good fighter, he's lucky,\" Beristáin said. \"He's the only undefeated fighter with two losses. His trainer [Joel Díaz] is my friend… He's very young with a bright future. But tonight, we won, and in his heart, he knows it.\"</p><p>While Bradley responded by holding his title belt aloft, Díaz merely looked in his counterpart's direction and said: \"A man with such knowledge couldn't come up with a plan to knock out Tim Bradley.\"</p><p>As for who the victor could face next, his promoter, Top Rank CEO Bob Arum, pointed to the winner of the 23 November tilt between Pacquiao and Brandon  Ríos. Of the two, a Bradley-Ríos fight would be easier to make considering that both men share the same manager, Cameron Dunkin.</p><p>In the meantime, Bradley believed that his performance has re-established him as one of boxing's best.</p><p>\"You have to consider me top three in the world now,\" he said. \"There's [Floyd] Mayweather, there's Andre Ward, and there's Tim Bradley, baby.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419849756|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|126cd5e96f135ce85a9d1c7e6062e627d5f8e5d7 -->",

        "headline":"Orlando Cruz defiance shows why football should come out of the closet",
        "body":"<p>Shortly after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/orlando-cruz-loses-world-title-challenge\" title=\"\">Orlando Cruz's forehead crumpled to the canvas in the early hours of Sunday morning</a>, an act of involuntary genuflection wrought by a blunting right hook and left uppercut, his opponent Orlando Salido offered this verdict: \"He's a good fighter, he moves well in the ring,\" he said. \"But he's not anything special.\"</p><p>In boxing terms, Salido, now the WBO featherweight champion, was right. Cruz was defiant but he took a beating. At 32, he is unlikely to fight for a world title again. But we can also say this: by coming out as the first openly gay fighter, and then scrapping until his synapses were sparked, he will have chiselled away at fossilised perceptions and inspired others for generations to come. By that measure, Cruz is special indeed.</p><p>It was noticeable how minor an issue Cruz's sexuality was. Apart from the occasional boo when he entered the ring – a standard reaction when a Mexican fights a Puerto Rican – few seemed to care. It was a welcome change after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/09/tyson-fury-david-haye-boxing\" title=\"\">Tyson Fury called Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko \"homosexual\"</a> on Twitter last week, but it also made you wonder: if boxing, a sport so blue-collar that every bill seems to carry the whiff of Lynx, lager and hard-luck stories, can be comfortable with an openly gay participant, why can't football?</p><p>Most will have a ready list of two-word answers: Justin Fashanu and Le Saux, the fansand the media. That Graeme le Saux is not gay didn't seem to matter; reading the Guardian was enough. In May, the Observer revealed that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/05/gay-footballers-fear-reaction-of-fans\" title=\"\">PFA chairman, Clarke Carlisle, was approached by eight gay footballers</a> – of whom seven remained quiet not because of the perceived negative reaction from team-mates, but fears of how fans and the media would respond.</p><p>Recent research, however, suggests that football supporters might not be as homophobic as is generally thought. In 2012, the academics Ellis Cashmore and Jamie Cleland published a <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/1600411/Fans_homophobia_and_masculinities_in_association_football_evidence_of_a_more_inclusive_environment\" title=\"\">paper in the British Journal of Sociology</a>, based on 3,500 anonymous interviews, which found that supporters had \"more permissive and liberal\" attitudes towards homosexuality than was widely assumed, with only 7% believing there was no place for gay players. Of course that's still too many: in a crowd of 3,000 it equates to over 200 people, more than enough for their bile to be heard, but it's fewer than widely assumed.</p><p>Cleland also analysed attitudes towards gay footballers on 48 online football message boards for another paper published this year – and that found <a href=\"http://irs.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/02/14/1012690213475437\" title=\"\">those expressing homophobic views were repeatedly challenged by other supporters</a>. However, that doesn't necessarily happen at matches: last season, for instance, homophobic chants were sung at Brighton fans in nearly three-quarters of games – with Cleland finding fans fearing for their safety if they confronted others about their behaviour.</p><p>\"I have been quite surprised by the recent data,\" says Cleland, a lecturer in criminology at Loughborough University. \"There is a vocal minority, and we can't ignore that. But that minority is becoming smaller, certainly compared to the 80s and 90s. Meanwhile a forthcoming paper of mine suggests the media – which many suspect is another part of the problem – is increasingly changing its attitude towards gay players.\"</p><p>What of attitudes to gay players within teams? Again, research suggests they are becoming more liberal. In 2002 Eric Anderson, a sociologist at the University of Winchester, interviewed 26 openly gay male athletes in the US and found sport \"a bastion of hegemonic masculinity, heterosexism and homophobia\", yet when he did the same in 2010 he discovered far less prejudice. In 2002, gay athletes didn't discuss their sexuality with team-mates; by 2010 they were doing so openly. Players also reported that insults such as \"fag\", were used far less frequently, if at all.</p><p>In 2006, <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/players/02/28/poll.0228/\" title=\"\">Sports Illustrated surveyed 450 MLB players, 248 NBA players, 357 NFL players and 346 NHL players</a> and asked if they would accept an openly gay player on their team. Eighty per cent of NHL players said they would, while the figure was around 60% in American football, basketball and baseball. It would be fascinating to see whether those figures have moved northwards in the past seven years – and what similar research in football would uncover.</p><p>Instead, all we know is this: there are around 3,000 professional footballers in Britain, and not one of them is openly gay. Conservatively you could add a zero to that number to get a global figure. And how many of these 30,000 are out? Two. Anton Hysen at the Swedish semi-professional team Utsiktens BK and Robbie Rogers at LA Galaxy. Isn't this more than a little strange?</p><p>Unfortunately football's leaders have rarely led on this issue. Fifa president Sepp Blatter's joke that gay supporters travelling to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal, should \"refrain from any sexual activities\" was fairly typical. Others remain quiet, preferring for the issue to be kept in the closet.

Judges Patricia Morse Jarman (116-112) and Robert Hoyle (115-113) scored the bout for Bradley, overruling Glenn Feldman's 115-113 tally for Marquez.</p><p>A heavily pro-Marquez crowd at the Thomas and Mack Center jeered the announcement of the scores, but an unfazed Bradley was confident he deserved the win.</p><p>\"I understand the scoring, but I thought I won on the majority of the cards,\" the American said.</p><p>The clash involved the last two men to officially defeat former pound-for-pound king Manny Pacquiao in 2012.  While Bradley aimed to prove <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/10/manny-pacquiao-timothy-bradley-live\">his controversial decision win over Pacquiao</a> was no fluke, Marquez hoped to demonstrate that his sublime stoppage of the Filipino did not signal the end of his prime.</p><p>\"I knew that this was my moment,\" Bradley (31-0, 12 KOs) said after the win.  \"I made adjustments. He's a veteran. I expected that. I had to stay solid with my defense and stay hungry.\"</p><p>Utilizing his speed and agility, the American boxed beautifully throughout the fight, but was forced to weather a late surge from Marquez (55-7-1, 40 KOs) to capture the victory in an affair where both men exhibited tactical brilliance and several rounds were close enough to go either way.</p><p>Bradley had appeared to take early control by slipping Marquez's shots and finding a home for his own counter right hand over the top.  However, the Mexican's crippling body shots might have taken their effect as the bout progressed, and Bradley's punch output suddenly decreased.</p><p>The fans rose in unison in the 10th when Marquez pounded Bradley with a left hook and the two grazed shoulders during a furious exchange.  But the American answered back with a right hand on the button that stopped the charging Marquez in his tracks, and the mystery continued as to who held the advantage on the scorecards.</p><p>The final round produced substantial drama.  A screaming straight right hand from Marquez blasted Bradley, who then walked to his right with his hands down and glared at his rival as if to signify he was not dazed. </p><p>With seconds left, the fighters traded blows, and a left hook from Bradley jolted Marquez with enough force that his glove almost touched the canvas.  While the Mexican recalibrated his balance and stayed upright until the bell, his act of resilience turned out to be irrelevant.</p><p>As for who Bradley will face next, the defending champion was noncommittal, but hoped that his performance re-established him as one of boxing's best.</p><p>\"I'm going to sit down to talk to my team,\" Bradley said.  \"I want to fight nothing but the best.  You have to consider me top three in the world now.  There's [Floyd] Mayweather, there's Andre Ward, and there's Tim Bradley, baby.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419815759|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|6d5344d656a973036cf49138cd42635d761b6ac5 -->",

Marquez coming forward. A leading right from Marquez catches Bradley. Some big swings from Marquez get the crowd excited, but it's much ado about nothing as they fail to connect, looking more dramatic than effective. Bradley continues to stay out of range, using his left hand jab effectively. A huge flurry at the end sees Marquez almost go down to a left hook. Marquez stumbles backwards. And the final bell rings...</p> <p><strong>Guardian unofficial scorecard: Bradley 10-9 Marquez</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a1a46e4b00464758c0603\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T05:02:05.214+01:00\">12.02am <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round eleven</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Bradley's corner tell him that he's winning. Marquez comes forward much more as the round begins, possibly knowing that he may need to do something serious in order to win. Bradley stays out of reach mostly though, using his jab effectively. Bradley is mostly landing a single right hand jab and then retreating. Marquez lands occasional body blows, but not enough to do any serious damage. Last round coming up. Bradley appears to be ahead on points (although Marquez's corner tell him that he's winning &quot;I think,&quot; they say)</p> <p><strong>Guardian unofficial scorecard: Bradley 10-10 Marquez</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a195fe4b00464758c0602\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T04:57:52.400+01:00\">11.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round ten</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And for the first time there's some serious scrapping. Bradley lands a big right, but Marquez counters. Strange that Bradley was get involved in those sort of close-quarter flurries at this point, when his jab has been doing such a good job. The crowd get behind the Mexican again. Bradley goes back to jabbing and circling, circling and jabbing. Marquez almost catches Bradley in the corner, but some very undignified scuffling sees the pair almost both end up on the floor.</p> <p><strong>Guardian unofficial scorecard: Bradley 10-9 Marquez</strong></p> <p>Daniel SanMateo emails:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Very close fight up until now. Marquez is like a great wine, ageing graciously and fine.</p> <p>&nbsp;Bradley is doing a great job as well.</p> <p>&nbsp;Hopefully Marquez will prevail, Pacman's shadow again looming on the air.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a1864e4b00464758c0601\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T04:54:02.580+01:00\">11.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round nine</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Is Bradley's age advantage the deciding factor here? Bradley still looks fresh, Marquez looks more leaden footed. Certainly Marquez looks less likely to outmaneouvre his opponent. Marquez has some marking around his eyes. Bradley's jab gets working again, but Marquez trades with left-hand uppercuts when they get close enough. It's mostly risk-free fighting. Marquez may just have won his first round for some time...</p> <p><strong>Guardian unofficial scorecard: Bradley 9-10 Marquez</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a1773e4b00464758c0600\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T04:49:51.185+01:00\">11.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round eight</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The most dramatic start to a round yet as Bradley goes forward swinging. It makes for more entertaining boxing, but isn't necessarily a good idea for the American, because Marquez looks happier when they get into it. Bradley lands a good left, short arm jab, but Marquez counters with a right. The crowd show their allegiance with some chanting of &quot;Mexico! Mexico!&quot; Marquez lands a big right to the head, Bradley counters. Bradley's jab is still the biggest scoring factor.</p> <p><strong>Guardian unofficial scorecard: Bradley 10-9 Marquez</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a1685e4b0d9d00a7cb7a0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T04:45:07.424+01:00\">11.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round seven</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So, into the second half of the bout, and still the pair circle and jab. Bradley the more successful with the jabbing, more obviously catching Marquez's face. Bradley throws a big swinging right hand and loses his positioning and is caught by a big right from the Mexican. And then they go back to Bradley jabbing, Marquez unsure how to get closer to the American.</p> <p><strong>Guardian unofficial scorecard: Bradley 10-9 Marquez</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a1592e4b0d9d00a7cb79f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T04:41:20.121+01:00\">11.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round six</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Some expletive-ridden advice in the Bradley corner during the break: mostly telling him to stick to his jabbing. A big right from Bradley gets an oooh from the crowd, but then the pair go back to jabbing. While the jabbing contest goes on Bradley looks the more likely winner: Marquez unsure how he can get behind the jab. Marquez finally lands a big right to Bradley's head, but there's no follow-up. Bradley being booed by the crowd as he dances away.</p> <p><strong>Guardian unofficial scorecard: Bradley 10-10 Marquez</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a14a3e4b00464758c05ff\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T04:37:37.590+01:00\">11.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round five</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The pair are still skirmishing. Bradley's jab reaching in for some head shots, but the American is wary of coming in to follow up. How many of those jabs are landing? Marquez's defence is up. Still Bradley jabs. Marquez counters with scything body blows. When the Mexican swings for the head, Bradley easily ducks under. When Marquez attempts to come forward he gets caught by the jab. Again the round ends with a flurry. Marquez takes a big punch to the face and then charges forward as the bell rings.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Guardian unofficial scorecard: Bradley 10-9 Marquez</strong></p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T04:37:48.069+01:00\">at 11.37pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-525a139ee4b0d9d00a7cb79e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T04:33:36.479+01:00\">11.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round four</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>HBO scoring it 2-1 to Bradley so far. Marquez comes forward and there's a flurry. And then the fight stops as the referee asks for some grease/vaseline to be removed from Marquez. Bradley still going forward more of the pair, but Marquez looks quite content with that, allowing him the opportunity for big counter punches. Marquez's punches appear the more likely to cause some serious damage.</p> <p><strong>Guardian unofficial scorecard: Bradley 9-10 Marquez</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a12a6e4b00464758c05fe\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T04:29:29.498+01:00\">11.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round three</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Back to sizing each other up again as the third starts. When Marquez comes forward, Bradley catches the Mexican with some left hooks. But just as Bradley appears to be getting the upper hand (just), Marquez throws a big right to make the American retreat again. Bradley looks the quicker of the two. Again the pair throw a flurry of punches at the end of the round in a bid to edge it.

Cruz counters but his punches are carrying less weight. And getting too close and getting involved in slugging exchanges may not be the best option for the Puerto Rican. Another combination from Salido. Cruz, with his mop of hair on top, looks to lack the firepower for the big exchanges, although as soon as I type that Cruz lands a straight right that is his best punch of the night. Cruz may just have landed enough punches in that round to share it, but certainly not enough to win it. (Controversial, I know, to score rounds 10-10 but you try typing and scoring at the same time).

Salido lands another low blow and gets another talking to. To be fair, the belts on those shorts are very high, offering not a lot of body to hit above them. Salido is the more aggressive of the pair and lands a couple of combinations. Cruz lands a nice right hook but is mostly dancing around, frustrating Salido who is coming forward the more of the two. Salido lands more punches and wins the round (unless the judges decide to score against him for those low blows).</p> <p><strong>Guardian unofficial scorecard:&nbsp;Cruz 9-10 Salido</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525a027ae4b036d35b97e3a2\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T03:20:28.588+01:00\">10.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Round one</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The opening moments feature plenty of standing-off, sizing each other out.

Cruz is making the better early moves in terms of trying to get his opponent where he wants him, but when Salido finds himself in the corner, Cruz lands no punches.

This is perhaps my favourite passage:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cruz felt more jittery when, three months ago,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/15/orlando-cruz-boxer-marry-boyfriend\">he proposed to his partner, Jos&eacute; Manuel, on Facebook</a>. &quot;I'd like to say, and share it with your friends, and my friends: 'Do you want to marry me?' It's an important step, a step I've thought about, a step we've thought about ...&quot;</p> <p>It did not take long for Jos&eacute;, who is older than Cruz and an engineer, to accept and tell Cruz: &quot;I love and adore you.&quot;</p> <p>Cruz looks almost dazed as he remembers his unusual proposal. &quot;I came in after a long run and just did it. It was very spontaneous. Life is much more positive for me now. I have my boyfriend. I have so much support. I'm much more confident. My marriage can happen in a year or two but a world title fight against Salido is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full interview <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/11/orlando-cruz-gay-boxer-world-title\">here</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5259fc7ae4b036d35b97e39e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T02:51:40.678+01:00\">9.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Next up...</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And so, next up we will have&nbsp;Orlando Cruz vs Orlando Salido for the vacant&nbsp;WBO Featherweight title.

And as always, it will be hard to say. Probably about 11pm ET. Probably. That time might be more likely than usual as the first fight of the night (of four) finished with a TKO in the third round, giving Seanie Monaghan a nasty, brutish and short victory.</p> <p>And what time is 11pm ET where you are? Well, that's 9pm in Las Vegas. And 4am in the UK. As for the rest of the world, this never fails to amuse me:</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfNISfcJuYo\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RfNISfcJuYo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5259ee0fe4b0d2382acc0633\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T02:03:53.962+01:00\">9.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Welcome to another Big Fight Night at the Guardian: watching the big bouts so that you don't have to pay expensive pay-per-view.</p> <p>Top of the bill is an intriguing welterweight title fight: Timothy &quot;Desert Storm&quot; Bradley vs&nbsp;Juan Manuel &quot;Dinamita&quot;&nbsp;M&aacute;rquez. A 30-year-old against a 40-year-old, although I wouldn't suggest that age is necessarily going to be a decisive factor. What probably marks both these fighters out is that they have both beaten Manny Pacquiao. Maybe that should be &quot;beaten&quot;.&nbsp;M&aacute;rquez undoubtedly got the better of Pacman, with an awesome KO. But Bradley's victory was nowhere near so clear cut, a controversial split-decision.</p> <p>Bradley is the title-holder here, but&nbsp;M&aacute;rquez is going for a title in a fifth different weight.</p> <p>Also featuring on tonight's undercard is Orlando Cruz vs Orlando Salido, which should be a good bout, but is also highly notable for Cruz's decision to become an openly gay boxer, something that must have taken an enormous amount of courage, probably more courage than it takes to just get hit by an opponent for an hour.</p> <p>My colleague Don McRae spent some time with Cruz recently:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cruz laughed because, a year after coming out as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/boxing\">boxing</a>'s first publicly gay fighter, he could afford to be open. He was a month away from the fight of his life, which takes place on Saturday night in Las Vegas as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/sep/25/orlando-cruz-gay-boxer-wbo-title-video\">he challenges Mexico's Orlando Salido for the WBO world featherweight title</a>, but he still loved his new liberty.</p> <p>The temptation of slipping into a bar was obvious after months of monastic training. But boxing is merciless towards laxity and indulgence. Cruz's trainer, Juan de Le&oacute;n, a fellow Puerto Rican, was also waiting for us at home in the suburbs of a blue-collar city deep in New York State. So we raced on through the darkness.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full interview <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/11/orlando-cruz-gay-boxer-world-title\">here</a>.</p> <p>I will be back with more shortly, but in the meantime, read the great Cruz interview.

        "headline":"Orlando Cruz beaten in historic world championship bid",
        "body":"<p>Orlando Cruz had his dream of becoming the first openly gay boxer to win a world title unceremoniously cut short on Saturday night at the Thomas and Mack Center, as Orlando Salido earned a seventh-round stoppage victory to capture the vacant WBO featherweight belt.</p><p>A year had passed since the 32-year-old Cruz (20-3-1, 10 KOs) garnered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/11/orlando-cruz-gay-boxer-world-title\">global attention and support from the boxing community for publicly announcing his sexual orientation</a>.  The Puerto Rican southpaw donned rainbow flag trunks for the clash, and had vowed to continue his historic run by upsetting the favored Salido.</p><p>However, Salido (40-12-2, 28 KOs) once held a piece of the title on two separate occasions during a career that started 17 years ago at age 15 in his native Mexico.  Ultimately, he proved too tough an assignment for the less-experienced Cruz, who was appearing in his first major title bout.</p><p>After an uneventful first frame where both men held back on punches, the second round featured the type of fight most observers expected, as the rugged Salido applied his signature systematic pressure out of the orthodox stance, with the crafty Cruz attempting to utilise his tact and footwork to box his way out of trouble.  </p><p>But the Mexican's lunging lead right hand was maddeningly effective, and it snapped the Puerto Rican's head back on impact.  Salido would follow the shot with left hooks upstairs and to the ribcage. Though Cruz sporadically found a home for his own counter right hook, it failed to do the type of damage to back up an opponent of Salido's caliber.</p><p>As the discrepancy in punching power became readily apparent, Cruz switched his tactics in the fifth.  In a brief role reversal, he became the aggressor and forced Salido to back into the ropes.  Cruz then tagged him with a couple of three-punch combinations in what was arguably his best round of the fight.</p><p>Salido blunted that momentum in the sixth, once more digging his head into his rival's chest and delivering hammers from both hands on a backpedaling Cruz, who pushed his right jab out but could not deter the Mexican from pressing forward.</p><p>The end came abruptly in the seventh round.  As Cruz retreated toward the ropes, Salido stepped in and threw a flurry, but missed with a left uppercut.  As the Puerto Rican refrained from returning fire, Salido unleashed his final salvo of the night, a looping right hand followed by a left uppercut that connected with enough influence to send Cruz to the canvas for good.  Referee Kenny Bayless counted Cruz out at an official time of 1:05, as the pioneering fighter's dream of a world championship was deferred for now.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419814985|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|63c4a6c5ce17050f9aca5175a714215512e3842d -->",

These are inexperienced fighters, plying their trade far from home, but the squad's performance director, Robert McCracken, remains discreetly optimistic. \"We've got to start again after the Olympics and we've lost some pretty big names,\" he admits. \"But three years before Rio we are in a great position, at least as good as before London.\"</p><p>He jabs out names of potential world medallists: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/fred-evans-silver-medal-boxing\" title=\"\">Evans, who won an Olympic welterweight silver</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/london-2012-fred-evans-andrew-selby\" title=\"\">Andrew Selby, who lost to a very good Cuban in London</a> but is now ranked No1 at 52kg; Joe Joyce, the super-heavyweight with lead piping in his fists. Then come possible curveballs: Josh Taylor, who lost early in London 2012 but is kicking on after injury, Sam Maxwell and Jack Bateson – all of whom McCracken believes could make a decent fist of it given a favourable draw and a slice of luck.</p><p>It is not just Britain's squad that has freshened up since the Olympics. The rules have too. This will be the first world championships since the 1980s without headguards. Fighters will box three three-minute rounds rather than four two-minute rounds. And scoring is based on a 10-point system rather than rewarding flurries of tippy-tappy punches. \"I like the changes,\" says Selby. \"The new scoring rewards aggression, which suits me.\"</p><p>Next to him, the middleweight Anthony Fowler nods his head. \"They are trying to make it more like the professionals,\" he says. \"Not wearing a headguard means you see punches more clearly and your head doesn't get as hot.\"</p><p>McCracken is far too modest to brag, but the success of Britain's amateur boxers since he became performance director is extraordinary. He took charge in November 2009, shortly after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/sep/11/great-britain-amateur-boxing-failure\" title=\"\">the men's team returned from the Milan world championships without a medal</a>. Since then, they have won 19 – five golds, six silvers and eight bronzes – in five major tournaments, across the European, worlds and the Olympics. To put that into context, in the same five tournaments from 2004 to 2008 the men's squad won five medals – two golds and three bronzes.</p><p>So what changed? McCracken cites a number of reasons. There is a greater emphasis on fitness and the latest strength and conditioning methods. His fighters go on more training camps abroad, which hammers home the fact that foreign rivals are no better. Meanwhile, technological wizardry is used to wrangle every possible advantage. Beside each of the six rings at the EIS, for instance, there are computer tablets that record each sparring session and have a searchable database of the world's best amateur fighters.</p><p>More than anything else, McCracken stresses that the squad's success is down to sharp recruitment and smart delegation. \"Once you have identified the best people, you should let them get on with it,\" he says. \"It's no good me standing over the performance analyst, the doctor or the physio because I have not got their skill sets.\"</p><p>A typical day starts on the track at 7.45am, before the squad return to the gym at 10am for a weigh-in followed by three rounds of technical work and a heavy weights session. After lunch they return to the gym at 3pm for eight rounds of sparring and pad work before a long stretch to warm down. On the days where they also do extensive video analysis they often do not finish until 6pm.</p><p>To prepare for fighting three three-minute rounds, the squad are doing more low-rep sets of heavy weights to make them stronger and have swapped long morning runs for intense sprints on the track. The latter sessions, which they enjoy least of all, involve multiple repetitions of 60 seconds all-out effort followed by a four-minute rest – which should enable them to throw more flurries at the beginning and end of rounds, where judges are more liable to be swayed.</p><p>\"The training is harder now,\" says Taylor. \"The 3 x 3-minute rounds are more physically demanding on your body so we are doing more strength and conditioning work and lifting heavier weights. We used to do steady runs, now it's high-intensity runs and sprinting up stairs. We are fitter than most pros.\"</p><p>Evans cites another change. \"We now wear heart-rate monitors all the time so the coaches know how hard we are putting it in,\" he says. \"It is impossible to coast because they will know.\"</p><p>Messages are also drilled home via whiteboards in the gym. On one, Joyce is reminded to \"Keep your shape: hold it before your punch – then stop and punch again\", but sometimes directives are blunter. Underneath a chart showing the correct ratios of protein, carbs and fats for their six meals a day, the squad's performance nutritionist has written \"Cut out the crap\" in big letters.</p><p>McCracken will not be drawn on a medal target, but he is confident his squad is coming nicely to the boil. \"This competition will give us a gauge of where were at – who needs to stay and who needs to be moved out,\" he says. \"It will help us make decisions. But in three years' time in Brazil we will do well, no doubt about it.\"</p><p>With that McCracken slips back into the shadows, quietly observing the scuttle and sweat of fighters going about their day's work. A note here, a nod there. He barely raises his voice, but he does not need to: McCracken's influence is loud and clear.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419702568|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|6095a9c8fd6cda34be546f556fb3b1c6455e887d -->",

He lost the next two encounters with \"The Greatest\" narrowly and contentiously; many believed Norton should have been awarded the decision in all three contests.</p><p>Norton, a former US marine, had a cross-armed defensive style that troubled Ali. Superbly conditioned, with a chiselled muscular physique that made him sought after in Hollywood – his films included Mandingo (1975), with Susan George, and Drum (1976), with Pam Grier – he was a lightly considered underdog when he first fought Ali in 1973.</p><p>Gene Kilroy, who acted as Ali's business manager, said: \"Ali thought it would be an easy fight. But Norton was unorthodox. Instead of jabbing from above like most fighters, he would put his hand down and jab up at Ali.\" Ali was never able to get into his familiar rhythm, and was on the receiving end of a split points decision after 12 rounds. He was left in hospital, where his broken jaw had to be wired up.</p><p>Picked as a supposedly soft touch, Norton had been offered $50,000 for the fight. \"For $50,000, I'd fight the Russian army,\" he said. ABC's commentator Howard Cosell had said before the fight that it was \"the worst mismatch in boxing history and a disgrace\". Later he said: \"Kenny, you made me look silly.\" Norton replied: \"That's OK, Howard, you always look silly.\"</p><p>Six months later, Norton and Ali fought again and this time Ali prevailed by a split decision, setting up a decider in 1976 at the Yankee stadium in New York. By then, Ali was world champion and generating huge sums of money wherever and whenever he fought. The judges gave a narrow points decision against Norton, with booing greeting the verdict from many in the 30,000 crowd.</p><p>Norton was born and brought up in Jacksonville, Illinois. His father, John Norton, was a fire service engineer; his mother, Ruth, was a hospital therapist. An outstanding all-round athlete, Norton won a scholarship to Northeast Missouri State College (now Truman State University) through his proficiency at basketball and American football and as a track athlete. It was only after enlisting in the marine corps that he began boxing, quickly finding that his strength and physique – he stood 191cm (6ft&nbsp;3in) and weighed about 100kg (220lb) – made him ideally suited to the sport.</p><p>Norton was the All-Marine heavyweight champion three times before turning professional in 1967. He made the usual advance of a heavyweight prospect, repelling a succession of the sport's journeymen and soon gained respect in the division. He boosted his earnings with sparring work against the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/08/joe-frazier\" title=\"Joe Frazier obituary\">Joe Frazier</a>, with whom he shared a trainer in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/oct/12/boxing.theguardian\" title=\"Eddie Futch obituary\">Eddie Futch</a>.</p><p>Frazier, who was close to Norton as a friend, never fought him. But Norton did fight another great heavyweight of the 1970s, George Foreman, for the title in 1974. At the peak of his powers, Foreman faced Norton in Caracas, Venezuela, and floored him three times before the stoppage came in the second round, enabling Foreman to dramatically retain the title he had won by defeating Frazier in 1973. Foreman would later become friends with Norton and praised him, saying: \"He fought Ali through all those questionable decisions and, even though he was patriotic [Ali had famously refused to serve in the army], he never used that against Ali. That made me so proud of him. He was humane.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417826431'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2013/9/19/1379608109808/Muhammad-Ali-right-winces-010.jpg' alt='Muhammad Ali, right, winces as Ken Norton lands a punch in their second fight, won by Ali in 1973' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Muhammad Ali, right, winces as Ken Norton lands a punch during their second fight, won by Ali, at the Forum in Inglewood, California, in 1973. Photograph: AP</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the bitter disappointment of losing to Ali in their third fight, Norton rebounded with three wins in 1977 – including victories over the highly rated Duane Bobick and Jimmy Young – and earned himself the position of mandatory challenger for the title, which was claimed by Leon Spinks after his shock victory over Ali in February 1978. The World Boxing Council awarded Norton the title when Spinks agreed to a rematch with the ageing Ali instead of a fight against Norton.</p><p>Norton lost his title in his first defence as champion, again suffering the agonies of being on the wrong end of a split decision, when he took on Larry Holmes in what is now recognised as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS8JXVpJDIk\" title=\"Ken Norton v Larry Holmes in 1978\">one of the all-time classic world heavyweight fights</a>. For 15 rounds at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, the two men traded power punches of almost frightening intensity. Holmes would go on to be recognised as the world No 1 until the mid-1980s, while Norton was never the same fighter again.</p><p>A loss to the big-punching Earnie Shavers in 1979, with Norton suffering a first-round knockout, suggested his time had gone. Another first-round stoppage, against Gerry Cooney in 1981, prompted Norton to announce his retirement from the sport.</p><p>In 1986, a car accident almost killed Norton. He suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured skull and a brain injury that left him with slurred speech. Before then, he had been working as a ringside commentator and had continued to act in films and on television. After a long period of declining health, including a succession of strokes and a heart attack, he moved into a care home.</p><p>Norton is survived by his wife, Rose, and his children Ken (an American football linebacker who now coaches with the Seattle Seahawks), Keith, Kenejon and Kenisha.</p><p><em>• </em>Kenneth Howard Norton, boxer, born 9 August 1943; died 18 September 2013</p><p><em>• </em>This article was updated on 20 September 2013.

I like you a lot, I love you and I look forward to your answer.\"</p><p>Cruz didn't have to wait long. Manuel accepted his proposal with his own emotional video, also posted on Facebook.</p><p>\"I want to tell you, yes, I do accept and would like to marry you, because I love you,\" he replied tearily. \"I'm a bit emotional. I didn't expect to find your proposal posted to Facebook.\"</p><p>Both videos have since been removed from the website.</p><p>Cruz also mentioned the proposal on his Twitter account, saying that he had taken an important step in his life and that he wants happiness for him and his partner as a couple.</p><p>Pedro Julio Serrano, spokesman for the US-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said he will serve as the godfather at the couple's wedding.</p><p>However, it was unclear where the wedding would take place. Same-sex marriage is not allowed in Puerto Rico, or in Florida, where Cruz has a home.</p><p>Cruz is preparing to fight Orlando Salido for the world featherweight title in Las Vegas this October – a year on from his public announcement that he is a \"proud gay man\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/415124692|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|55a65843358abc3f7c7114ca22aabea5a42063aa -->",

        "body":"<p>Three young Afghan women boxers risk missing an official invitation to train and fight in the UK because of \"excessive\" red tape.</p><p>Sadaf Rahimi, Fahima Mohammad and Shabnam Rahman have overcome a host of cultural and financial barriers to pursue their sport in Kabul.</p><p>They were due to visit London for their first bout with UK rivals as part of International Women's Day on Friday. Instead, they have been forced to wait for days in Delhi for paperwork that has already been approved to be \"officially processed\".</p><p>The team from Kabul has \"invited status\" and support for sports visas, but visitors from Afghanistan must get paperwork in India before they can travel to the UK.</p><p>Margaret Pope, founder of the Women in Sport Foundation which had worked to bring the Afghan boxers to the UK, said of the delay: \"It is a frustrating, 11th-hour development to a groundbreaking initiative  … to bring the women to the UK and equip them with skills and experience to take back to Afghanistan.</p><p>\"One of the justifications for the UK military involvement in Afghanistan was to help improve the terrible situation for the country's women,\" she added. \"It is therefore a bitter irony that when there is a clear opportunity to assist some of the bravest, talented and most inspiring young Afghan women, bureaucratic delays are quashing their dreams.\"</p><p>Former aid worker Melanie Brown said: \"Making Afghans who request visas travel to a third country in order to receive them and then wait weeks to hear if they have been successful could cynically be seen as a way of discouraging all those but the very wealthy from visiting the UK.</p><p>\"This is extremely frustrating, there is the considerable cost and the impracticality of staying in Delhi for weeks at a time while waiting for paperwork to be rubberstamped.\"</p><p>Rahimi, Mohammad and Rahman are due to train and attend a charity auction in London to raise money for their gym in Kabul, then travel to Bristol to be coached by Britain's first officially licensed female boxer, Jane Couch MBE.</p><p>Couch is no stranger to struggles with authorities – in 1998 she persuaded an industrial tribunal to overturn a British Boxing Board of Control ruling that had denied her a licence. The BBBC had argued that premenstrual syndrome made women too unstable to box.</p><p>After years of lobbying from British women fighters, women's boxing was officially recognised as an Olympic sport on 14 August 2009. At London 2012 there were women boxers from Kazakhstan, North Korea and Turkey, while British boxer Nicola Adams became the first woman to win an Olympic boxing gold.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405074009|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|e92415ab9e94b664e7e9a06fc5b473a5dc9984d7 -->",

        "headline":"Amir Khan's victory over Carlos Molina begins his climb back",
        "body":"<p>Amir Khan lives not just to fight another day, but another Danny Garcia. After two straight losses – the last one a devastating stoppage in the summer by the Philadelphian that cost him his world light-welterweight belts and led to his split with Freddie Roach – he survived a hat-trick ball to cut down the unbeaten Carlos Molina in a near-perfect performance.</p><p>He knew defeat would leave his career in pieces. Instead his wicked jab and at times bewildering combinations, behind an improved defence – assiduously crafted by his new trainer, Virgil Hunter – earned him a shutout on all three cards after 10 rounds. At that point the referee, Jack Reiss, inspected Molina's carved features for the fourth time and waved it over.</p><p>\"Carlos took some really good shots and he was still coming forward,\" Khan said, \"and that's when I thought I better stick to the plan. Virgil is a great trainer and I'm getting better at boxing and becoming the complete fighter. He is teaching me speed and power, when to throw the big shots. Sometimes I am too brave for my good but now I know it is better to stick to the game plan. Garcia caught me with a good shot but I will fight Danny Garcia again, anytime, anywhere.\"</p><p>Molina, battered but defiant, said: \"I don't know what happened. I couldn't pull the trigger, just couldn't get through. He was so fast and I couldn't get in because he has a long jab. I felt I connected two or three times but I wasn't in the right place to reconnect when I rocked him.\"</p><p>Khan has not boxed with such fixed discipline in one extended performance since he stopped Paulie Malignaggi in New York in 2010. That seems such a long time ago but now he has the opportunity to view 2013 with hope that was not apparent after Garcia had temporarily, at least, evicted him from the elite establishment around 10 stones inhabited by some of the most exciting fighters in the business.</p><p>Khan has to convince Showtime and his American partners, Golden Boy Promotions, not to mention Garcia and his abrasive father, Angel – who had travelled across the country to the west coast to inspect his handiwork – that he is worth a rematch.</p><p>Garcia, who has swagger where once there was untested confidence (considerably buoyed by his recent spectacular stoppage of Erik Morales) has a defence against Zab Judah in New York in February first but has indicated he would fight Khan again if he impressed tonight.</p><p>If Khan gets that gig he will be up against an opponent who has grown into the title, an unbeaten and dangerous foe. But Khan has never shied away from a challenge. He looked unusually nervous during the introductions – with good reason. His whole career was on the line.</p><p>He impressed from the opening bell, his snaking job leaving Molina's round faced visibly marked up in round one, and he only once erred \"in the pocket\", shipping a decent left hook.</p><p>But Molina, who has never been down, has an excellent pedigree (his twin brothers were both Olympians, one for Mexico, one for the United States) and he was not going to fold without fierce resistance. Although he got through with a couple of steadying left hooks in the second, he was too content to box with his face, now reddened beyond cleansing.</p><p>He was more aggressive in the third, leading with a right hook that missed, then marched Khan to the ropes, where he got slightly the better of the exchanges to edge the round, from this vantage point, anyway.</p><p>Ringside observers who have seen a lot of Molina testify to his durability and, even though coming up to 10st for the first time at this level he gave the appearance of immovable solidity. However Khan sensed him wilting a little in the fourth and, for the first time, risked an all-out assault in a blaze of unanswered blows that left his opponent bleeding heavily around the eyes.</p><p>Molina was slow off his stool for the fifth but there was still bounce in his legs as he trundled forward behind a high guard, although, pawing at the leakage around his left eye, he looked bewildered by Khan's jab.</p><p>At the halfway mark Khan had reproduced the sort of focused boxing that dazzled Garcia for two and a half rounds before a disastrous collapse; his challenge was to keep his shape and not hang his chin out as he did on that calamitous night. Molina was still competitive but Reiss took a long look at his wounds before the start of the seventh.</p><p>This was still a fight you could only watch without anxiety in a replay, knowing the result. What appeared on the scorecard like a stroll was in fact a fight loaded with possibilities. However the rebuilt Khan controlled his urge for a brawl, boxing beautifully on the outside.</p><p>After eight rounds Molina had fallen behind to the point where he needed a knockout, increasing the danger for Khan, but there was no sign of his newfound boxing shape deserting him as he moved away from Molina's cocked right.</p><p>The referee called in the ring doctor to inspect Molina's cuts before the ninth and the fighter looked relieved to get the go-ahead. Yet, even buoyed by the reprieve, he could not pierce the shield Khan had constructed behind those whirring combinations and the blood flowed like wine.</p><p>Only a mistake could turn Khan's night bad because, going into the championship rounds, he was in complete control. A bruise had grown ugly around Molina's right eye but his chin showed no sign of deterioration, even under the persistent onslaught.</p><p>But there was no more for him to sacrifice at the end of the round. Molina's father, Miguel, protested in vain. His boy had stepped up, in more ways than one, and might be better moving back to a division where he feels more comfortable.</p><p>The punch stats went overwhelmingly Khan's way: 312 of 679 thrown landing, and he took just 87 of 335 coming the other way. It was the power-punch percentage of 56 that impressed most, however: 156 from 278. That is a staggeringly good return on any fighter's effort to stop his opponent, and way too good for Molina.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401153721|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|ef7c472cd573a9849493c61cd0e8e5af24462c5b -->",

        "body":"<p>The South African boxer Corrie Sanders has died aged 46 after being shot during an armed robbery at a restaurant in Brits, near Pretoria. Sanders was one of the biggest-punching heavyweights of recent years and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xNoXYgi7o4\" title=\"Corrie Sanders fighting Wladimir Klitschko\">most famously defeated Wladimir Klitschko</a> to win the World Boxing Organisation heavyweight title in 2003.</p><p>Sanders was born in Pretoria. A talented sporting all-rounder, he played rugby and cricket as a schoolboy and later honed a golf game to near-professional standard. His impressive physique and strength, allied to a natural athleticism, helped him develop an intimidating punching power from a southpaw stance, which made him one of the most dangerous fighters of his time.</p><p>Claiming 196 wins from 200 amateur fights, he had won the South African heavyweight title in four consecutive years, from 1985 to 1988, before he moved into the professional sport. He won 42 of his 46 paid fights. Perhaps if he had moved to the US, he would have been a bigger name on the world stage. When asked why he had remained in South Africa, he said: \"I loved this country too much. It might sound strange, but I felt I had more black fans than white. Whenever I was out and about, they would stop me and want to chat. That was always very humbling.\"</p><p>With his career handled by the leading promoter Rodney Berman, Sanders rose steadily up the rankings after making his professional debut in 1989, winning his first 23 contests and becoming the South African champion in only his 11th pro fight. Wins over fringe American contenders such as Smokin' Bert Cooper, Levi Billups and Britain's <a href=\"http://www.johnnynelson.org.uk/\" title=\"Johnny Nelson\">Johnny Nelson</a> alerted the cognoscenti to the fact the he could become a potent force in the division.</p><p>His progress was slowed by a shocking second-round knockout defeat in 1994 against Nate Tubbs. But he remained undefeated thereafter until May 2000, when he lost a dramatic contest against the future champion Hasim Rahman. In the fight, televised by the American channel HBO, Sanders had Rahman down before being stopped himself in the seventh round. He was 37, and probably past his best, by the time he got his title shot fighting Klitschko for the WBO title in Hamburg in 2003.</p><p>The Ukrainian had only lost once in 41 fights and was a hot favourite to repel Sanders, who was quoted as a 40-1 outsider. But the South African produced a devastating display of power-punching to floor the champion twice in the opening round and twice more in the second when the fight ended. Ring Magazine hailed Sanders's win as their \"upset of the year\".</p><p>The following year, Sanders relinquished the then relatively lowly rated WBO belt to fight Wladimir's older brother Vitali for the World Boxing Council title, made vacant by the retirement of Lennox Lewis. This time Sanders looked to have a chance in the early rounds, especially the third when he caught Vitali with his danger punch, the left hook. But Vitali was able to withstand the pressure and went on to establish his dominance before stopping the South African in the eighth.</p><p>Sanders fought four more times before retiring, in 2008, and will be remembered as perhaps South Africa's best ever heavyweight. After moving away from boxing, he was a familiar figure at celebrity golf events and, as well as concentrating on various business interests, also worked as a motivational speaker.</p><p>He is survived by his former wife, Sunette, and a son and a daughter.</p><p>• Cornelius Johannes Sanders, boxer, born 7 January 1966; died 22 September 2012</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/396592535|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|50caa0480cd428ab068ff2e8643f37e4954df681 -->",

        "headline":"Anthony Joshua crowns Team GB's golden Olympics with 29th gold medal",
        "body":"<p>Super heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua sealed an extraordinary run of home success at the London Olympics by coming back against the reigning Olympic champion to win Team GB's 29th gold medal of the Games, just hours before the closing ceremony.</p><p>The Finchley-born fighter became the latest hero created by an Olympics that delivered 65 medals in total – the best since the first time London hosted the Games in 1908. A late run of golds from Russia in athletics, boxing, gymnastics and volleyball was not enough to deprive Great Britain of third place in the medal table.</p><p>Sam Murray won Team GB's 65th and final medal of the 2012 Games in the women's modern pentathlon on Sunday. The 22-year-old from Preston was pipped to top place by Lithuana's Laura Asadauskaite, but was still chuffed. \"I had a lot to make up on the run, I needed that,\" she said. \"I've made a few mistakes today which set me back but I came through in the end. I'm just so pleased, my legs kept running for me. Up the hills was so steep and I just kept working hard.\"</p><p>Before the Games, UK Sport, the body responsible for pouring £312m into Olympic sport over the last four years, set the target of matching the achievement in Beijing four years ago by finishing fourth. The British Olympic Association (BOA) would talk only of an aspiration of winning more medals in more sports – a landmark that was passed last week.</p><p>Overhauling the Russians in third place was considered unlikely by all but the most bullish of forecasters. BOA chairman Lord Moynihan did not believe it would be possible. \"Did I think we could beat them? Probably not. The fact we're set to is phenomenal credit to the athletes and the support of those athletes,\" he said. \"They always come on strongly. I was aware that Putin was very focused on them being better financed than ever before.\"</p><p>One of the most pleasing aspects for sports governing bodies, the BOA and the high-performance team at UK Sport has been the spread of sports that delivered medals. Of the 26 Olympic sports, 16 brought medals for the British team. While cycling, rowing and sailing continued to deliver, there was gold medal success in sports such as taekwondo, dressage and the canoe slalom for the first time.</p><p>Before the Games, both London 2012 chairman Lord Coe and International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge had highlighted the importance of \"golden moments\" that would live in memory. Alongside the achievements of Usain Bolt, the Jamaican sprint team and the record-breaking Michael Phelps, the British athletes delivered more than their fair share of moments.</p><p>Sir Chris Hoy's sixth gold broke records, Ben Ainslie's fourth gold in consecutive Games made him the most successful sailor in Olympic history and Mo Farah wrote his name in the history books by becoming the first British man to win a long distance gold since 1908 – and then repeating the feat a week later.</p><p>Anthony Joshua, who only started boxing four years ago, won Team GB's climactic gold medal on Sunday afternoon in controversial circumstances. Three points behind going into the last round against the Italian Roberto Cammarelle, he was roared on by the crowd and fought back to draw 18-18, winning gold on a countback. The furious Italian camp protested but to no avail. Earlier on Sunday Freddie Evans had to settle for silver in the welterweight category.</p><p>Joshua will now field a host of offers to turn professional, following in the footsteps of super heavyweight gold medal winners such as Lennox Lewis and Audley Harrison. Afterwards, he said: \"It's much more than a gold medal, it's a life experience.\"</p><p>Nicola Adams, who won the first ever women's boxing medal in the Olympics, said she hoped her success would inspire others. \"I'm hoping it brings more women into sport, not just boxing. That would be great for me. I was inspired by Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard,\" she said. \"To be able to get in the ring and perform like they did, it meant everything to me. To have kids in the future with a female role model to look up to would be great.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394618674|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|0c76b21304c2cc138ce37659c6c68f27db00010d -->",

        "headline":"Luke Campbell beats John Joe Nevin to claim bantamweight gold",
        "body":"<p>The Olympics have long carried a sense of grand sporting internationalism. But on Saturday the ExCeL arena produced a coming-together of a more parochial nature as British and Irish boxers Luke Campbell of Hull and John Joe Nevin of Mullingar fought for the men's bantam gold before a thrillingly loud and agreeably garrulous UK-Irish crowd. This was not so much ping-pong diplomacy as fists across the water, a meeting of two nations with a rather mixed history of relations, sporting and otherwise, but combining here under the Olympic boxing banner to create another delightfully arresting tableau at these Games.</p><p>In the event it was Campbell who took the gold, producing a display of controlled long range aggression to secure Team GB's 28th gold medal of these rather giddy Games. Medals aside, this was also an occasion of rather deafening sporting kinship inside the ExCel arena. Campbell is also of Irish descent — his family know Nevin's family — and as it had been for the Anglo-Irish bout between Katie Taylor and Natasha Jones earlier in the week, the arena was packed with a boisterous and celebratory crowd, the seats spotted with emerald green Irish football shirts and the entry of both men greeted with a wall of noise that seemed to rattle the 9,000 plastic seats. The cheers for Nevin were as loud as those for the home fighter; for Ireland this has already been a fine Olympics. Five medals, four in boxing, is an excellent return.</p><p>Not that the crowd were particularly concerned with sporting history as Nevin and Campbell set about each other, Campbell the taller man in blue landing some early blows and taking the first round 5-3. The second round went to Nevin, who produced some raucously received combinations to shade it 5-4, before Campbell sealed the fight, even producing a knockdown in the third. The cheers for Campbell were vast, as they were for Nevin at the end of a bout capped by a lingering embrace between the two corners.</p><p>All in all it was another triumphant night for the ExCel, which has been one of the surprise successes of these Games, a multi-roomed docklands hangar of impossibly vast scale, host to more Olympic events under one roof than any other venue in Olympic history. It is not to be tackled lightly: in the first week the venue broadcast manager wore a pedometer and discovered he'd walked eight miles by the end of the day. The boxing concludes here on Sunday with two British gold medal hopes in the ring. They will do well to match the peculiar clamour of Campbell's big night.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394592285|2013-10-17T12:53:00Z|453f8cbd6a82e7454253c17c26577886001ad201 -->",
