        "body":"<p>With its excellent health care, superb state-sponsored child-minding provision, and greener-than-Kermit environmental policies, Sweden is practically a metonym for social progressiveness; the canary in the coalmine for putting politically correct policies into practice. It therefore comes as no surprise that cinemas in Stockholm<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/swedish-cinemas-bechdel-test-films-gender-bias\"> are the first in the world to make gender representation a factor in an unofficial ratings system</a>, pledging to give an A rating to films that pass the Bechdel test. So should feminists and other folk of a liberal minded persuasion round the world be throwing their copies of The Second Sex in the air with joy, and blessing the Swedes' hand-knitted socks?</p><p>The Bechdel test was invented in the mid-1980s when Alison Bechdel's comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For featured a character who refused to watch a movie that didn't have at least two women who talk to each other about something besides a man. It's a notion rather beautiful in its stringent simplicity, which is why it's stuck around, come to be taken so seriously, and even applied to forms of media other than film. Bechdel actually introduced it in wry light-hearted fashion, via two women debating in the street what to go see at the cinema. The punchline was that only film that the character who proposed the theory saw as qualifying was Ridley Scott's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/75860/alien\">Alien</a>, which was five or six years old at the time the strip was published.</p><p>Today, if sticking to the letter of the Bechdel test, there wouldn't be much more at regular multiplexes for the characters to choose from, especially given the dominance now of effects-driven, male-demographic-skewed blockbusters. Ellen Tejle, the director of one of the four cinemas in Stockholm to adopt the Bechdel-driven rating system, said that the campaign has been aimed at opening viewers' eyes to how rarely they see \"a female superhero or a female professor or person who makes it through exciting challenges and masters them,\" and that \"the goal is to see more female stories and perspectives on cinema screens.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421823347'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2013/9/20/1379685121976/Julia-Louis-Dreyfus-and-C-010.jpg' alt='Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Catherine Keener in Enough Said' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A possible fail … Catherine Keener and Julia Louis-Dreyfus talk about James Gandolfini in Nicole Holofcener's Enough Said </figcaption></figure><p><br />Well, good for her and the other theatre managers, and good for the Swedish Film Institute for supporting the initiative if this means getting audiences to think more about how feminine perspectives and relationships are missing from so many movies. I'd like it more if they were highlighting the shocking paucity of female directors working today, down, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/19/women-directors_n_3118488.html\">according to a 2012 report</a>, to only 5% of active directors in Hollywood, a 2% reduction on 2010, but you can't win 'em all.</p><p>However, I'm not so sure if I feel so supportive of TV channel Viasat Film. Their idea of promoting Tejle and Co's Bechdel test-initiative is to have a \"Super Sunday\" on 17 November, showing surefire-ratings earner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142857/hunger-games\">The Hunger Games</a> (fair enough), the loathsome Margaret Thatcher biopic whitewash <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140396/iron-lady\">The Iron Lady</a>, and Oliver Stone's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146822/savages\">Savages</a>, not exactly a woman-centric film even if it does technically pass the Bechdel test. Maybe any publicity is good publicity – but really? Is that the best they could do?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421823348'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/20/1382269995314/Saving-Mr-Banks-008.jpg' alt='Saving Mr Banks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Bowing to the woman, but just the one of them, so another likely Bechdel dud … Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson in Saving Mr Banks</figcaption></figure><p>Judging by the comments beneath the original article in the Guardian, this kind of affirmative-action programming still has the power to get people's knickers in a serious twist, provoking howls of fury about the \"nanny state\" (the Swedish government is not making this a law, guys – it's just a few cinemas creating publicity) and how flawed the test is if it \"fails\" films like the Lord of the Rings cycle, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/57129/shawshank.redemption\">The Shawshank Redemption</a> or, oh God the pity, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.</p><p>Personally, I too have reservations about the validity of Bechdel test, if we're going to take it so seriously, because it would \"fail\" some of the best films I've seen this year at festivals like the London film festival. Jonathan Glazer's magnificent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156833/under-the-skin\">Under the Skin</a> probably wouldn't come up to snuff, given Scarlett Johansson's character is practically the only woman in it, and yet it's a film deeply concerned with female power and agency that in its sly metaphoric way says way more about gender than, say, The Iron Lady. Nicole Holofcener's acclaimed bittersweet examination of a love-triangle <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156988/enough-said\">Enough Said</a> might fail on the grounds that the two women in it mostly talk about men. Even the relentlessly slushy but effective <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156373/saving-mr-banks\">Saving Mr Banks</a>, which stars Emma Thompson as children's author PL Travers locking horns with Tom Hanks' Walt Disney over adapting Mary Poppins, would also fail, even though it features one of the stronger female protagonists of the year. At least the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148737/frances-ha\">Frances Ha</a> would be safe.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421815984|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|a46773fc546fec3c7287e11b95cc54e25330d63e -->",

        "body":"<p>There are chick flicks and there are chick flicks. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/sep/13/julie-julia-review\">Julie &amp; Julia</a> is a chick flick. But then again, it isn't. Unusually, the two protagonists are women but the focus of the film isn't shoes, weddings or men. Meryl Streep stars as legendary American chef Julia Child, the woman who brought French cooking to a post-war nation fuelled by tinned food. Her weighty tome Mastering the Art of French Cooking, published in 1961, may not be as well-known in the UK, but she was the Delia of her day. The other half of Nora Ephron's film focuses on the modern-day blog of writer Julie Powell, who set herself the goal of cooking all 524 recipes from Child's book in one year as a means of finding herself.</p><p>No shoes in sight (unless you're talking chouxs). The women in this film, particularly Child, have conversations about cooking, and the purpose of life, and their careers, and creativity, and just the general day-to-day back-and-forth that makes up most female discourse. In other words, they pass the Bechdel Test. What's that? Well, back in the early 80s, US cartoonist Alison Bechdel created a comic strip called <a href=\"http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/\">Dykes to Watch Out For</a>, which gave lesbians a rare voice in popular culture. In 1985, one of the characters in the strip announced that she would only watch a movie if it met the following three requirements: (1) it has two women in it, (2) who talk to each other, (3) about something beside a man.</p><p>This became known as the <a href=\"http://thebechdeltest.blogspot.com/\">Bechdel Test</a>. These are three seemingly simple requirements, yet the movies that tick all of the boxes are few and far between. Meryl Streep's character in Julie &amp; Julia passes with flying colours.</p><p>But what other movies would get a gold star? Silkwood, Sunshine Cleaning, Boys Don't Cry, Girl, Interrupted and Persepolis immediately came to mind, but then I hit a wall. I sent an email out to friends asking for their suggestions, but the pickings were scrappy: \"Does Juno count, given that she talks a lot about abortion?\" or \"Would Sex and the City pass? There's that one scene where Charlotte has a bad-water-induced 'accident' in Mexico\", are just a sample.</p><p>And for the past few days I've conducted worrisome dialogues in my head along the lines of \"What about <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/\">Alien</a>? Didn't Sigourney Weaver have a conversation with that other woman about guns and airlocks, or am I thinking of Battlestar Galactica?\" And \"In that opening sequence in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/\">Kill Bill: Vol 1</a>, didn't Uma Thurman and Vivica A Fox talk about something other than a man while they were beating each other's brains out?\"</p><p>Of course, you could argue that it doesn't matter if a film passes the test as long as it's entertaining. Bechdel's comic strip had a feminist agenda, so the fact that the Julia Child character in Julie &amp; Julia focuses on something as housewifely as cooking could be seen as a black mark against the film – but at least there's an attempt to show a woman who is determined, three-dimensional and creative. Scanning this year's studio-hyped female star vehicles is disappointing to say the least: The Proposal, The Ugly Truth, Bride Wars, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IeXqvFR6HI\">He's Just Not That Into You</a> and Love Happens are all chick flicks in the purest sense. </p><p>Where are the films starring women who aren't fretting about getting/marrying/understanding a man? The major studios still seem to shy away from anything that takes a woman out of a non-threatening role. Should we expect more from our movies? It's been 20 years since we had our first female prime minister, but not a lot has changed when it comes to depicting the modern woman on celluloid. Or maybe that's because even though it's 2009 women still like to blither on about men, and are happy to go and see movies where interchangeable yet gorgeously sculpted movie stars blither on about men? Of course, now I've researched it, I've come up with a much longer list of films that pass the Bechdel Test – but that would be no fun for you. How many can you think of?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/353085061|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|d39ed44f0b039335923057ba5fe07f13e0005d34 -->",

Tomorrow is also one of the biggest film-going days of the year in the US, since many families have traveled to be with their loved ones and need to get out of the house for a few hours. What better place to go than a movie theatre? </p><p>Further, this coming weekend is the beginning of what is the biggest money-making five-week period throughout the world at the cinemas. With that in mind, I am sharing this video that describes the Bechdel test. <br /> <br />The Bechdel Test is a simple way to gauge the active presence of female characters in Hollywood films and to judge just how well-rounded and complete those roles are. It was created by Allison Bechdel in her comic strip <em>Dykes to Watch Out For</em> in 1985. It is astonishing the number of popular movies that can't pass this simple test. It demonstrates how little women's complex and interesting lives are underrepresented or non existent in the film industry. We have jobs, creative projects, friendships and struggles among many other things that are actually interesting in our lives... so Hollywood, start writing about it!</p><p>What movies have you seen recently? Did they pass the Bechdel test?

        "headline":"Are You My Mother? by Alison Bechdel – review",
        "body":"<p>If any kind of human relationship can be called typically baroque, it's that between a woman and her mother. Prudent men regard the intricacies of this terrain with awe. Even in fairly tranquil mother-daughter bonds there are flourishes of longing, resentment and tenderness that no sensible person would ever try to chart.</p><p>Alison Bechdel is not a sensible person, as her alter egos – first in her comic strip, <a href=\"http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Dykes to Watch Out For</em></a>, more recently in her celebrated graphic memoir <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/comics/9780224080514/fun-home\" title=\"\"><em>Fun Home</em></a> and this sequel, <em>Are You My Mother?</em> – demonstrate. The cartoon version of Bechdel is boyish and fretful, a sort of lesbian Woody Allen, equally prone to seizure by doubt or by the giddy, centrifugal force of some idea. She is comical and, as a therapist depicted in <em>Are You My Mother?</em> tells her, adorable, a quality that allows her to carry readers where they might not otherwise be keen to go.</p><p><em>Fun Home</em> described Bechdel's rather gothic childhood in small-town Pennsylvania, where her father worked as both high-school English teacher and funeral home director. He devoted most of his time, however, to lovingly restoring and furnishing the family's enormous old Victorian house. After Bechdel came out to her parents at 19, she learned her father had a history of secret homosexual affairs, the revelation of which may have been behind his death in a traffic accident a few weeks later. Now, <em>Are You My Mother?</em> scrutinises Bechdel's relationship with her other parent, a woman not only still alive but also on hand to offer comment. (She doesn't think much of memoir as a genre: \"I just don't know why everyone has to write about themselves.\")</p><p>Like all of Bechdel's work, <em>Are You My Mother?</em> is furiously literary, full of citations and quotations, and crafty symbolic parallels to the books its author is so often depicted reading with furrowed brow. The presiding genii of this particular work include <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/mar/30/adrienne-rich\" title=\"\">Adrienne Rich</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/sigmundfreud\" title=\"\">Sigmund Freud</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/may/31/alice-miller-obituary\" title=\"\">Alice Miller</a> and, above all, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/virginiawoolf\" title=\"\">Virginia Woolf</a> and the British psychoanalyst <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Winnicott\" title=\"\">DW&nbsp;Winnicott</a>. (\"I want him to be my mother,\" cartoon Alison says.) The concepts Winnicott contributed to object relations theory (the \"good enough\" mother, transitional objects, the true and false self, etc) provide themes for each of the book's seven chapters, but its swirling, circular structure derives from Woolf.</p><p>As Bechdel recollects her childhood, her love affairs, her interactions with two different therapists and, throughout it all, her efforts to get the recognition she has always craved from her mother, her account loops in and out of itself chronologically. The key image of <em>Are&nbsp;You My Mother?</em> comes toward the end of the book, but is pulled from the beginning of Bechdel's life, all the way back in her father's monstrous mansion. Two mirrors faced each other in the foyer, creating an infinite regression of images of whoever happened to be standing in the little room.</p><p>Winnicott held that infant and mother regard each other as mirror image – a replica of the self that is at the same time inaccessible. Bechdel feels that until she can get her mother \"out of my head\" the two women can never truly know each other, and that an exorcism of this kind is exactly what Woolf achieved by writing <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100101.txt\" title=\"\"><em>To the Lighthouse</em></a>. Woolf got the idea for that novel while \"walking round Tavistock Square\". The young Winnicott's analyst had his office a block away. Bechdel imagines the two crossing paths on that very day in a beautiful series of pages that show just how masterfully she has developed her ability to fuse drawing and diagram in a&nbsp;visual poetics of thought.</p><p>Bechdel's superbly flexible and eloquent images have only got better since <em>Fun Home</em>, which is fortunate given that <em>Are You My Mother?</em> contains some dramatically unpromising material. In one of her paroxysms of self-doubt, Bechdel quotes a passage from Woolf where the novelist notes she has opted to \"banish the soul\" from her diary. Even if she were to set out to do otherwise, Woolf writes, \"what happens is that, as usual, I'm going to write about the soul &amp; life breaks in.\"</p><p>A lot of <em>Are You My Mother?,</em> on the other hand, is \"about the soul\" or, as Bechdel puts it, \"information about my internal life\". <em>Fun Home</em> was about a man so intent on squelching his internal life that it backed up and overflowed in the form of decor, a tortured soul made manifest in flocked wallpaper and carved mahogany. The soul, it seems, is as likely to break into life as the other way round.</p><p>It's not that Bechdel's revelations in <em>Are You My Mother?</em> are less significant than those in <em>Fun Home</em>. In fact, they are more profound. Still, in the realm of art, a grotesque Victorian pile fit for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Havisham\" title=\"\">Miss Havisham</a> is always going to register more persuasively than lines such as, \"This 'mind-psyche' that takes over and replaces the mother is a version of the compliant false self.\" There's a bit too much therapy in <em>Are You My Mother?.</em> Psychology boils away the particulars of individual experience to arrive at abstract generalities. It may get at the same truths that art does, but&nbsp;the trip isn't nearly as much fun.</p><p>• Laura Miller's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780316017657\" title=\"\"><em>The Magician's Book</em></a><em>: A Skeptic's Adventures in Narnia</em> is published by Little, Brown.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/390564935|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|4616fc4d0627ba4f63c6ac39faa39f93c33835fd -->",

        "headline":"Cinema programmers beware: feminist films can flunk the Bechdel test",
        "body":"<p>With its excellent health care, superb state-sponsored child-minding provision, and greener-than-Kermit environmental policies, Sweden is practically a metonym for social progressiveness; the canary in the coalmine for putting politically correct policies into practice. It therefore comes as no surprise that cinemas in Stockholm<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/swedish-cinemas-bechdel-test-films-gender-bias\"> are the first in the world to make gender representation a factor in an unofficial ratings system</a>, pledging to give an A rating to films that pass the Bechdel test. So should feminists and other folk of a liberal minded persuasion round the world be throwing their copies of The Second Sex in the air with joy, and blessing the Swedes' hand-knitted socks?</p><p>The Bechdel test was invented in the mid-1980s when Alison Bechdel's comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For featured a character who refused to watch a movie that didn't have at least two women who talk to each other about something besides a man. It's a notion rather beautiful in its stringent simplicity, which is why it's stuck around, come to be taken so seriously, and even applied to forms of media other than film. Bechdel actually introduced it in wry light-hearted fashion, via two women debating in the street what to go see at the cinema. The punchline was that only film that the character who proposed the theory saw as qualifying was Ridley Scott's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/75860/alien\">Alien</a>, which was five or six years old at the time the strip was published.</p><p>Today, if sticking to the letter of the Bechdel test, there wouldn't be much more at regular multiplexes for the characters to choose from, especially given the dominance now of effects-driven, male-demographic-skewed blockbusters. Ellen Tejle, the director of one of the four cinemas in Stockholm to adopt the Bechdel-driven rating system, said that the campaign has been aimed at opening viewers' eyes to how rarely they see \"a female superhero or a female professor or person who makes it through exciting challenges and masters them,\" and that \"the goal is to see more female stories and perspectives on cinema screens.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421823347'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2013/9/20/1379685121976/Julia-Louis-Dreyfus-and-C-010.jpg' alt='Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Catherine Keener in Enough Said' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A possible fail … Catherine Keener and Julia Louis-Dreyfus talk about James Gandolfini in Nicole Holofcener's Enough Said </figcaption></figure><p><br />Well, good for her and the other theatre managers, and good for the Swedish Film Institute for supporting the initiative if this means getting audiences to think more about how feminine perspectives and relationships are missing from so many movies. I'd like it more if they were highlighting the shocking paucity of female directors working today, down, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/19/women-directors_n_3118488.html\">according to a 2012 report</a>, to only 5% of active directors in Hollywood, a 2% reduction on 2010, but you can't win 'em all.</p><p>However, I'm not so sure if I feel so supportive of TV channel Viasat Film. Their idea of promoting Tejle and Co's Bechdel test-initiative is to have a \"Super Sunday\" on 17 November, showing surefire-ratings earner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142857/hunger-games\">The Hunger Games</a> (fair enough), the loathsome Margaret Thatcher biopic whitewash <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140396/iron-lady\">The Iron Lady</a>, and Oliver Stone's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146822/savages\">Savages</a>, not exactly a woman-centric film even if it does technically pass the Bechdel test. Maybe any publicity is good publicity – but really? Is that the best they could do?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421823348'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/20/1382269995314/Saving-Mr-Banks-008.jpg' alt='Saving Mr Banks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Bowing to the woman, but just the one of them, so another likely Bechdel dud … Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson in Saving Mr Banks</figcaption></figure><p>Judging by the comments beneath the original article in the Guardian, this kind of affirmative-action programming still has the power to get people's knickers in a serious twist, provoking howls of fury about the \"nanny state\" (the Swedish government is not making this a law, guys – it's just a few cinemas creating publicity) and how flawed the test is if it \"fails\" films like the Lord of the Rings cycle, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/57129/shawshank.redemption\">The Shawshank Redemption</a> or, oh God the pity, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.</p><p>Personally, I too have reservations about the validity of Bechdel test, if we're going to take it so seriously, because it would \"fail\" some of the best films I've seen this year at festivals like the London film festival. Jonathan Glazer's magnificent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156833/under-the-skin\">Under the Skin</a> probably wouldn't come up to snuff, given Scarlett Johansson's character is practically the only woman in it, and yet it's a film deeply concerned with female power and agency that in its sly metaphoric way says way more about gender than, say, The Iron Lady. Nicole Holofcener's acclaimed bittersweet examination of a love-triangle <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156988/enough-said\">Enough Said</a> might fail on the grounds that the two women in it mostly talk about men. Even the relentlessly slushy but effective <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156373/saving-mr-banks\">Saving Mr Banks</a>, which stars Emma Thompson as children's author PL Travers locking horns with Tom Hanks' Walt Disney over adapting Mary Poppins, would also fail, even though it features one of the stronger female protagonists of the year. At least the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148737/frances-ha\">Frances Ha</a> would be safe.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421815984|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|a46773fc546fec3c7287e11b95cc54e25330d63e -->",

        "body":"<p>Cinemas in Sweden have instituted a classification system for films, based not on the violence or sexual content they contain, but on how sexist they are.</p><p>To be awarded the highest A rating for gender equality, a film must pass the so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2010/nov/24/2\" title=\"\">Bechdel test</a>: the movie must contain at least two named women characters who talk to each other about something other than a man.</p><p>The test – whose origins are in a 1985 storyline in Alison Bechdel's comic strip <a href=\"http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/\" title=\"\">Dykes to Watch Out For</a> – may sound like an incredibly low bar. But an alarming number of films showing in cinemas fail to reach it. \"The entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, all Star Wars movies, The Social Network, Pulp Fiction and all but one of the Harry Potter movies fail this test,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/swedish-cinemas-bechdel-test-films-gender-bias\" title=\"\">said Ellen Tejle</a>, who runs Stockholm's Bio Rio, one of a number of independent cinemas that has instituted the classification.</p><p>To that one might add a number of current releases and Oscar contenders: Alfonso Cuarón's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/04/alfonso-cuaron-gravity\" title=\"\">Gravity</a>, despite its starring role for Sandra Bullock; Lee Daniels' The Butler, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/28/barack-obama-oscar-tipped-drama-butler\" title=\"\">about</a> a presidential servant and the civil rights movement; and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/20/captain-phillips-review-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">Captain Phillips</a>, Paul Greengrass's piracy drama, which involves an all-male gang of pirates attacking an all-male shipping crew. The WikiLeaks film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/151168/fifth-estate\" title=\"\">Fifth Estate</a>, which is partly set in the offices of the Guardian, fails the test.</p><p>Oddly enough, Thor (in which Chris Hemsworth plays the Nordic god, come to save us all from Christopher Ecclestone) does pass, since it features a scene in which Natalie Portman and Kat Dennings discuss nuclear physics.</p><p>But some classics fail to meet the test, with the Shawshank Redemption, which regularly tops viewers' polls, falling foul of the Bechdel criteria.</p><p>Claire Binns, director of programming and exhibition for the UK-based Picturehouse chain, said the classification idea would not be taken up in her cinemas anytime soon, but it certainly highlighted a real problem – a \"criminal\" lack of parts for older women in cinema, a desperate lack of women working behind the camera and a failure of the film industry to bring to the screen \"women with real stories – women that aren't just there to be killed in reel three or raped in reel four\".</p><p>She said that she \"did her utmost\" to seek out for her chain films with strong female stories, mentioning the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/bright-days-ahead/5060138.article\" title=\"\">Bright Days Ahead</a>, directed by Marion Vernoux and starring French actor Fanny Ardant as a dentist embarking on an affair with a younger man.</p><p>She also said Picturehouse had decided not to show the violent, macho cop drama The Sweeney on London screens, a film \"which I found quite offensive\".</p><p>In Sweden the experiment is reflective of a much more ardent debate on gender equality than in Britain or North America, said Sofia Nyblom, a Swedish journalist and arts consultant. It comes against the background of the Swedish film institute's <a href=\"http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Statistics/Gender-equality/\" title=\"\">gender equality directive</a>, which states that 50% of its funding should go to women filmmakers.</p><p>In other artforms, too, patience was running out with gender inequality, she said, citing <a href=\"http://kvast.org/in-english/\" title=\"\">Kvast</a>, a body set up to agitate for better representation of women composers by performing groups and broadcasters. \"I don't think this will attract sneers,\" she said.</p><p>But the Bechdel test is, some argue, a crude way of assessing films for gender equality. <a href=\"http://www.surrey.ac.uk/schoolofarts/people/complete_staff_list/bella_honess_roe/\" title=\"\">Dr Bella Honess Roe</a>, lecturer in film studies at Surrey University, pointed out that The Hurt Locker would not pass the test, though \"it was a watershed moment for women directors when Kathryn Bigelow won an Oscar for it\".</p><p>Films that are, arguably, problematic in other ways, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/27/the-help-film-review\" title=\"\">The Help</a>, which was criticised for its race politics, would pass, she added. \"If we are going to classify for gender equality then surely we would have to examine class, race, ethnicity and sexuality bias,\" she said.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/clio-barnard\" title=\"\">Clio Barnard</a>, acclaimed as one today's most exciting British film-makers, notes that her most recent film, The Selfish Giant, with three male protagonists, fails the test. So does her debut feature The Arbor (on a formal technicality: its two main characters are both women, but they never speak to each other). \"It's a good thing if it raises the question,\" she said. \"But I'd like to have a discussion about changing the rules.\"</p><p>A women's viewpoint behind the camera was at least as important as the characters on screen, she said – recalling her excitement at seeing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/clio-barnard\" title=\"\">Andrea Arnold</a>'s debut feature Red Road, and its \"brilliant exploration of female sexual desire\".</p><p>Melissa Silverstein, founder and editor of the <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/\" title=\"\">Women and Hollywood</a> website, acknowledged the crudeness of test (\"it doesn't tell you whether it's a good film\"). But it is at least presenting information that can contribute to a necessary debate, she said. \"It would be great if our culture reflected who we were and didn't have to seek out information about whether we are included.\"</p><p>And it matters, said <a href=\"http://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/2318/people/people.html\" title=\"\">Kate Gerova</a>, the director of the Bird's Eye film festival, which screens work by women filmmakers. \"We make sense of ourselves through cinema,\" she said. \"Its first principle is one of identification. How you make sense of who you are, where you are in the world – we do this through cinema.\" There are plenty, it seems, who are fatigued by watching films, in the words of Honess Roe, about \"men running around blowing each other up while women sit about in inappropriate clothes, waiting to be rescued.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421853976|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|aee113cb065b59f72c56fb379ef165ea0bb12acf -->",
