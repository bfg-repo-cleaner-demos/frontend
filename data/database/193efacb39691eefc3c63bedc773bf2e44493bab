Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In my last statement I informed the committee that I am frequently reported to various authorities. I thought it worth clarifying that this has been as a result of my own campaign to reduce the upper limit at which abortion takes place from twenty four to twenty weeks.</p> <p>The purpose of the reporting, on the basis of spurious claims, is to undermine my credibility and to distract and preoccupy both me and my office from the issue I have pursued since I became an MP.</p> <p>Following the reporting to the police I had need to instruct a solicitor as the investigating officers would not discuss the case with me directly—even though the Standards Commissioner had investigated the very same complaint and had made no finding against me.</p> <p>The bill was in fact, &pound;67,000 not &pound;62,000 as I quoted. The House of Commons legal services department investigated whether or not there was insurance provision available to cover the bill as it had been incurred wholly and directly as a result of my role as an MP.</p> <p>I was informed via a letter from Michael Carpenter of legal services who provided me with assistance that, following his own investigations of various provisions that he thought may assist, there was no such help available and that the obligation to pay the bill was mine alone.</p> <p>As a single parent with financial responsibilities for a disabled ex husband, an elderly mother and a child in full time education, I faced the possibility of bankruptcy or finding a way to pay the bill.</p> <p>This is the initial impetus that drove me to undertake media work.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280f123e4b0f37bee4ff4ea\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T15:05:03.409Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In the course of the inquiry into her I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here earning, <strong>Nadine Dorries</strong>, the Conservative MP, threatened to sue Kathryn Hudson, the parliamentary commission.</p> <p>Here's the threat.

I will not tolerate that or any report which invokes libellous negative coverage against me as a result and will not hesitate to pursue you personally should that be the case.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>In its report, the Commons standards committee said the accusations made by Dorries were &quot;unacceptable&quot;.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280eb5de4b0f37bee4ff4e1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T14:48:00.401Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Nadine Dorries</strong>, the Conservative MP, has been ordered to apologise to the Commons for failing to declare how much she earned for her appearance on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here in the register of members' interests. That's the conclusion of<a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmstnprv/806/80602.htm\"> a report from the Commons standards committee. </a>An investigation by Kathryn Hudson, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, also found that she failed to properly comply with the investigation into her.</p> <p>Here's the conclusion from the committee's report.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The House's Code of Conduct and disciplinary system depend on Members being prepared to explain their conduct, to submit to public scrutiny and where necessary, to respond to the Commissioner's inquiries. We recommend that Ms Dorries</p> <ul> <li>register all payments in respect of her employment, whether or not they have been channelled through Averbrook Ltd or any other third party and</li> <li>apologise to the House by way of a Personal Statement.</li> </ul> <p>We expect Ms Dorries to consult the Registrar in person about the detail of her Register entry within 21 days of publication of this Report. We will monitor Ms Dorries's compliance and will recommend further action if necessary.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>The report also reveals that, at a late stage in the inquiry, Dorries said she would declaring gross earnings of &pound;142,000, and a profit of &pound;82,000, in the register. This seems to be money paid into a company, Averbrook, for her media work.</p> <p>And here's an excerpt from Hudson's report (published as an appendix to the main report).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have offered Ms Dorries several opportunities to answer the questions I have put to her and I have reminded her of her obligation under the Code of Conduct to cooperate with my inquiry. It would have been open to her, if she could not herself provide the evidence I sought, to authorise ITV or her agent to do so. I note that the Committee on Standards and Privileges, reporting in 2010 on an inquiry into Ms Dorries' conduct, endorsed the then Commissioner's view that Ms Dorries had taken too long to provide evidence to the Commissioner and concluded that &quot;that prompt, full and open responses to the Commissioner's inquiries are of great importance&quot;&nbsp;I am sorry that on this occasion Ms Dorries has chosen not to co-operate with my inquiry and I accordingly conclude that she is in breach of the Code of Conduct in this respect.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-20a97918-89d2-45a4-86fb-0f6ef1b996f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/11/1384181273468/715da018-3373-4add-b1e5-7c782791273e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nadine Dorries appearing in I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Nadine Dorries appearing in I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.

(See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/11/sir-john-major-attacks-dominance-of-privately-educated-elite-politics-live-blog#block-5280c588e4b055987af67745\">12.50pm).</a></p> <p><strong>Paul Nuttall</strong>, Ukip's deputy leader, has put out<a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/newsroom/news/1002-john-major-ignores-the-grammar-school-elephant-in-the-room\"> a statement saying that the decline of grammar schools is to blame </a>and saying that Major should blame Labour and the Tories for what they did in government.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a former grammar school boy himself, I find it flabbergasting that John Major can seriously slam the last Labour government for overseeing the decline of social mobility in Britain. After all, David Cameron and the Tories are as opposed to new grammar schools as Labour.</p> <p>The days of Tory Leaders like John Major and Margaret Thatcher are long gone. It isn't hard to see why. The abolition of selective education in Britain has been a hammer blow to the prospects of working class kids.</p> <p>Until we see a grammar school back in every town and city across the UK, Britain's shocking lack of social mobility will go on. It is as simple as that.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10441029/Sir-John-Major-attack-on-Britains-privileged-governing-class-the-speech-transcript.html\">A full text of Major's speech is now on the Telegraph website.</a></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/mccluskey-unite-will-never-be-browbeaten-by-crosby-cameron-or-the-daily-mail/\">• Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has said that his union will not abandon the &quot;Leverage&quot; protest tactics that have been condemned by David Cameron and papers like the Daily Mail. </a></strong>The attacks on the union showed it was making a difference, he said. But he also said the union was being misrepresented.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every day we read statements and press articles about Unite which do not come within hailing distance of the truth.</p> <p>This shows one thing above all: Unite is making a difference. We have served notice on the establishment that fighting trade unionism is back - and the elite don't like it ...</p> <p>Among the many caricatures of Unite painted in recent weeks is the one that we have no strings to our bow except confrontation. That is not the reality of course. Look at the motor industry - at JLR, Vauxhall, Toyota, Nissan and elsewhere. We have had difficult negotiations, but collaborated with responsible employers not just to protect existing jobs but to secure additional investment which can guarantee skilled manufacturing jobs into the future.</p> <p>It is ironic that when David Cameron praises the work of the Automotive Council in reviving the motor industry, he is also praising the work of Unite members, Unite representatives. I guess Lynton Crosby hasn’t explained that to him.</p> <p>And what is true in motors is true across industry. We are not toy town revolutionaries. We know that most of the time most workers want a decent relationship with their employer, based on mutual respect, and that they expect their union to work in that spirit.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• Theresa May, the home secretary, has said the BBC's dominance on the internet is damaging local newspapers.</strong> She made the comments in a speech to the Society of Editors' annual conference. Local newspapers were&nbsp;having &quot;a particularly hard time&quot;, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That's partly been the result of the BBC's dominant position on the internet and its ability to subsidise the provision of internet news using the licence fee. This makes it enormously difficult for local newspapers to compete. If the BBC can, as they do, provide all the locally significant news, what is left to motivate the local media to buy a paper? It's destroying local newspapers and could eventually happen to national newspapers as well.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/11/taxman-minimum-wage-spot-checks\">• HM Revenue and Customers has warned firms who have advertised placements for unpaid internships that they could be &quot;publicly named and shamed&quot; and may be liable for a &pound;5,000 fine if they are found to be in breach of national minimum wage laws.</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/appointment-of-uk-non-resident-charge-daffaires-to-iran\">• William Hague has appointed a&nbsp;non-resident charg&eacute;s d’affaires to Iran. </a></strong>Ajay Sharma, previously head of the Foreign Office's Iran department, has been appointed to the non-resident post.&nbsp;Hague said this was a move towards improving bilateral relationships.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T14:16:08.746Z\">at 2.16pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d4fce4b055987af6775a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:04:26.762Z\">1.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Danny Alexander</strong>, the Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, has come out in support of Sir John Major.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dannyalexander/statuses/399864198387482624\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Agree with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Major&amp;src=hash\">#Major</a> that corridors of power should reflect society. &pound;2.5bn pupil premium helps every child get the best start <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fairersociety&amp;src=hash\">#fairersociety</a></p>— Danny Alexander (@dannyalexander) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannyalexander/statuses/399864198387482624\">November 11, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>He sounds more supportive of Major than Number 10.

(Major seems to think where you come from does count, because that is an indicator of social mobility.) But the spokesman also stressed Cameron's commitment to social mobility. Cameron described this as &quot;building an aspiration nation&quot;, the spokesman said. &quot;What the prime minister is saying is that we need to unleash and unlock promise.&quot; The government was doing this in various ways, for example by raising standards and imposing greater rigour in the education system, the spokesman added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What people say around the breakfast table in the morning, what they really want to know is that the government has policies to ensure that their kids can fulfil their talents and ambitions. That is the important thing.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• Downing Street confirmed <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/046274a2-47ce-11e3-9398-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz2kKfy05gk\">the Financial Times story saying Cameron is taking a close interest in the NHS's preparations for winter.</a></strong> &quot;It's a very important issue,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;You would expect the government to be very focused on it.&quot; He also said that the practice of putting private hospitals on standby in case they were needed had been going on for years.</p> <p><strong>• William Hague, the foreign secretary, is giving a statement in the Commons on Iran and Syria at 3.30pm.</strong> Downing Street said that Cameron does not think France is to blame for<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24895911\"> the failure of the P5+1 to reach an agreement with Iran over its nuclear energy programme at the weekend.</a></p> <p><strong>• Number 10 said that Cameron &quot;understands the concerns&quot; that people have about the premium rate charges people have to pay if when calling government helplines.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24888608\">The public accounts committee has criticised these charges in a report today.</a> The spokesman said the government was looking at this problem. Charges for people using bereavement services was a particular concern, he said.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• Downing Street reaffirmed its commitment to consider the law on protests in the light of Unite's use of &quot;Leverage&quot; tactics that can involve demonstrations outside people's home.</strong><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2480643/Labours-Unite-paymasters-intimidated-managers-oil-refinery-battle.html\">These tactics have been critically reported in the Daily Mail.</a> At PMQs recently Cameron condemned these tactics and said the government would consider whether there was a case for legislation. <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/mccluskey-unite-will-never-be-browbeaten-by-crosby-cameron-or-the-daily-mail/\">In a statement today the Unite leader Len McCluskey has vowed not to back down. </a>This is what McCluskey said.:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The protests which the Daily Mail has targeted are ... as old as democracy – free speech and the right to peacefully demonstrate. For that, our members have been described as “thugs”. We will see what the law makes of that phrase.</p> <p>It is, at any event, a lie. These protests were peaceful, mostly silent, and of course had nothing to do with intimidating families, children, or anyone. In more than two years, we have not had a single complaint about our members’ conduct on such protests, nor a single police charge.</p> <p>So let me send one clear message to the Daily Mail: This union is not retreating from leverage, or from the right to peaceful protest.</p> <p>And we are not taking lessons in proper conduct from a paper which, from its support for fascism before the war to its smearing of Ralph Miliband today, represents a stream of poison in British society.</p> </blockquote> <p>The prime minister's spokesman said Cameron thought &quot;intimidatory behaviour&quot; was wrong. &quot;We are considering whether or not there is something to be done in this area,&quot; he said. But he would not elaborate, or even say whether this would involve legislation.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/scotland-and-the-rest-of-the-uks-research-base-a-strong-union\">• David Willetts, the science minister, and Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish secretary, have published a paper showing the research benefits to Scotland of being part of the United Kingdom.</a></strong></p> <p><strong>• Downing Street would not comment on <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/be7ecc76-4a23-11e3-9a21-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2kKfqSWOE\">a Financial Times report saying the date of the autumn statement will be put back a day - from 4 December to 5 December - because David Cameron will be making a visit to China.</a></strong> The spokesman said that he might be able to make an announcement about Cameron's visit to China &quot;in the not to distant future&quot;.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-reveals-new-support-to-protect-interns-right-to-fair-pay\">• Jo Swinson, the business minister, has issued new guidance aimed at interns telling them about their right to receive the minimum wage.</a></strong></p> <p><strong>• Vince Cable, the business secretary, is on a trade visit to Moscow.</strong></p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c981407c-00de-4dc1-83df-380be4085722\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/11/1384171133464/4af6bbf8-b57a-4e6c-b8ef-e47ca6667e24-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"10 Downing Street.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>10 Downing Street.

As&nbsp;<em>The Spirit Level</em>&nbsp;showed, it is the most unequal countries, such as the UK and the US, that have the lowest levels of social mobility, while the most equal, such as&nbsp;Sweden, Canada and Japan, have the highest levels. This is hardly surprising: greater inequalities of outcome make it easier for rich parents to pass on their advantages to their children. As Will Hutton's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/indreview_willhutton_fairpay.htm\">report</a>&nbsp;on public-sector pay for the coalition noted: &quot;There is now good evidence that income inequality can become entrenched across generations, as elites monopolise top jobs regardless of their talent, gaining preferential access to capital and opportunities. This harms social mobility.&quot;</p> <p>Nor can the last Labour government be blamed for David Cameron's predilection for handing senior posts to those who were also privately educated. As Conservative MP&nbsp;Sarah Wollaston commented following the appointment of Old Etonians Jesse Norman and Jo Johnson to the No. 10 policy board, &quot;I’m not asked for policy advice, but just in case . . . there are other schools and some of them even admit women.&quot; David Davis put it more bluntly: &quot;No more Etonian advisers&quot;.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280a2a7e4b08521f0cfb58d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T09:28:49.287Z\">9.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here is more on the number of Old Etonian Tory MPs. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/11/sir-john-major-attacks-dominance-of-privately-educated-elite-politics-live-blog#block-5280a010e4b08521f0cfb589\">9.17am.) </a>Paul Goodman got is figures from <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/article/forget-old-etonian-chumocracy-tories-are-their-least-aristocratic-ever#sthash.kE0Oe92X.dpuf\">this article by Michael Mosbacher.</a>&nbsp;Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over time, Tory governments have moved down the social ladder, and the Cameron cabinet marks a dramatic acceleration of this trend. His first, in 2010, was the first Tory-led cabinet in which more than half of its members had not gone to public school. Only one went to Eton (Cameron), and the sole aristo Lord Strathclyde is rather less grand than those seen in earlier Tory governments. The title was created for the current holder’s grandfather, a Glasgow MP and chartered accountant.</p> <p>But even these figures understate the change. If you include non-cabinet ministers who attend its meetings, the Eton tally rises to three. Sixth baronet Sir George Young fits the Etonian image, but Oliver Letwin is more interesting.</p> <p>Ed Miliband likes to contrast his background with that of the Tories. He went to Haverstock School, a comprehensive in Camden. Yet his background is, apart from his schooling, remarkably similar to that of Letwin. Both sets of parents were north London Jewish intellectuals, both fathers were academics at the London School of Economics, and both Bill and Shirley Letwins’ and Ralph and Marion Milibands’ homes were meeting places for literary and political figures ...</p> <p>A substantial majority of Tory MPs would once have gone to public schools. Research by the Sutton Trust shows that it is now down to 54 per cent, with 27 per cent having attended comprehensives and 19 per cent grammar schools. The Trust makes much of the fact that the number of Old Etonians in parliament rose from 15 in 2005 to 20 in 2010. But this is a real terms fall for the Tories. The 2010 Etonian crop consists of 19 Tories and one Liberal Democrat, Viscount Thurso. The 2005 crop consisted of 13 Tories, Thurso, and a Labour MP who retired in 2010. The Tory Etonian representation has risen from 13 to 19, but the number of Conservative MPs rose from 198 to 306. Thus, the percentage of Old Etonians fell from 6.6 to 6.2 per cent.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280a010e4b08521f0cfb589\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T09:17:24.872Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2013/11/the-conservatives-real-class-problem.html\">At ConservativeHome Paul Goodman says that, if Sir John Major is suggesting that social mobility is getting worse and that the Tories are dominated by Old Etonians, he is wrong. </a>Here's an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What some will draw from Sir John’s comment that the Conservative Party is dominated by Old Etonians and that social mobility in Britain is getting worse. It’s a statement of the obvious that a perception of the latter for a very long time is that they are “the party of the rich”, and that David Cameron’s way of leading the Party has left him open to the charge that he’s leading a “chumocracy”.</p> <p>Since a socially mobile country would be one in which people’s living standards rise or fall relative to those of former generations (absolute social mobility) or their own contemporaries (relative social mobility), it is also a statement of the obvious that Britain is in some ways not a social mobile country – particularly since <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-trends/regional-economic-analysis/changes-in-real-earnings-in-the-uk-and-london--2002-to-2012/art-changes-in-real-earnings-in-the-uk-and-london--2002-to-2012.html\">average earnings have been falling since 2002</a>, long before the Coalition and “austerity”.</p> <p>But there’s no conclusive evidence that social mobility in Britain is getting worse, and quite a bit to prove that the Tories aren’t dominated by Old Etonians.</p> </blockquote> <p>Goodman says that only 6.2% of Tory MPs are Old Etonians. That does still seem rather a lot ...</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52809a4be4b055987af6772a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T09:06:38.184Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>One of the nice things about British public life is that, if you hang around for long enough, even a person with the most dire reputation can achieve rehabilitation. It has happened to Sir John Major. When he crashed out of office in 1997, his premiership was widely depicted as a disaster. A decade and a half later, it's all looking rather different. His premiership has been re-assessed (Janan Ganesh, in his biography of George Osborne, argues that &quot;by any reasonable standard, Major led one of the most effective post-war governments&quot;). Major was easily one of the most impressive political witnesses giving evidence to the Leveson inquiry. And, as he showed with his recent call for a windfall tax on energy companies, he has established himself as an elder statesman whose interventions carry weight. (The windfall tax speech was one of the best any politician has given all year. If you haven't already, do read it. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2471752/John-Major-Osborne-impose-emergency-tax-energy-firms-help-people-stay-warm-winter.html\">The full text is here, at the bottom of this Daily Mail story).</a></p> <p>And now Major has done it again. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10439303/Truly-shocking-that-the-private-school-educated-and-affluent-middle-class-still-run-Britain-says-Sir-John-Major.html\">As Christopher Hope reports in the Daily Telegraph's splash,</a> he has launched a fierce attack on the lack of social mobility in Britain.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the speech to Tory party grassroots activists on Friday evening, Sir John - who went to a grammar school in south London and left with three O-Levels - said: “In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class. To me from my background, I find that truly shocking.”&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>But his speech did not just cover the influence of the privately-educated elite. He made other arguments too including, interestingly, calling for policy to be balanced more in favour of savers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the speech to South Norfolk Conservative Association’s annual dinner on Friday evening, Sir John also said:&nbsp;</p> <p>- the Government should help pensioners who have saved carefully for their retirement and are being punished by “cripplingly unfair” low interest rates</p> <p>- the Bank of England ought to return interest rates to “normal levels, say three to five per cent”, so that society treats “the saver as fairly as it treats the debtor”.</p> <p>- Tory party members were right to feel “unsettled” by the Coalition’s decision to legalise same sex marriage, but activists have to move with the times.</p> <p>- the Conservative leadership should to pull their punches on the United Kingdom Independence Party, pointing out that “many of the Ukip supporters are patriotic Britons who fear their country is changing” and will come back to the Tory party. </p> </blockquote> <p>I'll be covering reaction to the speech this morning.</p> <p>Otherwise, it looks quite. Here's the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Number 10 lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Michael Gove, the education secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p>As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web.

Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In my last statement I informed the committee that I am frequently reported to various authorities. I thought it worth clarifying that this has been as a result of my own campaign to reduce the upper limit at which abortion takes place from twenty four to twenty weeks.</p> <p>The purpose of the reporting, on the basis of spurious claims, is to undermine my credibility and to distract and preoccupy both me and my office from the issue I have pursued since I became an MP.</p> <p>Following the reporting to the police I had need to instruct a solicitor as the investigating officers would not discuss the case with me directly—even though the Standards Commissioner had investigated the very same complaint and had made no finding against me.</p> <p>The bill was in fact, &pound;67,000 not &pound;62,000 as I quoted. The House of Commons legal services department investigated whether or not there was insurance provision available to cover the bill as it had been incurred wholly and directly as a result of my role as an MP.</p> <p>I was informed via a letter from Michael Carpenter of legal services who provided me with assistance that, following his own investigations of various provisions that he thought may assist, there was no such help available and that the obligation to pay the bill was mine alone.</p> <p>As a single parent with financial responsibilities for a disabled ex husband, an elderly mother and a child in full time education, I faced the possibility of bankruptcy or finding a way to pay the bill.</p> <p>This is the initial impetus that drove me to undertake media work.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280f123e4b0f37bee4ff4ea\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T15:05:03.409Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In the course of the inquiry into her I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here earning, <strong>Nadine Dorries</strong>, the Conservative MP, threatened to sue Kathryn Hudson, the parliamentary commission.</p> <p>Here's the threat.

I will not tolerate that or any report which invokes libellous negative coverage against me as a result and will not hesitate to pursue you personally should that be the case.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>In its report, the Commons standards committee said the accusations made by Dorries were &quot;unacceptable&quot;.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280eb5de4b0f37bee4ff4e1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T14:48:00.401Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Nadine Dorries</strong>, the Conservative MP, has been ordered to apologise to the Commons for failing to declare how much she earned for her appearance on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here in the register of members' interests. That's the conclusion of<a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmstnprv/806/80602.htm\"> a report from the Commons standards committee. </a>An investigation by Kathryn Hudson, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, also found that she failed to properly comply with the investigation into her.</p> <p>Here's the conclusion from the committee's report.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The House's Code of Conduct and disciplinary system depend on Members being prepared to explain their conduct, to submit to public scrutiny and where necessary, to respond to the Commissioner's inquiries. We recommend that Ms Dorries</p> <ul> <li>register all payments in respect of her employment, whether or not they have been channelled through Averbrook Ltd or any other third party and</li> <li>apologise to the House by way of a Personal Statement.</li> </ul> <p>We expect Ms Dorries to consult the Registrar in person about the detail of her Register entry within 21 days of publication of this Report. We will monitor Ms Dorries's compliance and will recommend further action if necessary.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>The report also reveals that, at a late stage in the inquiry, Dorries said she would declaring gross earnings of &pound;142,000, and a profit of &pound;82,000, in the register. This seems to be money paid into a company, Averbrook, for her media work.</p> <p>And here's an excerpt from Hudson's report (published as an appendix to the main report).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have offered Ms Dorries several opportunities to answer the questions I have put to her and I have reminded her of her obligation under the Code of Conduct to cooperate with my inquiry. It would have been open to her, if she could not herself provide the evidence I sought, to authorise ITV or her agent to do so. I note that the Committee on Standards and Privileges, reporting in 2010 on an inquiry into Ms Dorries' conduct, endorsed the then Commissioner's view that Ms Dorries had taken too long to provide evidence to the Commissioner and concluded that &quot;that prompt, full and open responses to the Commissioner's inquiries are of great importance&quot;&nbsp;I am sorry that on this occasion Ms Dorries has chosen not to co-operate with my inquiry and I accordingly conclude that she is in breach of the Code of Conduct in this respect.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-20a97918-89d2-45a4-86fb-0f6ef1b996f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/11/1384181273468/715da018-3373-4add-b1e5-7c782791273e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nadine Dorries appearing in I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Nadine Dorries appearing in I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.

After all, David Cameron and the Tories are as opposed to new grammar schools as Labour.</p> <p>The days of Tory Leaders like John Major and Margaret Thatcher are long gone. It isn't hard to see why. The abolition of selective education in Britain has been a hammer blow to the prospects of working class kids.</p> <p>Until we see a grammar school back in every town and city across the UK, Britain's shocking lack of social mobility will go on. It is as simple as that.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10441029/Sir-John-Major-attack-on-Britains-privileged-governing-class-the-speech-transcript.html\">A full text of Major's speech is now on the Telegraph website.</a></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/mccluskey-unite-will-never-be-browbeaten-by-crosby-cameron-or-the-daily-mail/\">• Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has said that his union will not abandon the &quot;Leverage&quot; protest tactics that have been condemned by David Cameron and papers like the Daily Mail. </a></strong>The attacks on the union showed it was making a difference, he said. But he also said the union was being misrepresented.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every day we read statements and press articles about Unite which do not come within hailing distance of the truth.</p> <p>This shows one thing above all: Unite is making a difference. We have served notice on the establishment that fighting trade unionism is back - and the elite don't like it ...</p> <p>Among the many caricatures of Unite painted in recent weeks is the one that we have no strings to our bow except confrontation. That is not the reality of course. Look at the motor industry - at JLR, Vauxhall, Toyota, Nissan and elsewhere. We have had difficult negotiations, but collaborated with responsible employers not just to protect existing jobs but to secure additional investment which can guarantee skilled manufacturing jobs into the future.</p> <p>It is ironic that when David Cameron praises the work of the Automotive Council in reviving the motor industry, he is also praising the work of Unite members, Unite representatives. I guess Lynton Crosby hasn’t explained that to him.</p> <p>And what is true in motors is true across industry. We are not toy town revolutionaries. We know that most of the time most workers want a decent relationship with their employer, based on mutual respect, and that they expect their union to work in that spirit.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• Theresa May, the home secretary, has said the BBC's dominance on the internet is damaging local newspapers.</strong> She made the comments in a speech to the Society of Editors' annual conference. Local newspapers were&nbsp;having &quot;a particularly hard time&quot;, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That's partly been the result of the BBC's dominant position on the internet and its ability to subsidise the provision of internet news using the licence fee. This makes it enormously difficult for local newspapers to compete. If the BBC can, as they do, provide all the locally significant news, what is left to motivate the local media to buy a paper? It's destroying local newspapers and could eventually happen to national newspapers as well.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/11/taxman-minimum-wage-spot-checks\">• HM Revenue and Customers has warned firms who have advertised placements for unpaid internships that they could be &quot;publicly named and shamed&quot; and may be liable for a &pound;5,000 fine if they are found to be in breach of national minimum wage laws.</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/appointment-of-uk-non-resident-charge-daffaires-to-iran\">• William Hague has appointed a&nbsp;non-resident charg&eacute;s d’affaires to Iran. </a></strong>Ajay Sharma, previously head of the Foreign Office's Iran department, has been appointed to the non-resident post.&nbsp;Hague said this was a move towards improving bilateral relationships.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T14:16:08.746Z\">at 2.16pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d4fce4b055987af6775a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:04:26.762Z\">1.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Danny Alexander</strong>, the Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, has come out in support of Sir John Major.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dannyalexander/statuses/399864198387482624\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Agree with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Major&amp;src=hash\">#Major</a> that corridors of power should reflect society. &pound;2.5bn pupil premium helps every child get the best start <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fairersociety&amp;src=hash\">#fairersociety</a></p>— Danny Alexander (@dannyalexander) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannyalexander/statuses/399864198387482624\">November 11, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>He sounds more supportive of Major than Number 10.

(Major seems to think where you come from does count, because that is an indicator of social mobility.) But the spokesman also stressed Cameron's commitment to social mobility. Cameron described this as &quot;building an aspiration nation&quot;, the spokesman said. &quot;What the prime minister is saying is that we need to unleash and unlock promise.&quot; The government was doing this in various ways, for example by raising standards and imposing greater rigour in the education system, the spokesman added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What people say around the breakfast table in the morning, what they really want to know is that the government has policies to ensure that their kids can fulfil their talents and ambitions. That is the important thing.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• Downing Street confirmed <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/046274a2-47ce-11e3-9398-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz2kKfy05gk\">the Financial Times story saying Cameron is taking a close interest in the NHS's preparations for winter.</a></strong> &quot;It's a very important issue,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;You would expect the government to be very focused on it.&quot; He also said that the practice of putting private hospitals on standby in case they were needed had been going on for years.</p> <p><strong>• William Hague, the foreign secretary, is giving a statement in the Commons on Iran and Syria at 3.30pm.</strong> Downing Street said that Cameron does not think France is to blame for<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24895911\"> the failure of the P5+1 to reach an agreement with Iran over its nuclear energy programme at the weekend.</a></p> <p><strong>• Number 10 said that Cameron &quot;understands the concerns&quot; that people have about the premium rate charges people have to pay if when calling government helplines.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24888608\">The public accounts committee has criticised these charges in a report today.</a> The spokesman said the government was looking at this problem. Charges for people using bereavement services was a particular concern, he said.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• Downing Street reaffirmed its commitment to consider the law on protests in the light of Unite's use of &quot;Leverage&quot; tactics that can involve demonstrations outside people's home.</strong><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2480643/Labours-Unite-paymasters-intimidated-managers-oil-refinery-battle.html\">These tactics have been critically reported in the Daily Mail.</a> At PMQs recently Cameron condemned these tactics and said the government would consider whether there was a case for legislation. <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/mccluskey-unite-will-never-be-browbeaten-by-crosby-cameron-or-the-daily-mail/\">In a statement today the Unite leader Len McCluskey has vowed not to back down. </a>This is what McCluskey said.:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The protests which the Daily Mail has targeted are ... as old as democracy – free speech and the right to peacefully demonstrate. For that, our members have been described as “thugs”. We will see what the law makes of that phrase.</p> <p>It is, at any event, a lie. These protests were peaceful, mostly silent, and of course had nothing to do with intimidating families, children, or anyone.

As&nbsp;<em>The Spirit Level</em>&nbsp;showed, it is the most unequal countries, such as the UK and the US, that have the lowest levels of social mobility, while the most equal, such as&nbsp;Sweden, Canada and Japan, have the highest levels. This is hardly surprising: greater inequalities of outcome make it easier for rich parents to pass on their advantages to their children. As Will Hutton's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/indreview_willhutton_fairpay.htm\">report</a>&nbsp;on public-sector pay for the coalition noted: &quot;There is now good evidence that income inequality can become entrenched across generations, as elites monopolise top jobs regardless of their talent, gaining preferential access to capital and opportunities. This harms social mobility.&quot;</p> <p>Nor can the last Labour government be blamed for David Cameron's predilection for handing senior posts to those who were also privately educated. As Conservative MP&nbsp;Sarah Wollaston commented following the appointment of Old Etonians Jesse Norman and Jo Johnson to the No. 10 policy board, &quot;I’m not asked for policy advice, but just in case . . . there are other schools and some of them even admit women.&quot; David Davis put it more bluntly: &quot;No more Etonian advisers&quot;.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280a2a7e4b08521f0cfb58d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T09:28:49.287Z\">9.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here is more on the number of Old Etonian Tory MPs.

His first, in 2010, was the first Tory-led cabinet in which more than half of its members had not gone to public school. Only one went to Eton (Cameron), and the sole aristo Lord Strathclyde is rather less grand than those seen in earlier Tory governments. The title was created for the current holder’s grandfather, a Glasgow MP and chartered accountant.</p> <p>But even these figures understate the change. If you include non-cabinet ministers who attend its meetings, the Eton tally rises to three. Sixth baronet Sir George Young fits the Etonian image, but Oliver Letwin is more interesting.</p> <p>Ed Miliband likes to contrast his background with that of the Tories. He went to Haverstock School, a comprehensive in Camden. Yet his background is, apart from his schooling, remarkably similar to that of Letwin. Both sets of parents were north London Jewish intellectuals, both fathers were academics at the London School of Economics, and both Bill and Shirley Letwins’ and Ralph and Marion Milibands’ homes were meeting places for literary and political figures ...</p> <p>A substantial majority of Tory MPs would once have gone to public schools. Research by the Sutton Trust shows that it is now down to 54 per cent, with 27 per cent having attended comprehensives and 19 per cent grammar schools. The Trust makes much of the fact that the number of Old Etonians in parliament rose from 15 in 2005 to 20 in 2010. But this is a real terms fall for the Tories. The 2010 Etonian crop consists of 19 Tories and one Liberal Democrat, Viscount Thurso. The 2005 crop consisted of 13 Tories, Thurso, and a Labour MP who retired in 2010. The Tory Etonian representation has risen from 13 to 19, but the number of Conservative MPs rose from 198 to 306. Thus, the percentage of Old Etonians fell from 6.6 to 6.2 per cent.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280a010e4b08521f0cfb589\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T09:17:24.872Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2013/11/the-conservatives-real-class-problem.html\">At ConservativeHome Paul Goodman says that, if Sir John Major is suggesting that social mobility is getting worse and that the Tories are dominated by Old Etonians, he is wrong. </a>Here's an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What some will draw from Sir John’s comment that the Conservative Party is dominated by Old Etonians and that social mobility in Britain is getting worse. It’s a statement of the obvious that a perception of the latter for a very long time is that they are “the party of the rich”, and that David Cameron’s way of leading the Party has left him open to the charge that he’s leading a “chumocracy”.</p> <p>Since a socially mobile country would be one in which people’s living standards rise or fall relative to those of former generations (absolute social mobility) or their own contemporaries (relative social mobility), it is also a statement of the obvious that Britain is in some ways not a social mobile country – particularly since <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-trends/regional-economic-analysis/changes-in-real-earnings-in-the-uk-and-london--2002-to-2012/art-changes-in-real-earnings-in-the-uk-and-london--2002-to-2012.html\">average earnings have been falling since 2002</a>, long before the Coalition and “austerity”.</p> <p>But there’s no conclusive evidence that social mobility in Britain is getting worse, and quite a bit to prove that the Tories aren’t dominated by Old Etonians.</p> </blockquote> <p>Goodman says that only 6.2% of Tory MPs are Old Etonians.

It has happened to Sir John Major. When he crashed out of office in 1997, his premiership was widely depicted as a disaster. A decade and a half later, it's all looking rather different. His premiership has been re-assessed (Janan Ganesh, in his biography of George Osborne, argues that &quot;by any reasonable standard, Major led one of the most effective post-war governments&quot;). Major was easily one of the most impressive political witnesses giving evidence to the Leveson inquiry. And, as he showed with his recent call for a windfall tax on energy companies, he has established himself as an elder statesman whose interventions carry weight. (The windfall tax speech was one of the best any politician has given all year. If you haven't already, do read it. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2471752/John-Major-Osborne-impose-emergency-tax-energy-firms-help-people-stay-warm-winter.html\">The full text is here, at the bottom of this Daily Mail story).</a></p> <p>And now Major has done it again. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10439303/Truly-shocking-that-the-private-school-educated-and-affluent-middle-class-still-run-Britain-says-Sir-John-Major.html\">As Christopher Hope reports in the Daily Telegraph's splash,</a> he has launched a fierce attack on the lack of social mobility in Britain.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the speech to Tory party grassroots activists on Friday evening, Sir John - who went to a grammar school in south London and left with three O-Levels - said: “In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class. To me from my background, I find that truly shocking.”&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>But his speech did not just cover the influence of the privately-educated elite. He made other arguments too including, interestingly, calling for policy to be balanced more in favour of savers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the speech to South Norfolk Conservative Association’s annual dinner on Friday evening, Sir John also said:&nbsp;</p> <p>- the Government should help pensioners who have saved carefully for their retirement and are being punished by “cripplingly unfair” low interest rates</p> <p>- the Bank of England ought to return interest rates to “normal levels, say three to five per cent”, so that society treats “the saver as fairly as it treats the debtor”.</p> <p>- Tory party members were right to feel “unsettled” by the Coalition’s decision to legalise same sex marriage, but activists have to move with the times.</p> <p>- the Conservative leadership should to pull their punches on the United Kingdom Independence Party, pointing out that “many of the Ukip supporters are patriotic Britons who fear their country is changing” and will come back to the Tory party. </p> </blockquote> <p>I'll be covering reaction to the speech this morning.</p> <p>Otherwise, it looks quite. Here's the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Number 10 lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Michael Gove, the education secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p>As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a summary at about 1pm and another in the afternoon.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422167554|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|487091e6d5193cf4ab8bc1f183fd26ca74c4a216 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sir John Major has criticised the \"truly shocking\" dominance of the upper echelons of power in Britain by the privately educated and affluent middle class, it was reported.</p><p>In remarks that will sting Eton-educated David Cameron, his Tory predecessor in 10 Downing Street is said to have called for more to be done to boost social mobility.</p><p>The Daily Telegraph said the state-educated former prime minister, who left school at 16, spoke out in a speech to members of the South Norfolk constituency party.</p><p>\"In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class,\" he is reported to have said. \"To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking.\"</p><p>Cameron has faced claims he has surrounded himself with people from a similarly privileged family and educational background.</p><p>Major said: \"Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born, not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born.</p><p>\"We need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. And it isn't going to happen magically.\"</p><p>In an appeal for unity, Major said the party could win the 2015 general election \"but only if we pull together\" - saying internal criticism could be productive but should be kept private.</p><p>\"Public criticism is destructive. Take it from me. Political parties who are divided and torn simply do not win general elections,\" he said in a nod to the divisions which wracked his own premiership.</p><p>On one issue that has caused Conservative grass-roots dissent – gay marriage – he urged people to accept times had changed. \"We may be unsettled by them, but David Cameron and his colleagues have no choice but to deal with this new world. They cannot, Canute-like order it to go away because it won't,\" he said.</p><p>And on another major area of concern, he recommended a less-confrontational approach to the threat of the UK Independence Party.</p><p>\"We don't need to make personal attacks on Ukip,\" he said. \"Many of the Ukip supporters are patriotic Britons who fear their country is changing.</p><p>\"It is far more productive to expose the follies in their policies.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422153544|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|fb1ae2b1f02e3ac344d338b26a927263acc1da35 -->",

        "headline":"John Major 'shocked' at privately educated elite's hold on power",
        "body":"<p>Sir John Major has expressed his shock at the way in which every sphere of modern public life is dominated by a private school-educated elite and well-heeled middle class. He also suggested interest rates should go back to \"normal levels of 3% to 5 %\" as one way of helping pensioners deal with the recent squeeze on earnings.</p><p></p><p>The former prime minister has been warning for months about the threat of so-called net curtain poverty, and claimed the government needed to do more to address the quiet poverty gripping the responsible middle class. He blamed the slowdown in social mobility on Labour policies, including the abolition of grammar schools.</p><p></p><p>In a speech in Norfolk on Friday, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10439303/Truly-shocking-that-the-private-school-educated-and-affluent-middle-class-still-run-Britain-says-Sir-John-Major.html\" title=\"\">reported on Monday by the Daily Telegraph</a>, he claimed that pensioners' savings were being squeezed by a mix of inflation and low interest rates.</p><p></p><p>Major – who went to a grammar school in south London and left with three O-levels – said: \"In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class. To me from my background, I find that truly shocking.\"</p><p></p><p>He blamed this \"collapse in social mobility\" on Labour, claiming that despite Ed Miliband's \"absurd mantra to be the one-nation party, they left a Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration\".</p><p></p><p>Major said: \"I remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost</p><p></p><p>\"Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born, not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born. \"We need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. And it isn't going to happen magically.\"</p><p></p><p>The Commission on Child Poverty and Social Mobility, chaired by Alan Milburn, the former Labour cabinet minister, has found no evidence that social mobility slowed due to Labour policies.</p><p></p><p>The coalition will argue that its pupil premium is aimed specifically  at poorer children and designed to help them achieve higher results than the better resourced middle class. It will also point to free childcare aimed at the poorer two-year-olds.</p><p></p><p>Major also said the government should help pensioners who had saved carefully for their retirement and were being punished by \"cripplingly unfair\" low interest rates. He suggested the Bank of England ought to return interest rates to \"normal levels, say 3% to 5%\", so that society treated \"the saver as fairly as it treats the debtor\".</p><p>Critics will point out that pensioners have been relatively immune from spending cuts, partly due to the triple lock on the value of pensions.</p><p></p><p>There is, however, cross-party concern  about the potential impact of rising interest rates on household debt.</p><p></p><p>At the weekend the Tory MP Mark Garnier told the BBC: \"The important point, I think, is that we have to remember that we're in a period of super-low interest rates: this is not normal, this is the lowest interest rates have been for 300 years.</p><p>\"And actually when we go back to a normal period of low interest rates – so if they rise by 2%-3%, which is perfectly reasonable even before the three years target that [the Bank of England governor] Mark Carney has set – it's going to have a really dramatic effect on quite a number of households that are already suffering a bit of forebearance on their mortgages.\"</p><p></p><p>The thinktank the Resolution Foundation recently warned: \"The number of families in Britain with perilous levels of debt repayments could more than double to 1.2 million if interest rates rise faster than expected in the next four years and household income growth is weak and uneven.\" Current market expectations are for interest rates to reach 1.9% by mid-2017.</p><p></p><p>Major said the Conservative leadership should pull their punches on the UK Independence party (Ukip), saying many of its supporters were \"patriotic Britons who fear their country is changing\", and would ultimately come back to the Tory party.</p><p></p><p>Turning to the Conservatives' prospects for the 2015 general election, the former prime minister said that if the party decided to \"shrink into our comfort zone we will not win general elections – the core vote cannot deliver a general election majority\".</p><p></p><p>Party members were right to feel unsettled by \"bewildering\" changes such as the coalition's decision to legalise same-sex marriage, he said.</p><p></p><p>\"Social mores have moved on from the way in which we were brought up, with the values that we had. They have moved and changed,\" Major added. \"And that is why issues such as gay marriage have proved so toxic for the Conservative party.</p><p></p><p>\"Because for many Conservatives, people who are conservative because their instinct is to conserve, to change slowly and only when you know it is certain for the better, that is classically Conservative.</p><p></p><p>\"For people like that who form the bulk of our party and a great deal of our country too, these are difficult issues, these bewildering social changes, and mostly it is my generation and older who are unsettled by these changes.</p><p></p><p>\"We may be unsettled by them, but David Cameron and his colleagues have no choice but to deal with this new world. They cannot, Canute-like, order it to go away, because it won't.\"</p><p></p><p>Major called for loyalty from party members, saying: \"Public criticism is destructive. Take it from me. Political parties who are divided and torn simply do not win general elections.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422179812|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|3729c527846df4b1bf28ebc193d89984130b26e5 -->",
