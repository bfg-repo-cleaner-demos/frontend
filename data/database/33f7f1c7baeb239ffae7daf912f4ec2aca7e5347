At that point he was the world time-trial champion, having won the rainbow jersey in autumn 2003. He was stripped of his title.</p><p>That – for the time – was relatively routine stuff for cycling but what has set Millar apart since then is the role he has taken up in his sport. Millar returned to cycling determined to campaign against dopingand has never shied away from speaking about the topic – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/jul/27/cycling.athensolympics2004\" title=\"\">giving the Guardian an emotional interview within a few weeks of being banned</a>.</p><p>He was one of the founders of the Slipstream squad, in 2007-08, together with Lance Armstrong's former team-mate Jonathan Vaughters, with whom <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/31/cycling.tourdefrance2\" title=\"\">he set out to construct a squad built on an ethical foundation</a>, where doping was not an option for the riders.</p><p>The two men's \"little mission\" has turned into one of cycling's leading teams – now sponsored by Garmin and Sharp – and is widely regarded within the sport as a role model, with its emphasis on independent testing of the cyclists, and its acceptance of those who have taken drugs, confessed and served bans.</p><p>Several of the team, including Vaughters, were among those who testified against Lance Armstrong when the US Anti-Doping Agency built its case against the seven-times winner.</p><p>Millar has also gained a profile as the writer of one of cycling's better confessional autobiographies, Racing Through the Dark, in which he took the reader through his rise and fall and the process of redemption.</p><p>In recent seasons he has admitted to suffering increasingly from health and injury problems as his 20 years on the road have taken their toll, and he had hinted that the 2013 Tour had taken him close to the end of the line.</p><p>Millar confirmed his decision to finish riding in a video interview given to the Dutch cycling magazine Wieler Revue. \"It has been quite organic really. You always think it is going to be a definitive moment but it hasn't been,\" he said. \"It has kind of crept up and I am suddenly realising it is time. I think my body is actually getting stronger. It is just that I don't want it or need it as  much as I once did. It is very much a conscious decision. I can still be on top of the game – I know that – but it is a lot harder for me now and I want to be on top of my game next year, so I know I can get that out of me. With the motivation of knowing it is my last year, I know I can get the best out of myself.\"</p><p>In addition to his four Tour stage wins, Millar has also won stages at the Vuelta a España and the Giro d'Italia.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419958573|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|5cc3b549fbd7dc343edc9c716e4a349b593ecf1a -->",

        "body":"<p>Cycling's new international president, Brian Cookson, has started talks to launch an independent investigation into the UCI's handling of doping scandals and begun a clear-out of the old regime.</p><p>Cookson announced that Christophe Hubschmid, the director general, has left the organisation, along with Philippe Verbiest, the lawyer who had been the UCI's legal counsel since the 1980s.</p><p>Cookson, the former head of British Cycling, has also revealed the UCI has dropped its legal action against the Irish writer Paul Kimmage, revoked the age limit of 28 that existed for UCI women's teams and formed a new commission aiming to boost the growth of women's cycling.</p><p>Cookson said in a statement: \"We have started the work of establishing a high-level dialogue with Wada (World Anti-Doping Agency) to plan how we will proceed with the independent investigation into the UCI's past.</p><p>\"We have also been making contact with other key stakeholders in this area, including Usada (US Anti-Doping Agency), other national anti-doping organisations and the French sports ministry. And earlier this week I called Paul Kimmage to tell him that the UCI has withdrawn from the legal action against him.\"</p><p>Hubschmid had been a close confidante of the former president Pat McQuaid, who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/27/pat-mcquaid-uci-loses-election\" title=\"\">defeated by Cookson in last month's election</a>, and was viewed as having had a key role in efforts to re-elect McQuaid. Similarly, Verbiest had been seen as a close link with the old regime.</p><p>Cookson added: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/17/head-british-cycling-brian-cookson\" title=\"\">Some changes are needed</a> and I can confirm that former director general Christophe Hubschmid has left the UCI and that Antonio Rigozzi of Lévy Kaufmann-Kohler is now assisting us as external legal counsel.</p><p>\"I would like to thank Christophe for his contribution to the UCI and wish him well for the future. I would also like to thank our previous legal counsel Philippe Verbiest for his many years of hard work and commitment to the UCI.\"</p><p>Speaking during his first foreign engagement in Beijing, Cookson said the talks with Wada and the changes were a vital step.</p><p>He said: \"These early days are very important for the UCI. We have embarked on the process of implementing our manifesto commitments so that we can re-establish our international federation's reputation and make it the best and most respected in the world. I believe that we have made a good start.\"</p><p>Cookson plans to meet the new IOC president, Thomas Bach, and the Rio 2016 Olympics president, Carlos Nuzman, during the next few weeks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419707004|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|81edc0d52268aabf5b9d90cfd119e2d989754ee7 -->",

        "body":"<p>A \"profound and decisive change\" in the organisation of professional cycling, including a three-tier league with promotion and relegation and a 20% reduction in racing days for elite teams, is set to be introduced in 2015.</p><p>Proposals from cycling's governing body, the UCI – and supported by key stakeholders – would lead to the current WorldTour being replaced by a 16-team first division and an eight-team second division, with a feeder third division featuring teams from the continental tours.</p><p>Another major change would see a limit of 120 days' racing for elite first division teams by 2020 – a significant chop given the 2013 WorldTour schedule is 154 days – after complaints from elite teams about their gruelling schedules.</p><p>A 20% reduction in race days will inevitably lead to some races being scrapped or shortened, but there are no plans to trim the three-week grand tours, the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España.</p><p>Other proposed changes include giving more importance to the spring classics, ensuring no events overlap and making it a rule that there will be races on every Sunday of a slightly shortened season, which would start in February rather than January, and run until October.</p><p>The announcement, which was squirrelled away in the UCI's Sport and Technical newsletter, follows nearly two years of talks between the UCI and the Professional Cycling Council – a body that includes representatives of riders, teams and race organisers. According to a UCI statement the proposals, which will be submitted for approval to the UCI's management committee and PCC in January, \"should lead to a profound and decisive change in the organisation  – the aspect of our sport that is the foundation for global development\".</p><p>But in some senses they are a defensive measure. The UCI is not only reacting to teams' concerns about their schedules but also trying to make cycling more attractive to sponsors by making the calendar easier to follow, and giving every race its place in the spotlight.</p><p>Meanwhile Britain's Brian Cookson, the new UCI president, has promised that these reforms are only the start of his reform agenda after being elected last month.</p><p>Cookson said: \"My manifesto was not simply a declaration of intent, it was a genuine proposal for the future and a working document. My priorities have certainly not changed now that I have been elected.</p><p>\"The UCI must take the necessary steps to restore its own credibility and that of cycling as a whole, in particular with regard to the public perception of anti-doping measures and the present-day leaders of the world of cycling.</p><p>\"In order to restore confidence in the UCI and promote cycling all around the world, we have to transform the way in which anti-doping procedures are managed, restructure elite road cycling, develop women's cycling and reinforce our position and influence, in particular within the Olympic Movement.</p><p>\"These are immense tasks and work on them has started already.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419407546|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|063c23eb451cea59760b7424836d530e5aa03781 -->",

        "headline":"After the crash: the triathlete who got back on her bike and gave back",
        "body":"<p>The sun was out. It was a crisp November morning. Charlotte Roach, 21, watched her cycling teammate remove her leg warmers while holding her position in the group. It was one of those days an Olympic trainee dreams about.</p><p>Then everything changed. A cyclist ahead of her swerved, catching Roach's front wheel. She realised she was going down. \"I remember falling but I never hit the ground,\" Roach said. Instead, she hit an oncoming Land Rover. \"The next thing I knew, I was on the road in a lot of pain.\"</p><p>The pain was the result of punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebra, broken ribs, and a broken collarbone. An air ambulance rushed Roach to hospital, where she had emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstruction work. For an international athlete, one who had just been accepted onto the Olympics acceleration programme 2012 for triathlon, the accident was shattering.</p><p>It would be three months before Roach was back on a road bike again.</p><p>First, she had to relearn to walk. In a high-dependency ward where the \"banter was of the highest quality\", Roach was watched around the clock. Physios worked with her to sit on the edge of the bed, then stand. And finally, to walk. She says:</p><blockquote><p>\"Nobody knew what would lie ahead for me now. Would I make the Olympics? But then I would think, 'Who cares, when the questions are, will I be able to walk out of the hospital unaided? Will I ever touch my toes, stand up straight, run, swim and resume normality? Will I live independently, finish my degree, and reclaim my life?' \"</p></blockquote><p>Roach's memories following her release from the hospital are a catalogue of small victories: tying her own shoes by balancing on one leg, unable to bend down; walking the few hundred metres to her local surgery for the first time without falling; running for almost 90 minutes. She made mistakes, she notes, like swimming with her broken collarbone. But more than that, she made progress.</p><blockquote><p>\"At 5.05am I'd wake to see a letter pinned to my wall explaining that I no longer had any potential. I wasn't about to sleep in and miss swimming with that hanging over me.\"</p></blockquote><p>Bit by bit, Roach began to repair herself. Running came first. Then the swimming. Roach signed up for a triathlon, one after a scheduled shoulder operation. Yet something was still missing: cycling. \"The obvious hurdle was my return to the bike.\" </p><p>For Roach, acting with self-professed stubbornness, the bike was just another challenge to be overcome. It wouldn't be a problem. She would get on, push the wheels, and move.</p><p>On her first road outing, Roach arranged to ride with a group of young triathletes. She strapped her feet in. Within seconds, she felt \"very insecure and uncomfortable\".</p><blockquote><p>\"My head was urging my body to stop, to get off and not leave the car park. Despite my reluctance, I knew I had to go.\"</p></blockquote><p>Once they started, Roach found herself toward the back of the group - the same place she had been when she was knocked off: \"In my heightened state of terror, I saw near miss after near miss.\" She fell back a bit and then a bit more. \"To the passing observer, I would probably be considered not in the group at all.\" Roach struggled to hide her shaking and tears from the group. She says:</p><blockquote><p>\"When I finally got off my bike, I felt mentally drained, humiliated, defeated and disappointed.</p><p>After suffering this, I realised the key to conquering my demons was to go out and fight them alone, where I was in control of as many factors as possible.\"</p></blockquote><p>The next morning, Roach went out riding. The process was a gradual one. She started by exploring Cambridgeshire back roads. At first, everything was a hazard. Aggressive drivers would bring her to tears.</p><blockquote><p>\"In my head, I'd be telling pedestrians to just keep walking along the pavement, cars to continue on their side of the road, dogs not to run out in front of me.\" </p></blockquote><p>Alongside her mental battles, Roach was waging another fight: one against the ever-worsening pain in her spine. Every day, every session, was agony. She began to train in fortnightly cycles, going until the back spasms became too much, resting, and doing it again.</p><p>The pain started taking over. Even though she placed fourth in her first elite triathlon, a European cup where she represented Great Britain, Roach found herself increasingly unable to train.</p><blockquote><p>\"I felt I had no choice. Despite my original declaration that I'd never have spinal surgery again, the metal work was going to have to come out.\" </p></blockquote><p>In Roach's recounting, there is a sense of frustration. She would have to fight the same battles, step by shaky step, again.</p><p>Yet fight she did, first through another round of surgeries, then through more recovery. And she also pledged to give something back.</p><p>In August 2011, Roach left Beijing for London. She cycled 16,000km through 16 different countries. By the time it was finished, she had raised almost £10,000 for the <a href=\"http://www.theairambulanceservice.org.uk/about-us/our-services/derbyshire-leicestershire-rutland-air-ambulance\" title=\"\">Derbyshire, Leicestershire &amp; Rutland air ambulance</a> that saved her life.</p><blockquote><p>\"It was a debt I had to repay. They expended time, effort and money to keep me alive. The least I could do was provide that opportunity for another.\"</p></blockquote><p>Today, the impact of those few seconds in November can still be seen on Roach. She has scars across her shoulders, her elbow, her back. Her Olympic opportunity never fully materialised. And every day, she has pain.</p><p>Yet when asked if she would recommend cycling, Roach doesn't even hesitate. </p><blockquote><p>\"Absolutely. Cycling is an extremely rewarding activity. It's a great feeling, propelling yourself with speed.\" </p></blockquote><p>Roach paused, then added: \"I do it all the time.\"</p><p>• <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanaeMercer\" title=\"\">Danae Mercer</a> is a freelance writer</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419239991|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|14d390f0b5addebcc4c0e431306628f6ebed078a -->",

The team said the request was refused by the UCI.</p><p>\"Endura Racing's culture has always been entirely at odds with cheating in any form, including the use of PEDs, and nothing in JTL's conduct during his 2012 season with the team gave rise to concerns that his approach was at odds with this in any way,\" a statement, issued on <a href=\"http://www.endura.co.uk\" title=\"\">endura.co.uk</a>, read.</p><p>\"JTL joined Endura Racing in January 2012 and when it became clear he had World Tour potential, was made available to Team Garmin-Sharp in April for physiological tests. No adverse results were reported back.</p><p>\"He then accompanied Team Sky on their Tenerife training camp in May. Team Sky had full access to JTL from the point it was agreed for him to train with them at this camp. This includes the period covering the last quarter of 2012.</p><p>\"According to JTL, he undertook physiological tests for Team Sky directly after the world championships in 2012 and although Endura never received any data from these tests, neither was anything raised by Team Sky as unusual or concerning.</p><p>\"At this early stage, without detailed information, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the reasons for inconsistencies in JTL's biological passport data although it is known that there are many possible legitimate causes including fatigue and ill-health, both of which we understand JTL has suffered from in the last year.</p><p>\"A process that ought to have remained confidential is under way and we obviously hope that JTL is able to provide information that is acceptable to the UCI for their inquiry in order for him to clear his name.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418758285|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|fdff7c16e2d2212ce97c5a76ea8ba53661e52e82 -->",

        "headline":"Why Great Britain's wheels came off at cycling's world championships",
        "body":"<h2><strong>1 Riders undercooked or over-raced</strong><br /></h2><p>A team's collective form matters in the world championships as much as that of a single individual rider, and the buildup of most of the Great Britain squad was less than ideal. At one end of the spectrum Chris Froome, Ian Stannard and Geraint Thomas came in off the back of long seasons – Thomas, for example, was racing in January at the Tour Down Under, while Stannard had ridden his heart out through the spring Classics, the Tour de France and Critérium du Dauphiné, and the Tour of Britain. At the same time, Thomas had not raced a great deal between the Tour de France and the worlds, so he was effectively being asked to pick himself up for one more big race at the end of a long season, which proved impossible. Steve Cummings was also under-raced, while of the two riders who should have had the best form coming out of the Tour of Britain, Josh Edmondson crashed and Sir Bradley Wiggins's heart did not seem to be in it.</p><h2><strong>2 None of the team had ridden the Tour of Spain</strong><br /></h2><p>Nine of the top 11 finishers in the world championships had ridden the Tour of Spain to build the deep levels of stamina required for the tough Florence circuit, although not all had completed the Vuelta (Fabian Cancellara, Philippe Gilbert, for example), with the two weeks between the Madrid finish on 15 September and the world title on 29 September clearly enough for the super-compensation effect of finishing a major Tour to kick in. Of the British, only Luke Rowe rode the Vuelta, and he pulled out early with illness. In Copenhagen during 2011, on the other hand, Britain's three standout performers, Stannard, Wiggins and Froome, had all completed the Vuelta. It is not an absolute rule that competing in the Tour of Spain is the best way to prepare for the worlds – the winner, Rui Costa, and sixth-placed Peter Sagan did not race it – but it underlines that the British squad's buildup was less than ideal.</p><h2><strong>3 British eyes are fixed too intently on the Tour</strong><br /></h2><p>Team Sky's focus since their foundation has been the Tour de France, pretty much to the exclusion of all other goals, a trend which has gained strength with the successes of Froome and Wiggins. That is logical for the sponsor, given the exposure the Tour brings – and it is logical for Sir Dave Brailsford as attention to detail is more likely to be rewarded in stage-racing than in one-day races, which are far less structured – but it impacts on the world championships in two ways. It's hard for a rider like Froome to maintain top form from early June to late September – Alejandro Valverde and Joaquim Rodríguez, who also did well in the Tour came good only in the final week of the French race, clearly having in mind that they would be starting the Vuelta a few weeks later. Sky's approach means the team have not built a culture in which one-day racing is given the significance it merits. The team's attempt this year to perform in the spring Classics was patchy, beyond a fine ride by Stannard in the Milan-San Remo. The problem with the Tour's predominance over the Classics at Sky is that one-day racing demands a very particular skillset and the riders do not seem to be acquiring it.</p><h2><strong>4 Incorrect tactical choices</strong><br /></h2><p>Great Britain's attempt to control the race in the opening kilometres reflected the fact that they like to race from the front, something which has worked well for Froome and Wiggins in stage races. In a hilly one-day race it's less certain to succeed; the key is to know precisely when to put the hammer down, as the Italians and Belgians showed in Florence. From Froome's explanation afterwards, it seems that he is ill at ease if he has no team-mates around to keep him out of trouble. If he is to shine at a world championships he will need <em>domestiques</em> capable of going at least to the final 40km.</p><h2><strong>5 Great Britain underestimated the task</strong></h2><p>GB were unlucky in that two riders who might have done well on this circuit given the right buildup, Peter Kennaugh of the Isle of Man and the Yorkshireman Ben Swift, were absent because of injury, but Froome either underestimated the toughness of the race or over-estimated his form – and here, his relative inexperience in cycling at the highest level and at one-day racing probably comes into play. The one mystery is Wiggins, who was clearly fit – if his placing in the time trial is anything to go by – and who can race in the rain. However, there is an important difference between keeping out of trouble in the rain in the Tour of Britain, with a dominant team around you and victory beckoning, and doing so in the far more aggressive environment of a world championships. The national jersey and professional pride should make the difference in the latter circumstance, but clearly they didn't.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418658514|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|65ffee5d2a9aca9281a1753151679279524d285f -->",

        "body":"<p>Simon Clarke was the only Australian to finish a brutal world championships road race in Italy on Sunday with the Victorian digging deep to claim a prized top-10 place.</p><p>Clarke crossed the line seventh just 34 seconds behind winner Rui Costa of Portugal who covered the rain-soaked 272km route in seven hours and 25 minutes.</p><p>The Spanish pair of Joaquin Rodriguez and Alejandro Valverde had the numbers to take out the title but, in the end, had to settle for silver and bronze respectively.</p><p>The treacherous conditions on the Tuscan roads caused countless crashes that took out many of the race favourites including 2009 world champion Cadel Evans at the halfway mark.</p><p>Australia's other main hope, Richie Porte, came down before the peloton even hit Florence and was subsequently distanced on the first of 10 laps of a hilly 16.6km circuit.</p><p>Just three Aussies didn't crash: Clarke, road captain Mathew Hayman and domestique Rory Sutherland.</p><p>\"Conditions were just unbelievable,\" Clarke, 27, told reporters at the finish. \"We couldn't have had worse luck. Richie crashed on the way to Florence and then there was that massive stack after the second climb [on the second lap].</p><p>\"The guy was coming past me and hit the barriers and I knew I had Cadel, Michael Matthews and [David] Tanner on my wheel and I thought 'That was it'. Then I got the information later that I was the only one left.\"</p><p>Clarke said when he realised he was flying the flag solo, he decided: \"I just really wanted to go well for Australia and make up for the bad luck\".</p><p>Hayman was the last Australian to abandon with five laps still to race. Cameron Meyer and Sutherland climbed off after four of the 10 laps while the rest of the nine-man team had to park their bikes even earlier but despite being isolated, Clarke did everything right including riding towards the front of the ever-dwindling main bunch up each climb.</p><p>Clarke was competing at his ninth world championships. \"It's experience,\" he said. \"You can't trade that for anything.\"</p><p>Some 200 riders started in Lucca but just 61 finished in Florence. Evans and Tanner were taken to hospital for precautionary scans of leg injuries.</p><p>Evans later tweeted: \"Overheard in the radiology unit: 'If all the riders are here, who's in the race?\" The former Tour de France winner added: \"X-rays show nothing broken\". Tanner, too, is okay despite losing some skin.</p><p>Meyer on Sunday tweeted: \"I have never seen so many crashes in my life. Unbelievable conditions. Not a good day for the Aussies with 6 of us crashing.\"</p><p>Clarke rides professionally for Australian outfit Orica-GreenEdge and won the climbing classification at the 2012 Vuelta a Espana but Australian team director Brad McGee said his performance on Sunday was a coming of age.</p><p>\"He will now be etched into the rat pack of modern one-day race performers and that will be the level he will aspire to for the rest of his career,\" McGee said.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418593920|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|53beb88f10a715818dad8f64a2b4a0ec033b8f84 -->",

        "headline":"Tour de France: how Team Sky climbed to the top and stayed there",
        "body":"<p>There is a new joke doing the rounds among cycling fans: British Tour de France winners are like London buses. You wait years for one to come along, and then you get two, one right after the other. Two British victors of cycling's toughest event back to back might seem an outlandish idea, but Dave Brailsford, Team Sky, Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins have managed to make it seem routine at the same time.</p><p>In July 2009, Team Sky was merely a series of spreadsheets, random jottings, and what the team's founders term \"brain dumps\" as Brailsford and his associates tried to figure out how to start a professional cycling team. They had little idea of what they were getting into. But this July Froome started as the overwhelming Tour favourite, led the race from the end of week one, and never looked likely to be beaten. Wiggins did exactly the same in 2012.</p><p>It has taken four years, but that is not a coincidence: four years is an Olympic cycle, the time frame in which British Cycling, the UK's governing body, and its performance director, Brailsford, have tended to function since the arrival of lottery funding into the sport in 1997. Britain's Tour de France domination stems directly from its record Olympic medal hauls, which drew in the big money from Sky – James Murdoch is an active cyclist and turns up to races intermittently – and gave Brailsford the knowledge base from which to climb cycling's Everest: the Tour.</p><p>The Sky goal was to dominate road cycling using the same methods that had brought Olympic success, most notably the \"aggregation of marginal gains\", where every area is examined in minute detail for possible improvement, and the cumulative effect of many small gains gives a considerable advance on the opposition. Sky would also use the people-management principles devised by Steve Peters, the \"mechanic of the mind\", a psychiatrist who had worked at Rampton mental hospital.</p><p>The first year was a struggle. The \"marginal gains\" that Sky brought to cycling initially made it the butt of derision. Its special set-up at time-trial stages, with non-slip matting laid out so the cyclists wouldn't slip in their custom-made carbon-fibre soled shoes, took hours to set up – and other teams would laugh at them as they toiled away.</p><p>Attempts to use weather modelling to locate training camps and decide Wiggins' start time in a Tour time trial fell spectacularly flat. Staff would moan about the extra effort it took lugging the riders' custom-made bedding in and out of hotels every night. There were tensions among riders and staff, with European hirings struggling to fit in with British Cycling's methods. Key members left; there were complaints about constant meetings.</p><p>The ridicule and mutterings lasted only as long as it took for Sky to start winning, and since the end of 2011 it has been a trail of success, not just in the Tour but in other stage races. By then Sky's training guru, Tim Kerrison, had begun putting together a radical programme that is at the root of Wiggins and Froome's successes: intense training at high altitude, reverse periodisation, which turned the idea of a gradual buildup to the Tour on its head, less racing and more training.</p><p></p><p>Rod Ellingworth, Sky's performance manager, and Kerrison put together a method of internal communication based on dropboxes, to compensate for the fact that Sky's 80 personnel were spread around Europe. Advanced planning and logistical systems were put in place. More training staff were hired, so that, uniquely in professional cycling, Sky's riders benefit from one-to-one training on a constant basis. \"You can see from this team how much you can get by investing relatively small amounts in coaching,\" Kerrison has told the Guardian. \"The gains are disproportionate.\"</p><p></p><p>Kerrison's computer modelling of the Tour's athletic demands meant the team could target precisely what training was needed to win the Tour.</p><p>There has been no let-up on the marginal gains front. The team's dietitian, Nigel Mitchell, has been a constant presence on the race, monitoring every gram the riders consume, including the fish oils, and fruit and vegetable shakes that are Sky staples. The fruits of Froome's work in a wind tunnel could be seen in his time-trial success and in the bursts of speed on the climbs that won him the race. And the Olympic link is as strong as ever: two of Sky's key team members, Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh, were gold medallists at the \"Pringle\" in London.</p><p>On Saturday, Froome spoke about his personal journey to Tour de France success, from pounding dirt tracks in Kenya as a teenager when he was unaware La Grande Boucle even existed. But the voyage taken by Brailsford and his cohorts from callow tyros to Tour tyrants is equally remarkable. The Sky head said before the Tour that in 2010 he would have given his right arm to see one of his cyclists make the podium in a major Tour; now the cycling world is scrabbling to catch up.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413308338|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|287c3df4789c5615fdd93dae0768373719affe27 -->",

        "headline":"Eddy Merckx: this much I know",
        "body":"<p><strong>My parents taught me honesty</strong> and respect for other people. When I was at school I&nbsp;wanted to go to the Côte d'Azur for holidays, like my schoolfriends. We went to the North Sea. My father, who was a grocer and one of 11 children, said: \"Don't look to those who go to the Côte D'Azur, but look to those who can't go the North Sea – keep your feet on the ground.\"</p><p><strong>I wanted to be a cyclist</strong> from the age of four. I listened to the Tour de France on the radio during the holidays. My teachers said: \"That's not a job\", but I was the Belgian amateur champion at 16 [he won 445 races as a pro].</p><p><strong>My earliest memory</strong> is my first crash on a&nbsp;bike. It was when I was four. My legs were going faster and faster until, in the end, they couldn't keep up with the pedals and I&nbsp;crashed spectacularly.</p><p><strong>The closest I have come to death</strong> was when I had my crash at the Blois outdoor vélodrome in central France in September 1969. I'd just won the Tour de France and I&nbsp;was racing behind my pacer, who was on a&nbsp;Derny [a custom-built motorbike]. He&nbsp;crashed into another bike and was killed. I&nbsp;hit him at full speed. I flew through the air, landing head first. I&nbsp;had nothing on my head – just sponge and leather. I twisted my hips and injured my back and I was never the same. I&nbsp;was always in pain, and still have treatment on my back every two months.</p><p><strong>I heard Sir </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/21/bradley-wiggins-never-ride-tour-de-france-again\" title=\"\"><strong>Bradley Wiggins</strong></a> made £6m last year. I'm not jealous about that, because I&nbsp;don't understand why cyclists aren't paid as much as footballers or tennis players or golfers, but if I could have made £6m in a&nbsp;year I wouldn't have ridden as much. You had to ride a lot back then to make money. When I started, I got a jersey and some equipment. Sometimes I would get the equivalent of €25 to enter a race and €15 prize money.</p><p><strong>I don't know how many races</strong> I was in over the years [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/mar/16/eddy-merckx-william-fotheringham-review\" title=\"\">Merckx</a> competed in 1,413 races from 1966-77], but in 1975, the year I lost  the Tour de France, I did 195 races. I was racing everywhere.</p><p><strong>They called me the Cannibal.</strong> It was a&nbsp;young girl, the daughter of my old Peugeot teammate Christian Raymond, who gave me the name. We were on the start line and Christian said to her: \"This guy won't let us win anything – he wants everything for himself.\" She said: \"So he's a cannibal.\"</p><p><strong>When you are number one, </strong>the pressure is on you. It's not only physical but mental. You&nbsp;become tired.</p><p><strong>Cycling is a good school for life.</strong> It makes you hard and gives you ambition, but you can never say you've arrived.</p><p><strong>I don't like it when people say </strong>I was the best ever. It's silly. I am not the best ever. I was the best of my time. You cannot compare generations. There was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/may/31/fausto-coppi\" title=\"\">Fausto Coppi</a> after the war, Anquetil, Hinault, Indurain, Fignon. I&nbsp;never rode for the glory. I rode because I&nbsp;like cycling and winning. But not to say I am the best.</p><p><strong>I made a big mistake in 1975</strong>, when I had a&nbsp;crash in the Tour de France and broke my jaw [he was also punched by a spectator but still finished second]. I should have retired from the race. I was exhausted.</p><p><strong>I am 68, but still ride every week</strong> with some friends, maybe 60km at a time, but we enjoy a glass of wine and some parma ham afterwards.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411601601|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|df651deb0e04a36862b65e8ff3f8c38ebf26aac7 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"The Tour De France,\" said Antoine Blondin, \"is a mobile village – an anarchy with its own laws and customs, a territory 30 kilometres long and as wide as the road, ruled by a mayor who is Jacques Goddet. The laws of France cease to operate. The gendarmes are there not to enforce the laws of the state but the laws of the tour. Goddet can perform marriages like a sea captain. No one, not even de Gaulle, would dare raise his voice in anger if Goddet shot down a Russian or American who had violated his air space.\" He said it in jest before a leg of the Tour and after following it for a day, I believe him.</p><p>Jacques Goddet, executive director of <em>L'Equipe</em>, stood in his long British colonial shorts with a toupee on his Alec Guinness head, administrating the start of the night stage of the Tour with the calm of a district commissioner receiving a tribal delegation. Journalists gazed at him through mouthfuls of seafood and Muscadet, admiring the man who had conceived and modernised the Tour, which an American journalist once described as the best piece of organisation since the North African landings.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411915571'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/6/27/1372341315690/jacques-goddet-001.jpg' alt='jacques goddet' width='200' height='198' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jacques Goddet, director of the Tour de France and founder of the daily newspaper L'Equipe. Photograph: Gamma-Keystone</figcaption></figure><p>At the off that strange whirring noise of 130 cyclists began to eat up the road to Bordeaux. Behind them, team cars covered with advertisements and spare bikes with their wheels spinning against a background of yacht masts in La Rochelle harbour and to the left of them a stampeding horde of journalists and photographers. Goddet's co-director leads the riders while he sits just behind, calling up the team cars to change a puncture – done at Le Mans speed – or hauling a red flag up his aerial to stop following cars from passing the cyclists when the road is too dangerous or narrow. It was always dangerous and mostly narrow. If there was no room to pass on the road, the cars mounted the pavements and gave the spectators a thrill by sandwiching them on the kerb.</p><p>Italian car horns blared through the peaceful French countryside and one was glad that the Protestant facade of La Rochelle had been rid of the all-conquering Latin vulgarity of the Tour.</p><p>The road runs arrow-like over the undulating East Anglia-esque flat lands by the Atlantic, before it turns inland through the Romanesque vineyards of the Gironde and on down to Bordeaux.</p><p>All of France seemed to be picnicking. Peasants hacked at bread and cheese or brought out antiquated telescopes, soldiers had the day off and while provincial bourgeoisie sat at their respectable tables, forks in their hands and transistors in their ears. For a journalist perhaps the greatest elation of all is the feeling known best to heads of state of riding a convertible, standing up on the seat at full speed through the villages and acknowledging the cheering of women and children. General MacArthur on his recall from Korea.</p><p>If you looked behind at the straining hordes and incredible pace of the cyclists, you were soon deflated by their superlative physical condition; the brown, wind-polished limbs and the teamwork of getting a competitor back in the crowd as three of four team-mates slip-streamed the stricken rider from in front and the team car virtually pushed him from behind. The stage to Bordeaux is normally boring except that it is the last before the mountains and often won by a Dutchman. The Pyrenees, which lie ahead, will sort out the real competitors before they reach Barcelona on Saturday evening.</p><p>Nobody quite knows why the Dutch win at Bordeaux, perhaps the final effort of the \"platlanders\" before the Pyrenees or the celebration of arrival on familiar terrain after the Pyrenees – whichever way the Tour is run.</p><p>Of three Italians, young Felipe Gimondi is in the lead, with Adorni and Motta well placed. Some feel that Poulidor, the French favourite, who is now in second, has already won. Poulidor himself said: \"The mountains are our chance and we're going to seize it,\" he said. The Spaniards think otherwise. \"The Pyrenees,\" said the great climber Bahamontes, \"will be an entirely Spanish recital.\"</p><p><em>This is an edited extract</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411679059|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|a81b80260ff4b630684fbaed0934b15604a10e68 -->",

Obree, described as a genius by Sir Chris Hoy, possessed huge natural talent and drive, but a series of factors – not least his refusal to touch the drugs then prevalent in the sport – cut short his career in the 1990s and he slipped into relative obscurity and intermittent depression.</p><p>Now at 47, he plans to try for the world human-powered land speed record on a machine which he rides head first, just above the ground. If that wasn't enough, the bike was almost entirely built in his kitchen from recycled parts, including metal from an old saucepan.</p><p>The idea that a self-built steel-framed creation, which Obree estimates cost around £1,000 to build, could tackle the 82.8 mph record set in 2009 by a Canadian rider using a computer-modelled, carbon fibre-shelled recumbent machine, seems ludicrous. But this is well-trodden ground for Obree, one of the more creative, bloody-minded and enigmatic characters in British sport.</p><p>The Ayrshire-based rider achieved fame from seemingly nowhere in July 1993 when he broke the world one-hour cycle distance record at a Norwegian velodrome, using a self-built bike, Old Faithful. This incorporated a self-created, highly aerodynamic tuck position as well as, famously, ballbearings borrowed from a washing machine.</p><p>Obree retook his record the following year, also winning a track world championship title on Old Faithful. When cycling's governing body, the UCI, outlawed the tuck stance, Obree came back with an equally creative alternative, the stretched out \"Superman\" position, to win another world title.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411531352'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/25/1372165923377/Graeme-Obree-1996-Olympic-010.jpg' alt='Graeme Obree 1996 Olympics' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graeme Obree competes during the preliminary round of the men's individual pursuit at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>That was where it ended. It is arguably paradoxical to describe a man whose autobiography, The Flying Scotsman, was made into a film staring Jonny Lee Miller, as an unsung hero, but Obree never notched up the titles and fame of his peers, such as Chris Boardman.</p><p>Obree's sole Olympics, in 1996, saw him exit in the preliminary rounds. His career with a French professional road cycling team lasted one day. Obree has always maintained he was sacked when he made it clear he would not use drugs.</p><p>He has endured a turbulent personal life, affected by self-criticism and depression, eventually diagnosed as bipolar disorder. Obree came out as gay a couple of years ago, something he says has contributed to his happiness. His decision to do so is still relatively unusual in professional sport.</p><p>He reinvented himself as an author and a speaker, and just over two years ago began plotting an attempt at the human-powered bike speed record. Rather than adapt one of the feet-first recumbent bikes traditionally used for such bids, Obree, typically, started from scratch.</p><p>The result is the Beastie, in which the rider lies face down and head forward, with his or her feet powering a pair of narrower push-pull levers rather than conventional pedals.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411531353'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/6/25/1372166249301/Graeme-Obree-001.jpg' alt='Graeme Obree' width='220' height='424' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graeme Obree on the sea front in Ayrshire in 2007. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>\"The idea came from first principles,\" Obree said. \"The widest part of the body is the shoulders, so if you think about a teardrop shape it makes sense to have that at the front, and the feet‚ with the push-pull, meaning they just miss each other at the narrowest part, at the back.</p><p>\"The first thing I had to do was the basic outline of the structure. The body's the one thing you can't change. Everything else was built around that mechanically.\"</p><p>The Beastie was built mainly in Obree's small flat in Saltcoats, Ayrshire, with excursions to a friend's workshop. The steel frame came primarily from old bikes, and as many other components as possible were recycled. Stainless steel from an old saucepan became part of a shoulder rest.</p><p>Such a process was necessary, given the innovative design. Obree said: \"It was one of those things where I didn't know exactly what I wanted until I could see how it came into shape. If you're building it yourself you can make all the fine changes as you go along. If it's done by someone else, when it comes back you'll go: 'Oh, that's wrong,' and it could take weeks to fix. But doing it myself, in my own flat, the same process could take an hour.\"</p><p>Obree has tried out the machine once, wobbling to a modest 30mph or so on a runway at Prestwick airport, without the aerodynamic fairing, as he got used to the low-slung machine's twitchy ride. \"The main thing was, once I was launched I could hold a relatively straight line,\" he said. \"That's good to know. I'd say the test was pretty successful in terms of mechanical parts working. The skin's fine, the bike's steerable, nothing fell off.\"</p><p>In September Obree and the Beastie will decamp to a super-smooth, high altitude road in Nevada for the annual World Human Powered Speed Challenge. He is promising nothing. \"All I can do is go and give it a good punt,\" he said. However, a record would bring renewed recognition.</p><p>The temptation is to create a narrative in which this would be vindication for a man denied the celebrity of Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins thanks to petty officialdom and the endemic drug taking of early 1990s cycling. <a href=\"http://road.cc/content/news/36717-graeme-obree-interview-part-2-doping-olympics-uci-regulations-and-future-projects\" title=\"\">Obree, typically, doesn't see it that way</a>.</p><p>\"In a lot of ways I wouldn't like to be as famous as Bradley Wiggins. I think that would be totally awful, actually, getting stopped in the street everywhere. I get it occasionally but it's quite polite, it's nice. It's not a crowd of people around you, like Chris Hoy gets. I wouldn't want that level of fame.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, Obree says he is glad the post-Lance Armstrong cycling era is more ready to hear his story: \"I've got no regret about not taking drugs. But I obviously wonder how I'd have got on at the Tour de France. That was what I was lined up for. But that wasn't my overriding goal from the start, my goal was a world record, so I got that, and the world championships. The Olympics got away, obviously. And it would have been great to get Olympic gold and, say, a Tour de France stage win. But hey ho.</p><p>\"And you know what? I escaped with my health and my honour. In a lot of ways I don't have any regrets.\"</p><p></p><h2>An innovative man</h2><p>To get a sense of the extent to which Graeme Obree likes to re-think the very fundamentals of his sport, consider his self-penned 2012 training manual, The Obree Method. Inside is an entire chapter about how to adapt your breathing so as to absorb more oxygen (it's all to do with the out-breaths).</p><p>Craig MacLean, who competed on the velodrome for Britain at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, recalls first meeting Obree at track competitions in the early 1990s.</p><p>\"He thinks about everything in a very unconventional way. There's some ideas about training he gave me which I still use today. Cycling is almost like a big experiment for him.</p><p>\"He was a bit of a maverick around that era. Cycling was very much a traditional sport ‚you only ever rode fixed gear in the winter and you had to do a certain number of miles before you were allowed back on your normal road bike, all these things that had been around since the dark ages. But he always did things differently.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411524674|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|75c489993af79bb5d76532bc16180e7afbfbfa79 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sir Bradley Wiggins has left the Giro d'Italia to return home to recover from the severe cold and chest infection that ruined his hopes of winning the first Grand Tour of the 2013 season.</p><p>He had been lying 13th overall, but the writing was clearly on the wall when he was left behind by the peloton during Thursday's rain-soaked stage into Treviso, losing three minutes.</p><p>\"We monitored Bradley overnight and this morning we've withdrawn him from the Giro after consulting the team doctor,\" the Team Sky head, Dave Brailsford, said on Friday. \"His chest infection has been getting worse and our primary concern is always the health of our riders. Bradley will return to the UK today for treatment and to rest and we hope to have him back on the road as soon as possible.</p><p>\"As a passionate racer he wanted to continue but he is simply unable to do so on medical grounds.\"</p><p>Team Sky had said that a decision would be taken first thing on Friday depending primarily on Wiggins's health but also on the weather, as further rain would be certain to affect him adversely. Rain was forecast for Friday morning in Emilia Romagna, the location of the stage start, together with winds gusting to 40km/h.</p><p>The risk was that by continuing to pursue what had become a lost cause, Wiggins might create more problems for his health in the long term. A prompt withdrawal at least means he can return for the Tour de France; there are opportunities for him to return to competition before then, including the Tour of Switzerland in late June, but the team will wait for a complete recovery before deciding on his programme.</p><p>Wiggins had made the sign of the cross to cycling fans at the finish of Wednesday's stage in Fruili; even though he was able to hang on to the leaders, he admitted that he had been ill for several days and had been taking antibiotics. He had limited his time loss on the first severe mountain-top finish of the race on Tuesday to just 37sec, inspiring hopes that he might still tilt for the podium.</p><p>The most likely cause for Wiggins's sickness is the rough weather which has followed the Giro as it has travelled from the south of the country to the north. While some cyclists thrive in the wet and cold, Wiggins has always been open about the fact that he is susceptible to such conditions.</p><p>The wet weather hit the Giro 10 days ago, on stage four, and Thursday was the fourth stage run in rain and cold; Wiggins had lost time on stages four and seven in the grim conditions. The forecast for the weekend's Alpine stages is for snow, with speculation that Sunday's finish on the Galibier will be cut short.</p><p>Wiggins was not the only winner of a Grand Tour from 2012 to quit the race; before the Briton's departure was confirmed, Garmin-Sharp announced that Hesjedal would not start Friday's stage. The Canadian had suffered immensely on Tuesday's stage in Friuli, and like Wiggins, the three-hour run on to the Veneto plains on Thursday proved too much for him.</p><p>\"There's a virus that's been going around, so it could be that, or severe allergies – whatever it is, I'm only getting worse,\" said Hesjedal in a statement released by his team. \"Yesterday's stage was just too much for me, I fought to get through it but after seeing the medical staff last night, I also know that its time for me to go home, get some tests done and get healthy again.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409034147|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|3a58b4b91abfac1c3dc2dcbcf40de2a62f51004a -->",

        "body":"<p>The US government has filed court documents laying out its case against cyclist Lance Armstrong, who is accused of defrauding the Postal Service by taking millions of dollars in sponsorship money while flouting professional cycling rules by doping. </p><p>The US department of justice is joining a whistleblower lawsuit brought in 2010 by Armstrong's former teammate, Floyd Landis, and on Tuesday the department filed its formal complaint. </p><p>Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and was banned for life from cycling in 2012 after accusations he had cheated for years. In January he said the accusations were true in an interview with television host Oprah Winfrey. </p><p>Armstrong and his teammates from Tailwind Sports were paid US$40m by the Postal Service from 1998 to 2004, according to the lawsuit. Armstrong's salary during that time, excluding bonuses, was $17.9m, the complaint says.<br /> <br />The government is suing under the False Claims Act and can recoup up to three times the amount it lost as a result of the fraud. The complaint also alleges breach of contract, unjust enrichment and fraud. </p><p>An attorney for Armstrong said the complaint was opportunistic and insincere. \"The US Postal Service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship of the cycling team. The USPS was never the victim of fraud,\" said attorney Elliot Peters in a statement. \"Lance Armstrong rode his heart out for the USPS team and gave the brand tremendous exposure during the sponsorship years.\"<br /> <br />The complaint echoes Landis's claims that Armstrong and others defrauded the US government by falsely denying the doping accusations and continuing the sponsorship relationship with the Postal Service. </p><p>When the government believes a suit has merit, it may take over the litigation. The individuals, or whistleblowers, get a portion of the proceeds if the case is successful. </p><p>The US complaint accuses Armstrong of using at least one prohibited substance or method in connection with every Tour de France between 1999 and 2005. \"Moreover he knew that his teammates were engaged in similar doping practices, and he actively encouraged and facilitated those practices,\" the complaint says.</p><p>\"The United Stated suffered damage in that it did not receive the value of the services for which it bargained.\"<br /> <br />A lawyer for Landis, Paul Scott, said in statement that he was \"pleased to see the United States take this important step toward recovering taxpayer dollars lost to fraud\".<br /> <br />The case has been filed the US district court for the District of Columbia.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407736960|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|52921a9e794f6bfb5543c33b28de549ba9453d4c -->",

        "headline":"Chris Hoy to retire from cycling after 13 years on top",
        "body":"<p>Since the London Olympics last August, and the magic moment on \"Super Tuesday\" when Sir Chris Hoy edged his front wheel in front of Germany's Maximilian Levy to seal the sixth Olympic gold of his career the question has been asked – when would the Scot retire?</p><p>Now it appears that after 13 years at the highest level, Hoy will confirm his departure from cycling on Thursday.</p><p>The rider, who is now 37, will make \"a major announcement\" at Murrayfield stadium in his native Edinburgh at noon. Hoy has been a proud Scot all his career and it seems entirely typical of that he should choose to make his official farewell not far away from the mouldering old wooden Commonwealth Games stadium at Meadowbank, where he made his debut in track cycling in the&nbsp;early 1990s.</p><p>Since 7 August, when he won keirin gold in London and was saluted as he left the boards by a guard of honour consisting of all the Great Britain team staff, Hoy has officially been contemplating his future with a view to continuing as far as the Commonwealth Games next year in Glasgow, at the new velodrome which has been named after him. That decision, he said last November, would depend on whether he felt his body would hold out.</p><p>Senior figures within British Cycling have, however, felt recently that he would be hanging up his wheels some time this year. One indication that he would be quitting competition came in the last few weeks when his press officer Charlie Reid, who has run his media engagements since the Beijing Games, was quietly moved to other duties.</p><p>Hoy has also been dealing with his newly launched bike range, and motor racing. Nothing has pointed to a resumption of training. At the world championships in Minsk in February, it was clear that the British sprint staff were looking for a new rider to take over Hoy's place in the team sprint.</p><p>It seems likely that Hoy has made the decision on two grounds: first, he is unlikely to make a better farewell than his spectacular gold medal in the keirin in London. If he were to continue to Glasgow next August, there would be a risk that a younger opponent might show him up. Given the reputation of the track head coach Shane Sutton for plain speaking, this may well have been&nbsp;put to him.</p><p>Also, in the runup to London, Hoy's body was buckling. It was kept quiet – for obvious reasons – but the updated version of his autobiography published after the Games made it clear that he was carrying a back injury between the world championships in Melbourne in April, and the Olympics.</p><p>Between Beijing and London he also broke a rib while weight training, and had a big crash at the Copenhagen World&nbsp;Cup in February 2009 that injured&nbsp;his hip.</p><p>Hoy's departure will mark the end of an era: he is one of the last members of the Olympic cycling team who competed in the distant era before lottery funding arrived in 1997 to transform the sport. He was one of a group of sprinters, together with Jason Queally and Craig Maclean, who were given funding soon after lottery cash arrived, and they broke through at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 with a silver medal in the team sprint to go with Queally's gold in the kilometre time trial. Since then he has spearheaded the British squad's rise to world domination.</p><p>Hoy's first world titles came in 2002 in Copenhagen, where he triumphed in the kilometre, and he followed that up with gold at the discipline in the Athens Olympics. When the time trial was dropped from the Olympic programme he reinvented himself as a keirin and match-sprint rider in time for Beijing, using his immense strength to ride from the front in a dominating style that was completely novel at the time.</p><p>That earned him a spectacular hat-trick of gold medals at the Beijing Games, which in turn led to his election as BBC Sports Personality of the Year for&nbsp;2008. By this stage he was established as the father figure in the British track team, seen as the exemplar of commitment and discipline, as well as ultra-competitiveness, which was the template for the younger squad members.</p><p>By the run-in to London, Hoy's position in the match sprint was under threat from Beijing silver medallist Jason Kenny, and the younger man was given the nod in June.</p><p>But in April, Hoy had taken his fourth keirin world title in six years, showing when he emerged from the pack in a daring move on the final banking that he had broadened his skills, and could now win from almost anywhere on the track.</p><p>That epic moment set up what now looks to have been the final flourish, the&nbsp;highlight of the London velodrome racing in August. If Hoy confirms his departure on Thursday, that will have been one hell of an exit, befitting one of&nbsp;the greatest British Olympians.</p><h2>Hoy's golds</h2><p><strong>Olympic Games</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Athens 2004 </strong>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Beijing 2008 </strong>Team sprint (with Jason Kenny and Jamie Staff); keirin; sprint</p><p><strong>London 2012 </strong>Team sprint (with Jason Kenny and Philip Hindes); keirin</p><p></p><p><strong>World Championships</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Copenhagen 2002 </strong>1km time trial; team sprint (with Craig MacLean and Staff)</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2004</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Los Angeles 2005</strong></p><p>Team sprint (with Jason Queally and Staff)</p><p><strong>Bordeaux 2006</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Palma 2007</strong></p><p>Keirin, 1km time trial</p><p><strong>Manchester 2008</strong></p><p>Sprint, keirin</p><p><strong>Copenhagen 2010</strong></p><p>Keirin</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2012</strong></p><p>Keirin</p><p></p><p><strong>Commonwealth Games</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Manchester 2002</strong></p><p>1km time trial</p><p><strong>Melbourne 2006</strong></p><p>Team sprint (with Ross Edgar, and Craig MacLean)</p><p></p><p>Hoy has also achieved one Olympic silver medal, eight World Championship silver medals and nine world championship bronze medals.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407237443|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|f82936fc13ad123d9a58592c42968190f8b38402 -->",

Jorg Jaksche says on Monday that Dr Fuentes offered to help him obtain any performance enhancing drugs on the market including 'blood transfusions, EPO, anabolic steroids, IGF1, (and) artificial haemoglobin'",
