        "body":"<p>This week, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJXHDct6FWI\">Luciano Berio's Sinfonia</a>. Shurely shome mishtake? That's no symphony, I hear you cry! But Luciano Berio's 1969 magnum opus - still his single most famous and arguably most important piece - is precisely that: a symphony. \"Sinfonia\", after all, is Italian for \"symphony\", it's just that while we translate the titles of classical works by Mozart and Haydn that their composers called sinfonias into symphonies, with Berio's piece, we somehow don't bother. That gives \"Berio's Sinfonia\" a veneer of Euro-avant-garde exoticism, but it distances a crucial part of what the piece is doing from our Anglo-Saxon consciousnesses. This piece is an astonishingly <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Playing-Words-Sinfonia-Association-Monographs/dp/0947854002/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383550360&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=david+osmond+smith+berio\">intellectually rich</a> and  seductive commentary on the idea of the multi-movement orchestral work, and a labyrinthine musical-etymological analysis of the very notion of \"symphony\". </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421657649'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383578814841/Luciano-Berio-1993-002.jpg' alt='Luciano Berio, 1993' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Luciano Berio photographed at the opening of the Academie Universelle des Cultures, January 29, 1993.\n Photograph: Micheline Pelletier/  PELLETIER MICHELINE/CORBIS SYGMA</figcaption></figure><p>Composed for the New York Philharmonic originally in 1968 as a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7aKtpApxoM\">four-movement work</a>, but expanded to five movements the year after, Berio's Sinfonia takes as its starting point the notion, buried in the deep history of the symphony, of \"sounding together\". That's the Greek root of the word, after all (symphony is a combination of Greek words meaning \"sound\" and \"together\"), and it's why the genre got going in the first place: instead of single expressive or musical ideas being explored in individual movements, the 18th century symphony was all about combining different moods,  keys,  emotions. Berio simply - well, actually extraordinarily densely, but we'll come to that - takes that idea as the fundamental aesthetic principle of his Symphony, so that the work is about the sounding together of musical layers and textual references. It's a kaleidoscope of musical pasts and presents, including a collage of orchestral music from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcRyNRybeTA\">Beethoven to Stockhausen</a>, as well as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de_mTKjPqNU\">Berio's own oeuvre</a>. It's a symphonic palimpsest that's both obsessively, microscopically structured, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0SBy5y25OE\">completely open-ended</a> in the variety of responses it induces in its listeners.</p><p>So let's begin at the beginning: the piece isn't just scored for large orchestra, but includes crucial parts for eight amplified voices (at the premiere and many subsequent performances, the <a href=\"http://www.swinglesingers.com/\">Swingle Singers</a>). That allows Berio to include the entire range of vocal possibility as part of the soundings-together in the piece, from austere vowel sounds to spoken quotations from Samuel Beckett, the anthropologist <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mythologiques-Tome-Le-cru-cuit/dp/2259211003/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383550624&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=levi+strauss+cru+et+le+cuit\">Claude Lévi-Strauss</a>, self-reflexive commentaries on the performance as it's going along, and even excerpts from Berio's own writings. Berio's orchestra is a multi-layered reference machine that includes a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbmzU19Jwg4\">shadowy third section of violins</a> who play at the back of the ensemble behind the percussionists, as well as a couple of electronic organs and saxophones. </p><p>A \"reference machine\"? Here's what I mean - Berio's Symphony is a flabbergastingly rich strata of writings-on and writings-over that includes, but is not limited to, the following:<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9Vhr-C1Ef0\"> in the first movement</a>, the main textual material for the singers is Lévi-Strauss's pioneering work in the deep structures of myths from all over the world from which Berio chooses a sequence of myths and connections that focus on water and death. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xnonVCjKwc\">The second movement</a> is an amplification of Berio's own piece, O King, written in 1968 as a memorial to Martin Luther King; it's a musical meditation that circles around cycles of pitch and rhythm and puts Martin Luther King's name together from the individual phonemes that make up those words. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpeKkks2nOE\">The short fourth movement</a> returns to a world of myth and reflection, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlJCzgK0TDA\">the fifth movement</a> turns the rest of the piece itself into the basis of an even more extraordinary palimpsest that reviews, re-writes, and reconstitutes the rest of the piece into a seven-minute kaleidoscope that both sums up the project of this symphony, and opens up even more questions about what it all means. </p><p>And there's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW30g2tPmDA\">the third movement</a>, the Symphony's most famous section. It's notorious because this entire central panel of Berio's Symphony is written on top of the scherzo of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_NxhxPR6mE\">Mahler's Second Symphony</a>. The Mahler is inescapable because Berio makes his music the foundation of a spiralling chaos of quotations, allusions, and transformations of fragments of orchestral repertoire from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg2i2NB-i3o\">Ravel's La Valse</a> to Debussy's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLAIJjWdJRQ\">La Mer</a> and Stravinsky's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02tkp6eeh40\">Rite of Spring</a>, from Berg's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afYzbcMNDwo\">Violin Concerto</a> to Boulez's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyGe6tD9Vfw\">Pli selon pli</a>. And dozens of others. (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Playing-Words-Sinfonia-Association-Monographs/dp/0947854002/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383550360&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=david+osmond+smith+berio\">David Osmond-Smith's detective work</a> in tracking down nearly every reference in this movement is extraordinary and unsurpassed.) Sometimes the Mahler is right there in the musical foreground, almost exactly as it appears in the Second Symphony, at other times, Berio reduces Mahler's music to a skeletal framework of a melodic line, rhythm, or harmony. And at still other moments, it's obliterated by Berio's own idiom - as well as the near continuous textual and vocal polyphony of the eight singers, here mostly concentrating on words from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKBybTQ53F0\">Beckett's The Unnameable</a>. The structure of the scherzo is, however, always there in the background, and Berio preserves the shape and trajectory of the Mahler, however subcutaneously.</p><p>The question is: why? One answer is that Berio wants to reveal the essential palimpsest of listening that defines all musical experiences. Every time you hear a new piece of music, your brain is filtering it through the works you know already, and the images, experiences, and words that it calls to mind. One way of thinking about the Sinfonia's third movement is that it writes out that process. (Although in fact Berio's range of references was limited to the scores he could get hold while composing the piece - he was on holiday in Sicily and had to confine himself to what he'd taken with him and those in the public library.)</p><p>The other reason for the Mahlerian foundation of the third movement is that the Second Symphony's scherzo fits perfectly into the bigger programme of Berio's Symphony. Mahler's is a piece about water, existential futility, and by extension, death. It's also itself another palimpsest: the scherzo, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Playing-Words-Sinfonia-Association-Monographs/dp/0947854002/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383550973&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=david+osmond+smith+berio\">as David Osmond-Smith shows</a>, is not only an expanded version of a song that Mahler wrote setting a text from Des Knaben Wunderhorn about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdhY0s3GOtw\">St Anthony's</a> unfortunately pointless sermonising to the sinful fishes, it's also, in Mahler's own description, a tragic vision of a dance watched by an observer who can't be part of the revels. And - and! - Mahler's music quotes Bruckner's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwhmbK6Av_w\">Fourth Symphony</a>, Beethoven's violin sonata, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3zni6zz2lk\">op.96</a>, and a song from Schumann's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzaCBH9xl9Q\">Dichterliebe</a> that imagines a lover watching his  beloved marry someone else. Even before Berio's intervention, Mahler's scherzo is already multi-layered with musical and extra-musical meanings. </p><p>Often held up as pre-figuring a joyful postmodernism in music, the expressive effect of the third movement of Berio's Symphony is, I think, anything but an indulgent wallowing in the mud of musical history. There is a funny, punning reflexivity at the end of the movement when the singers list the performers and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKBybTQ53F0\">thank the conductor</a>, but the bleak quotations from Beckett and Berio's own essay, <a href=\"http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/doc/511056740.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul%2015,%201968&amp;author=LUCIANO%20BERIO&amp;pub=Christian%20Science%20Monitor%20%20(1908-Current%20file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=8&amp;desc=The%20composer%20on%20his%20work\">Meditation on a Twelve-Tone Horse</a> prove Berio's real point: to find a way of keeping going, going on, even if music \"can't stop the wars, can't make the young older or lower the price of bread\". Yet, \"There must be something else, otherwise it would be quite hopeless. But it is quite hopeless... Where now? When now?\" The true function of the third movement is revealed only in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0SBy5y25OE\">fifth movement</a>, when Berio really does go through the mirror and pulpate his whole Symphony in music that's a resolution and a dissolution of the entire work's modus operandi.</p><p>Berio's Symphony is a search for meaning that's endlessly renewed every time it's played or heard. If you haven't listened to it yet, throw yourself into the labyrinth right now; and if you have, listen again  - and again. You will always find something new, I promise. </p><h2>Four key recordings</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7aKtpApxoM\">Luciano Berio/New York Philharmonic Orchestra</a>: Berio's original recording of the 1968 version - incomplete, as it proved, but essential listening.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9Vhr-C1Ef0\">Pierre Boulez/Orchestre National de France</a>: Boulez gets stuck into Berio's historical revels, and the results are a revelation.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Berio-Formazioni-Folk-Songs-Sinfonia/dp/B00000E45Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383550015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=berio+sinfonia+chailly\">Riccardo Chailly/Concertgebouw Orchestra</a>: Chailly's account has a laser-like clarity even in Berio's densest textures of music and meaning.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJXHDct6FWI\">Simon Rattle/City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra</a>: this video of Sinfonia is a magnificently imaginative period piece with the singers of Electric Phoenix: why don't they film classical music like this any more?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421597882|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|5656843ce2c486d34d54fcadde3dd28f8df37159 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Hometown</strong>: East London. <br />   <br /><strong>The lineup</strong>: Azekel Adesuyi (vocals, music). </p><p><strong>The background</strong>: Azekel has a husky soul voice and the sleeve of his debut EP Circa is a homage to Otis Redding's 1966 album cover for <a href=\"http://(http://eil.com/images/main/Otis+Redding+-+Otis+Blue+%2F+Otis+Redding+Sings+Soul+-+LP+RECORD-511857.jpg\">Otis Blue</a>. So far, so conventional. But the 24-year-old producer and singer-songwriter adheres to a more recent tradition in the way he strikes a balance between classicism and modernism – the backdrop to his soulful meanderings is consistently electronic, spacey and spacious, the sort of sounds you'd hear on a record by James Blake, not James Brown. Voice and music aren't integrated quite as seamlessly as on those early Weeknd mixtapes, where both felt utterly contemporary. Here, Azekel is effecting a juxtaposition of old and new, that's his schtick, and it works well even though, as we say, this kind of move is becoming increasingly popular among young British gentlemen and will presumably be even more so in the wake of Blake's success at the Mercurys last week.  </p><p> <a href=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/10089365\">Reading on mobile? Click here to listen<br /></a><br />If the Weeknd, on House of Balloons et al, looked back at a series of last-nights, with himself as the protagonist still reeling from the immediate effects, Azekel casts back further in time and so the songs have a more meditative, reflective air. Each of the track titles on Circa has a year appended, because together they're designed to \"draw on a collection of memories from 2003 to 2013\", as the press release explains, \"from tales of unrequited love to the challenges of maintaining a relationship … Circa presents the story of his emotional growth\". So they range, in terms of chronology, from Be Mine '03 to In the Zone '13, although it's harder to make a similar measure in terms of his emotional development. Suffice to say that he sounds less hedonistic than hesitant throughout, wracked with uncertainty, assured only of his own failure and pain. Be Mine '03 feels relatively airy and optimistic, but even this one contains a germ of doubt: \"Don't you feel the same way, too?\" he pleads with his new lover. On Dockland Blues '05 there is the sampled sound of a young man crying, so already the EP feels like an elegy. Official '07 opens with deep and maniacal cackling, and a forlorn confession: \"We've already had a few dates, but I'm thinking always … this won't do.\" It's as downcast as you could want from downtempo music, only with enough production tricks and post-dubstep sleights of studio to offset the sense that this is glorified supperclub soul muzak. Azekel even samples Sade on No Ordinary Love '10, but his producers – including Youan, Blaksmif, Adelight and Vincent Perez – ensure things don't get too smooth.  </p><p><strong>The buzz</strong>: \"Simultaneously aqueous and intergalactic\" – Pitchfork.</p><p><strong>The truth</strong>: R&amp;B vocals and sentiments against a backdrop of flighty, futuristic electronica. <br /> <br /><strong>Most likely to</strong>: Bring to mind a dubstep Lewis Taylor.</p><p><strong>Least likely to</strong>: Win next year's Mercury – it's a band's turn. </p><p><strong>What to buy</strong>: Debut EP Circa is out now via Generator and THNDR LGHTNG. </p><p><strong>File next to</strong>: D'Angelo, James Blake, Lewis Taylor, Frank Ocean. </p><p><strong>Links</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.azekel.com\">azekel.com</a>.  </p><p><strong>Wednesday's new band</strong>: Laura Wilde.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421630230|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|5895b73a6501b1fdee447fc6ebe6c7cd3efa16ab -->",

        "headline":"Simon McBurney: The Age of Enlightenment",
        "body":"<p>Simon McBurney has a wild glint in his eye as he talks about his new version of The&nbsp;Magic Flute for the English National Opera. \"This is not&nbsp;something ossified by 200 years of productions,\" he says  during a break from rehearsals at London's Coliseum, a baseball cap pulled tight around his head. \"It's literally physically dangerous.\"</p><p>It is, too. During one of Mozart's trickiest quintets, the platform on which the singers are standing shudders and tilts up like the hull of a&nbsp;sinking ship. The Queen of the Night's three attendants, who've been&nbsp;trying to lure Prince Tamino, the&nbsp;hero, and his sidekick Papageno back to the dark side, slide towards oblivion – singing as they go. And then&nbsp;there's the Queen of the Night herself. With its breakneck coloratura and high Fs, her showpiece aria – <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/englishnationalopera/the-magic-flute-the\" title=\"\">The&nbsp;Vengeance of Hell Boils in My Heart</a> – is hard enough to sing while standing still. But here, she's rolling around in a wheelchair, wielding a knife and being pawed by her errant&nbsp;daughter, as does the impressive Cornelia Götz.</p><p>So why is the Queen of the Night in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wheelchair? \"There are lots of paradoxes in Mozart,\" says McBurney. \"She says she's losing her power. But&nbsp;then she goes on to sing one of the&nbsp;most demanding arias in opera. So&nbsp;if we're to treat what she says seriously, the question becomes how&nbsp;do we physically show her growing powerlessness?I thought the wheelchair would do that. By the end of&nbsp;the opera, she can hardly move.\"</p><p>McBurney, the award-winning 56-year-old founder of <a href=\"http://www.complicite.org/flash/\" title=\"\">Complicite theatre company</a>, who's appeared in&nbsp;The Vicar of Dibley and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teosebTsBSc\" title=\"\">Rev</a>, and had&nbsp;screen roles in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5p31OI_AMs\" title=\"\">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByjQG6aD4Co\" title=\"\">Harry Potter, came late&nbsp;to opera, and even later to Mozart.&nbsp;</a> \"For years, I wasn't in the least bit interested in opera,\" he tells me over&nbsp;a&nbsp;post-rehearsal drink. \"The productions were so wooden, the plots&nbsp;so fucking obscure, everything so&nbsp;fucking pointless. And I never got Mozart. I thought he was light, frothy,&nbsp;insubstantial.\"</p><p>With all due respect, I say, that's nuts. \"I know. I'm very slow and stupid, so I only gradually understand what's going on.\" He removes his baseball cap,&nbsp;and orders more crisps and a second glass of Talisker whisky. \"Mozart's seeming frothiness is just a&nbsp;light touch with very profound material. That's what I've found working on The Magic Flute.\" You didn't know this before you started work on it? \"No. It's always like that for&nbsp;me: a journey where you don't know where you're heading.\" That must be interesting for your actors and&nbsp;singers. \"Interesting, yes. It's pretty much always a diabolical pact for them. As it is for me.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421684874'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383644987718/Simon-McBurney-directing--001.jpg' alt='Simon McBurney directing the Magic Flute, ENO 2013' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'The Magic Flute  is fundamentally asking what is it to change people's consciousness.' Simon McBurney in rehearsal at English National Opera, October 2013. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>What audiences will see <a href=\"http://www.eno.org/flute\" title=\"\">later this week in McBurney's Magic Flute</a> is the&nbsp;ancien regime dying before them and the European Enlightenment struggling to be born. The wobbling, tilting, swinging, hovering  platform is a visual metaphor for&nbsp;humanity in crisis. After the Queen of the Night's attendants tumble off, the platform rights itself like a mechanised flying carpet, and Tamino and Papageno head off to endure further ordeals before they can get their girls and achieve enlightenment.</p><p>\"The Magic Flute, I think, is fundamentally asking what is it to change people's consciousness,\" says McBurney. \"What makes it evolve? This was an important question when this was first performed two years after the French revolution - and now. When we performed this in Amsterdam we got a big laugh when Sarastro says we're in a crisis. We were in 1791 and we are now.\"</p><p>On stage, Papageno is wondering aloud why he can't just get the girl without having to go through all this&nbsp;fuss: trials by fire and water, plus&nbsp;lewd propositions from scantily clad regal lickspittles. The opera's answer seems to be that you aren't in the Garden of Eden any more, sunshine, you're in a modern world where you  don't pull fruit from the trees or immediately receive the object of your sexual desire, but have to suffer, struggle and use your wits and rationality to get what you want. Even then there's no guarantee of success.</p><p>Yet the struggle is is our predicament, what makes us human rather than animal. This is the&nbsp;vision that fires McBurney. \"The opera is politically, philosophically and&nbsp;musically profound,\" he says. \"And sexual. I just got a text from Stephen Fry saying, 'Good luck with your flute. Oo-er.' Zauberflöte is German slang for penis. The opera's original audiences in 1791, when Die Zauberflöte premiered in Vienna, would have immediately grasped a lot&nbsp;of the resonances we struggle to understand. They'd have recognised the Queen of the Night's coloratura singing as old-fashioned, and her rival Sarastro's singing as something more modern. In a sense, she's the dying ancien regime, and he's the new dawn. They'd have got that political subtext from the music.\"</p><p>Traditionally, says McBurney, the second half of The Magic Flute was so dull you might nod off. It is unlikely to&nbsp;happen here. The pacing is snappy, the production dense with multimedia effects. A sound-effects artist in a glass chamber stage right makes a rustling noise echoed centre-stage as Papageno fumbles with a sweet wrapper. A video&nbsp;artist stage left projects images and directs the singers with arrows that appear behind them on a screen. And when the singers speak, they are mic-ed up so they can move more freely around the stage yet still be heard. When they sing, though, the mics are turned off. The sound design alone makes it one of the most technically virtuosic operas ever put&nbsp;on in London.</p><p>\"It's the most demanding production we've ever staged,\" says ENO artistic director John Berry. This co-production with <a href=\"http://www.dno.nl/home.php?&amp;lang=uk\">De Nederlandse Opera</a> (their engineers built the amazing hydraulic system) was performed in Amsterdam to rave reviews last year and now Berry is hoping for similar success. Berry is the man responsible for attempting to revive ENO by luring in celebrated directors (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/may/07/the-damnation-of-faust-review\" title=\"\">Terry Gilliam</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/27/dr-dee-eno-review\" title=\"\">Rufus Norris</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/20/mike-figgis-lucrezia-borgia-eno\" title=\"\">Mike Figgis</a> and of course McBurney) to work in opera for the first time. He's also the man who smiles when I mention <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/29/fidelio-eno-elektra-royal-review\" title=\"\">the boos that Calixto Bieito's Fidelio got at ENO</a> recently: \"Part of the territory.\"</p><p>It was Pierre Audi – former artistic director of London's Almeida and since 1988 artistic director of <a href=\"http://www.dno.nl/home.php\" title=\"\">De Nederlandse Opera</a> – who first persuaded McBurney to face down his operatic prejudice, proposing that he direct an adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov's absurdist novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/21/a-dogs-heart-eno-review\">Heart of a Dog</a> in a DNO-ENO co-production in 2010.  \"I love Russian literature,\" says McBurney, \"and I adore Bulgakov. I've long been fascinated by that pre-war Soviet era.\" Indeed, that fascination has yielded some of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRLwjkYROqw\">his and Complicite's best work</a>, notably 1994's adaptation of Daniil Kharms's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jan/01/theatre2\" title=\"\">Out of a House Walked a Man</a> (with an original score composed by his Russophile musicologist brother Gerard) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/mar/22/the-master-and-margarita-review\" title=\"\">2011's adaptation of The Master and Margarita</a>.</p><p>\"Once Pierre had got me sucked into opera, he kept mentioning The Magic Flute, saying I'd get a kick out of directing it. I thought, 'Bollocks.' Other opera directors warned me off, saying they couldn't see how to make it work.\" </p><p>So&nbsp;how is he making his production work? \"My proposition is that music is at the heart&nbsp;of what The Magic Flute means, that it's Mozart's music, not the words, we should be attending to. Music expresses what can't be expressed otherwise. It reminds me of the music&nbsp;of the Chukchi people of north-eastern Siberia.\"</p><p>Really? He gives me a sidelong glance. \"Oh yes. Really.\" McBurney recommends I listen to his choices for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/6ba7cd36\" title=\"\">Radio 4's Desert Island Discs last&nbsp;year</a>. Not I'm the Slime by Frank Zappa (though that is superb) or the fifth movement of Schnittke's Concerto Grosso (ditto), but  throat singer <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izS2W9q7tTY\" title=\"\">Veronica&nbsp;Oucholin's rendition of I Light&nbsp;the Fire</a>. At the time he told presenter Kirsty Young: \"I understood through my father [the late American archaeologist Charles McBurney] that&nbsp;in neolithic times, humans felt&nbsp;they were part of the world of animals and echoes of that time the vestiges, can&nbsp;still be heard today, which is why I've chosen this piece from the Chukchi people.\"</p><p>What's that got to do with Mozart? \"It's very simple. Mozart is saying: that which cannot be articulated otherwise can be expressed in music. The magic flute changes people and so&nbsp;do the bells. It's the great prophetic opera. All this is taken on by Beethoven, Wagner, Hitler, Stalin, maybe even the Beatles.\"</p><p>So now McBurney is in love with the&nbsp;art form he disdained. He and Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov are currently trying to create a libretto for an opera about which he will tell me nothing. \"I'm also planning to do operas with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/damon-albarn\" title=\"\">Damon Albarn</a> and the Pet&nbsp;Shop Boys, and maybe something involving Beethoven.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421684875'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383644448424/Magic-Flute-rehearsal-ENO-001.jpg' alt='Magic Flute rehearsal, ENO 2013' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The wobbling, tilting, swinging, hovering platform - a visual metaphor for humanity in crisis.  Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>But first Mozart. It would be absurd to judge a production on a single rehearsal, but one impressive and symbolic thing McBurney has done is to raise the orchestra from the pit to a level where the audience can actually see it. For once you'll be able to study the first clarinettist's dandruff from the cheap seats. It was <a href=\"http://www.authorama.com/opera-stories-from-wagner-12.html\" title=\"\">Wagner at Bayreuth who first shoved his musicians into the Nibelheim-like bowels of the Earth</a>.</p><p>\"For Wagner,\" says McBurney, \"that was about mysticism. I want to do the opposite – to take the audience from darkness to light, to make us evolve, to end mystification and embrace reason and rationality. That, as I understand it, is what the opera is about.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421641042|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|9fa679c12516c9647c43b3f82e05e94e82ccb772 -->",

        "body":"<p>My father, Mike O'Neill, a piano player and songwriter who enjoyed his heyday in the 1960s, has died of cancer aged 75.</p><p>Born in Lowton, Lancashire (now in Greater Manchester), the oldest of four brothers, he grew up in the 40s causing havoc as a child. He later took a job in the steelworks, but decided to teach himself the piano instead, eventually hitching his way to London, where he threw himself into the music business.</p><p>After playing with <a href=\"http://forgottenbands.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/colin-hicks-cabin-boys.html\" title=\"\">Colin Hicks and the Cabin Boys</a>, he fronted the instrumental group <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-04AiddUvAoc/Ts0kP1uaYKI/AAAAAAAAASI/-X5rjur2e2I/s1600/Nero%252B%252526%252BThe%252BGladiators%252B1960%252BWK.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://forgottenbands.blogspot.com/2010/10/nero-gladiators.html&amp;h=210&amp;w=240&amp;sz=1&amp;tbnid=LRmnKYeSWFhU-M:&amp;tbnh=175&amp;tbnw=200&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__V97gbI1G47R207P_jZ9ghQw-jDU=&amp;docid=NwqyqsuPZOQryM&amp;itg=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rLh3UvHfIMeb0wWr54AY&amp;ved=0CHoQ_B0wCg\" title=\"\">Nero and the Gladiators</a> who performed in togas and had hits with rocked-up versions of Entry of the Gladiators and In the Hall of the Mountain King. After leaving the band he went on to play with the Ivy League and the John Barry Seven and was a founding member of Heads, Hands and Feet with Tony Colton and Chas Hodges (of Chas and Dave fame).</p><p>A prolific session musician, Mike played with the Beatles, Jerry Lee Lewis, Dusty Springfield, Shirley Bassey, Deep Purple and Chuck Berry. He even jammed with Jimi Hendrix, who reportedly thought about taking Mike on as his pianist. Mike also played on Donovan's album <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gift-From-Flower-To-Garden/dp/B0000011N5\" title=\"\">A Gift from a Flower to a Garden</a>, toured with Joe Cocker and even gave Dire Straits their name.</p><p>Mike's childhood friend Clive Powell arrived in London and joined him in his flat in Old Compton Street, Soho, where he introduced him to jazz and the 2i's coffee bar. Powell then began to perform under the name Georgie Fame and recorded some of Mike's songs.</p><p>In the 70s, he drifted into theatre and was managing director with the 7:84 theatre company, where he met his wife, the actor Rachel Bell, whom he married in 1979, and worked with the playwright <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jan/24/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"John McGrath obituary\">John McGrath</a> and the actors Colm Meaney and Alan Ford. He later went on to work as a doorman at the Royal College of Art, becoming great mates with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/apr/22/obituaries\" title=\"Eduardo Paolozzi obituary\">Eduardo Paolozzi</a> – who swapped sculptures and prints with him in return for back copies of National Geographic, which Mike lovingly rescued from many a London charity shop.</p><p>He loved to paint and draw and was the kindest, most generous and good-hearted man you could ever hope to meet. He survived by Rachel, his two children, me and Daniel, and, most recently, his granddaughter, Frances.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421625162|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|45117a2962f6b6660c25d6f9e143caaad91e7e58 -->",

The fan site True to You – a reliable source for reports on the singer – posted on Sunday that he had been discharged from Cedar Sinai hospital and thanked medical staff for their \"outstanding level of care and attention\".</p><p>Although no details were given of how the injuries were sustained, the mention of whiplash has led to widespread speculation that he may have been involved in a road traffic accident.</p><p>It has not been the healthiest of years for Morrissey and his team. In January he was forced to cancel six US shows after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/28/morrissey-hospitalised-bleeding-ulcer-us\" title=\"\">suffering from a bleeding ulcer</a>. In March he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/12/morrissey-diagnosed-severe-pneumonia\" title=\"\">diagnosed with severe pneumonia</a>. Then in July he called off his South American tour, after his touring party was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/11/morrissey-cancels-south-american-tour-food-poisoning\" title=\"\">hit with food poisoning</a> in Lima, Peru, following a spate of cancelled shows in the continent. \"Morrissey and an entourage of about eight people ate at a restaurant that we had not recommended, with regrettable consequences,\" Rodrigo Perez, Morrissey's Chilean concert promoter, said at the time. \"Within hours, all of them fell sick with severe gastric problems … The hotel has become like an outpatient clinic. There are people who have not been able to get out of bed for 48 hours.\"</p><p>\"After such a victorious and uplifting welcome of Lima love, the contaminated jinx had its way via a simple restaurant meal of penne pasta and tomato,\" Morrissey wrote after the incident. \"[We] collapsed with a deadly and delirious bedridden disease.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421630231|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|ef465fc423e63ea73ee481ad360039c656878ad6 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"This is my gay bestiality song,\" <a href=\"http://www.lukesitalsingh.com/\" title=\"\">Luke Sital-Singh</a> says, introducing Luna to a crackle of laughter – an unlikely declaration from a bespectacled young singer-songwriter who comes across as so risk-averse you struggle to picture him smoking a cigarette. A romantic ode to a stranded killer whale he read about in the newspaper, written before he learned said whale was male, Luna is not exactly exhibit A in the case for this sensitive acoustic balladeer being tipped to \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/21/ben-howard-brit-awards-sales\" title=\"\">do a Ben Howard</a>\" – even its author concedes it's \"a shit idea for a song\". But it evidences the kind of funny levity Sital-Singh brings to his live show, lest the burning sincerity of his music prove a bit&nbsp;much.</p><p>Touring a trilogy of accomplished EPs, this native of the south-west London suburbs – just like, hark the omens, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/john-martyn\" title=\"\">John Martyn</a> – promises to mean a great deal to a lot of people. He has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/18/new-band-luke-sital-singh\" title=\"\">hailed as the British Bon Iver</a>, but his music is pitched squarely at Radios 1 and 2. Think Damien Rice meets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/07/keaton-henson-review\" title=\"\">Keaton&nbsp;Henson</a>.</p><p>Sital-Singh's most impassioned moments sound like the music for American TV drama montages. During Inaudible Sighs, he clutches at the breast of his shirt to emphasise the line \"a terrible fear in my chest\". Elsewhere, his lyrics find him wanting to \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNlnZrvRKxA\" title=\"\">download the sky</a>\" and \"lose my life to the love I&nbsp;find\". It is great if you like that kind of thing, though it does underscore how a more opaquely poetic turn of phrase can unlock a more meaningful truth.</p><p>A refined lyrical approach could prove deadly in combination with his supremely confident and controlled voice. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53NC_aRQzC0\" title=\"\">Nothing Stays the Same</a> has a ripping, wordless vocal hook crying out to be bellowed by festival masses. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKKrlthkBzA\" title=\"\">Fail for You</a> could erode mountains of cynicism with its heartfelt paean to loving commitment, sung in a trembling tenor that swoops and falls between a&nbsp;whisper and a roar.</p><p>• Did you catch this gig – or any other recently?

Listen here</a></p><p>When Lover Lover recorded their forthcoming debut album, There Is a Place, there were three of them – singer Eleanor Bodenham and producers Martin Craft and Nick Littlemore, the latter of Empire of the Sun and Pnau fame. For reasons none of them are willing to go into, there now remains only one. Having started the band in Paris, before relocating to London and then the American desert, Bodenham is the sole remaining original member. It's this sense of journeying mixed with a palpable melancholia that makes Lover Lover's songs so engaging, specifically this album highlight, Lakeshore Line, premiered here. \"I make my best friends these days out of people I don't know,\" sighs Bodenham as the Fleetwood Macesque lilt unfurls beneath her – all sun-dappled melodies, nagging hooks and that lovely sense of hope that comes from just ploughing on through. In fact, it would be the perfect soundtrack to a long, mind-clearing drive, as Bodenham admits: \"It's like when you learn to drive for the first time and take an old car out on your own. You've got nowhere to go and nowhere to be. But it's a hot night and the sun is going down and all the windows are open and you're listening to something that makes your eyes melt.\" That latter part might sound a bit distressing, but Lakeshore Line is the sort of song that will make you cry-smile your way through to the other side. <br /><br />There Is A Place is out on 18 November via Cross Keys Records.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421625548|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|5e98c1412e3c3cf5f4ccec35ad738309b0bfd2cd -->",

Watch here</a></p><p>Girls' Generation's full <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GirlsGeneration\">biography on their Twitter page</a> runs to five words: \"Asia's No 1 girl group\". Anything more would be superfluous. Fans of the hyper-energised, neon-coloured South Korean form known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/kpop-stars-lowdown-south-korean-pop\">K-Pop</a> – and there are millions around the world – already know exactly who Girls' Generation are. Winning video of the year for I Got a Boy at last night's inaugural <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/nov/04/youtube-music-awards-chaotic-debut\">YouTube awards</a> has ensured that millions more now do.</p><p>The nine-member group is the product of the rigorous South Korean pop training system – they were assembled in the mid-noughties by <a href=\"http://www.smtown.com/link/audition\">SM Entertainment</a> as a companion act to its successful boyband Super Junior. (Psy and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/16/big-bang-review\">Big Bang</a>, the best known Korean acts outside Asia, were trained by the rival YG Entertainment.)  They've since become a multi-platform colossus, generating millions of dollars from records, endorsements and tours. And their reach is global: their candy-flavoured electropop, best experienced while watching their giddy videos, transcends language barriers (in any case, they tend to sing choruses in English).</p><p>Having two San Francisco-born members – Stephanie \"Tiffany\" Hwang, who represented the band at the YouTube awards, and Jessica Jung – has made them more relatable for non-Asian markets, though the US itself hasn't quite tumbled. An appearance on David Letterman's show in 2012, performing the English-language single The Boys, evoked comments such as <a href=\"http://travel.cnn.com/seoul/play/what-will-us-think-girls-generation-481595\">\"Just saw a bunch of really hot Asian chicks on Letterman\"</a>, but not much of a sales bounce, apart from on Billboard's \"world albums\" chart.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/girlsgeneration/the-boys-music-video/1163687/#\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p><p>The audience at last night's awards, which were held in New York, apparently didn't quite get them either. When their name was announced, there were a few cheers, but mostly silence. Partly, you infer, it was because they were competing with mega homegirls Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus (as well as Psy and the Bieber), but there was probably also a failure to grasp what Girls' Generation are about. I Got a Boy, a volcano of pink wallpaper, halogen lights and sugar-rush dancing, is hard to comprehend for an audience accustomed to videos predicated on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8\">sex and outthrust tongues</a>. I Got a Boy's main selling point is its wholesomeness: the girls may be wearing pleather miniskirts and lycra hotpants, but the tenor is incredibly innocent. They go no further with the \"boy\" of the title than holding hands; the only sexual frisson comes when he ties one of the girls' shoelaces, and she flutters her lashes, chastely overwhelmed. It may just be too much for Americans, but it makes for a very different, and worthy, winner.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421628566|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|738cd53647d6c86013ee44cb4c239b63ce647ade -->",

        "body":"<p>Patti Smith has paid tribute to Lou Reed in <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2013/11/11/131111ta_talk_smith\" title=\"\">a eulogy published by the New Yorker</a>. She recalled the first time she saw the Velvet Underground play, at Max's Kansas City in Manhattan: \"I loved to dance, and you could dance for hours to the music of the Velvet Underground. A dissonant surf doo-wop drone allowing you to move very fast or very slow. It was my late and revelatory introduction to Sister Ray.\"</p><p>Smith does not skirt over the nature of Reed's personality, and writes about how intimidating he could be in the mid-70s, when the Patti Smith Group were building their career. \"A complicated man, he encouraged our efforts, then turned and provoked me like a Machiavellian schoolboy. I would try to steer clear of him, but, catlike, he would suddenly reappear, and disarm me with some Delmore Schwartz line about love or courage. I didn't understand his erratic behaviour or the intensity of his moods, which shifted, like his speech patterns, from speedy to laconic. But I understood his devotion to poetry and the transporting quality of his performances.\"</p><p>Smith wrote that when she had last seen Reed, earlier this year, she had sensed he was ill: \"When Lou said goodbye, his dark eyes seemed to contain an infinite and benevolent sadness.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/loureed/perfect-day-music-video/2077556/#\" title=\"\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p><p>In the 1970s, in conjunction with writing music and poetry, Smith also reviewed albums. In one memorable piece for Creem magazine in 1974, <a href=\"http://www.oceanstar.com/patti/poetry/velvet.htm\" title=\"\">she reviewed the posthumously released Velvet Underground album Live 1969</a>. \"It goes beyond risk and hovers like an electric moth,\" she wrote. \"There is no question no apologising there is just a trust a bond with time and god their relentlessly relaxed method of getting it on and over the land of strain. Like Rimbaud we rebel baptism but you know man needs water he needs to get clean keep washing over like a Muslim. Well this drowning is eternal and you dont have to track it lambkin you just lay back and let it pour over you. Dig it submit put your hands down your pants.\"</p><p>Reed died on Sunday 27 October, which – Smith wrote in her eulogy – was the birthday of Dylan Thomas and Sylvia Plath. \"Lou had chosen the perfect day to set sail – the day of poets, on Sunday morning, the world behind him.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421608278|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|88cd36844675b3112f0872191b2f510fab0115b8 -->",

        "headline":"Jake Bugg: 'You never forget where you're from'",
        "body":"<p>Early afternoon in Austin, Texas, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/jake-bugg\" title=\"\">Jake Bugg</a> is perhaps having cause to regret one of his most famous lyrics. It's the line from \"Two Fingers\", one of five singles he released last year, that goes: \"Skin up a fat one, hide from the feds…\"</p><p>\"Our bus got pulled over by the cops in Arizona,\" mutters the 19-year-old, freshly arrived in one redneck state from another. Luckily his touring party had somehow \"had word\" in advance that they might be subject to a&nbsp;police search, so had taken some precautions. A&nbsp;sniffer dog came aboard. Twice. Its nose led to Bugg's luggage. \"But they pulled it out, opened it, and all me laundry exploded out,\" he says, smiling, in his broad Nottingham accent. Nothing else emerged. \"I never have weed in my suitcase.\"</p><p>At the same time, the easygoing amiability of Britain's best new singer-songwriter since the emergence of Noel Gallagher was winning the day. \"I was getting on really well with this state trooper, so it would have been awkward if they'd had to arrest us.\" Awkward indeed. \"They said: 'We know it's on here, but we can't find it.'\"</p><p>In the end, Bugg thinks the friendly \"feds\" tipped him a wink and did the British youngster a favour. \"They said: 'Well, you've just come from California, so we'd expect your bus to smell of marijuana.'\"</p><p>Now, in blazing Texan heat, Bugg – dressed all in black and firmly buttoned up in a Harrington-style jacket – is considering what lies ahead. Today on the singer-songwriter's itinerary: a teatime slot at the <a href=\"http://www.aclfestival.com/\" title=\"\">Austin City Limits festival</a>, another pit stop in a world tour that has lasted, more or less, for a full 18 months. Tomorrow, two flights to reach Mexico City, where the guitarist and his two-piece band are performing at the giant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2012/nov/30/corona-capital-festival-mexico\" title=\"\">Corona Capital event</a>, a few notches beneath headliners Arctic Monkeys. Then home to the UK, an appearance on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/dec/13/alan-carr-chatty-man\" title=\"\">Alan Carr's <em>Chatty Man</em></a>, production rehearsals, and straight into a sold-out British tour.</p><p>He will land at Heathrow a year to the day from the release of his self-titled first album. It entered the charts at number one, making Jake Bugg – 18 at the time – the youngest British male in chart history to debut at the top. Over the following 12 months he picked up a Brit nomination, a place on the Mercury Music Prize shortlist, Olympic ubiquity (his song \"Lightning Bolt\" was the obligatory soundtrack for any Usain Bolt highlights package), support slots with the Rolling Stones and Stone Roses, a celebrity girlfriend (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/cara-delevingne\" title=\"\">Cara Delevingne</a>, although the relationship was short-lived) and worldwide album sales topping 1m.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421485428'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383133107609/Jake-Bugg-portrait-shot-008.jpg' alt='Jake Bugg portrait shot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>‘I’d never been out of England before I went on tour last year’: at Zilker Park, Austin, Texas. Photograph: Julian Broad for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>Not bad for a quiet, undemonstrative lad playing old-fashioned skiffley blues, albeit rebooted with lyrics clawed from an inner-city childhood in very modern Britain. The product of a broken home, Bugg grew up in Clifton, Nottingham, once the biggest housing estate in Europe.</p><p>As the immigration officer at Dallas/Fort Worth airport said to me: \"Ah, Jake Bugg… He's the new Dylan, right?\" Or, he's Gallagher writing for the La's. Either way, he's a phenomenon, and Britain hasn't seen a young artist like him in yonks.</p><p>Backstage at the Austin festival, the compact, poker-faced moptop cuts a curious figure amid the vest-wearing, extravagantly tattooed American rock fraternity. He's had two solid summers of playing Glastonbury, T in the Park and multiple fields in between. Does Jake Bugg enjoy music festivals?</p><p>\"Not particularly. It's either too hot or it's too cold,\" he replies in his default monotone.</p><p>What about touring in general? In spring last year, not long after signing a record deal, he embarked on his first run of support gigs, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/michael-kiwanuka\" title=\"\">Michael Kiwanuka</a> in Europe. \"That was really cool. I'd never been out of England when I did that tour. The first place I&nbsp;went to was Paris. And I did <em>not</em> like it.\"</p><p>All that fancy foreign muck?</p><p>\"That was a toughie, getting into the food,\" he acknowledges.</p><p>These exchanges are typical Bugg. But his scowling demeanour isn't really the whole picture, as that Arizona lawman would attest. It's partly a defence mechanism against the fannish hysteria that increasingly attends his every move. And it's partly a put-on, a grumpy-kid act that amuses him and everyone around him.</p><p>Once you get to know Bugg, he's hilarious, airily dismissive of most of his peers (\"Arctic Monkeys? I love the second record. I ain't had a proper listen to the new one, but what I've heard I haven't been a big fan of\") and pithily aware of the status success has brought. \"I like my clothes and I like to look smart,\" admits this recipient of piles of free clobber courtesy of high rollers such as Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry's Christopher Bailey. \"But I'm not someone who gets absorbed in the fashion world, 'cause it can get very controversial,\" he adds. This could be him being ironic, or could be a reference to his brief experience of that scene when he went out with model Delevingne – much to the tabloids' titillation (\"When posh totty meets pop grotty,\" snarked the <em>Sun</em>).</p><p>Today he frowns like a trooper when I bring up his ex. When we spoke earlier this year, just after their split, he was still confused by the whole paparazzi-friendly blip in his private life. \"I knew, obviously, that people wanted to take photos of her 'cause, you know, she's all over the world. But it was just confusing for me – what you gonna get out of getting a picture of me? What the fuck do you want from that? I'm just gonna smoke a fag and stand here!\"</p><p>When the mood takes him, Bugg can appear reserved to the point of taciturn. Left to his own devices, \"I'd just be in my bedroom, writing tunes,\" he admits. \"I try and be productive with my spare time.\" Yet over the last year, \"I've met a load of new friends and a lot of cool people. And they introduce you to people and you learn to be more sociable. You kind of have to be, doing this,\" he says, gesturing to the tape recorder sitting on the table next to his ever-present packet of fags. \"Especially in America – there's no point doing the promotion if you're not gonna smile your way through it. But I do have to give myself a slap every day, tell myself how lucky I&nbsp;am. This is what I&nbsp;always wanted to do.\"</p><p>Bugg has been in America loads this year, including a short stint making his second album. Yes, a scant year after releasing his first, and despite touring nonstop ever since, Jake Bugg has found time to write and record a follow-up.</p><p>It's called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/12/jake-bugg-second-album-completing\" title=\"\"><em>Shangri La</em></a> and is named after the studio in which it was recorded: the oceanside California base of super-producer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/rick-rubin\" title=\"\">Rick Rubin</a> (Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Neil Diamond, Adele, oh, <em>everyone</em>). And it's fantastic. Two highlights: \"Song About Love\", a glorious ballad – think Nick Drake meets Gram Parsons – and \"Messed Up Kids\", another street-real account of life in his hometown: \"Johnny deals a bit of blow on the side, thinks that he's invincible, hates a fight/Jenny walks the streets alone, she was fine, but she got kicked out of her home in hard times…\"</p><p>\"With that song,\" Bugg says, \"I thought I&nbsp;wasn't gonna sing any more stuff about coming from where I come from, and being as observational as the first record. But it was actually quite interesting to view things from a different perspective after everything that's happened. And to go back to where I'm from and have one last look.\"</p><p>Technically, Bugg is currently homeless. On the brief occasions he's in London he stays in hotels. He's been considering buying a flat for a while, but hasn't had time. His possessions – apart from a burgeoning collection of guitars – amount to the three suitcases he's lugging round the world, and some boxes stored in a music rehearsal space in the capital. But he did make it home to Nottingham this summer, if only to headline a local music festival, <a href=\"http://www.splendourfestival.com/\" title=\"\">Splendour</a> – two years after opening its smallest stage.</p><p>\"In the crowd there was a girl on some lad's shoulders that I went to school with for years. And she always said to me: 'I'll never get your music – why do you listen to that crap?'\" he smiles, referring to his adolescent love of Don McLean, the Everly Brothers and Johnny Cash. \"And she was singing all the words to the songs. That was mad.\"</p><p>The visit also inspired \"Messed Up Kids\". \"That wasn't the reason for my visit; that was just kinda what I stumbled on when I went back for one last look. That was quite interesting. And quite weird. Nottingham's a place that I know better than anywhere in the world, but I've been away from it for such a while.\"</p><p>Does he still feel connected to it? \"Yeah, you never forget where you're from. But I spent so much time there – I lived there all my life – and there was a big world out there, and I wanted to see it.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421485427'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383133608388/Jake-Bugg-on-stage-at-Zil-008.jpg' alt='Jake Bugg on stage at Zilker Park' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>‘I think I can come across as a bit of a twat, to be honest’: Jake Bugg onstage at Zilker Park. Photograph: Julian Broad for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>Hence, in part, the work ethic that has produced two albums in one year. I spend five days with Bugg, in Texas and Mexico, and he's clearly a grafter, turning in quick-fire radio interviews and acoustic singalongs galore. He's also hugely entertaining company, generous and welcoming and straightforward. He likes his music, his band and crew, his football, his weed, his table tennis, his clothes, and that's pretty much it. As both a lad and as an artist, Jake Bugg is proper.</p><p>That said, \"I think I can come across as a bit of a twat, to be honest,\" he admits with a hint of a smile. \"I got a couple of tweets not long ago – 'Jake Bugg, you make great music but why do you have to be such a&nbsp;douche?'\"</p><p>They don't think he's a douche in Mexico. At the airport Bugg is met by a proper boy-band fan crush. At the Corona Capital festival he's greeted with a deafeningly rapturous audience reaction and two offers of marriage. As he saunters offstage, I ask how that was for him.</p><p>At first Bugg gamely tries to maintain his cool. \"Awright,\" he replies with a shrug, his T-shirt sticking to him with sweat. \"Decent,\" he adds. Then the lips twitch into a full smile. \"Pretty fucking mental. It was insane, all the&nbsp;singing along. Was not expecting that.\" He's clearly chuffed to bits.</p><p>In Texas I had asked what he cares about. He had thought for a minute before deciding on family and friends, \"obviously. I think the purpose of life is for it to be lived. And sometimes I think to myself when I'm really knackered: why am I doing this? You're doing it 'cause you love travelling the world and playing music. When my time passes, I don't necessarily want to be remembered. But if there was some slight way you could make a slight change that's better for the world, then I'd feel like I've done something with my years.\"</p><p>Jake Bugg, then: a wise – and staggeringly talented – head on young shoulders. Although the boy himself doesn't think he's that young any more.</p><p>\"I've aged terribly in the last year!\" he said. \"I went back to England recently and didn't get ID'd at either pub I&nbsp;went to. And you have to look over 25 now, which makes it even more annoying.\"</p><p>Shangri La<em> is released on 18 November</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421275620|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|8072f8e11e45b06ecac08929e8b1f3ceceb3dca4 -->",

        "headline":"Lady Gaga: 10 things we learned from hearing ARTPOP",
        "body":"<blockquote class=\"quoted\"></blockquote><p>On Tuesday, Lady Gaga's new album ARTPOP – the first since 2011's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/18/lady-gaga-born-this-way-review\">Born This Way</a> and her recent time off from pop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/30/lady-gaga-hip-replacement-scare\">following a hip injury</a> – will be streaming in full via a mobile phone company's website, six days before its official release date. Last week a bunch of journalists – including yours truly – were crammed into a studio in central London to hear the whole thing once at ear-splitting volume. Below are the 10 things that became immediately apparent, including stuff involving sex, weed, mistaken forays into trap and massive bloody choruses. </p><h2>She wants to take you behind the veil</h2><p>On the album's bizarre opening track, the Mariachi-goes-EDM stomp of Aura – initially called Burqa when an early demo leaked online – Lady Gaga wants to lift the curtain on life as Gaga. \"Do you want to see the girl who lives behind the aura?\" she asks. I imagine most people's response to that would be: \"We've seen quite enough, thank you very much,\" but actually it would be quite nice to know a little more about the \"real\" Lady Gaga – the person – as opposed to Lady Gaga, One of the Most Famous People on the Planet. The song, however, appears to be a slightly muddled insight into gender politics and women's control over their own bodies (\"My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face\" is her rather glib summation of a complex situation), that suddenly ends with the chant of \"Dance. Sex. Art. Pop. Tech\", which is at least a handy guide to the themes of the album and app.</p><h2>The themes are writ large</h2><p>Being a professional journalist I made notes during the playback and next to the title of each song I wrote down a list of the themes covered. Here's what I came up with: gender, identity, love, sex, fantasy, money, fame, media, representation, art, labels, fashion, materialism, drugs, loneliness, narcissism. That's a pretty broad scope of things to write about and yet the themes are plastered all over the songs in giant neon letters, which on the one hand works brilliantly on songs like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pco91kroVgQ\">Applause</a>, the Vanity 6-esque strut of Sexxx Dreams and the excellent G.U.Y, but when the songs aren't good enough to support the weight of the clanging metaphors (the almost parodical, self-produced <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP3ctBs3510\">Venus,</a> the cluttered Mary Jane Holland, the terrible Fashion!), it all just feels a bit empty.</p><h2>ARTPOP could mean anything</h2><p>In fact, she says as much herself on the title track: \"My artpop could mean anything.\" In a way, that idea of making bold statements with little substance behind them has been her biggest issue post-Born This Way, when she attempted to heal the world of its confidence issues through the medium of song. It's easy to forget amongst the clatter that she's just a pop star, and I mean that in the most brilliant sense of that job title. By calling the album ARTPOP she appears to have set the bar too high in terms of concept, and if her point is to celebrate the vacuousness and malleability of it all then perhaps it should have been called POPART.</p><h2>She still know how to write an amazing chorus</h2><p>But, one thing Lady Gaga isn't is stupid and ARTPOP stays very true to the second part of that awkward compound word. Almost every song comes with at least five hooks and two choruses, sometimes crowbarred into the song's jackhammer production (Aura's lovely \"do you want to see me naked\" pre-chorus, Venus's \"When you touch me I die, just a little inside\" bit), or finessed with all the grace of the woman who wrote one of pop's greatest moments, Bad Romance, on a tour bus in the middle of the night. Sexxx Dreams and the R Kelly-assisted <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3jzMyYgPQs\">Do What U Want</a> are both futuristic, electro-tooled R&amp;B slow jams with delicious choruses, while Gypsy – the only song here to feature input from long-term collaborator RedOne – is an epic narrative about fame and loneliness bolted onto an Edge of Gloryesque electropop rush that features a brilliant vocal riff that's up there with \"p-p-p-poker face\".</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/ladygaga/applause-music-video/2004572/#\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p><h2><br />She should steer clear of trap</h2><p>Jewels N Drugs was introduced at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/02/lady-gaga-review-london-roundhouse\">Gaga's recent iTunes gig</a> with a lengthy speech about how she's not going to be limited to just one musical genre thank you very much. Unfortunately, it's an example of why she should probably steer clear of trap. It opens with the sounds of an orchestra tuning up, then suddenly lurches into the sort of dated, drum-clap-heavy beat that's plagued hip-hop for the last five years and features not one but three rappers (TI, Too $hort and Twista). It's basically about how she doesn't want a man's jewels, but she would like their drugs, and would have made an interesting curio but probably should have been left off the album.</p><h2><br />Lady Gaga enjoys having sex</h2><p>As well as metaphorical and sometimes literal drugs, ARTPOP focuses a lot on sex and how enjoyable it can be. G.U.Y stands for Girl Under You and opens with a spoken word bit about \"Eros, god of sexual desire\", while Sexxx Dreams features the line: \"When I lay in bed I touch myself when I think of you.\" There's also an amazing bit in the latter song where she says \"I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple of drinks\" and it sounds like it was covertly recorded during a drunken game of truth or dare. MANiCURE (ie cured by a man in a sex way), meanwhile, includes the line: \"Touch me in the dark, put your hands all over my body parts.\" The sex chat is a nice change from the more heavy-handed stuff and also a nice reminder that she's a person with urges who gets drunk and does things she might regret in the morning, but is having a nice time doing them.</p><h2>She loves her fans more than smoking weed</h2><p>Throughout the album there's a lot going on – sonically, lyrically, thematically – and it can all get a bit messy and cluttered. The album's one real moment of calm is DOPE, which was originally titled I Wanna Be With You and was described at the iTunes gig as an ode to her fans and how much she missed them while she was off with a bad hip. Produced by Rick Rubin, it's the album's most tender moment, with Gaga's voice recorded close so that it sounds like she's (slightly drunkenly) singing in your ear. Over piano and a distant synth hum, she sings \"I know I fucked up again, because I lost my only friend,\" before moving on to a more direct reference to her \"little monsters\" by saying \"my heart would break without you\" and the chorus of \"I need you more than dope.\" The latter feels like a slightly less impressive comparison then say \"I need you more than air\" or \"I need you more than all the money in the world\", but as the preceding Mary Jane Holland will tell you, Gaga's quite a fan of the weed.</p><h2>Being famous can be difficult </h2><p>As well as DOPE, there are a couple of other songs that deal with the problems of being a famous singer of songs. Applause is about the not-exactly-relatable rush of people clapping for you and how hard it was when she couldn't get that fix because of her hip operation, while the excellent Do What U Want could easily be read as a love song and also about critics and internet \"haters\" (\"Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me, if you're wondering know that I'm not sorry\"). To be honest, R Kelly's verse is solely about sex and features the line \"I can be the drink in your cup\". Gypsy deals with the loneliness of fame in a much more direct way and is built around the hook, \"I don't want to be alone forever, but I love the gypsy life\". By the end, however, she seems to have found some sort of compromise as she sings \"see the world with me\", before listing the countries she could take her man (presumably on her next world tour).</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu2ZDpY66nk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p><h2>She's a fan of fashion</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Lady Gaga enjoys fashion and making statements with the things she wears. Oddly, it seems like she feels people need reminding of this fact and so there are a couple of songs about that. In typically subtle fashion, these songs are called Donatella and Fashion! (the exclamation mark is important because she's already released a song called Fashion). The oddest of the two clothes-based curios is Donatella, which opens with Gaga putting on a faux-stupid accent and intoning \"I am so fab, I'm blonde, I'm skinny, I'm rich and I'm a bit of a bitch,\" before the album's worst lyric (even worse than Venus's \"Uranus, don't you know my ass is famous\") emerges in the first verse: \"Walk down the runway but don't puke – you had a salad today, boulangerie!\" If it's a tribute to the designer then it's very odd, and if it's a satire it's a bit too obvious. Fashion!, meanwhile, is saved only by its Daft Punk circa Discovery filtered guitar riff.</p><h2>Applause sounds great as an album closer</h2><p>Because you clap for things when they've finished. Duh.  </p><p>• ARTPOP is released on 11 November as an album and an app.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421477270|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|90ea53c87e8c01d23af271eafe96781812c745c9 -->",

We can answer your needs, with our stream of the fourth studio album from Wooden Shjips, San Francisco's pre-eminent exponents of the the best possible use of a couple of chords.</p><p>Guitarist Ripley Johnson tells us: \"For Back to Land, we decided to look back a little bit, to let our childhood influences, mostly classic rock, seep into the sound of the album. Part of that came from moving into a proper home for the first time in years, in a new city (Portland), and getting all of my old records out of storage. Something about winter in the northwest encourages self-reflection, introspection, so that played a bigger part in the process as well.\"</p><p>Despite the instropection, though, we think there's a brightness to his new record: whatever Johnson's self-reflection, the music here is outward looking, without ever losing touch with the Shjips' psychedelic roots. Let us know what you think.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421614700|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|a23353b2ee96434907e5be342f6320ee9357166b -->",

The fan site True to You – a reliable source for reports on the singer – posted on Sunday that he had been discharged from Cedar Sinai hospital and thanked medical staff for their \"outstanding level of care and attention\".</p><p>Although no details were given of how the injuries were sustained, the mention of whiplash has led to widespread speculation that he may have been involved in a road traffic accident.</p><p>It has not been the healthiest of years for Morrissey and his team. In January he was forced to cancel six US shows after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/28/morrissey-hospitalised-bleeding-ulcer-us\" title=\"\">suffering from a bleeding ulcer</a>. In March he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/12/morrissey-diagnosed-severe-pneumonia\" title=\"\">diagnosed with severe pneumonia</a>. Then in July he called off his South American tour, after his touring party was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/11/morrissey-cancels-south-american-tour-food-poisoning\" title=\"\">hit with food poisoning</a> in Lima, Peru, following a spate of cancelled shows in the continent. \"Morrissey and an entourage of about eight people ate at a restaurant that we had not recommended, with regrettable consequences,\" Rodrigo Perez, Morrissey's Chilean concert promoter, said at the time. \"Within hours, all of them fell sick with severe gastric problems … The hotel has become like an outpatient clinic. There are people who have not been able to get out of bed for 48 hours.\"</p><p>\"After such a victorious and uplifting welcome of Lima love, the contaminated jinx had its way via a simple restaurant meal of penne pasta and tomato,\" Morrissey wrote after the incident. \"[We] collapsed with a deadly and delirious bedridden disease.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421630231|2013-11-05T11:03:52Z|ef465fc423e63ea73ee481ad360039c656878ad6 -->",
