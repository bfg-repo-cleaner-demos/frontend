        "body":"<p>I'm all for delayed gratification. I will book theatre tickets six months ahead. I will take a shoulder of lamb, stud it with anchovies and garlic and half-submerge it in a broth of red wine, stock and piggy bits, so that it looks like the ravaged island of Dr Moreau, shove it in the oven and know it will have nothing of any interest to say to me for at least seven hours.</p><p>What I won't do is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/03/eat-out-queue-for-table\" title=\"\">queue for a hamburger</a>. In this, it seems, I am peculiar. Recently London's Covent Garden has seen the opening of the US operations Shake Shack and Five Guys. We also have home-grown outfits like Meat Liquor, and Burger and Lobster, which seem to regard reservation policies as bourgeois affectations. In the sense that bookable tables suit people with jobs, interesting lives and places they need to be which don't include standing dead-eyed and wet-lipped on a chilly pavement for the running time of <em>The Godfather Part III</em>, I suppose they are. And yes, it's not entirely new. The Hard Rock Cafe has long been famous for its queue, but that was so odd it was a tourist attraction, something people pointed and laughed at. The new queueing has got completely out of hand. It's taken for granted. I have wandered past these places on numerous occasions and been baffled. What in God's name possesses anyone to stand in an endless line – I've been quoted more than two hours for Burger and Lobster – for a lump of ground beef between two sugary buns?</p><p>Of course it's not just a lump of ground beef, is it? Over at the Shake Shack it's \"our proprietary Shack blend\" which makes it sound less like lunch and more like a haemorrhoid ointment; at Five Guys it's \"hand formed burgers cooked to perfection\". Really? Whose version of perfection, given that Westminster Council is trying to outlaw any burger served less than medium? Or completely buggered, as it's known.</p><p>I'll go that extra 10 miles to eat well. I'll cross London to secure an ingredient, take a flight to eat at the right restaurant. But queue? That's not an expression of greed. It's stamp-collecting. It's trainspotting. It's eating out as spectator sport. Except the only thing the queue has to spectate upon is itself, and there it finds validation: standing in line for a hamburger must be entirely reasonable; just look at all the other people doing it.</p><p>The counter-argument involves the P word: patience, and my total lack of it. Apparently patience is a virtue. Really? If everybody was patient, nothing would ever get done. The world depends on restless, impatient people. I should also point out that patience is one of the seven great Christian virtues. Nobody with an appetite should ever sign up to those. Obviously some are OK. I believe fully in humility. I am brilliant at that, do it better than anybody else. But chastity and temperance? Don't be silly. That's the point. Queuing for a burger is not about eating. It's about self-denial. And doing the restaurant's marketing for them by standing outside.</p><p>Me? I will go somewhere that serves a slightly less impressive burger and in so doing, trade a little of the perceived quality of the Shake Shack object of desire, for living more of my life. I've only got one of those, and I'm not wasting it in a queue.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421828691|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|4b3ef3429e53b630d10c1f8a057f6a070b28ee4f -->",

        "headline":"It was hard to stomach David Cameron preaching austerity from a golden throne",
        "body":"<p>At a state banquet for the new Lord Mayor on Monday, David Cameron gave a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/11/david-cameron-policy-shift-leaner-efficient-state\" title=\"\">speech about his commitment to the cause of permanent austerity</a>. He stood up to speak from a golden chair, and read his notes from a golden lectern.</p><p></p><p>As it happens, I was at the banquet too and heard the news about permanent spending cutbacks for myself. Sadly I was not there as a dignitary, a foreign diplomat, a captain of industry or the director of a big City firm. I was there as a waitress. The contrast between what he was saying and where he was saying it seemed initially almost too laughable to get worked up about. But actually, it reflected something chilling in Cameron's attitude towards the people he purports to be working for.</p><p></p><p>I work evenings and weekends at an events company. The company is great and the hours are flexible, which allows me to combine it with my main job of an internship. It's tough, and I've been in a state of semi-tiredness for the last two months. I do get to work at interesting events, though, and the fanciness of the Guildhall banquet was breathtaking. Although, as one of my colleagues said: \"I thought Boris Johnson was the lord mayor, that's the only reason I agreed to work!\"</p><p></p><p>The guests enjoyed a champagne reception, and then were served a starter (\"a celebration of British mushrooms\"), a fish course and main course of fillet of beef, all served with wine of course. In the break before dessert, coffee, dessert wine, port, brandy and whisky were served, Cameron gave his speech. We retreated downstairs to a steam-filled kitchen, where we polished the cutlery. Most of us were exhausted by this point. Dinner service is physically demanding, and I am by no means the only person who combines two or three jobs. The contrast of the two worlds was striking; someone said it was like a scene from Downton Abbey.</p><p></p><p>Maybe Cameron didn't see the irony; perhaps he forgot about the army of waiting staff, cleaners, chefs and porters who were also present at the banquet. Perhaps he thought he was in a room of similarly rich people, who understood the necessity for austerity. Perhaps it didn't occur to him that this message might not be as easily comprehended by those who hadn't just enjoyed a four-course meal. Perhaps he forgot about those of us, disabled or unemployed or on the minimum wage, for whom austerity has had a catastrophic and wounding effect.</p><p></p><p>In his speech, Cameron talked about a \"leaner, more efficient, more affordable state\". He argued that austerity could be a permanent government policy; a way of trimming down the administrative excesses of some public services. He framed it in the context of the current tough living conditions – a minimising of state spending, as it \"comes out of the pockets of the same taxpayers whose living standards we want to see improve\".</p><p></p><p>No word yet, of course, on what changes will be made to the state-funded banquet he was speaking at. Perhaps next year there will only be three courses, or the dessert wine will be ruthlessly culled.</p><p></p><p>I wonder how Cameron and his government can do these things. Aside from the idiocy of calling for cuts while wearing a white tie – has the man never heard of Twitter – does he not see what welfare cuts are doing to the vulnerable in society? He enjoys a banquet, while the number of people using food banks has tripled in the past year. As someone on the shift with me said, \"It gets annoying that we always serve free food to the people who really don't need free food.\"</p><p></p><p>The political content of what Cameron is saying is obviously more important than where he was saying it, but I don't think the latter is irrelevant. I have a fundamental problem with a man who sits on a golden throne and lectures us about spending less, like a modern-day, white-tie clad sheriff of Nottingham. And all around him, the insidious stain of austerity creeps across the country, manifesting in the bedroom tax, rising tuition fees and the closure of public services that vulnerable people depend on.</p><p></p><p>Each of us has just one chance at existence, and so many people's lives are being blighted by these cuts. If this is the cruel and damaging reality of permanent austerity, then we should be telling Mr Cameron we don't want it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422381235|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|a39e5393ad4fbfe9cb5ea9291bf9c8c72f35b051 -->",

        "body":"<p></p><p>The MI6 spy found dead in a bag three years ago probably locked himself in the holdall and died as a result of a tragic accident, Scotland Yard has said.</p><p>Outlining the results of a three-year investigation on Wednesday, the Metropolitan police said that Gareth Williams was most likely to have died alone in his flat.</p><p>However, Detective Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said the police could not \"fundamentally and beyond doubt\" rule out the possibility that a third-party was involved in his  death.</p><p>The naked body of Williams was found in the padlocked bag, with the keys discovered under his body, in the otherwise empty bath in his flat in Pimlico, London, in August 2010.</p><p>Last year, a coroner concluded that Williams was probably unlawfully killed and his death the result of a criminal act. Following an eight-day inquest, the Westminster coroner, Dr Fiona Wilcox, said he was probably either suffocated or poisoned, before a third-party locked and placed the bag in the bath.</p><p></p><p>However, Hewitt said Scotland Yard's three-year inquiry had come to a different conclusion and that Williams was \"most probably\" alone when he died.</p><p>\"Despite all of this considerable effort, it is still the case that there is insufficient evidence to be definitive on the circumstances that led to Gareth's death,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>\"Rather, what we are left with is either individual pieces of evidence, or a lack of such evidence, that can logically support one of a number of hypotheses.\"</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hewitt added that the investigation had added \"some clarity and detail\" to the case, but that \"no evidence has been identified to establish the full circumstances of Gareth's death beyond all reasonable doubt\".</p><p></p><p>A forensic examination of Williams's flat, a security service safe house, has concluded that there was no sign of forced entry or DNA that pointed to a third-party present at the time of the spy's death.</p><p></p><p>Scotland Yard's inquiry also found no evidence of Williams's fingerprints on the padlock of the bag or the rim of the bath, which the coroner last year said supported her assertion of \"third-party involvement\" in the death.</p><p></p><p>However, Hewitt said it was theoretically possible for Williams to lower himself into the holdall without touching the rim of the bath.</p><p></p><p>Winding down the lengthy investigation, which has drawn interviews and statements from 27 of Williams's colleagues in MI6 and GCHQ, Hewitt said the death remained a tragedy that would be kept under review by detectives.</p><p></p><p>In a statement, Williams's family said they were  disappointed with the police findings and that they agreed with the coroner's conclusions that he was most likely killed unlawfully.</p><p></p><p>\"We are naturally disappointed that it is still not possible to state with certainty how Gareth died and the fact that the circumstances of his death are still unknown adds to our grief,\" the  family said.</p><p></p><p>\"We note that the investigation has been conducted with further interviews upon some of the witnesses who gave evidence at the inquest and that the investigation team were at last able to interview directly members of GCHQ and SIS [MI6].</p><p></p><p>\"We consider that on the basis of the facts at present known the coroner's verdict accurately reflects the circumstances of Gareth's death.\"</p><p></p><p>In a press briefing at Scotland Yard, Hewitt admitted it was \"a cause of some regret\" that the police were not able to definitively explain the circumstances surrounding the 31-year-old's death.</p><p></p><p>He rejected suggestions that the security services had \"pulled the wool\" over his eyes, following concerns over how MI6 and counter-terrorism officers had handled some evidence during the initial investigation. It emerged on Wednesday that police only gained access to Williams's spy agency personnel and vetting files after the coroner's inquest ended last May.</p><p></p><p>Williams, a maths prodigy and fitness enthusiast originally from Anglesey, was a private person with few other close friends aside from his family, police said. In interviews, MI6 and GCHQ colleagues described him as a \"conscientious and decent man\" and detectives were unable to identify anyone with any animosity towards him or a motive for causing him harm.</p><p></p><p>As part of the fresh investigation, a forensic sweep of Williams's flat discovered 10 to 15 unidentified traces of DNA, which are being kept under examination, but none on the North Face holdall or around the bath area of the en-suite bathroom of the flat's main bedroom. There was also no evidence of a \"deep clean\" of the flat to wipe all trace of DNA.</p><p></p><p>Hewitt said: \"There are really three hypotheses that you can use here. One is that Gareth, for whatever reason, got himself into that bag and then was unable to get himself out and died as a result of that.</p><p></p><p>\"One is that Gareth, with someone else, got into the bag consensually then something went wrong and he died as a result of that. The third is that someone murdered Gareth by putting him in that bag. I would argue that any physical absence [of evidence of] a third party being present tends to make the hypotheses that there is a third party present less likely.\"</p><p></p><p>He added: \"The coroner drew an inference. I am now drawing a different inference.\"</p><p></p><p>At the coroner's inquest, two experts tried 400 times to lock themselves into the 32-inch by 19-inch holdall without success, with one remarking that even Harry Houdini \"would have struggled\" to squeeze himself inside. But days after the inquest footage emerged of a retired Army sergeant climbing into the bag and locking it from the inside.</p><p></p><p>Hewitt said it was now established that it was theoretically possible for a person to climb into the bag and that it was \"more probable\" that Williams did this before suffocating as a result of the accident. It emerged during the inquest that Williams had an interest in escapology, but the police said it would be speculation to link his death to a failed attempt to escape from the locked holdall.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422374658|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|2fd9134acad4628a73f05b72533e71cb4f6ef04d -->",

        "body":"<p>A group of Occupy Wall Street activists has bought almost $15m of Americans' personal debt over the last year as part of the Rolling Jubilee project to help people pay off their outstanding credit.</p> <p><a href=\"http://rollingjubilee.org/\">Rolling Jubilee</a>,&nbsp;set up by Occupy's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/15/occupy-rolling-jubilee-debt-forgiveness\">Strike Debt group</a>&nbsp;following the street protests that swept the world in 2011, launched on 15 November 2012. The group purchases personal debt cheaply from banks before \"abolishing\" it, freeing individuals from their bills.</p> <p>By purchasing the debt at knockdown prices the group has managed to free $14,734,569.87 of personal debt, mainly medical debt, spending only $400,000.</p> <p>\"We thought that the ratio would be about 20 to 1,\" said Andrew Ross, a member of Strike Debt and professor of social and cultural analysis at New York University. He said the team initially envisaged raising $50,000, which would have enabled it to buy $1m in debt.</p> <p>\"In fact we've been able to buy debt a lot more cheaply than that.\"</p> <p>The group is able to buy debt so cheaply due to the nature of the \"secondary debt market\". If individuals consistently fail to pay bills from credit cards, loans, or medical insurance the bank or lender that issued the funds will eventually cut its losses by selling that debt to a third party. These sales occur for a fraction of the debt&rsquo;s true values &ndash; typically for five cents on the dollar &ndash; and debt-buying companies then attempt to recoup the debt from the individual debtor and thus make a profit.</p> <p>The Rolling Jubilee project was mostly conceived as a \"public education project\", Ross said.</p> <p>\"We're under no illusions that $15m is just a tiny drop in the secondary debt market. It doesn't make a dent in the amount of debt.</p> <p>\"Our purpose in doing this, aside from helping some people along the way &ndash; there's certainly many, many people who are very thankful that their debts are abolished &ndash; our primary purpose was to spread information about the workings of this secondary debt market.\"</p> <p>The group has focussed on buying medical debt, and has acquired the $14.7m in three separate purchases, most recently&nbsp;purchasing the value of&nbsp;$13.5m on medical debt owed by 2,693 people across 45 states and Puerto Rico, Rolling Jubilee said in a press release.</p> <p>&ldquo;No one should have to go into debt or bankruptcy because they get sick,&rdquo; said Laura Hanna, an organiser with the group. Hanna said 62% of all personal bankruptcies have medical debt as a contributing factor.</p> <p>Due to the nature of the debt market, the group is unable to specify whose debt it purchases, taking on the amounts before it discovers individuals&rsquo; identities. When Rolling Jubilee has bought the debt they send notes to their debtors &ldquo;telling them they&rsquo;re off the hook&rdquo;, Ross said.</p> <p>Ross, whose book, <a href=\"http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/creditocracy/\">Creditocracy</a> and the case for debt refusal, outlines the problems of the debt industry and calls for a &ldquo;debtors&rsquo; movement&rdquo; to resist credit, said the group had received letters from people whose debt they had lifted thanking them for the service. But the real victory was in spreading knowledge of the nature of the debt industry, he said.</p> <p>\"Very few people know how cheaply their debts have been bought by collectors. It changes the psychology of the debtor, knowing this.</p> <p>&ldquo;So when you get called up by the debt collector, and you're being asked to pay the full amount of your debt, you now know that the debt collector has bought your debt very, very cheaply. As cheaply as we bought it. And that gives you moral ammunition to have a different conversation with the debt collector.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422309147|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|eb1f79972b6a77bb0687b85ebfb26ad79d81d69a -->",

Offscreen in my private life – it's different.</p><p>\"I wear a red ribbon at the start of December for World Aids Day, a pink ribbon in October during breast cancer awareness month, a badge in April during Bowel Cancer Awareness month, and yes – a poppy on Armistice Day.</p><p>\"I respect and hold in high esteem those in the armed forces, both my father and my uncle have served in the RAF and the army.  Every year I donate to the Poppy Appeal because above all else it is a charity that needs donations, so that it can continue to help support serving and ex-service men and women and their families.\"</p><p>The abuse directed at her on Twitter included racist jibes that her family would not have been able to settle in Britain but for the deaths of soldiers.  \"Without all those fallen soldiers, Hitler would've taken over Britain and your family would never have been allowed here...,\" user @alhaurincraig wrote.  Another crudely superimposed a picture of a poppy on to an image of the presenter with a banner saying 'Sack the Slag'.</p><p>White said the racist and sexist abuse acted against all of the goals that the fallen soldiers had fought for. \"The messages of \"go back to where you came from\" have been interesting to read, as have the 'fat s--g' comments, and the repeated use of the phrase 'black c--t',\" she said.  \"Mostly because it flies in the face of everything that millions of British men and women and those in the Commonwealth have fought for for generations, and continue to fight for: the right to choose, and the right of freedom of speech and expression.\"</p><p>Google has also been the subject of criticism because it used only a small Remembrance Day poppy on its website. Labour MP Gerry Sutcliffe said it was \"demeaning not to have something spectacular\".</p><p>The search engine said it tried to be sensitive in not putting sombre occasions into one of their trademark doodles but instead featuring them in some way on their homepage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422347727|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|78aaf770fdf9c298733094f851d2fcebe3ae8a57 -->",

        "body":"<p>The children's minister Edward Timpson has said he has deep concerns over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/13/hamzah-khan-social-services-warning-signs\" title=\"\">the serious case review by the Bradford safeguarding children board into the death of four-year-old Hamzah Khan</a>, who was starved to death by his mother in Bradford.</p><p>A source from the Department for Education (DfE) used even stronger language, describing the review as \"risible\", but a source at the council accused the government of \"social worker bashing\".</p><p>Hamzah's partially mummified body was found clothed in a Babygro meant for a child aged six to nine months in September 2011, almost two years after his death in December 2009.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/03/hamzah-khan-starved-to-death-amanda-hutton\" title=\"\">His mother, Amanda Hutton, 44, was last month found guilty of his manslaughter</a> and of neglecting six of her eight children.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/interactive/2013/nov/13/hamzah-khan-serious-case-review\" title=\"\">The serious case review (SCR)</a>, commissioned by Bradford safeguarding children board (BSCB), concluded that while social services missed signs that, had they been put together, could have warned that Hamzah and his seven siblings were at risk, his death was \"not predictable\". That appears to have not gone far enough for the DfE.</p><p>In a letter to Nick Frost, chair of BSCB, Edward Timpson, the minister for children and families, wrote: \"I am concerned that it [the SCR] fails to explain sufficiently clearly the actions taken, or not taken, by children's social care when problems in the Khan family were brought to their attention on a number of occasions.\"</p><p>The letter sets out a number of questions, which Timpson says relate to \"missed opportunities to protect the children in the house\".</p><p>He continues: \"It is tragic beyond words that by the time a health visitor did trigger concerns about the whereabouts of the younger children in the household, who were missing from health and education services altogether, Hamzah Khan was already dead.\"</p><p>Frost said in a statement: \"The SCR is very clear that Hamzah's death could not have been predicted but finds that systems, many of them national systems, let Hamzah down both before and following his death.\"</p><p>The DfE's criticism provoked an angry response at Bradford council, with a source claiming that the education secretary, Michael Gove, had initially been ready to accept the SCR's findings.</p><p>The source said: \"Forty-eight hours ago all the indications were that the DfE were going to accept the report but Gove appears to have had a change of heart.\"</p><p>The council accused the education secretary of changing his mind because there was \"not enough social worker bashing\".  It is understood Gove thinks there has been a failure of all agencies in Bradford to accept any responsibility.</p><p>The authors of the SCR make 50 recommendations for \"learning\", which have been accepted by BSCB without blaming any one agency for failing Hamzah. The panel found that the agencies focused their efforts on Hutton as a victim of domestic violence, rather than her children. The experts report that while much help was offered to Hamzah's mother, who was beaten up by her partner for much of their 22-year relationship, not enough focus was put on whether her children were safe and well.</p><p>Annie Hudson, chief executive of the College of Social Work, said the SCR \"brings into sharp focus why there must be strong, joined-up and effective systems in place to keep in contact with, and track, children at risk.</p><p>\"No child should ever fall off the radar or become invisible to child protection agencies and society as a whole.\"</p><p>The NSPCC said it highlighted the need for a red flag when children miss key appointments so youngsters such as Hamzah do not \"slip off the radar of society\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422378691|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|d7c3b400464ae84bc4d38dfc68bb6ce1b96a13d1 -->",

        "headline":"Lily Allen does not represent all feminism – and nor should she",
        "body":"<p>As soon as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/nov/12/lily-allen-hard-out-here\" title=\"\">Lily Allen released a music video</a> that was purportedly a new feminist anthem, I anticipated that a slew of blogs and commentary would follow. I was right – I've read four on the subject already. Nevertheless, it is my policy to leave no bandwagon unjumped, and so here's my contribution to the unfolding brouhaha.</p><p>I can't deny I enjoyed watching Lily Allen poke fun at the notoriously sexist music industry, and in many ways I thought she was spot on. The presence of a besuited old white man in her music video who encourages her to fellate a banana was pretty revealing. Behind the dancing girls and schmaltzy lyrics that usually characterise pop songs, these men act as the all-oppressing eye of the industry: telling female singers that weight loss and sexual objectification are the only feasible routes to stardom; stripping down women in music videos to their underwear while leaving their male counterparts untouched. Allen was right to identify these shadowy white men as the source of the problem, for though sexism is a structural thing, it does usually manifest itself in the actual men in charge dictating how women should present themselves and their bodies in order to achieve some kind of validation.</p><p>But the video is problematic too. For one thing, it's unclear whether Allen is reserving scorn solely for the rich white men she satirises, or whether some women (like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/07/pop-stars-sexy-netmums-parents-miley-cyrus\" title=\"\">Miley Cyrus</a> – who presumably has also been taught that sexualisation is the route to success) don't cop some too. To twerk or not to twerk may be the zeitgeist question, but whatever answer you come up with, you're still telling women how they should present their own bodies. Then there's the issue of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/10/black-women-music-industry-sex\" title=\"\">race in the video</a>. On a surface level, Allen attempts to mock the way black women are treated as nothing more than sexual objects in music videos – yet she also posits herself as separate from the black women that feature in hers. At the end of the song, she pointedly sashays off, while they remain behind as simply semi-nude backing dancers. <a href=\"http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/music-videos-exploiting-black-womens-bodies\" title=\"\">Sarah Greene of the End Violence Against Women Coalition recently told the Voice</a>, \"In a particular Calvin Harris video [Drinking from the Bottle ft Tinie Tempah], there is kind of a sea of black women's bottoms. You never even see their faces … young black women say it makes them feel hated.\" In that respect, it's difficult to see Allen's anthem as little more than same old same old, and it's probably why I ultimately feel she misses the mark. As the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Okwonga/status/400367983299940352\" title=\"\">journalist Musa Okwonga put it</a>, \"She should've swapped the female dancers for a bunch of twerking middle-aged men.\"</p><p>In my mind though, the wider question is not whether or not Lily Allen's feminist song is a success or not; it's why is it that one single music video containing some fairly cursory observations on sexism is able to stir up such a reaction in the feminist movement. One explanation lies in a comment made by the blogger Glosswitch recently (<a href=\"http://glosswatch.com/\" title=\"\">and I recommend you read her piece in full</a>): \"I'd say one objective of feminism should be to help women's decisions become less loaded. It's oppressive to have to represent a whole sex in everything you do.\" Unfortunately for Allen and everybody else, her music video seems unable to stand in and of itself, representing only her opinions, but is instead being seen as some kind of expression of all feminism – and by extension all women. This is part and parcel of being in an oppressed group: women are routinely dehumanised and homogenised, so that every act we undertake in public tends to reflect on all women, instead of our own individual character. It's a problem men just don't have. And feminism is so marginalised as a strain of political thought, that when one feminist woman makes it into the mainstream, a flurry of panic and excitement will inevitably follow simply because there are so few feminist voices in the public sphere. Feminism is an extremely broad church, but I often think feminists are guilty of expecting every single prominent feminist to reflect their exact politics because there aren't enough opinions in the mainstream to choose from – and all too often the feminists that do make it big are white and middle class.</p><p>Perhaps the most helpful response we feminists can have to Lily Allen's video is not to tear it down because of its flaws (although they should be addressed), but to look at feminism itself and discuss how to realise its potential as a political movement. Instead of admonishing or praising Allen, we should ask why there is such a weight of expectation upon something so small, and what we can do to rectify that. There are already exciting projects attempting to do this, like the <a href=\"http://ukfeminista.org.uk/event-details/summer-school-2013/\" title=\"\">UK Feminista summer school</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/apr/16/everyday-sexism-project-shouting-back\" title=\"\">Everyday Sexism Project</a>, <a href=\"http://www.southallblacksisters.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Southall Black Sisters</a>, or the indispensable work of the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fawcett Society</a>. I don't pretend to have a grand feminist plan, and in any case feminists should probably decide on such a plan together, but I do know that if we focus on organising ourselves into a political force and supporting each other in the struggle against patriarchy, the time will come when we care less about what Lily Allen has to say – because the fate of feminism won't seem to rest upon the strengths and weaknesses of one music video.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422367349|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|eb480736002bcb62f3ac77dca7fbf93c7da33bfc -->",

The CBI, the country's premier investigative agency, is India's equivalent of the FBI.</p><p>Sinha said at the conference that if the state could not stop gambling, it could at least make some revenue by legalising it.</p><p>\"If you cannot enforce the ban on betting, it is like saying: 'If you can't prevent rape, you enjoy it,'\" he said.</p><p>The remarks have caused outrage across India, which in the past year has been hit by widespread protests following the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/delhi-gang-rape-relief-india-men-sentenced-death\" title=\"\"> fatal gang-rape</a> of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in New Delhi.</p><p>On Wednesday, Sinha said  his comments had been taken out of context and misinterpreted, and that he was sorry if he had caused hurt. Angry activists, however, called for his resignation.</p><p>Brinda Karat, leader of the Communist party of India (Marxist), said Sinha's comments were offensive to women everywhere.</p><p>\"It is sickening that a man who is in charge of several rape investigations should use such an analogy,\" Karat told reporters. \"He should be prosecuted for degrading and insulting women.\"</p><p>The New Delhi attack on the young woman last December caused nationwide outrage and forced the government to change rape laws and create fast-track courts for rape cases.</p><p>Laws introduced after the attack make stalking, voyeurism and sexual harassment a crime. They also provide for the death penalty for repeat offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the victim's death.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422368950|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|3356dd1aba5de54aede55024098d378c1e663a8e -->",

        "body":"<p>Lars Von Trier has abandoned plans to release a softcore version of his sex epic Nymphomaniac. The film's two-part four-hour cut, which is due to debut in Copenhagen on Christmas Day, will now contain explicit scenes. </p><p>The release of Nymphomaniac will see the Danish director give up final cut for the first time in his career. The decision was apparently taken after Von Trier said he was unwilling to trim the two-part film's current five and a half hour running time himself. Nymphomaniac's strange fate is detailed in an extended making-of feature in the Danish film magazine Filmmagasinet Ekko which was picked up by <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lars-von-trier-gives-up-655155\">the Hollywood Reporter</a>. </p><p>\"The short version is against Lars' own will, but he accepts it because he understands market mechanisms,\" says Von Trier's long-term producing partner Peter Aalbaek Jensen in the magazine article. \"You cannot make a film for more than 60 million kroners (about $11 million or £6.9 million) that is so lengthy. Five and a half hours is so extreme that it reduces market value so radically that investors would have felt they had bought a pig in a poke.\"</p><p>It is extremely unusual a director of the artistic clout of Von Trier to allow somebody else to complete their vision, particularly on such a singular project as Nymphomaniac. It is not known if the longer five-and-a-half-hour cut will ever be released, and Jensen refused to confirm if Von Trier would take it to next year's Cannes film festival.</p><p>Nymphomaniac, which stars the film-maker's regular muse Charlotte Gainsbourg in the lead, has been billed as an exploration of the erotic life of a woman from infancy to middle age. Digital trickery and body doubles have reportedly been used to portray famous stars such as Uma Thurman, Stellan Skarsgård, Christian Slater, Jamie Bell and Shia LaBeouf having sex.</p><p>A teaser trailer for the much anticipated film was briefly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/04/nymphomiac-youtube-shia-labeouf-lars-von-trier-clip-removed\">removed from YouTube earlier this month</a> after apparently falling foul of the site's rules on nudity and sexual content.</p><h2>More on Nymphomaniac</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/04/nymphomiac-youtube-shia-labeouf-lars-von-trier-clip-removed\">Nymphomaniac clip removed from Youtube</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/poll/2013/oct/10/nymphomaniac-orgasm-posters-vote-favourite\">Vote for your favourite Nymphomaniac orgasm poster</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422267679|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|36aed8ffd86c1865c8018d220088cf262a55dd38 -->",

        "body":"<p>The onion bhaji was probably my first introduction to the joys of Indian food back in the late 80s, so I feel I owe this simple snack a considerable debt of thanks. The word \"bhajia\" means fritter – in fact, they're just one small part of the wider pakora family, which encompasses all manner of good things (<a href=\"http://adventurefoodie.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/bheja-fry-goat-brain-fritters.html\" title=\"\">goat brain pakora</a> stands out in my memory) fried in chickpea batter, but in Britain, a land never known for its subtle taste, the pungent onion variety rules supreme.</p><p>Usually served <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/community/origins-onion-bhaji\" title=\"\">as a snack in its homeland</a>, generally with a nice cup of chai, bhajis are the stalwart of the starter selection here: a deep-fried appetite whetter for the myriad joys to come. At their best, they're almost ethereally light and addictively crisp. At their worst, they're stodgy and bland – as chef Cyrus Todiwala observes in his new book, <a href=\"http://nr11blog.wordpress.com/tag/onion-bhaji-recipe/\" title=\"\">Mr Todiwala's Bombay</a>: \"What you see in stores and supermarkets does not always represent the bhajia we Indians know.\" So just how do you guarantee great results?</p><h2>Onion</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422395582'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384346350260/SImon-Majumdars-onion-bha-002.jpg' alt='SImon Majumdar's onion bhajis' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Simon Majumdar's onion bhajis.</figcaption></figure><p>Often lost in mass-produced versions, the bulk of the bhaji should be onion, rather than dough. Most recipes use yellow onion, sliced very thinly so it cooks through quickly, but <a href=\"http://www.simonmajumdar.com/recipes/onion-bhaji/\" title=\"\">food writer Simon Majumdar</a> specifies white and <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/onion-bhaji-recipe\" title=\"\">Alfred Prasad, executive chef at the Michelin-starred Tamarind</a>, goes for red. I find white too mild, and although I like the sweetness of the red versions, I miss the yellow onion's pungent flavour, so I'm going to stick with that.</p><h2>Batter</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422395583'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384346305213/Flavours-of-Gujarats-onio-002.jpg' alt='Flavours of Gujarat's onion bhajis' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Flavours of Gujarat's onion bhajis.</figcaption></figure><p>Onions are onions, but where bhaji recipes diverge is in the batter that binds the slices together. Gram, or chickpea flour, is fairly standard, but Prasad and a brilliant little book called Flavours of Gujarat (which has been sitting on my parents' bookshelf for more than 20 years, waiting for this moment) recommend adding rice flour, presumably to make the batter crisper. For me, the difference between a great bhaji and a merely adequate one is in the crunch – as with all deep-fried foods, it should fight back – and Prasad's are particularly fiesty, so I'm going to adopt his 2:1 ratio of gram to rice flour.</p><p>Perhaps more important is the liquid used, both in type and quantity. Water is obviously the first choice, <a href=\"http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/653916\" title=\"\">but Nikita Gulhane</a>, whose bhaji recipe features in Madhur Jaffrey's Curry Nation, also adds plain yoghurt, and Prasad stirs in a little melted butter. I like the rich tanginess of Gulhane's yoghurt, but I find it makes the batter a bit thick and gloopy, so I'm going to use Prasad's butter, plus Todiwala's lemon juice for flavour.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422395584'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384346235959/Nikita-Gulhanes-onion-bha-002.jpg' alt='Nikita Gulhane's onion bhajis' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nikita Gulhane's onion bhajis.</figcaption></figure><p>The batters vary enormously in consistency: Gulhane's is a thick paste, while Majumdar counsels aiming for the texture of double cream. This makes all the difference to the finished result: the two thickest batters, from Gulhane and Flavours of Gujarat, produce rather doughy bhajis that seem to be more about the batter than the onion. They're tasty enough, but I prefer the more delicate coating of Todiwala, Prasad and Majumdar's versions. The guiding principle is that it should be thick enough to cling to the onion, but not firm enough to form clumps of its own.</p><p>Majumdar suggests letting the batter rest for an hour before use, much like a yorkshire pudding, presumably to allow the flours to absorb the moisture in the batter. I don't think this is desirable here, though: his coating is tough, but not particularly crisp, and one taster likens it (approvingly, I must add) to a Woolworths onion ring.</p><h2>Spices</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422395585'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384346198283/Alfred-Prasads-onion-bhaj-002.jpg' alt='Alfred Prasad's onion bhajis' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Alfred Prasad's onion bhajis.</figcaption></figure><p>The gram flour gives the batter a subtle nutty flavour, but subtle isn't what we're looking for here. Chillies are a popular addition, with Prasad and Todiwala plumping for fresh green chillies, and Prasad, Todiwala, Majumdar and Flavours of Gujarat sticking in dried chilli powder too. I prefer the cleaner, greener flavour of the fresh variety. Turmeric is also fairly standard, as much for colour as flavour.</p><p>Gulhane and Prasad both add garlic and ginger to the batter, which lend it a pleasing and more interesting sweetness than Majumdar's sugar – as do Prasad's unusual, but very welcome, fennel seeds, which I prefer to Todiwala's sharper ajwain, or lovage seeds. I love the earthiness of his cumin seeds with the onion, though. Sesame seeds, as used in Flavours of Gujarat, seem an unnecessary addition.</p><p>Fresh coriander, used by everyone but Majumdar, adds an attractive colour and a fresh, clean flavour to the batter, while curry leaves, as used by Prasad and Gulhane, contribute a herbal note. They're only worth buying fresh though, so if you can't find them, leave them out.</p><h2>Cooking</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422395586'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384346279529/Cyrus-Todiwalas-onion-bha-002.jpg' alt='Cyrus Todiwala's onion bhajis' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Cyrus Todiwala's onion bhajis.</figcaption></figure><p>It is very important to get the temperature of the oil right, as Todiwala explains: \"Too hot [and] they will fry too fast and remain raw inside and gooey. Too cold and the results will be oily and soft.\" The fairly standard 180C seems about right – most recipes suggest dropping a piece of batter in there to test the heat, but if you do have a food thermometer, use it – it is far more reliable than the sizzle test if you're after perfect results.</p><h2>The perfect onion bhajis</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422395587'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384346444696/Felicity-Cloakes-perfect--009.jpg' alt='Felicity Cloake's perfect onion bhajis' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Felicity Cloake's perfect onion bhajis.</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>(Makes 8)</em></strong><br /><strong>60g gram flour</strong><br /><strong>30g rice flour</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp ghee or butter, melted </strong><br /><strong>Juice of ¼ lemon</strong><br /><strong>½ tsp turmeric</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp cumin seeds, coarsely chopped</strong><br /><strong>¼ tsp fennel seeds</strong><br /><strong>1-2 hot green chillies (to taste), finely minced</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp root ginger, finely grated </strong><br /><strong>2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>Small bunch of coriander, chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 fresh curry leaves, chopped (optional)</strong><br /><strong>2 onions, halved, core removed and thinly sliced</strong><br /><strong>Vegetable oil, to cook</strong></p><p>Sift the flours into a mixing bowl, then stir in the ghee and lemon juice and just enough cold water to bring it to the consistency of double cream.

        "body":"<p>Not content with being voted the greatest northern male ever, the second greatest living British icon (he lost out to David Attenborough) and granted the freedom of the city of Tel Aviv, Morrissey is now out to demonstrate that he can write the kind of burnished prose no other singer on the planet could aspire to. There are, to be sure, a&nbsp;few painfully florid patches in this superb autobiography (\"Headmaster Mr Coleman rumbles with grumpiness in a rambling stew of hate\"), but it would be hard to imagine Ronnie Wood or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ericclapton\" title=\"\">Eric Clapton</a> portraying the \"Duchess of nothing\" Sarah Ferguson as \"a little bundle of orange crawling out of a frothy dress, the drone of Sloane, blessed with two daughters of Queen Victoria pot-dog pudginess\".</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/morrissey\" title=\"\">Morrissey</a> despises most of the people he meets, often with excellent reason. He is scurrilous, withdrawn and disdainful, an odd mixture of shyness and vitriol. The dreamy, heart-throbbish photo on the cover of the book, the nose rakishly tilted above the&nbsp;Cupid's-bow lips, belies what a mean old bastard he is. He finds an image of himself in (of all people) the minor Georgian poet <a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/review/story/0,,1788971,00.html\" title=\"\">AE Housman</a>, who preferred art to humanity and whose ascetic, spiritually tortured life seems to echo Morrissey's own. He admires wayward, bloody-minded types much like himself, and takes a&nbsp;sadistic delight in discomforting interviewers. \"Why did you mention Battersea in that song?\" a journalist asks him. \"Because it rhymes with fatty,\" he replies. Taken by his father at the age of eight to watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/04/immortal-biography-george-best-hamilton-review\" title=\"\">George Best</a> play at Old Trafford, he swoons at the sight of such artistry combined with such rebelliousness. Years later, others will swoon at his own mixing of the two.</p><p>Some of his bloody-mindedness springs from a damaged childhood. Born into a working-class Irish-Mancunian family, Steven Patrick Morrissey sang his way out of what struck him as a soulless environment, as other working-class Irish Mancunians have written or acted their way out. The vitriol started to flow early: his bleak mausoleum of a Catholic primary school was ruled by Mother Peter, \"a&nbsp;bearded nun who beat children from&nbsp;dawn to dusk\", and by the time he was 17 he was already emotionally exhausted. Manchester, still in its pre-cool days, was a \"barbaric place where only savages can survive … There are no sexual guidelines, and I see myself naked only by appointment.\" His eloquent contempt for his fellow citizens is terrifying: \"non-human sewer-rats with missing eyes; the loudly insane with indecipherable speech patterns; the mad poor of Manchester's armpit.\" The final indignity is to be turned down for a job&nbsp;as a postman at the local sorting office. At the hour of the birth of the Smiths, which gave him the exit from Manchester he craved, he felt himself dying of boredom, loneliness and disgust. \"I would talk myself through each day,\" he writes, \"as one would nurse a dying friend.\"</p><p>Not long afterwards, hordes of young people throughout the world are&nbsp;wearing his face on their chests. He returns to the streets where he grew up, now with a police escort, to sing to 17,000 fans from a stage overlooking an odious Inland Revenue office where he once worked. Having failed to find love from one man or woman, he can now find it from thousands. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/mick-jagger\" title=\"\">Mick Jagger</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/elton-john\" title=\"\">Elton John</a> are eager to shake his hand. He enjoys his celebrity, but the sardonic self-irony of the book seeks to&nbsp;persuade us otherwise. There is a relish and energy about its prose that undercuts his misanthropy. Its lyrical quality suggests that beneath the hard-bitten scoffer there lurks a romantic softie, while beneath that again lies a hard-bitten scoffer. Implausibly, he claims to be \"chilled\" by road signs reading \"Morrissey Concert, Next Left\". It's true, however, that having spent years yearning to be seen, he now spends years longing to be invisible. Living in Hollywood is hardly the best place for that. He deals with his own egocentricity by being wryly amusing about it: his birth almost killed his mother, he comments, because even then his head was too&nbsp;big.</p><p>Even so, he remains for the most part icily unillusioned, like a monk passing through a whorehouse. His contempt for the music industry is visceral, and he prefers to spend his time reading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/whauden\" title=\"\">Auden</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin\" title=\"\">James Baldwin</a>. (Spotting Baldwin in a Barcelona hotel, he decides not to approach him, since even the mildest rejection would apparently mean he would have to go and hang himself.) The solution to all problems, he tells us, \"is the goodness of privacy in a warm room with books\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\" title=\"\">David Bowie</a> tells him that he's had so much sex and drugs that he's surprised he is still alive, to which Morrissey replies that he's had so little of both that he feels much the same. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tomhanks\" title=\"\">Tom Hanks</a> comes backstage to say hello, but Morrissey doesn't know who he is. The press lie that he is a racist, that he opened the door to a journalist wearing a tutu, that he hung around public toilets as a youth and that he would welcome the assassination of Margaret Thatcher. The Guardian runs a disapproving piece on him adorned with a photo of somebody else. When he discovers that a Smiths record released in Japan includes a track by Sandie Shaw, he begs the people around him to kill him. \"Many rush forward,\" he adds.</p><p>\"Although a passable human creature on the outside,\" he comments of himself, \"the swirling&nbsp;soul within seemed to speak up for the most awkward people on the planet\", of whom he himself ranks among the most adept. He is one of the great curmudgeons and contrarians of our time. He&nbsp;even puts in a&nbsp;good word for the Kray brothers.</p><p>Surprisingly, he goes easy on his passion for animal rights, but observes no such restraint when it comes to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/george-bush\" title=\"\">George Bush</a> (\"the world's most famous active terrorist\") and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a>, at whose feet he lays the London deaths of 2005. At least the vindictive music industry has taught him how to&nbsp;hate, though one suspects he didn't&nbsp;need much tutoring. The music impresario <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tonywilson\" title=\"\">Tony Wilson</a> \"managed a lengthy and slow decline which some thought was actually an ongoing career\". There is a cameo of Julie Burchill of such sublime savagery that&nbsp;one expects the page to ignite. The&nbsp;former Smiths who took him to court are subjected to 50 pages of devastatingly articulate venom.</p><p>Though he is careful to inform us that he drives a sky-blue Jag, fame hasn't changed him much. He is still the same miserable old Mozzer he always was. The death of friends leads him to wonder movingly whether life isn't \"all too burdensome, with so much loss taking its root in the heart, as the body goes spinning on towards a&nbsp;dreadful cessation\". It isn't the kind of sentence Robbie Williams would come up with. His interest in the dead, his father warns him, outstrips his affection for the living. He sees a ghost on Saddleworth Moor, burial ground of&nbsp;the Moors murders, and narrowly avoids being kidnapped in Mexico. Everywhere he looks he sees violence: \"military science whaling, nuclear weapons, armed combat, the abattoir, holy war … riot police assaulting innocent civilians.\" When a small, flightless bird comes to live in his back garden, he fences it in with boxes to ward off predators. He has quite a few such boxes of his own.</p><p>Perhaps the time has come for a new&nbsp;career. If he could get treatment for his addiction to alliteration and stop using phrases like \"for you and I\", this prodigiously talented \"small boy of 52\", as he described himself two years ago, could walk away with the Booker prize.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422279954|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|42551f72bd3fa99ac491fea86fb610ea14c72160 -->",

On Tuesday US Federal Reserve member Dennis Lockhart - seen as being in the centre as far as the policy debate goes - suggested there was a possibility the bank could reduce its $85bn a month bond buying programme at its December meeting.

But significant headwinds – both at home and abroad – remain, and there is a long way to go before the aftermath of the financial crisis has cleared and economic conditions normalise,&quot; he said in the report.</p> <p>&quot;That underpins the monetary policy committee's (MPC) intention to maintain the exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy until there has been a substantial reduction in the degree of economic slack.&quot;</p> <p>In August the BoE said as part of its new policy of forward guidance that it would not consider raising interest rates before unemployment fell to 7%. MPC members agreed that unemployment was a strong indicator of slack in the economy. Figures for August show that rate has fallen to 7.6% following an unexpectedly sharp rise in job recruitment over the previous three months.</p> <p>In response the BoE said there was now a three in five chance that the UK unemployment rate would hit 7% in mid-2015 compared to a previous prediction of late 2016.</p> <p>Deputy governor Charlie Bean said forward guidance was still pointing to a rate rise later rather than sooner. He said: &quot;The key message is that policy is not going to be related to growth rates but the elimination of slack.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <h2>Here's the full story:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/13/interest-rates-could-rise-2015\">Interest rates could rise in 2015 – BoE</a></h2> <p>The other big news story of the day is the drop in UK unemployment, to a four-year low of 7.6%.</p> <p><strong>Economics editor Larry Elliott writes:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Britain's rising population means that a record number of people – 29.95 million – are in work but the employment rate remains lower than it was before the deep recession of 2008-09.

Today he has the pleasure of an audience with the UK economics press pack. Photograph: POOL/REUTERS</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world.</strong></p> <p>UK economics is centre-stage today, with the release of fresh unemployment data (<strong>at 9.30am</strong>) followed by the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report (<strong>from 10.30am</strong>).&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>And what a difference three months makes.</strong> Back on August 7, governor Mark Carney pushed the Bank of England into a bold new era by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/07/bank-of-engand-links-interest-rates-jobless-target\"><strong>setting 'forward guidance' on interest rates</strong></a>. Effectively he pledged that borrowing costs won't rise until the UK jobless rate drops to 7% (<em>from 7.7% a month ago</em>), which Carney didn't see happening until 2016.</p> <p>Since then, a rich seam of solid economic data has shown that Britain's economy is performing better than most analysts thought in August. So the Bank is likely to upgrade its growth forecasts, and could also predict that unemployment will fall faster than previously expected.</p> <p><strong>And that could fuel predictions that UK interest rates will finally rise from their record low of 0.5% somewhat earlier than 2016</strong>.</p> <p>The unemployment data, meanwhile, is expected to show another drop in the number of people signing on for the Jobseeker's Allowance in October. The headline jobless rate is expected to stay at 7.7% for the three months to September.</p> <p>Michael Hewson of CMC helpfully rounds up the recent figures:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest&nbsp;unemployment&nbsp;numbers look set to show the&nbsp;ILO September&nbsp;unemployment&nbsp;rate stuck at 7.7%&nbsp;despite double digit falls in jobless claims numbers for the last four months.</p> <p>Claims numbers for October&nbsp;are expected to show another&nbsp;double digit decline of 33k, following on from declines of 41.7k, 32.6k, 29.2k and 21.2k, in previous months.</p> </blockquote> <p>But with pay still lagging behind inflation (which fell to 2.2% yesterday), it may not feel like a recovery to many.</p> <p><em><strong>We'll be tracking all the events through the day...</strong></em></p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-13T07:42:19.086Z\">at 7.42am GMT</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422360318|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|c26f4ab4f6e13790bb78440fbf15a02fc58d90e8 -->",

The security forces could only watch as more than 100,000 sacks of rice were carried away. </p><p>The eight were crushed to death when a wall in the warehouse collapsed, spokesman Rex Estoperez told the Associated Press. Other rice warehouses were dotted around the region, he said, refusing to give their locations for security reasons.</p><p>The Philippines government has come under fire for failing to deliver aid adequately or quickly enough, with growing frustration in the hardest hit areas, such as Tacloban, the capital of Leyte province where dead bodies have piled up on the streets and residents have resorted to looting to find food.</p><p>A military official told the Guardian on Wednesday that the government was aiming to double its relief efforts within the next two days. Attempts to provide help were buoyed by the expected arrival of two extra US military C-130 planes and one additional Australian air force plane.</p><p>Three relief distribution points were being set up in the Leyte island towns of Tacloban, Guiuan and Ormoc, the official said, with the main aid effort operating out of neighbouring Cebu instead of Manila, the capital, which is 360 miles to the north.</p><p>More than 10,000 people are feared to have been killed in the Philippines due to Haiyan, most of them in Leyte province, with aid workers suggesting that number may rise significantly. As many as 29 municipalities have still not been reached due to impassable roads and downed telecommunications. </p><p>President Benigno Aquino III said on Tuesday that he believed the number killed to be far lower – around 2,500 – and told CNN that the 10,000 figure may have come from an \"emotional\" official, with government figures alleging that the death toll stands at 2,275. The UN has said more than 670,000 people have been displaced and a total of 11.3 million people directly affected by the super storm.</p><p>International relief efforts intensified with the launch of a UN appeal and the dispatch of American, British and Japanese troops to the affected regions. But minimal amounts of aid have reached the worst‑hit areas.</p><p>More than 3,000 people surged on to the tarmac of Tacloban airport on Tuesday morning in the hope of flying out on the two Philippine air force planes that had just arrived.</p><p>Babies and sick or elderly people were given priority but only a few hundred were able to leave. Others were held back by soldiers and police. Many had walked for hours and camped at the base overnight.</p><p>\"I was pleading with the soldiers. I was kneeling and begging because I have diabetes,\" said Helen Cordial as she lay on a stretcher, shaking. \"Do they want me to die in this airport? They are stone-hearted,\" she told the Associated Press.</p><p>Dean Smith, an Australian who has been living with his family near Palo, Leyte province, for the last five years, told the Guardian that he waited eight hours to be able to get one of the first commercial flights out of Tacloban to Cebu. On the way to the airport he said he saw \"horrifying things that I know I have seen but my brain hasn't processed yet\". </p><p>He described scenes of chaos in the city centre, where police were stealing money from the local cashpoints, people in cars were refusing to drive the injured to get help, and the bloated body of a man floating in dirty water was being gnawed at by a dog.</p><p>\"What people have gone through, what they have seen – there is going to be a lot of post-traumatic stress after this event I assure you,\" he said shakily. \"No one has ever seen anything like this.\"</p><p>Having arrived on Tuesday in Cebu, Smith was planning to stock up on food, medicine and water and take it back to his Palo home, where his wife, six children, a 92-year-old grandmother and a pregnant nanny were all desperately awaiting supplies. He departed for Tacloban early on Wednesday morning.</p><p>Domestic and international relief efforts were being hampered by wet weather, poor communications and damaged infrastructure, with aircraft only able to land in Tacloban during daylight hours because the air control tower had been destroyed by Haiyan. Unsubstantiated reports of aid convoys being attacked by hungry victims circulated, with the Telegraph reporting that communist rebels had been killed whilst <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/10445615/Typhoon-Haiyan-aid-convoys-come-under-fire-as-relief-operation-becomes-logistical-nightmare.html\">trying to intercept a Red Cross convoy</a> destined for the island of Samar.</p><p>Still, Corizon Soliman, secretary of the Philippine department of social welfare and development, said aid had so far reached a third of the city's 45,000 families.</p><p>However armed forces spokesman Ramon Zagala told the BBC that relief workers were struggling to deliver aid for a number of reasons.</p><p>\"The area is very vast and the number of helicopters – although we have a lot of helicopters at the moment – it's really a challenge for us to bring [aid] to all the places and [bring] the number of goods that are needed.\"</p><p>The BBC quoted a Leyte official as saying that although relief goods like medicine and equipment were arriving into the province \"it's just not reaching the people affected\".</p><p>The UN released $25m (£15.7m) in emergency funds for shelter materials and household items, and for assistance with emergency health services, safe water supplies and sanitation.</p><p>The UN aid chief, Valerie Amos, launched an appeal for $300m as she arrived in Manila. \"We have deployed specialist teams, vital logistics support and dispatched critical supplies but we have to do more and faster,\" she said.</p><p>The US, Britain, Japan, Australia and other nations have pledged tens of millions of dollars in immediate aid, and some businesses have also offered help: banking group HSBC announced a $1m (£630,000) cash donation.</p><p>In Tacloban shops were stripped of food and water by hungry residents. While some tents had arrived, the widespread damage left many people sleeping in the ruins of their homes or under shredded trees.</p><p>Military doctors at a makeshift clinic at the airport said they had treated about 1,000 people for cuts, bruises and deep wounds but did not have enough medical supplies.</p><p>\"It's overwhelming,\" said Antonio Tamayo, an air force captain. \"We need more medicine. We can't give anti-tetanus vaccine shots because we have none.\"</p><p>The typhoon flattened Basey, a seaside town in Samar province about six miles across a bay from Tacloban. About 2,000 people were missing there, its governor said. Rescue and relief workers were yet to reach many of the more remote areas.</p><p>\"There are hundreds of other towns and villages stretched over thousands of kilometres that were in the path of the typhoon and with which all communication has been cut,\" said Natasha Reyes, emergency co-ordinator in the Philippines at Médecins Sans Frontières. \"No one knows what the situation is like in these more rural and remote places, and it's going to be some time before we have a full picture.\"</p><p>Damage to communications left the armed forces struggling to reach local authorities and many officials were dead, missing or trying to protect their own families.</p><p>\"Basically the only branch of government that is working here is the military,\" Ruben Guinolbay, a Philippine army captain, told Reuters in Tacloban. \"That is not good. We are not supposed to take over government.\"</p><p>The interior secretary, Manuel Roxas, said on Tuesday that only 20 of Tacloban's 293 police had arrived for work. But he added: \"Today we have stabilised the situation. There are no longer reports of looting. The food supply is coming in. Up to 50,000 food packs are coming in every day, with each pack able to feed up to a family of five for three days.\"</p><p>A team of British medical experts and the first consignment of aid from the UK was leaving for the Philippines, David Cameron said on Tuesday.</p><p>The UK surgical team, led by Anthony Redmond, Manchester University professor of international emergency medicine, includes three emergency physicians, two orthopaedic surgeons, a plastic surgeon, two accident and emergency nurses, a theatre nurse, two anaesthetists and one specialist physiotherapist.</p><p>The USS George Washington aircraft carrier, transporting about 5,000 sailors and more than 80 aircraft, plus four other US navy ships, should arrive in two to three days, the Pentagon said.</p><p>Britain's HMS Daring, a warship with equipment to make drinking water from seawater, and a military transport aircraft should arrive around the same time.</p><p>Japan is sending a team of 40 from its self-defence force.</p><p>Aquino has declared a state of national calamity, allowing the central government to release emergency funds more quickly and impose price controls.</p><p>Initial estimates of the cost of the damage vary widely, with a report from German-based CEDIM Forensic Disaster Analysis putting the total at anywhere from $8bn to $19bn.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422353950|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|7325428a23f22798381e4da038c16d690f93c266 -->",

        "body":"<h2>Koshari Street</h2><p>Koshari is an Egyptian snack food, a warm mix of rice, chickpeas and macaroni, topped with fresh tomato sauce, sold from street stalls and hole-in-the-wall takeaways. Koshari Street – a tiny, slick canteen with limited counter seating – serves Lebanese cook and food writer Anissa Helou's take on this Cairo classic, which she has jazzed-up with toasted vermicelli, crispy, caramelised onions, garlic sauce and an aromatic sprinkling of mixed nuts, herbs and spices. The &quot;hot&quot; tomato sauce is a little meek (there is also a &quot;mad&quot; version to try), but the filling koshari offers layers of bright, interesting flavours. Thanks to that secret doqqa spice mix, you get a heady whiff of something exotic each time you exhale. <br />• <em>Koshari from &pound;4.50, salads, soups and wraps from &pound;2.95. 56 St Martin's Lane WC2, 020-7836 1056, </em><a href=\"http://www.kosharistreet.com/\" title=\"\"><em>kosharistreet.com</em></a></p><h2>Honey &amp; Co.</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-422397456\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384342200655/Honey--Co-Cafe-Soho-Londo-008.jpg\" alt=\"Honey &amp; Co Cafe, Soho, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Photograph: Heloise Faure</figcaption></figure><p>At lunch and dinner, this small, critically acclaimed cafe-restaurant is a little too expensive for the true budget traveller. Instead, slip in at breakfast to try Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich's skilful Levantine cooking at sub-&pound;10 prices. The morning menu runs from baked goods (blueberry and sour cream doughnuts; toasted fig, walnut and orange loaf), to pizza-like lahma breads topped with, for instance, spiced lamb, tahini and pine nuts. There is usually an ijje (herb and feta) frittata on the menu, too. A merguez sausage roll was excellent: the pastry light and buttery, the two spicy lamb sausages nicely moistened by a base slather of vivid tomato sauce. On the side, a dollop of sweetly perfumed harissa added colour and, even at this time of day, you get a little complimentary bowl of chopped tomatoes, tiny hot green guindilla peppers and amazing kalamata olives, as sweet as they are salty and sour.<br />• <em>Breakfast, &pound;3–&pound;6. 25a Warren Street W1, 020-7388 6175,</em><a href=\"http://honeyandco.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em> honeyandco.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Attendant</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-422397457\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384342333173/Attendant-cafe-restaurant-008.jpg\" alt=\"Attendant cafe-restaurant, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Photograph: Ming Tang-Evans</figcaption></figure><p>With its blaring music and old copies of The Face left about as reading material, there will be plenty of people who find Attendant too cool for school. And that is before we get to the quirky fact that this subterranean space was once a public toilet. You eat and drink at tiny counters built into an ornate Victorian urinal. Which would be painfully trendy, were Attendant's food and its artisan coffee (Caravan beans, Jersey cows' milk) not as good as they are. It's all relatively simple stuff: almond milk porridge and croissants at breakfast; soup, hot deli sandwiches, salads and Bittersweet bakery cakes at lunch. However, the ingredients used are first-rate and it's all rendered with a quiet flair. A breakfast muffin of Montgomery cheddar souffl&eacute; (actually, more a flattened omelette) was exemplary in its detail. Dressed with oven-roasted tomatoes, buttery pan-fried mushrooms and fresh baby spinach, every element tasted vibrantly of itself. That shouldn't be a surprise, but it is. <br /><em>• Sandwiches and hot dishes around &pound;3–&pound;5.50. 27a Foley Street W1, 020-7637 3794, </em><a href=\"http://www.the-attendant.com/\" title=\"\"><em>the-attendant.com</em></a></p><h2>Scandinavian Kitchen<br /></h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-422397458\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384342518921/Scandinavian-kitchen-Lond-008.jpg\" alt=\"Scandinavian kitchen, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This specialist Scandi food store and cafe offers what can only be described as a smorgasbord of food to eat-in or takeaway. You can start your morning with toasted sourdough sandwiches, a smoked salmon and egg roll, or a Nordic rye and oat porridge that will put hairs on your chest. Then, for lunch, the kitchen dishes up numerous varieties of mix 'n' match wraps and open sandwiches (tiny, moreish meatballs in a sweet, sharp beetroot cream; smoked mackerel with fennel and crushed peas), accompanied by various salads. These might include new potatoes in a dill vinaigrette, or sharp, spritzy shredded white cabbage and oregano. The portions don't look huge, but, rest assured, those dark, heavy Scandinavian breads will fill you up. Of course, the cardamom-spiked kanelbullar swirls, sticky with cinnamon jam, are excellent; as are the smiley, eager-to-please staff. <br />• <em>Breakfast &pound;2.25–&pound;4.50, lunch &pound;2.95–&pound;9.95. 61 Great Titchfield Street W1, 020-7580 7161,</em><a href=\"http://www.scandikitchen.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em> scandikitchen.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Honest Burger</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-422397459\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384349089666/Honest-Burger-008.jpg\" alt=\"Honest Burger\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Made from 35-day aged beef (sourced from ace butcher the Ginger Pig), these thick patties – and Honest Burger's salty, rosemary-flecked, skin-on chips – are legendary across London. Arrive early to grab a seat or, if you're looking to keep the cost down, takeaway and dodge the queues altogether. At &pound;9.50, the eponymous Honest burger may sound expensive, but this is the sort of profoundly beefy burger – charred with a sensational crust on the outside, but still juicy and pink within – that will live long in the memory. It is complemented by a not overly sweet caramelised onion jam; dill-and-mustard-seed pickled cucumber; and superb thick-cut smoked bacon. <br />• <em>Beef burger and chips from &pound;8. 4a Meard Street W1, 020-3609 9524, </em><a href=\"http://honestburgers.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>honestburgers.co.uk</em> </a></p><h2>Foxcroft &amp; Ginger<br /></h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-422397460\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384349181239/Foxcroft-and-Ginger-Londo-008.jpg\" alt=\"Foxcroft and Ginger, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With its utilitarian, white-tiled interior, hip music and good coffee, F&amp;G is quintessential modern Soho. A basement bakery keeps the counter filled with fantastic cakes (rich, ganache-like chocolate brownies are particularly brilliant, &pound;1.70), and breads that are used at lunch for &quot;saucy buns&quot;, filled with, for instance, slow-cooked pork, jalapenos, smoky tomatoes and mozzarella, or buttermilk fried chicken with avocado and garlic mayonnaise. My shredded beef and cheddar bun could have done with more of the advertised beef juices, but it was tasty enough. There are gourmet salads (such new potato with roasted lemon and radicchio), sandwiches and frittatas available and, in the evening, Foxcroft serves sourdough pizzas with innovative toppings.<br />• <em>Breakfast/weekend brunch, &pound;2.80–&pound;9.50, lunch &pound;3.50–&pound;6.50, pizzas from &pound;4.95. 3 Berwick Street W1, 020-3602 3371,</em><a href=\"http://foxcroftandginger.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em> foxcroftandginger.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Pizza Pilgrims</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-422397461\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384342133649/Pizza-Pilgrims-Soho-Londo-001.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza Pilgrims, Soho, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Photograph: Paul Winch-Furness</figcaption></figure><p>The gilded rise of brothers Thom and James Elliot, from street food sensations to proper restaurateurs (of course, they already have a glossy cookbook out), may rankle with those who, romantically, regard street food as eating's punk rock: a matter of grassroots passion, not a career. However, it is difficult to carp when, thanks to the Elliots, you can now takeaway A1 pizza, in the middle of Soho, from &pound;6. Whichever way you slice it, that has to be a good thing. Pilgrims' bases are somewhat thicker and softer than you might expect, yet blackened with patches of delicious char. Toppings run to the spicy Calabrian 'nduja, fennel sausage, portobello mushrooms and truffle, but the house-blitzed San Marzano plum tomato sauce is so vibrant it will, finally, make you understand why the Neapolitans love a cheese-free marina pizza. On a sunny day, take your pizza around the corner into the Soho Square gardens.<br />Pizza lovers should note that, at the time of writing, the renowned (and, for my money, marginally better)<a href=\"http://francomanca.co.uk\" title=\"\"> Franco Manca</a> were about to open a site on nearby Tottenham Court Road. <br />• <em>From &pound;6 takeaway, &pound;7 eat-in. 11 Dean Street W1, 020-7287 8964, </em><a href=\"http://pizzapilgrims.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>pizzapilgrims.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Chettinad<br /></h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-422397462\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384342684114/Chettinad-lunch-box-Londo-008.jpg\" alt=\"Chettinad lunch box, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When discussing tasty, affordable curry in central London, two venues come up again and again: the canteen at the Indian YMCA (41 Fitzroy Square, W1) and the &pound;6.95 daily buffet at Diwana Bhel Poori, close to Euston station (121-123 Drummond Street, NW1, 020-7387 5556). For the ultimate in budget dining, however, neither can compete with the take-out, lunch-box deal at Tamil restaurant Chettinad. Served in a moulded, airline-style tray, it comprises a nibbly starter, three curries, raita, a roti and rice, for &pound;3.75 (vegetarian) or &pound;3.95 (meat). No, that isn't a typo. That is a full meal for under four quid. Impressively studded with fresh herbs and spices, a couple of tiny, lukewarm bhajis were a bit tough and leathery, but rest of the food was remarkable for the money. The rice had been winningly mined with cashew nuts, lentils and mustard seeds and, like the best south Indian food, the curries were restrained in their heat, allowing well-rounded flavour to shine through. On a cold day, a melting, slow-cooked chickpea curry in a rich tomato sauce was first-rate comfort food. Note: you can eat-in and takeaway for under &pound;10 in the evening, too.<br />• <em>Lunch box from &pound;3.75, takeaway, eat-in lunch &pound;6.95.

One of which is catching on in central London, too. Bi Bim Bap has just opened a second site in Fitzrovia, in addition to its Soho original. My traditional dol sot, a mixed vegetable version with mooli, daikon, spinach and more, was surprisingly tasty, a fried egg giving it a lovely creamy texture. You can add sinus-clearing gochujang chilli sauce as you go. The staff will happily explain the intricacies of all this to any bibimbap virgins. <br />• <em>Bi Bim Bap from &pound;6.45–&pound;9.95.

Behind the counter, a huge grill keeps the meats coming for bun salads and banh canh soups, both made using homemade noodles. They also server creditable banh mi, Vietnamese baguette sandwiches, which aren't the best in London – you'll have to go further east for that – but are authentically lighter than their French cousins; the meats deliver good flavours and, crucially, the shavings of pickled carrot and mooli are sharp enough to jangle your taste buds. Elsewhere, the menu runs from a six-hour simmered pho to savoury banh xeo pancakes. <br />• <em>Takeaway banh mi, &pound;4.35, noodle dishes and rice boxes from &pound;5.50.

        "headline":"Jennifer Lawrence is striking a blow for healthy, sweaty women",
        "body":"<p>Glancing at gossip mags while waiting in the queue at the supermarket suggests that women have just two body types: grossly overweight (which is seemingly anything over a size 12) or skinny and boney. So when Jennifer Lawrence, current heroine of Hollywood and legend among outspoken women everywhere, says that she wants to be <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/11/jennifer-lawrence-considered-a-fat-actress/\" title=\"\">\"fit and strong\"</a>, it is music to our ears. Finally, recognition of another option.</p><p>On Newsnight, speaking of playing Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games, Lawrence said that she refused to lose weight for roles, explaining: \"We have the ability to control this image that young girls are going to be seeing. They see enough of this body that they will never be able to obtain and it's an amazing opportunity to rid ourselves of that in this industry.\"</p><p>Sure, it's silly that a body type should even need celebrity endorsement, but what Lawrence has done here is a pretty rare thing among her peers. Various female celebrities will trot out similar lines in what come across as weak Kumbaya moments, where womankind should all join hands and rejoice. Rarely though, do we ever hear high-profile women say they want to look healthy.</p><p>For those of us who lead active lifestyles, we've been flying this flag for a long time. Historically, it's been deemed rather unladylike to sweat, making exercise somewhat of a problem, lest we get a little red faced or our hair get dishevelled. Women have been ushered towards gentler forms of exercise – a spot of yoga, a cheesy Jane Fonda DVD, or if we want to go a bit crazy, some Zumba.</p><p>But the tide has been slowly turning. More and more women are shirking the idea that you're either sporty or not, and experimenting with different ways to stay active. We're pushing the boundaries of what it means to be feminine and fit. We're running ultra marathons, skateboarding, doing Muay Thai and, sorry to upset the apple cart here guys, but we're sweating profusely while doing it. What's more we're not exercising with vanity in mind. A survey of visitors to my fitness website <a href=\"http://spikesandheels.com/\" title=\"\">Spikes &amp; Heels</a> revealed that barely any of the women working out regularly did so for weight loss reasons. The majority cited overall health, fitness and mental wellbeing as their driving force.</p><p>I particularly appreciate that Lawrence mentioned she wants to be strong. Any woman with an ounce of common sense has figured out that the \"lifting weights makes you bulky\" school of thought is utter nonsense. Women are becoming less fearful of the weights section in the gym and are squatting and deadlifting their way to greatness.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/03/thigh-gap-pressure-point-women-self-esteem\" title=\"\">\"thigh gap\" brigade</a> on Tumblr – legions of young women whose mission in life is to be so thin as to see a space between the tops of their legs – have come up against a new breed of fit chicks. The \"Strong is the new Sexy\" crowd post photos of women with defined muscles and six packs, doing pull ups while glistening with sweat (they all still have perfect hair and makeup though – I'm not saying that this movement isn't without its flaws).</p><p>Jennifer Lawrence's comments couldn't have come at a better time. With levels of inactivity at an all-time high in this country, having someone in her position championing being fit and strong may be just the boost a young woman needs to make a change. Make your way to the weights section, ladies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422307757|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|fdae8da322868f19a7318c2815da07b886ce1198 -->",

        "trailText":"<p>As the Sony PlayStation 4's US launch looms, here are the best initial titles, from Killzone: Shadow Fall to Call of Duty: Ghosts. By <strong>Keith Stuart</strong></p>",
        "headline":"PS4: the 10 key launch titles",
        "body":"<p>A few days ago, Amazon US posted a photo of its warehouse, stacked high with thousands of PlayStation 4 boxes, ready to ship out to American stores on Friday. At last, the arrival of the next console generation is imminent and palpable. It'll all be about the games from now on. Hopefully.</p><p>So to get us started, here are the 10 key PS4 launch titles – they're the ones we think will sell, or will define the launch period. Actually, some of them are just the ones that interest <em>us</em>. Whatever, have a look and see if you agree...  </p><h2><strong>Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, Ubisoft</strong></h2><p>Set amid the swashbuckling and treasure pilfering of piracy's golden age, the latest yarn in Ubisoft's historical adventure series is a distinct improvement on the last couple of instalments. Loaded with visually astonishing sea battles, it's a lavish way to start your next-gen career. Plus, the good news for PS4 owners is that this version of the game contains an hour of additional content in the form of three extra missions. There's also an Assassin's IV console bundle, replacing the Drive Club one that's now on hold due to the game's development delay. You'll find a nice walkthrough of some of the single-player game <a href=\"http://youtu.be/jHDfm2AYZS4\">on PlayStation Access</a>.</p><h2><strong>Battlefield 4, Electronic Arts</strong></h2><p>Fantastic multiplayer maps, wonderfully apocalyptic destruction and the tight, taut action we've come to expect from the series, Battlefield 4 is in a commanding position as the top military shooters make the generational crossover. Several retailers are offering Battlefield bundles for Sony's machine, but you'll have to wait for the Second Assault DLC pack – it's a timed exclusive on Xbox One. YouTuber Ali A has some <a href=\"http://youtu.be/alB3t7-bZ-c\">rather nice multiplayer PS4 footage</a>.</p><h2><strong>Call of Duty: Ghosts, Activison</strong></h2><p>Infinity Ward has abandoned the Modern Warfare arc, but its futuristic America-in-peril narrative is hauntingly familiar, while the multiplayer dwells on the same old twitchcore tricks and tactics. This is, however, still a thrilling ride, and running at 1080p in 60 frames-a-second, it looks its absolute best on PS4. As with Battlefield, a timed Xbox One exclusivity deal means the first DLC drop will be delayed on Sony's machine – but you can just spend that time enjoying the superior graphical performance.</p><h2><strong>Contrast, Compulsion Games</strong></h2><p>One of the first indie titles to appear on PS4's digital platform, Contrast is a fascinating 20s-based platformer, following the imaginary friend of a young girl investigating the secrets of her troubled family. With vaudevillian settings, a cool jazz soundtrack and a stylised mix of 2D and 3D visuals, this is a stark contrast to the triple A hits. It's coming later to a bunch of other platforms, but it's worth catching on PS4 from launch.</p><h2><strong>Fifa 14/Madden, EA Sports</strong></h2><p>Okay, I'm cheating – this is two games – but of course, in launch terms these EA Sports blockbusters are doing the same thing. As well as appeasing sports mad gamers, they're providing the state-of-the-art football action for young male professionals who can afford to buy a new machine in order to play one or two games a year – and who invariably choose one of these two titles on an annual basis. Both games are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/sep/02/fifa-14-preview-interview\">enhanced from their current-gen offerings</a> with better animations, AI and stadia – although the Xbox One version adds the Ultimate Team Legends content, with around 40 classic players.</p><h2><strong>Killzone: Shadow Fall, Sony</strong></h2><p>Guerrilla's ice-cold sci-fi blaster has been the PlayStation technical showcase of choice since the second console – and Shadow Fall is definitely a major player this time round too. Taking place 30 years after the last title, the action now plays out on a hostile planet where the Vektans and the Helghast are divided by a huge wall – and either metaphorically or physically, it's about to come crashing down. The game is clearly a graphical marvel, but the grit is beginning to wear thin. </p><h2><strong>Knack, Sony</strong></h2><p>Designed by Mark Cerny, the engineering leader on PS4 and veteran of such games as Sonic 2, Crash Bandicoot and Ratchet and Clank, this is Sony's own family pleaser. It's a colourful action adventure following the eponymous robot who can transform himself into a range of useful objects to defeat invading goblins. Early reports from the specialist press aren't exactly amazing, but the game looks to have plenty of charm and there are some arresting vistas to gaze upon.</p><h2><strong>Lego Marvel Super Heroes, Warner Bros</strong></h2><p>The latest title in the long-running Lego series switches from Batman and his DC pals to Marvel heroes like Hulk, Spider-Man and Wolverine. The formula is ridiculously familiar, but with that rich comic book heritage, some great set-pieces and a few fresh features for PS4, this entertaining adventure just pips Skylanders Swap Force (which also gets a visual overhaul for PS4) as the third-party kid-friendly title to opt for.</p><h2><strong>Resogun, Sony</strong></h2><p>Ah, another frenetic, hypnotic shooter from Super Stardust creator Housemarque, this time in a rotating 2D environment buzzing with laser blasts, eye-popping explosions and blazing score multipliers. It's got missiles, it's got nova-bombs and it'll be free for users who subscribe to the PlayStation Plus online gaming service. Until Xbox One gets a new Geometry Wars, this is the place to come for next-gen schmup action.</p><h2><strong>Super Motherload, XGen Studios</strong></h2><p>Another indie download, this time a procedurally generated digging sim with four-player co-op. Set on a colonised future Mars, the aim is to burrow deep under the planet's surface, grabbing minerals and bringing them to the surface for cash and experience points, which can be spent on customising your craft. Developed by Edmonton-based XGen Studios, it's sort of an RPG-infused version of brilliant platformer Spelunky, with some Mr Driller (the classic Namco arcade/Dreamcast puzzler) chucked in. This is a good thing.</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/31/ps4-sony-playstation-cant-play-audio-cds-mp3s\">PS4: five new things we've learned</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/11/playstation-four-makes-debut\">Sony has high hopes for PlayStation 4's debut this month</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/06/ps4-or-xbox-one-parents-guide\">PS4 or Xbox One?

There was always going to be a battle for René's services and, with the assistance of our chairman Shahid Khan, we've been able to bring one of the best coaches in the world to Fulham.\"</p><p>The move to bring in Meulensteen comes with the club inside the relegation places after 11 games.</p><p>Meulensteen, who will take up the post immediately, said: \"I was impressed by the vision of Shahid Khan and Alistair Mackintosh. I've spent many hours talking with Martin Jol and we share a vision of how football should be played and how players should be developed. It's our job to make sure we can bring this vision to life on the pitch for the fans.\"</p><p>Meulensteen's last job was in Russia in July at Anzhi Makhachkala, who he joined as assistant coach to another Dutchman, Guus Hiddink. However, Hiddink left the club two games into the season after which Meulensteen only lasted 16 days as manager.</p><p>Fulham have lost their last three matches and lie 18th in the league.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422391502|2013-11-13T15:50:01Z|23b2cb358f236f651feef84f2f5293d946ee6c76 -->",
