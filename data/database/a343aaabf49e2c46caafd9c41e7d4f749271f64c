No one is.\"</p><p>He also accuses Keane, who will be a pundit on ITV's coverage of Arsenal v Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night, of starting to think he was the manager. \"The one thing I will not allow is a loss of control, because control was my only saviour,\" writes Ferguson.</p><p>Ferguson arrived at United's pre-season training camp in Portugal on the eve of the 2005-06 season to find Keane raging against the facilities and the house in which he had been put up.</p><p>After the infamous MUTV interview – in which he slated players including Kieran Richardson, Darren Fletcher, Alan Smith, Edwin van der Sar and Rio Ferdinand following a game against Middlesbrough – Keane suggested the whole squad gather to watch it together.</p><p>Ferguson had already told his captain the interview was a \"disgrace\" and a \"joke\". After they had watched the video, Van der Sar and Keane locked horns before the Irishman turned on his manager, accusing him of bringing his private life into the club with his dispute with the racehorse owner John Magnier over Rock of Gibraltar.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420668051'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/10/22/1382439742708/Roy-Keane-008.jpg' alt='Roy Keane' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Roy Keane was a leader on the pitch but, according to Sir Alex Ferguson, became an unwelcome distraction as his career declined. Photograph: SHAUN, BOTTERILL/ALLSPORT</figcaption></figure><p>\"The hardest part of Roy's body is his tongue,\" writes Ferguson. \"What I noticed about him that day as I was arguing with him was that his eyes started to narrow, almost to wee black beads. It was frightening to watch. And I'm from Glasgow.\"</p><p>Carlos Queiroz, then assistant manager, told him it was \"the worst imaginable spectacle\" and in that moment Ferguson resolved that Keane, the rock on which United's success had been built and a hero to the fans, needed to be sold.</p><p>Asked at his press conference on Tuesday whether he expected Keane to respond, Ferguson said: \"The nature of the man you can expect that, that is the personality he has. But the reason was I had to explain what happened. It happened so quickly. He criticised his team-mates. We could not release that video. It ended up with two young players being booed in Paris [against Lille] on the Wednesday.</p><p>\"The meeting in the room was horrendous. I just could not lose my control in that situation. If I had let it pass I think the players would have viewed me differently.</p><p>\"Throughout my career I have been strong enough to deal with issues like that. Roy absolutely overstepped the line. There was nothing else we could do.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420629780|2013-10-23T17:15:08Z|3fba56e5d1c73250899efe6529949b768d6d622a -->",

Keane ruled with an iron fist and a savage tongue, which Ferguson said was the hardest part of his body. Their fall-out has become part of Old Trafford folklore and Ferguson traces the context to the decline in Keane’s on-field powers, and the related frustration he felt with that.<br />Keane had been furious about what he felt had been substandard pre-season facilities at Vale de Lobo, Portugal, in 2005 but it all kicked off when he gave his notorious interview to MUTV, in which he slaughtered many of his teammates including, according to Ferguson, Kieran Richardson, Darren Fletcher, Alan Smith, Edwin Van Der Sar and Rio Ferdinand. Of Ferdinand, Keane is said to have been scornful of the defender’s belief that he was a superstar ... “just because you are paid &pound;120,000-a-week and play well for 20 minutes against Tottenham.”<br />Keane suggested that the squad watched the interview in order for them to make up their own minds and what followed was a ferocious confrontation between him and many of them, together with Ferguson. In front of the squad, Keane slated Ferguson for bringing his personal affairs to United, in the form of his dispute with John Magnier over the racehorse, Rock of Gibraltar. Ferguson said that it had been “frightening” to watch. He had to act and he immediately sanctioned the paying up of Keane’s contract and his departure to Celtic.<br />Ferguson writes that Keane did pop in to see him to apologise but the relationship has since turned ugly again after public comments between the pair. Ferguson also passes judgement on Keane’s managerial career, saying that he needed money to build squads and lacked the requisite patience to do so.&quot;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52667c51e4b027bac8ef98f4\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-22T14:26:38.824+01:00\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">On Liverpool</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Ferguson was highly critical of Liverpool and Kenny Dalglish for their role in the Patrice Evra-Luis Suarez affair.</p> <p>On Liverpool's decision to wear T-shirts in support of the Uruguayan, he described it as &quot;the most ridiculous thing for a club of their stature&quot;.</p> <p>He added that nobody at Liverpool had to power to rein Dalglish in, saying his compatriot fell back &quot;on the old chip on the shoulder&quot;.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-930eb0d3-e386-49e0-af6f-1785a3b6494d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/22/1382448467656/bda3eaa3-e022-4bb4-9ab1-6eadb9627dad-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Liverpool's Glen Johnson warms up while wearing a t-shirt bearing the name and image of team mate Luis Suarez\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Liverpool's Glen Johnson warms up while wearing a t-shirt bearing the name and image of team mate Luis Suarez Photograph: Reuters</figcaption> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-22T14:28:11.627+01:00\">at 2.28pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52667bb4e4b0162f36966bc9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-22T14:21:31.160+01:00\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">On not accepting the England job offers</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was a great opportunity to relegate England.

Only the mean-spirited would not be thrilled by the sight of a man fulfilling his possibilities. If he inflicted some damage on us, that was fair enough. It did not weaken my belief that the policies I was putting in place when I transferred him would bring dividends.</p> <p>Ferguson&nbsp;on Beckham</p> <p>I could find no justification for Hoddle's insistence that David had to appear at a press conference while he was still reeling from the shock of being dropped for England's opening World Cup match. It would have been more sensible to give the lad private encouragement to react positively to the biggest disappointment of his international career.</p> <p>Ferguson&nbsp;on McGrath</p> <p>Although Norman Whiteside's drinking never struck me as being as serious as Paul McGrath's, he was a worthy companion for the big defender when it came to carousing. I was saddened as well as infuriated by the way they abused themselves, since both had the sort of talent given to only a tiny elite of footballers</p> <p>Ferguson&nbsp;on Robson</p> <p>It would have been impossible for any manager to avoid thinking of Robbo as a hero. He was a miracle of commitment, a human marvel who pushed himself beyond every imaginable limit.

        "body":"<p>They are two subjects that would be high up on any list of likely targets in Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography and he does not disappoint with the former Manchester United manager reserving some of his most barbed criticism for the Football Association and referees.</p><p>Ferguson had many run-ins with the FA  his 27-year tenure at Old Trafford and his parting shot is to claim that its disciplinary unit tended to go after high-profile targets because it resulted in favourable publicity.</p><p>In particular, he singles out the incident when Wayne Rooney was handed a three-match ban for swearing into the television cameras at Upton Park. He is also scathing about the mentality and structure of the FA.</p><p>\"It was never really possible to work out who was running English football's governing body. You would get Exeter schools having a say,\" he writes, witheringly. \"It's an institutional problem. Reformers go in there six feet two inches tall and come out five feet four inches.\"</p><p>He says the new chairman, Greg Dyke, has to reduce the number of people involved in making decisions. \"A committee of 100 people can't produce sensible management\".</p><p>Elsewhere, he says it is an \"indictment\" on England teams at youth level that so many fall back on \"outdated\" long-ball tactics. \"Because they don't have enough technical ability and coaching the years from nine to 16 are thrown away.\"</p><p>Ferguson also declares that there are no \"really top\" referees in the modern game, damning them as unfit and \"as a group, aren't doing their job as well as they should be\".</p><p>Claiming that the behaviour of his players in big games was \"generally excellent\", he outlines his disappointment with the current crop of Premier League referees. \"By the end, I felt we hadn't had a really top Premier League referee for a long time.\"</p><p>Ferguson said the experiment with making referees full time has been a failure and argues they should be made to move close to the FA's central hub at St George's Park.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420651143|2013-10-23T17:15:08Z|2f3b9c2071600d0f9798877cbe0344820a169b66 -->",

I could see him being swallowed up by the media or publicity agents,\" Ferguson writes, relating an episode where Beckham insisted on keeping his hat on during a team dinner in order to avoid revealing a new hairstyle.</p><p>Ferguson describes his \"dejection\" at the path Beckham took and describes his departure for Real Madrid in £24.5m transfer in 2003 as all but inevitable.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420668630'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/10/22/1382438403686/david-beckham-008.jpg' alt='david beckham' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>David Beckham sports a plaster over his cut eyebrow following the dressing-room bust-up with Alex Ferguson.

You've let your team down, you can argue as much as you like,\" writes Ferguson.</p><p>When he saw photographs of Beckham wearing an alice band to highlight the injury, he resolved to sell the player. \"David thought he was bigger than Alex Ferguson. There is no doubt about that in my mind.\"</p><p>Ferguson describes his admiration for Beckham in the way he prolonged his career and tenaciously fought to earn moves to Milan and Paris Saint-Germain after leaving for the US, but the underlying tone is sadness at what he views as a talent squandered.</p><p>He said at his press conference: \"He fell in love with Victoria and that changed everything. I am a football man. If he had asked my advice when he left Real Madrid for LA Galaxy I would have told him exactly what I thought.</p><p>\"Maybe in years to come he will think maybe he should have stayed at Real Madrid but I don't think I have been too critical.</p><p>\"How can you argue with how he has turned out. He's a marvellous boy. He worked to get to the point where he became a great player.</p><p>Ferguson pays Beckham the ultimate in backhanded compliments in the book when he says the player showed \"more graft\" in finding a way back from Los Angeles Galaxy to the top of the European game than he did at the end of his time with United.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420626871|2013-10-23T17:15:08Z|f6da16b490b07fd6c92128055311d08cd7c6d8cb -->",

My judgment was that Wayne wasn't playing well enough.</p><p>\"But when you see him playing like he is, do you think I would drop him? No way. He is England's great white hope and a great player for Manchester United. The player who is playing now is a different player.\"</p><p>In his book, My Autobiography, Ferguson says he felt Rooney was being controlled by his agent, Paul Stretford, during the protracted episode in 2010, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/22/wayne-rooney-staying-manchester-united\" title=\"\">which ended with the player signing a new contract</a>.</p><p>Ferguson felt Rooney was \"sheepish\" during the confrontation, in which he said United should have pursued Özil when he signed for Real Madrid from Werder Bremen, and had been \"programmed in what he was trying to say\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420666019'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/10/22/1382440568376/Mesut-Ozil--008.jpg' alt='Mesut Ozil ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sir Alex Ferguson was urged to sign Mesut Özil by Wayne Rooney before the German midfielder went to Arsenal and set the Gunners alight.

I would hammer him for any drop in condition,\" writes Ferguson, who is withering about his contribution in his final season.</p><p>Despite occasional flashes of brilliance, he felt Rooney was \"struggling to get by people\" and had \"lost some of his old thirst\".</p><p>\"I left him to discuss his future with David Moyes, hoping to see many more great performances from him at Old Trafford,\" concludes Ferguson.</p><p>Ironically, Özil was one of the transfer targets passed over by Moyes during a difficult transitional summer for United and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/02/mesut-ozil-arsenal-real-madrid\" title=\"\">ended up joining Arsenal for £42.5m</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420631393|2013-10-23T17:15:08Z|2c06dedb7e291cb9b0a617a851e35decec27d50b -->",

He was going through the menu.</p><p>\"I told him, 'For Christ's sake, Mark, we've got the weight off you. Why are you tucking into all that stuff?'</p><p>\"We arrived back in Manchester, and Mark was on mobile phone to a Chinese restaurant to order a takeaway. Is there no end to you? I just couldn't make an impact on him.\"</p><p>Ferguson – who had several false starts signing goalkeepers – tried to pull out of a deal to sign Bosnich. </p><p>\"Mark got off to a real bad start. He turned up for training three hours late. He was overweight,\" Ferguson added at a press conference to launch the book. \"We had a bad period trying to replace Peter Schmeichel. Goalkeepers are not my strongest point. By the time we got to [Edwin] van der Sar it was a blessing.\"</p><p>On Wednesday Bosnich defended his record at Manchester United. ''The fact remains that I was the only player he signed twice at Manchester United,'' Bosnich said on Fox Sports. ''In my first season there we won the English Premier League by a record 18 points, which still stands today, and we became the first British team to win the World Club Championship against Palmeiras in Tokyo.''</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420703682|2013-10-23T17:15:08Z|2e1faff06fac9863f148bed712bbb2d9b75fe5b7 -->",

After they had watched the video, Van der Sar and Keane locked horns before the Irishman turned on his manager, accusing him of bringing his private life into the club with his dispute with the racehorse owner John Magnier over Rock of Gibraltar.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420668051'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/10/22/1382439742708/Roy-Keane-008.jpg' alt='Roy Keane' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Roy Keane was a leader on the pitch but, according to Sir Alex Ferguson, became an unwelcome distraction as his career declined.

It was frightening to watch. And I'm from Glasgow.\"</p><p>Carlos Queiroz, then assistant manager, told him it was \"the worst imaginable spectacle\" and in that moment Ferguson resolved that Keane, the rock on which United's success had been built and a hero to the fans, needed to be sold.</p><p>Asked at his press conference on Tuesday whether he expected Keane to respond, Ferguson said: \"The nature of the man you can expect that, that is the personality he has. But the reason was I had to explain what happened. It happened so quickly. He criticised his team-mates. We could not release that video. It ended up with two young players being booed in Paris [against Lille] on the Wednesday.</p><p>\"The meeting in the room was horrendous. I just could not lose my control in that situation. If I had let it pass I think the players would have viewed me differently.</p><p>\"Throughout my career I have been strong enough to deal with issues like that. Roy absolutely overstepped the line. There was nothing else we could do.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420629780|2013-10-23T17:15:08Z|3fba56e5d1c73250899efe6529949b768d6d622a -->",

        "headline":"Sir Alex Ferguson fails to show either side of himself at vapid launch",
        "body":"<p>To the Institute of Directors on London's Pall Mall for the launch of an eagerly awaited football tome that may well outsell The Da Vinci Code and contain even more outlandish conspiracy theories. Whether it's his attitude to officialdom, the tapping-up of players, or the touchline antics of rival managers, Sir Alex Ferguson has regularly been accused of hypocrisy, so it came as no surprise that even in retirement this firebrand socialist and former shop steward chose to launch his memoirs at the headquarters of an organisation known, some might argue, for its contemptuous attitude towards trade unions. Unsurprisingly, throughout an absorbing, but nowhere near white-knuckle question-and-answer session, the peculiar choice of venue was a subject that went resolutely unraised.</p><p>Those of a less cynical bent might point out that the logo of the Institute of Directors references the Greek character Phi, which its Wikipedia page helpfully reveals has \"over the millennia\" come to \"symbolise the pursuit of excellence\". During this millennium and the tail-end of the last, no manager has symbolised its single-minded pursuit across the football landscape as much as the knight of the realm and former Old Trafford autocrat.</p><p>A vision in gilt, turquoise, glass and canvas, the IoD's Nash room was the venue for this press conference. The brush-strokes on its massive portraits of long-dead members of the monarchy may not have been the equal of those of the \"nice little painting\" by the Fulham and former Manchester United midfielder Kieran Richardson that Ferguson had hanging in his Old Trafford office, but they added a suitably regal tone to a 45-minute audience in which an air of general obsequiousness was only occasionally polluted by minor acts of interrogatory insubordination from the floor.</p><p>With almost 200 folk in attendance, the gravity of the occasion could be gauged by the presence of no less a journalistic heavyweight than Nick Robinson, the occasionally shouty political editor of the BBC.</p><p>Much has been written about Ferguson's liberal interpretation of the concept of time over the years, so it came as no big surprise when he pitched up eight minutes early, prompting an unseemly scramble from the many football writers poring over his book, the many photographers taking pictures of the many football writers poring over his book, and the many TV cameramen recording footage of the many photographers taking pictures of the many football writers poring over his book. Lest there be any confusion: this preposterous media circus, about which the Guardian was as enthused as everyone else, was generated by the launch of a book.</p><p>And so to the questions. With four helpful microphone-wielding ladies prowling the floor, they came thick and fast ... but sometimes just thick to the point of impenetrable. The first, a (hopefully) light-hearted request from one Chinese journalist for Ferguson to apologise to a colleague of hers he seems to have unintentionally offended some years ago left everyone confused. \"Well, that was a great start,\" laughed Ferguson, peering quizzically at his interrogator before asking: \"What was the question again?\"</p><p>Over 45 minutes there was plenty of ebb and flow, with a suited Ferguson never looking entirely comfortable or relaxed as he repeatedly clicked open and shut the cap of the pen he was holding, perhaps in preparation for the myriad book-signing sessions that loom in his short-term future. A strict one-question limit forced journalists to use all their cunning.</p><p>\"That's three questions,\" Ferguson faux-barked at the man from one sports-news broadcasting company who had attempted to slip two extra under the radar. \"Typical Sky. Greedy.\"</p><p>Although he wasn't present, the former Football Association chief executive Adam Crozier may be pleased to learn he provided the stand-out and stand-up moment of the afternoon, his name pointedly not cropping up as Ferguson struggled to recall \"the Scots lad from the Post Office\" who was  given the onerous task of offering him the England manager's job.</p><p>According to his estimable ghostwriter Paul Hayward, \"behind Ferguson the dictator you find a totally different man. One who laughs incessantly and seeks out the fun in life\".</p><p>Neither Ferguson the dictator nor his fun-loving counterpart showed themselves at the launch of his latest memoir, a disappointingly vapid briefing devoid of fireworks or much fun, rendered all the poorer by the non-appearance of either version of this mighty football man.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420658389|2013-10-23T17:15:08Z|427d4f125b603a3f34eb80c7f2a43d2e4dd97769 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sir Alex Ferguson may have retired from football management, but like a deposed postwar prime minister his memoirs live on. Part news story, part superheated publishing beano and without doubt the most swaggeringly A-list football book of the year, decade and – it seems safe to say – entire spectrum of past and future time, Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography is finally upon us.</p><p>Unveiled at a launch-cum-press-event on Pall Mall, the book itself was available under strict pre-launch embargo from the publishers Hodder &amp; Stoughton at 10 o'clock sharp on Tuesday morning.</p><p>And so it arrived in convoy, glossily packaged, and coming in at a muscular 402 large-type pages, all fronted up by a wonderfully stark full-face Fergie portrait: imperious, gently amused and posed against a sheer white background like some benevolent creator.</p><p>To give My Autobiography its due it is hard to imagine, in outline, a more potent footballing memoir. Ferguson's retirement last May brought to an end the greatest career in English football's recent years of plenty.</p><p>Ferguson not only straddled but helped to define the transformation of an industry, his 27 years at Manchester United entirely bound up in this violently hot-housed blooming from marginalised popular sport to thrummingly unavoidable celebrity entertainment vehicle.</p><p>Throughout, Ferguson was the most important man in the most important job in the nation's most vibrantly territorial popular spectacle. More than this he was abrasive, confrontational and charismatic, an imperial lord of the Premier League touchline. Ferguson doesn't just know where the bodies are. He buried most of them himself. In short, this was always likely to be worth a squizz.</p><p>The first thing to say about My Autobiography is that it isn't really an autobiography. It is instead a continuation of the accumulated Ferguson life story, as told in the 16 (at a quick count) biographies and autobiographies already out there.</p><p>In effect this is the semi-detached second volume of Managing My Life, published in 1999 and written with the great Hugh McIlvanney. As such My Autobiography kicks off with a 17-page section called \"Glasgow roots\" before leaping to 2001 and Ferguson's decision to cancel his impending retirement and settle down instead to 12 years of fevered and macro-cosmically fraught football management.</p><p>The first real heavy hits are landed in the early David Beckham chapter. This is misleadingly polite to start with – \"I hold no rancour towards David. I like him\" – before settling down into a beautifully paced hatchet job by stealth: not so much the hairdryer as a gently malevolent towelling down.</p><p>\"David is the only player I ever managed who chose to be famous,\" Ferguson notes, before giving chapter and verse on his many other failings right down to Beckham's refusal to remove his beanie hat during a formal team meal in a restaurant in order to hide (for media-related reasons) his newly shaved head. Ferguson sticks up for Rio Ferdinand: the missed drugs test in 2003 was the fault of the testers. There is a love letter of a chapter on Cristiano Ronaldo, while Roy Keane is elegantly filleted, and described here, in effect, as a vaguely disturbed individual.</p><p>José Mourinho is treated with respect, albeit mentions of Roman Abramovich's vast spending on his behalf at Chelsea are never far away.</p><p>Best of all, there is a good, fresh chapter about his gathering sense of disappointment with Wayne Rooney, which starts with Ferguson signing Rooney from a weeping Everton chairman, Bill Kenwright (\"they're stealing our boy, they're stealing our boy\"). Elsewhere Ferguson rambles across politics, taking in his advice to Tony Blair in 1997 (\"keep your government in one room and lock the door and you'll have no problems … Tony was receptive to that message\") and recounting the story of Blair asking his advice on whether to sack Gordon Brown or not. The potentially disastrous wrangle over the racehorse Rock of Gibraltar gets short shrift, as do the media (basically he hates the media). And in many ways this is the tone. The big subjects are broached. Ferguson raises his double-barrel. Boom. Off they go. My Autobiography doesn't have a subtitle, but \"Why I was right all along …\" might have been a good choice.</p><p>This is undoubtedly an excellent football book, as it could hardly fail to be given the richness of its source material, while Paul Hayward, Ferguson's ghost, captures his voice perfectly throughout.</p><p>For all that there is nothing really startling here. How could there be, really, in a resumé of a life lived almost entirely beneath the compound eye of football's mass media. In the end My Autobiography is remarkable in two respects. It is undoubtedly the most voraciously hyped footballing memoir of all time, a publishing event of such visceral force it came as something of a surprise to receive the hardback copy in a simple bubble-wrap envelope as opposed to say, a lead-lined coffin.</p><p>This has not happened before and it will probably not happen again. It is of its time, a product of 23 years of intensely enacted pre-publicity.</p><p>Second, while Ferguson may be the greatest British manager of all time, he continues to give a fascinating lesson in how to be an absolutely terrible ex-manager. Looming in the stands, name-checked in every press conference and now available in headline-grabbing book form, he is for his successor, David Moyes, the managerial equivalent of the father-in-law from hell, continually asserting, as here, his continued and undiluted power to fascinate and control.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420672453|2013-10-23T17:15:08Z|e07b5e4c08cc02bf22d89c1f56753259daf16485 -->",

He also effectively rubbished Keane's chances of making a career in football management.</p><p>Other former United players are criticised in the book, among them Owen Hargreaves and David Beckham. Keane told ITV on Tuesday night: \"I think I do remember having a conversation with the manager when I was at the club about loyalty. In my opinion I don't think he knows the meaning of the word.</p><p>\"It doesn't bother me too much what he has to say about me but to constantly criticise other players at the club who brought him a lot of success, I find very, very strange … I just don't think the manager needs to do that.</p><p>\"I'm not sure how many books he has written now but he has to draw the line eventually to say: 'Listen, these players have all been top servants to Man United.' And a lot of these players helped the manager win lots of trophies, so imagine if we never won a trophy what he would have said. We brought success to the club, we gave it everything we had when we were there. It's just part of modern life now that people like to do books and criticise their ex-players.\"</p><p>Ferguson expresses characteristically strident opinions in his new book, My Autobiography, many of which jostled for prominence at the launch press conference in London on Tuesday afternoon. The headlines included:</p><p>• How he told Wayne Rooney to mind his own business after the United striker urged him to sign Mesut Özil</p><p>• How Beckham's love for Victoria and the celebrity lifestyle prevented him from becoming a United legend</p><p>• How he was offered the England job twice but it took him 10 seconds to say no.</p><p>Ferguson's revelations about what happened with Keane were the most volatile material. He writes that the midfielder had been furious about what he felt were substandard pre-season training facilities at Vale de Lobo in Portugal but it was when Keane later gave his thoughts to United's in-house TV channel that Ferguson experienced what he described as a \"horrendous\" confrontation.</p><p>According to Ferguson, Keane laid into many of his then team-mates in the interview, including Edwin van der Sar, Darren Fletcher, Alan Smith, Kieran Richardson and Rio Ferdinand. Of Ferdinand, Keane is said to have been scornful of the defender's belief that he was a superstar … \"just because you are paid £120,000-a-week and play well for 20 minutes against Tottenham.\"</p><p>Keane suggested that the squad watch the interview and what followed was a scene that still makes Ferguson shudder. When outrage ensued among the players, Keane tore into them, but he reserved the most stinging attack for Ferguson, whom he accused of bringing his personal affairs into the club, in the form of his dispute with the Coolmore stud over the racehorse Rock of Gibraltar. \"His eyes started to narrow, almost to wee black beads,\" Ferguson wrote of Keane. \"It was frightening to watch. And I'm from Glasgow.\"</p><p>The interview was not broadcast but Ferguson knew that he had to act. He immediately sanctioned the paying up of Keane's contract and his departure to Celtic in December 2005. The former United manager also slates Keane's managerial track record at Sunderland and Ipswich Town, saying it was plain he needed money to build squads and that he lacked the temperament or patience for the job.</p><p>\"With the nature of the man, you can expect a response,\" Ferguson said at the press conference.\"We had to do something. The meeting was horrendous. I just couldn't lose my control. If I had let it pass, the players would have viewed me much differently to the way I want to be judged. He overstepped his mark, absolutely.\"</p><p>Ferguson repeated his claim that Rooney had \"asked away\" from United last season, after growing frustrated at being played out of position, and he also wrote that the striker's qualities were in danger of being \"swallowed up by a lack of fitness\". Describing Rooney as England's \"one hope\" for the World Cup, he made it clear that the country had to handle him with special care in the countdown to Brazil.</p><p>\"Wayne asked away,\" Ferguson said at the press conference. \"He felt he was unfairly played out of position and I can understand that. I was dropped at 2.10pm on the day of the Scottish Cup final. I was top goalscorer. I had a heated discussion with the manager. I can understand Wayne but at the time he wasn't playing well enough. That was my judgment. Do you think I would drop Wayne the way he is playing now? Absolutely no way.\"</p><p>On Özil, whom Arsenal signed for £42.5m from Real Madrid in August, Ferguson added: \"He was not on our radar and I said that to Wayne at the time [in 2010, when Rooney had handed in a transfer request]. I explained to Wayne to leave the signing of the players to me. We got most things right over the years.\"</p><p>Beckham emerges from the book as one of Ferguson's greatest regrets. He considered him to be like a son but he writes that he had his head turned by the trappings of showbiz. He said that he had to sell him to Real Madrid because Beckham thought he had become bigger than the manager and the club.</p><p>Ferguson does not mention Beckham's wife in the chapter of the book that he devotes to him, but he did give her a reference at the press conference. \"I think the big problem for me and I'm a football man really ... he fell in love with Victoria and that changed everything,\" Ferguson said. \"I had to think about my own control at the club. Maybe he will look back and say he should have stayed at Real Madrid [and not joined LA Galaxy]. But I don't think I've been too critical on David. He was always a marvellous guy.\"</p><p>Ferguson said that he could never have managed England. \"It was a great opportunity in life to relegate them,\" the Scot joked. \"The first time [he was asked] was the Scots lad, from the Post Office, Adam Crozier [the then FA chief executive] and the second time, they approached Martin Edwards [the former United chairman] and I said forget it. I met Crozier at Old Trafford. It didn't take me long – 10 seconds. Think of me going back to Scotland. Deary me.\"</p><p>Ferguson offered his support to his successor, David Moyes, and he insisted that the club could retain the title despite their sluggish start. \"When I saw the fixture list [at the beginning of the season], I would have been raging at that,\" Ferguson said. \"I would have gone down to the League. But Manchester United are the only team in that league that can win it coming from behind.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420678870|2013-10-23T17:15:08Z|f72cd4c6da088daa0ae919cb8f1d20544708fcc6 -->",

        "body":"<h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/22/ferguson-roy-keane-manchester-united-book\" title=\"Roy Keane had begun to think he was the United manager\"><strong>Keane really had to go</strong></a></h2><p>Sir Alex Ferguson paints the picture of Roy Keane, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/nov/19/newsstory.sport3\" title=\"\">his former captain and talisman</a>, as an erratic and terrifying figure, capable of frightening even him and, certainly, many players inside the dressing room. Keane ruled with an iron fist and a savage tongue, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/24/sport.comment\" title=\"\">which Ferguson said was the hardest part of his body</a>. Their fall-out has become part of Old Trafford folklore and Ferguson traces it to the decline in Keane's on-field powers and the frustration he felt as a result.</p><p>Keane had been furious about what he felt had been substandard pre-season facilities at Vale de Lobo, Portugal, in 2005 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/nov/02/newsstory.sport2\" title=\"\">but it all kicked off when he gave his notorious interview to MUTV</a>, in which he slated many of his team-mates including, according to Ferguson, Kieran Richardson, Darren Fletcher, Alan Smith, Edwin van der Sar and Rio Ferdinand. Keane is said to have been scornful of Ferdinand's belief that he was a superstar \"just because you are paid £120,000 a week and play well for 20 minutes against Tottenham\".</p><p>Keane suggested that the squad watch the interview in order for them to make up their own minds and what followed was a ferocious confrontation between him and many of the players, together with Ferguson. In front of the squad Keane slated Ferguson for bringing his personal affairs to United, in the form of his dispute with John Magnier over the racehorse, Rock of Gibraltar. Ferguson said that it had been \"frightening\" to watch. He had to act and he immediately sanctioned the paying up of Keane's contract and his departure to Celtic. Ferguson writes that Keane did pop in to see him to apologise but the relationship has since turned ugly again after public comments between the pair. Ferguson also passes judgment on Keane's managerial career, saying he needed money to build squads and lacked the requisite patience to do so. <strong>DH</strong></p><p></p><h2><strong>Loyalty to the Glazers is undimmed</strong></h2><p>His attitude to United's owners is best summed up by a photograph showing him laughing with Malcolm's sons Avram, Joel and Bryan above a caption that reads: \"The Glazers were supportive from day one. They let me get on with the job.\" Ferguson says the club was always going to be bought from the day it became a plc and, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/may/13/football.uknews\" title=\"\">in a claim that will be met with incredulity by some United fans</a>, insists their ownership model had no impact on his transfer dealings. While recognising the interest payments aroused \"protective feelings towards the club\", he says that \"at no stage did it translate into pressure to sell a player or excessive caution on the purchasing front\". He relates how Andy Walsh, who went on to help found FC United of Manchester, asked him to resign when the Glazers took over. Ferguson says he considered himself an employee and the thought never entered his head. \"I never thought it sensible to upset the management side of the club by adding to the debate on ownership\".</p><p></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/22/ferguson-wayne-rooney-sign-mesut-ozil-book\" title=\"Wayne Rooney wanted Ferguson to sign zil\"><strong>Rooney wanted Özil</strong></a></h2><p>Sir Alex Ferguson reiterated that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/09/wayne-rooney-reasons-leave-manchester-united\" title=\"\">Wayne Rooney asked to leave the club</a> at the back end of last season. Rooney, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/27/wayne-rooney-transfer-manchester-united\" title=\"\">who has denied handing in a formal transfer request</a>, allegedly came into Ferguson's office the day after the title-winning victory over Aston Villa and \"asked away\", with his agent Paul Stretford also calling David Gill. Ferguson revealed that Rooney had wanted United to pursue Mesut Özil before he signed for Real Madrid. Ferguson responded that it was \"none of his business\".. JR</p><p></p><h2><strong>He really did like José Mourinho</strong></h2><p>There is warmth from Ferguson in his chapter about José Mourinho and it is clear that the pair do enjoy a good relationship, despite what Sir Bobby Charlton, the United director, said about it essentially being a marriage of convenience. Ferguson likes younger people with a bit of devil in them and he smiled to himself when he saw the manner in which Mourinho first announced himself at Chelsea as the \"Special One\".</p><p>Ferguson even admits that he went too far in his criticism of Mourinho after United had met his Porto team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/feb/26/championsleague.porto\" title=\"\">in the Champions League last-16 first leg in 2003-04</a>. Ferguson had been infuriated at Porto's diving but, in truth, he was more angry about how Keane had got himself sent off. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/mar/09/minutebyminute.porto\" title=\"\">When Porto knocked United out in the Old Trafford return</a>, Ferguson found a way to congratulate Mourinho and they shared a glass of wine, which became something of a post-match tradition.</p><p>Ferguson writes that he found the wine appalling at Stamford Bridge and he told Roman Abramovich so. The following week, he took delivery of a case of Tignanello from the Russian. But the chapter veers away from Mourinho, as Ferguson discusses a range of topics from George Best to the desire of Nemanja Vidic to enlist for the Kosovo conflict and his personal transfer errors, chief among them Kieran Richardson, Eric Djemba-Djemba, William Prunier and Ralph Milne. There had been expectation that Ferguson would discuss why he did not advance Mourinho as his Old Trafford successor, but there is no mention of the subject in this chapter. <strong>DH</strong></p><p></p><h2><strong>The Pizzagate match at Old Trafford \"scrambled Arsène's brain\"</strong></h2><p>The Arsenal manager emerges as his greatest bête noire over 17 years of intense rivalry. Away from the game they can discuss wine and he is a diligent \"member of our trade\". On matchday things are different. Even then, says Ferguson, he can identify with \"the sharp change in him when the whistle blew\". They got on fine to start with, although Wenger would never come for a drink in his office after a match. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/sep/15/newsstory.sport1\" title=\"\">But then came \"Pizzagate\", when Ferguson had a pizza thrown at him in the tunnel after a match against Arsenal in 2004</a>. Ferguson says he had no idea who left him covered in pizza, although Cesc Fábregas is most often blamed, and claims that losing that match \"scrambled Arsène's brain\". The rift extended until <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/05/championsleague-arsenal\" title=\"\">the Champions League semi-final in 2009</a>, when United beat Arsenal and Wenger congratulated Ferguson. Despite their rapprochement Ferguson has a passing dig at Wenger's \"softer centre\" in his later years, adding insult to injury by saying he felt sorry for him during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/28/manchester-united-arsenal-premier-league1\" title=\"\">the 8-2 mauling at Old Trafford</a>, and says he has produced only one \"truly homegrown\" player in Jack Wilshere.

His wife, Cathy, told him that the final day of the 2011-12 campaign was the worst day of her life and he was determined to usurp them before retirement. Ferguson says United \"absolutely battered\" City during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/23/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">their 6-1 defeat at Old Trafford</a> but insists there was no animosity towards Roberto Mancini. However, Ferguson said Mancini \"let himself down\" by allowing Carlos Tevez to return to the side <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/28/carlos-tevez-manchester-city-roberto-mancini\" title=\"\">after the Bayern Munich incident</a>. JR</p><p></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/22/ferguson-david-beckham-sold-boot-kicking-book\" title=\"David Beckham swapped United legacy for fame\"><strong>David Beckham was a chief regret</strong></a></h2><p>It is clear that Ferguson considers David Beckham to be one of his chief regrets. He loved Beckham; he thought of him as a son and had nothing but admiration for the way that he chased his footballing dream; for his stamina, perseverance and desire to prove people wrong. But Ferguson came to believe that Beckham had forgotten what had made him a star and, increasingly, neglected to work as hard on the pitch.</p><p>Notoriously matters came to a head between the pair when Beckham failed to track back <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/feb/16/match.sport1\" title=\"\">on an Arsenal goal at Old Trafford in February 2003</a>. Ferguson kicked a boot at Beckham in the dressing room, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/sep/01/newsstory.sport3\" title=\"\">it hit him across the brow</a> and, when the player allowed the wound to be photographed the following day, Ferguson made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/apr/26/marketingandpr.football\" title=\"\">the decision to sell him</a>. He believed that Beckham felt he had become bigger than him and the club.</p><p>Ferguson writes that Beckham had his head turned by celebrity; that he made the conscious decision to pursue fame away from the field. He tells the story of how the Beckham camp tipped off dozens of photographers about one of the player's new haircuts (which turned out to be the shaven head) and how Beckham refused to remove his beanie hat before the big unveil, which infuriated Ferguson. He also writes that there was no \"footballing reason\" for Beckham to go to Los Angeles. Ferguson does not mention Beckham's wife, Victoria, in the chapter of the book that he devotes to the player. There is no anger from Ferguson, merely dejection that Beckham squandered the chance to become of United's most enduring legends. <strong>DH</strong></p><p></p><h2><strong>He found handling the media difficult in his later years</strong></h2><p>Ferguson's way of dealing with the media was to put his \"Alex Ferguson face on\". He pines for the good relationships he had with reporters in his early years in Scotland and admits, without irony, \"there was an intensity and volatility about the modern media I found difficult\". His distaste for the \"young reporters who dressed more casually\" is plain and he says that by the end he found it hard to have any relationship with the press. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/25/alex-ferguson-ends-bbc-boycott\" title=\"\">His seven-year ban on talking to the BBC</a> is glossed over in a page. The BBC3 documentary that sparked the row was a \"horrible attack\" on his son Jason, he said, and the BBC would not apologise. In the end, he says, they \"agreed to differ\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/aug/27/sir-alex-ferguson-bbc-premier-league\" title=\"\">but his point was made</a>. OG</p><p></p><h2><strong>He is no fan of the FA – or referees</strong></h2><p>Ferguson claims the FA used to go after high-profile targets, such as Manchester United and Wayne Rooney, because it resulted in favourable publicity. \"It was never really possible to work out who was running English football's governing body,\" he writes. \"It's an institutional problem. Reformers go in there 6 feet 2 inches tall and come out 5 feet 4 inches.\" He says Greg Dyke has to reduce the number of people involved in decision making: \"A committee of 100 people can't produce sensible management.\" Ferguson also, perhaps predictably, declares that there are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/20/sir-alex-ferguson-influence-referees\" title=\"\">no \"really top\" referees in the modern game</a>, damning them as unfit and \"as a group, not doing their job as well as they should be\". OG</p><p></p><h2><strong>Ruud was rude</strong></h2><p>Ruud van Nistelrooy left United in acrimonious circumstances in 2006, the final straw, according to Ferguson, being when the Dutchman swore at him on the bench after not being selected during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/27/match.wiganathletic\" title=\"\">the Carling Cup final against Wigan</a>. Ferguson claims he did not anticipate selling the forward to Real Madrid but his behaviour during his last year at the club forced his hand. However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/21/ruud-van-nistelrooy-apologises-ferguson-united\" title=\"\">Van Nistelrooy made a phone call to Ferguson out of the blue</a> in January 2010 to apologise for his behaviour. JR</p><p></p><h2>And one horse-shaped hole … the Rock of Gibraltar affair</h2><p></p><p>Given its centrality to Ferguson's later years at Old Trafford, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/08/alex-ferguson-rows-manchester-united\" title=\"\">the dispute with Magnier and JP McManus over Rock of Gibraltar</a> is barely acknowledged. It was that bitter dispute, over Ferguson's right to a share in the horse's stud fees, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/feb/01/newsstory.sport5\" title=\"\">that led directly to the Glazer takeover</a>. It is dealt with in a couple of paragraphs, with Ferguson admitting it was \"awkward\" but at no point interfered with his management of the club. The matter was \"resolved\"  when both sides agreed there had been a \"misunderstanding\", says Ferguson, matter-of-factly. He says he is now on \"good terms\" with Magnier. <strong>OG</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Reporting by Owen Gibson,  David Hytner and James Riach</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420621774|2013-10-23T17:15:08Z|7fd67506c7e76c2f40d239cbb262326e78234e5a -->",
