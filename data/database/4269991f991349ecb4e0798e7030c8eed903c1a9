        "body":"<p>Russell Brand has singled out the \"Oxbridge\" education of Robert Webb, as he hit back at his fellow comedian for urging him to \"read some fucking Orwell\" after Brand called for revolution and urged young people not to vote.</p><p>Webb, best known as one half of the comedy double act Mitchell and Webb and star of Channel 4 sitcom, Peep Show,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/30/robert-webb-russell-brand-vote\" title=\"\"> wrote an open letter to Brand</a> after he published <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\" title=\"\">an essay in the New Statesman</a> entitled \"We no longer have the luxury of tradition\", which implored readers to abandon the current political system.</p><p>Brand repeated a call for a \"total revolution\", encouraging young people to abstain from voting, adding \"I will never vote and I don't think you should, either.\"</p><p>Webb wrote in reply: \"I understand your ache for the luminous, for a connection beyond yourself. Russell, we all feel like that. Some find it in music or literature, some in the wonders of science and others in religion.</p><p>\"But it isn't available any more in revolution. We tried that again and again, and we know that it ends in death camps, gulags, repression and murder. In brief, and I say this with the greatest respect, please read some fucking Orwell.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/11/04/russell-brand-revolution-_n_4213849.html\" title=\"\">In an interview with the Huffington Post UK</a>, Brand responded by joking that Webb, a University of Cambridge graduate, could have written a private letter, and criticised his Oxbridge education.</p><p>He said: \"Why didn't he just write me a normal letter? He don't know where I live, I suppose. And no, no death camps. Just for the record, in case anyone else from Peep Show is worried, I'm definitely against death camps – just in case the bloke who plays Super Hans thinks I'm a Nazi.\"</p><p>\"Definitely no killing. I'm against that; I'm a vegetarian, I think we're all equal. I'm not saying smash people's stuff up, and definitely no killing.\"</p><p>In his letter, published on 30 October, Webb challenged Brand to value the \"vanishingly small\" chance of being born in 21st century Britain, asking: \"What were the chances, in the course of human history, that you and I should be born into an advanced liberal democracy?</p><p>\"That we don't die aged 27 because we can't eat because nobody has invented fluoride toothpaste? That we can say what we like, read what we like, love whom we want; that nobody is going to kick the door down in the middle of the night and take us or our children away to be tortured?\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/11/04/russell-brand-revolution-_n_4213849.html\" title=\"\">In response, Brand told the Huffington Post's Mehdi Hasan</a>: \"Maybe [it's good] for him, mate. Maybe it's okay for Robert Webb; no one is going to take his kids away, but I've heard some examples.</p><p>\"I don't claim to be a politician, like all things I'm sure there are people in the room who know more about this than I do, I didn't have an education like Robert Webb had. But there are people from Leicester in Guantánamo Bay.</p><p>\"If you went to Oxbridge, if you went to a private school, no one is coming for your kids. They're not coming for you if you're from Oxbridge. That's my open letter to Robert. I hope it doesn't go to the other one by mistake – David Mitchell – who I really like.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421665975|2013-11-05T11:23:37Z|baef9050c85554b95cb2078d9ff92cac39b82bd8 -->",

        "headline":"Fresh Meat's Zawe Ashton, AKA Vod, is the coolest thing on TV right now",
        "body":"<p>Television's coolest characters often come with a signature \"thing\". The Fonz from Happy Days had his leather jacket and his thumbs. Master William from The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air had his hi-top fade and loud trousers. In the Channel 4 comedy Fresh Meat, Vod has her off-the-wall clothes and that withering gaze that cuts down foolishness at 20 paces. She's easily the coolest character on television at the moment, but when I tell that to the woman who plays her, the response is charmingly modest. \"I would really like to keep anyone who says that in my pocket, as I go about my daily life,\" says Zawe Ashton (the Zawe is pronounced like \"Bowie\"). \"When I hit a low point, I'd just ask, 'What's that you're saying in there? I'm the coolest person on TV? OK, I'll take that!'\"</p><p>With the third season of the show starting on Monday, it feels fair to say that Ashton is the breakout star of Fresh Meat. Her many memorable moments include preparing coq au vin with a sword (at posh boy JP's family home) and a lecture-hall monologue about Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (\"I feel like I've got this pompous, fat, naked man sitting on my face, and he's resting his big, overrated bollocks on my airways\"). She is the show's wry centre, looking askance at the dubious decisions made by her housemates and doling out wisdom as necessary. The character works best in concert with the others, though, and the ensemble is excellent, something Ashton puts down to a meticulous casting process and a writing team who really understand  the characters. \"Everyone in this show was put through a very rigorous process,\" she says, \"and I think that's real testament to Sam and Jesse [Bain and Armstrong, the show's creators]. They were determined to find a group that worked together, and not just go, 'Who's hot right now?'\"</p><p>In person, Ashton is only superficially like her plain-speaking, no-holds-barred alter ego: her speaking voice is slightly less deep, far less estuary than Vod's, and she's clearly more prone to both chuckling and thinking before speaking. The source of Vod's cool – The Essence Of Vod, if you will – can be boiled down to a simple but powerful philosophy: she doesn't care what anyone thinks. \"I always describe her as having no subtext, no filters,\" says Ashton. Combined with the fact that she's a girl – and a black girl at that, which is almost never brought up as an issue to be \"tackled\" – Vod was primed for cult status from the start.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421634419'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383148036838/Zawe-Ashton-as-Vod-in-Fre-008.jpg' alt='Zawe Ashton as Vod in Fresh Meat 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Zawe Ashton as Vod in Fresh Meat 2</figcaption></figure><p>\"The door has felt very open in terms of the interpretation of Vod,\" continues Ashton. \"I've never had to take into consideration any external factors, I've been able to find out who this girl is from the inside out.\" The lack of extra racial baggage has paid dividends – last November she won a Creative Diversity Network Award for her performance, with the board praising Vod as a great example of racial diversity on our screens that didn't come served with a side-order of self-congratulation. \"That was so moving for me, because I do think about these things. I'm not the kind of actor who blocks out the undertones of the industry. I've been acting on TV since I was six, so 23 years would be a long time to keep your eyes averted.\" She arches an eyebrow.</p><p>Let's talk about those eyebrows. And lips, and clothes. Where on earth does Vod shop? And how hard is it for Ashton to \"become\" her? She laughs again. \"I'm telling you, once the head was shaved and the dummy was round the neck and the leather jacket and bovver boots were on, it was like, OK, we're ready. The whole birth of that character was so much about hair and makeup and wardrobe. RiRi's only just catching up to the dark blue lip!\" She gives high praise to Janet Horsfield and June Nevin who head the makeup and wardrobe departments. \"They're so collaborative in the process. I was cast the day before we moved to Manchester. I literally got there and was like, 'This is who I think she is – is that all right?' and they just worked in record time and completely understood what all the references were.\" Like what? \"We imagined what her parents listened to musically: a lot of Bowie, dancehall, ska. Plus I feel like her nan had a lot of influence over how she grew up because she's never been close to her mum or dad. Sometimes Vod dresses like an old man, and I feel like she's kind of empathising with her grandparents. She's a forager.\"</p><p>We gain an insight into Vod's mysterious background in an upcoming episode, when her mum comes to visit. \"It's another layer to Vod. [Writer] Penny Skinner met up with me before series three started, and said, 'Look, I really want to write something for Vod. We need something from her past, some kind of key to her upbringing to continue that identification that audiences are having.' I just went, 'Thank you, let's do it.' And the result deepened my empathy for her.\" The character of Vod has evolved over the series and the process, Ashton thinks, has been organic and natural, the big change being that she's now formed real bonds with her housemates. \"I don't imagine she lets people in very easily,\" Ashton says. \"I think Vod is a sage. If she gives you some serious insight into your life, you're going to consider it. Because those nuggets come few and far between, but when they do come, they land.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421634420'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383148115270/Zawe-in-Dreams-Of-A-Life-008.jpg' alt='Zawe in Dreams Of A Life' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Zawe in Dreams Of A Life</figcaption></figure><p>Ashton's parents still live in the east London house where she was raised, the eldest of three children. Her mother Victoria emigrated to the UK from Uganda as a teenager. She became a teacher and married fellow educator Paul, an Englishman who later worked for Channel 4 in educational programming. Victoria encouraged her daughter into drama and she attended the famous Anna Scher school from the age of five. Childhood roles in Desmond's and The Demon Headmaster were followed by parts in Holby City, Casualty and the St Trinian's sequel. Since then, she's popped up in BBC1's Case Histories (as Jackson Brodie's assistant Deborah) and E4's Misfits (as a virgin with an overprotective killer dad). Most notable of all, however, was her performance in Carol Morley's film Dreams Of A Life; Ashton was nominated for a British Independent Film Award for her portrayal of Joyce Vincent, a woman whose lonely death went unnoticed for three years.</p><p>Ashton is more than an actor, too. In 2000 she won the London Poetry Slam Championships, while her play Harm's Way was performed at The Lowry in Salford and nominated for the Verity Bargate award for new writing in 2007. She has just written and directed a short for BBC Films, Happy Toys. \"They approached me because of Fresh Meat and my BIFA nomination,\" she says. \"The film is about a woman who is struggling to get up in the morning and struggling to be a mother.\" Even before playing Joyce Vincent, Ashton was interested in black women and mental health: she wrote a play, For All Those Women Who Thought They Were Mad, which was selected  for the Royal Court's playwriting festival in 2009. \"These are things that affect us all,\" she says. \"Happy Toys has a black actress as the lead, the fabulous Jenny Jules, but it's not a 'banner' film. I'm just trying to make all the dots connect.\" She describes the film-making experience as \"stressful but elating. I'm almost gleeful to be putting something out to the world.\"</p><p>We touch briefly on the recent Doctor Who casting and the Guardian poll that saw her edge out Chiwetel Ejiofor, Stephen Mangan and Ben Whishaw as our readers' favoured Tardis occupier. She thought it was a joke until she saw it online herself. \"I never in a million years would've thought I'd end up on that poll,\" she says, still somewhat incredulous. \"Me, as a mainstream character on the BBC, in a role previously filled by white men! What a wonderful way to illustrate how attitudes towards mainstream casting are beginning to change.\" She cackles. \"It wasn't even that I wanted to be Doctor Who!\"</p><p>It's time for her photoshoot. I accompany Ashton to the studio and, on the way, we see food critic Jay Rayner walking towards the front door. Ashton's eyes go wide. \"Oh my God, it's Jay Rayner.

        "body":"<p>The inaugural <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/11/03/youtube-music-awards-live-stream-video-watch-2013-ytma/\">YouTube music awards</a> aired live across the internet from Pier 36 in New York on Sunday night, a messy affair that achieved its goal of being the antithesis of regular awards ceremonies: not least because the hosts, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/jason-schwartzman-youtube-music-awards-652622\">Jason Schwartzman and Reggie Watts</a>, ended the night covered in paint and fake blood.</p> <p>Somewhere among the chaos, the hosts presented awards in seven categories – giving winners a small, shiny, YouTube logo or, as innovation of the year winner <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/DeStorm\">DeStorm</a> called it, “the dopest paperweight”.</p> <p>The goal of the show's creative director, Spike Jonze, was to be prepared for as little as possible – each host was armed solely with a list of bullet points about the awards, all of which were voted on by YouTube users.</p> <p>“I’m used to that and that’s the way I like to work,&quot; said Watts, whose favourite YouTube video is an hour-long UFO documentary.</p> <p>“I cannot reiterate how we had no idea what was going to happen, ever,&quot; said Schwartzman after the show. &quot;All we had on the cards were the next award, but there were no lines and nothing scripted and we had no idea what was going to happen next.”</p> <p>That simple premise did not satisfy the show producer, so the hosts were also presented with &quot;obstacles” . Just 20 minutes into the show, the hosts’ humorous diatribe was interrupted as they were sent to the VIP section where actress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamrashidajones\">Rashida Jones </a>presented them with two babies, then walked away once the hosts had them in hand.</p> <p>Schwartzman, a father, was visibly upset as the baby he held cried, and repeatedly said he was concerned about the loud music – one of several elements that helped create an over-stimulating environment, even for mature adults watching from the comfort of their screens.</p> <p>&quot;I can’t speak for the baby, nor can the baby speak for itself, but it seemed like the baby just wanted its mother more than it was nervous to meet me,” he joked later, adding that the baby stopped crying when she was returned to her mother.</p> <p>The show had glimmers of promise during the live music video segments, in which filmmakers including Jonze, <a href=\"http://fafi.net/\">Fafi</a> and <a href=\"http://milk.co/\">Chris Milk </a>showed off their talent and seized on the crowd of revellers to create some genuinely impressive images.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VevSFuDm12E\">Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler the Creator rapped Sasquatch</a> in a pink cube filled with enthusiastic kids fight-dancing toward the cameras. Lady Gaga dressed as a male skateboarder for a piano ballad – <a href=\"http://www.hitfix.com/news/lady-gaga-strips-herself-bare-for-dope-at-youtube-music-awards-watch\">the live premiere of her song Dope</a>, backed by an enraptured audience. MIA held a brightly-lit parade filled with hula-hooping dancers and paint-throwing for her <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/11/03/mia-performance-come-walk-with-me-2013-ytma/\">Come Walk With Me</a> video.</p> <p>The consistently artful videos strayed into gimmick territory in DJ Avicii's short film, which paired a sullen concert-goer with the mocking stereotype of a rave girl, against a foreign DJ and the concertgoer's ex-girlfriend, played by <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2486926/Vanessa-Hudgens-gets-thrown-floor-overzealous-fan--But-dont-worry-music-video.html\">Vanessa Hudgens</a>.</p> <p>Towards the end of the film, both pairs froze in place and the in-house audience was invited to vote on whether the prior pair could “hail a taxi, meet each other's parents and have some soup” or partake in a “double tragedy”. Audience members were overwhelmingly in favour of tragedy, which resulted in a mock double-suicide from the ceiling, replete with red string guts splayed on the audience below.</p> <p><strong>Award winners:</strong></p> <p><strong>Video of the year</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq7ftOZBy0E\">Girls' Generation – I Got A Boy</a></p> <p><strong>Artist of the year</strong><br /> Eminem</p> <p><strong>Response of the year</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh-72yBP7sw\">Lindsey Stirling and Pentatonix – Radioactive</a></p> <p><strong>YouTube phenomenon</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNoKguSdy4Y\">I Knew You Were Trouble</a></p> <p><strong>YouTube breakthrough</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes\">Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis</a></p> <p><strong>Innovation of the year</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6FepyR0KuE\">DeStorm – See Me Standing</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421591893|2013-11-05T11:23:37Z|69be84e7e13f4e96911a3c2d42a70de4d2bfd3af -->",

        "body":"<p>It's such a wide-ranging topic it's difficult to cover it all in one program. I have OCD around contamination and checking, and intrusive thoughts. Socialising becomes almost impossible: I can't have people back to the house if you're saying to them, \"Don't touch that.\" It's very costly – I was spending five hours a day washing my hands, using four bottles of handwash a day. It used to take me two hours to wash my hands in&nbsp;order to get the clothes out of the machine; I had&nbsp;visions that if I had any chemicals on my hands that got on the clothes, they would burst into flames. It's so outlandish, and yet it seems so real to me. The cruel thing is that the very thing I&nbsp;find the most difficult, doing the&nbsp;washing, is the very thing the&nbsp;OCD creates plenty of.</p><p>It got to the point where I was sitting on a tiny sitting-room table, because that was easy to clean off, rocking backwards and forwards, frightened to touch anything, to talk to anybody, to do anything. That's what it showed on the programme – one minute the guy is going to university, the next he's stuck in the toilet all the time. And the lass who was frightened of harming others, I can relate to myself. I can stand at the bus stop and be petrified that I'm accidentally going to push someone in front of a bus – I'm not going to, and that isn't in my thoughts, but the OCD plays on your worst fears.</p><p>I found the editing a bit strange – it jumped all over the place. But then I suppose that's the way a lot of people with OCD's minds work. One minute I'm concentrating on getting the washing out of the machine, then I think: \"No, I'll make sure I turned the tap off in the kitchen.\" Your mind is jumping backwards and forwards.</p><p>It's nice to see how other people approach their OCD – I think we can bounce ideas off each other. At one point it looked like they weren't going to get through, and then they turned a corner and they do succeed. It gives everyone hope.</p><p>• Trudy&nbsp;Angus is a volunteer for OCD Action</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421480289|2013-11-05T11:23:37Z|688b2f46bb8d2fc30dfa1ef05575060a772d01a2 -->",

Why are the trio dancing? Who can say. What are they thinking? Well, Godard cuts in and tells us. Arthur (Claude Brasseur) is thinking of Odile’s mouth, Odile (Anna Karina) is worrying about the movement of her breasts beneath her sweater, and Franz (Sami Frey) is wondering if the world’s a dream. The sense of detachment is heightened by Michel Legrand’s obviously dubbed-in soundtrack, and the way the actors never quite nail the steps. But can we stop watching? Could we ever be as cool?",

        "body":"<p>Remembering the fifth of November is somewhat unnecessary these days: this weekend is when many Bonfire Night fuses are lit in earnest. In London, <strong>Back With A Bang!</strong> looks set to be one of Saturday's most explosive offerings, with 2013 British firework championships winners, Star Fireworks, painting the skies above Alexandra Palace (Sat, N22). As well as that there's a funfair and German beer festival among the ground-based amusements on offer.</p><p>For a closer encounter, there's Bridgwater's <strong>Guy Fawkes Carnival</strong> (Sat) whose illuminated float procession culminates in the centuries-old tradition of squibbing: 180 people lining the town's high street, fireworks held above their heads in a simultaneous blaze. Similarly Metallica-esque pyrotechnics can be found at the <strong>Ottery St Mary Carnival </strong>(Tue), when young and old carry flaming tar barrels through the streets. Only locals have the honour of barrel-bearing, but the evening also includes a giant community bonfire.</p><p>Austerity may have its jaws fastened tightly around local councils, yet many have still rustled up free displays to lift the spirits. The prize for the best setting goes to the crumbling towers and mirrored moat of <strong>Caerphilly Castle </strong>(Sat); Newham council is promising a laser show and pop soundtrack for their display at <strong>Wanstead Flats</strong> (Sun, E7); while<strong> Glasgow Green</strong> (Tue) is set to draw collective \"oohs\" from around 60,000 people on 5 November itself.</p><p>For the Guy Fawkes sympathisers, meanwhile, <strong>Diwali</strong> falling this weekend brings the chance to enjoy some torture-and-execution-free sparkle, with Leicester's sizeable celebrations on Sunday offering fireworks as the climax of an evening's entertainment. For those who just can't stand the decibels, <strong>Bristol Zoo Gardens</strong>' two family-friendly low-noise displays (Sat &amp; Sun) offer all the whizz without the bang.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421389569|2013-11-05T11:23:37Z|1484686de8b05ff4ab296885efe3c456a137f950 -->",

        "headline":"Chris Womersley's world of mullets, music and Coco Pops at the Black Cat",
        "body":"<p>The place and time where you come of age always remain special &ndash; and for Chris Womersley the &rsquo;80s were all about Fitzroy. His latest novel Cairo mythologises the Melbourne suburb in all its gritty, arty splendour, beginning with a block of modernist flats and their dissolute inhabitants on the suburb&rsquo;s western edge. These apartments of the book&rsquo;s title are still there, behind iron railings on Nicholson Street, &ldquo;Cairo&rdquo; picked out in a 1930s font.</p> <p>Today Womersley and I are on a walking tour of Fitzroy, a rectangle on the inner-city map with Brunswick Street as its spine. This was Melbourne&rsquo;s first suburb: Victorian terraces, brick factories and cobbled lanes lining the streets that sprang up from 1839.</p> <p>The area had a mix of migrants, Aborigines and Bohemians, and mixed fortunes. Womersley moved to Fitzroy when his parents divorced in his early teens, when young apprentices in high waisted jeans and mullets swaggered in the blood-house pubs of the now largely gentrified suburb. His friends at Melbourne High were blunt. &ldquo;I remember kids at school saying &lsquo;you must be really poor&rsquo; and &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll get stabbed there&rsquo;,&rdquo; he reminisces.</p> <p>Instead, Fitzroy became the centre of the writer&rsquo;s world. Not necessarily a healthy one, Womersley admits, but one that met all his basic needs. &ldquo;There was a period in the late &rsquo;80s when I worked on Brunswick Street, lived on Brunswick Street and I drank on Brunswick Street &ndash; so my world had a radius of about 200 metres,&rdquo; he says.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s also the starting point for our trip around the suburb, where the writer still lives. We meet the<a href=\"http://www.blackcatfitzroy.com/\"> Black Cat</a>, which he describes in Cairo as having &ldquo;waiters so laid back they barely served at all, Tretchikoff prints on the wall, Coco Pops available all day.&rdquo; </p> <p>Those were in the days of its founder, jazz musician Henry Maas, who opened the cafe in 1982, and it now has different owners, though a similar vibe. Back then, Womersley explains, it was the very first cool cafe on Brunswick Street, almost the first in Melbourne, with great music and a hip clientele (Jack Kerouac and Sylvia Plath were its patron saints), and afterwards, a thousand dark and funkily decorated venues bloomed.</p> <p>The palimpsestic nature of cities fascinates Womersley, as does their depiction in fiction. &ldquo;I remember reading<a href=\"http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780143180036/monkey-grip\"> Monkey Grip [by Helen Garner]</a> when I was a teenager,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;and being really thrilled because Bell Street got a mention and I was living in Bell Street when I read it.&rdquo; With Cairo, he aimed to combine realism with a quality of nostalgia and mythologising that comes through in the voice of its narrator Tom Button.</p> <p>&ldquo;I was debating when writing Cairo as to how fictional to make it and my aim was always to write a book that was &lsquo;real&rsquo; but felt fictional,&rdquo; he says. He wanted people to think: &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be a band called Shower Scene From Psycho and then googling it<a href=\"http://www.messandnoise.com/icons/3817018\"> and finding that there was</a>.&rdquo;</p> <p>At the centre of the novel is an art heist that fits that bill: the theft of Picasso&rsquo;s Weeping Woman from the National Gallery of Victoria in 1986. A group calling itself the<a href=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/2006/05/03/who-stole-picassos-weeping-woman/\"> Australian Cultural Terrorists</a> claimed responsibility and demanded the establishment of an annual acquisitive prize, to be called the Picasso Ransom, and an increase in art funding. The painting was returned after 17 days, demands unmet and the thieves have never been caught. &ldquo;There must be at least a dozen people who know who did it,&rdquo; he says.</p> <p>Womersley&rsquo;s pale, floppy haired Cairo protagonists, meanwhile, are wasting their fictional time at the Black Cat cafe, flicking ash and quoting Rimbaud, heading down the road to Rhumbarellas, or, for late night drinks, El Nidos, the Spanish cafe and pool hall around the corner in Johnson Street.</p> <p>The speciality of the house was a highly alcoholic sol y sombre, served in coffee cups to get round the licensing laws, which only began to liberalise in 1986. Tom Button&rsquo;s flamboyant composer friend Max Cheever drinks here. So did Womersley.</p> <p>For more illicit treats, fictional and factual, there was Seray&rsquo;s, a Turkish cafe. As a 16-year-old, Womersley and his callow friends had heard the legend that if you went in there and asked for Jimmy, you could buy marijuana. Sure enough, it worked: &ldquo;We said &lsquo;is Jimmy here?&rsquo; and this guy just chucked a few foils on the counter and said &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p> <p>Out on the street, we pass another landmark in our walking tour: Womersley also points out the brothel at number 417, which he lived next door to, and the premises of the famous<a href=\"http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/4129579\"> Punters&rsquo; Club</a>, heart of Fitzroy&rsquo;s live music scene. It has been closed for a decade, a victim of gentrification.</p> <p>At least<a href=\"http://www.polyesterrecords.com/\"> Polyester Records</a> is still there; it&rsquo;s where Womersley would agonise about which album to buy with his wages as a dish pig; he worked at Restaurant Monet in nearby Nicholson Street, as does 17-year-old Tom Button when he moves into his aunt&rsquo;s old flat in Cairo. The restaurant&rsquo;s no longer there, but there&rsquo;s a commemorative plaque on the wall.</p> <p>Our final stop is on the corner of Brunswick and James at 115a &ndash; the site of<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/melbourne-life/artists-reunite-from-roaring-80s-20110222-1b42s.html\"> the Roar Studios</a>, founded by a bunch of anti-establishment artists very like the ones that stalk the pages of the novel. Fitzroy has a strong Aboriginal heritage but also attracted Mediterranean migrants, students and a bohemian crowd whose retro patron saints, Womersley notes in his novel, were Sylvia Plath and Jack Kerouac.</p> <p>But Womersley was always a bit of an outsider and like Tom Button he observed their antics and harboured dreams of being a famous writer, waiting to be discovered without putting in the hard work. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a young man&rsquo;s fantasy,&rdquo; he says, though as the author of three novels, he&rsquo;s since applied himself. Like his fictional hero, he&rsquo;s also now, middle-aged, looking back slightly wistfully at his youth and the forging of his identity.</p> <p>At its heart, Cairo is a coming of age story that captures a place and a time, he says.</p> <p>&ldquo;I thought, why not make it as close to my own chronology as possible? If you don&rsquo;t know the area it won&rsquo;t make a difference to your understanding &ndash; but if you do it will give you an extra thrill.&rdquo;</p> <p>&bull; <a href=\"http://scribepublications.com.au/books-authors/title/cairo/\">Cairo is published by Scribe</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421424631|2013-11-05T11:23:37Z|399a7fae5a12c1a8fd68ce2dc27d10e6ab3c7ebf -->",

Iron Man 3</a></h2><p>Shane Black's jagged-edged debut in the Marvel hotseat might easily have been a by-the-numbers \"threequel\", especially with star Robert Downey Jr out of contract and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144027/avengers\">The Avengers</a>' stupendous box office success a year earlier. Instead, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/108739/kiss.kiss.bang.bang\">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a> director delivered the series' best instalment so far via a perfectly-pitched twist that comes about as close as the superhero genre will ever get to its very own Crying Game moment.</p><p>Ben Kingsley's nefarious Mandarin is a preposterous, shadowy Bin Laden clone with a big bushy beard and rhetoric drawn from the Acme guide to over-the-top comic book villainy, taunting Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man with lines like: \"You'll never see me coming!\" The problem is, he's right. We're contentedly caught up in another movie entirely (the enjoyment of which probably says some pretty shoddy things about our own prejudices) when the twist in the tale manifests, and the effect is instant. Black's movie slips slinkily from the predictability trap as we find ourselves blinking at the screen in disbelief, wondering if we are about to miss another deft sleight of hand. With the viewer (not to mention Iron Man himself) suddenly way outside the comfort zone, we find ourselves hurtling headlong towards the final credits with renewed vigour. <strong>Ben Child</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/86565/spider-man\">9.

Here was a callow teenage superhero with the same doubts and foibles as the audiences reading the comic, desperately trying to balance his duties to the people of Manhattan with his studies, chores and need to earn enough pocket money to take Mary Jane out on a Saturday night.</p><p>Fittingly, the incredibly successful 2002 film version saw director Sam Raimi transforming what had become a tired and directionless genre with a character-led approach that similarly invited viewers to identify and empathise with its wall-crawling, skyscraper-straddling hero. Suddenly, Batman and Superman felt like distant, statuesque figures representing vague concepts of fearless, epic valour. </p><p>As portrayed by goggle-eyed Tobey Maguire, Spider-Man/Peter Parker was defined by a likeable, everyman quality which made his romantic adventures just as tantalising as his battles with the bad guys. Speaking of which, has there ever been a better big screen super-villain that Willem Dafoe's sneering, leering, gurning Green Goblin? This was the movie which, more than any other, ushered in a new era of high-quality, visually spectacular comic book adaptations. <strong>BC</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/34642/blade\">8.

Though it foreshadows the later Marvel preoccupation with subplots and digressions – a simple tale of humans versus vampires suddenly drifts into a quest by the latter to raise a \"Blood God\" called La Magra – Blade is a much darker and violent (though by no means shorter) action thriller when compared to the more shinier, mainstream likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/139926/thor\">Thor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142811/captain-america\">Captain America</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/123770/iron.man\">Iron Man</a>.</p><p>Played by Wesley Snipes, immortal vampire hunter Blade channelled the kick-ass likes of Jim Brown (Slaughter) and Fred Williamson (Hammer), while a soundtrack featuring KRS-One, Mobb Deep and Mystikal played right to the urban demographic. Adding to the blaxploitation vibe, the film even has a vein of social comment, with the vampire elite preferring to stay in the shadows and rule by infiltrating the establishment rather than declare all-out war on the human masses.</p><p>At a time when superhero movies now attract A-list stars, the casting of Snipes, then taking a dip, now seems wilfully bizarre, especially putting him against a swan-diving Stephen Dorff and a doozy of a left-field choice in Kris Kristofferson as Blade's munitions man. But this, like casting camp Warhol legend Udo Kier as a vampire elder, is what gives the film its bite, a reminder of a not-so-distant time when comic-book stories were declassé and underground. <strong>Damon Wise</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135252/kick-ass\">7.

But in the potty-mouthed, pre-teen form of Chloe Moretz's Hit Girl, a lethal whirling dervish with the ability to slice and dice bad-guys like a butcher cutting up carcasses, the movie easily featured the most outlandish example of a masked vigilante ever seen on the big screen. It is also the film that opened the doors for The Avengers, Joss Whedon's more subtle take on the post-modern comic book caper, with its ability to simultaneously lampoon and celebrate the superhero phenomenon.</p><p>Vaughn and Jane Goldman's fiercely contemporary script, chock full of now-dated references to MySpace, gives us protagonists who are at best idiots, at worst brainwashed children. It recognises that attempting to be a \"real-life\" costumed vigilante is a recipe for rib-cracking, lip-busting disaster. But it is also savvy enough not to completely undermine the genre's most beloved tropes. </p><p>Kick-Ass may be an ersatz version of Spider-Man, with a rubbish moniker and a costume based on a wetsuit bought from eBay, but he achieves final victory in just as explosive a manner as his genuinely-superpowered forebears. It turns out you don't need laser-vision or super-strength to take down the bad guys after all - just a giant bazooka and balls of steel. <strong>BC</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144027/avengers\">6.

Here's a flying aircraft carrier! </p><p>Given the absurdly high stakes of this movie, Marvel were taking a gamble handing it to a renegade like Whedon. It's the climax of possibly the most ambitious multi-movie masterplan ever attempted (after Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, etc). And Whedon's career had been chequered with big hits (Buffy) and prematurely cancelled misses (Firefly). Weighed down with this colossal baggage and expectation, though, Whedon's approach is more like, \"let's see what this baby can do.\" Whedon's masterstroke was to turn the movie's greatest weakness into its strength. Namely, here are a bunch of supremely powerful egotists, how can they possibly work together? That's the problem, and that's the movie, too.</p><p>Despite all the CGI bangs and crashes going on around, the real joy of the Avengers is seeing characters we know and love learning to get along (seeing them not get along turns out to be rather fun, too). For some, Mark Ruffalo's Hulk steals the show with his softly, softly, then VERY LOUDLY approach, Tom Hiddleston's Loki is a delectably atypical supervillain. Robert Downey Jr is Hollywood's preeminent deliverer of wisecracks. The list goes on.</p><p>The Avengers is so jokily irreverent at times, the movie threatens to capsize entirely, and the plot is so nonsensically crowded it could easily disappear up its own Tesseract. Somehow, though, Whedon keeps it all under control, telling this bloated story with wit, clarity and genuine excitement. It's a mark of great movie-making that you can happily enjoy The Avengers without having seen the previous movies, or caring a jot about the silly names or the Top Trumps superpowers.</p><p>In retrospect, you could also read the movie's teamwork premise as a metaphor for Whedon's own career-long problem with Hollywood: how to achieve a lasting result when everything threatens to be watered down by committee decision-making? Here, at last, he finally cracked it. <strong>Steve Rose</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77773/superman\">5. Superman: The Movie </a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421644201'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/7/3/1372865977052/Christopher-Reeve-as-Supe-010.jpg' alt='Christopher Reeve as Superman' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>As Quentin Tarantino put it in Kill Bill Vol 2: \"Superman stands alone… When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman. His alter ego is Clark Kent.\" It's arguably this reversal of the superhero formula that made this 1978 blockbuster a Christmas hit – although there have been two big-budget attempts to reboot the franchise, with a far greater special effects capability, neither captured the world's imagination quite like Richard Donner's original. Key to this is the casting of an unknown, Christopher Reeve, who beat Burt Reynolds, Robert Redford and James Caan for the part, bringing with him a sensitive, doe-eyed, matinee idol quality borrowed from Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby.</p><p>Interestingly, the first Superman also added something missing from almost every superhero movie since: not simply a love story but a strong female presence in the form of Margot Kidder's reporter Lois Lane, a sharp-tongued Rosalind Russell type who works with Kent at the Daily Planet. It might not be stretching to say that their relationship is the core of the movie; Superman by himself did not keep the series alive, and within ten years (Superman IV: The Quest for Peace) he was a spent force. Here, though, the chemistry is terrific, with a little bit of screwball farce to keep us guessing as to whether the sophisticated city girl, comically star-struck by Superman, will see through the \"mild-mannered\" Kent's facade.</p><p>There are, of course, other key factors in the film's success. It was the first film outside the Irwin Allen disaster-movie cycle to use event casting as a promotional tool, making great play of Marlon Brando's $14m payday for ten minutes of screen time as Superman's father. The supporting cast, too – Gene Hackman, Terence Stamp, Valerie Perrine, Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter, Trevor Howard – was superbly chosen for a wide age-range of audience. Mostly, though, there is John Williams' perfect, anthemic score, still a musical milestone in Hollywood, fantasy film or not. <strong>DW</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/84422/x-men\">4.

If we're talking signs that this is not your average superhero film, that one is nigh-on definitive. But with a director as wily and provocative as Bryan Singer, best known at that time for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/63102/usual-suspects\">The Usual Suspects</a> (written by Christopher McQuarrie, who contributed some uncredited work to the X-Men screenplay), this was never going to play entirely by the rules of the genre. Partly that's down to the adventurous Marvel comics source material. But Singer's interpretation functions brilliantly as a psychological character study of the various disenfranchised souls who comprise the X-Men, a metaphor for society's suspicion of outsiders of any stripe, and a thrilling old-school action movie characterised by dazzling special-effects and action set-pieces. </p><p>It helps that the film has a smart and idiosyncratic ensemble cast. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is as intense as the post-Batman fad for introspective superheroes demands, but he's not without wit: deriding the idea of superhero nicknames when he finds himself at the X-Mansion school for mutants, Wolverine turns to Professor X (Patrick Stewart), who is in a wheelchair, and snorts: \"What do they call you? 'Wheels'?\" Ian McKellen is elegantly dry as X's sinister opposite number, Magneto, while Anna Paquin is poignant as Rogue, whose merest touch can be hazardous. Plenty of other superhero films have tried for the mix of seriousness and excitement, but few aside from X-Men quite have the ability to please as many of the people for as much of the time. <strong>Ryan Gilbey</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78119/batman\">3. Batman </a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421644203'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/17/1342540535833/FILM-BATMAN-BY-TIM-BURTON-008.jpg' alt='FILM 'BATMAN' BY TIM BURTON' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The modern superhero film as we know it today — sombre, gritty, light on Spandex but heavy on psychology — began in 1989 with Tim Burton's Batman. Burton, with only two much smaller-scale pictures to his name (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice) had the mother of all makeover jobs on his hands, a reboot in the days before that word was in common usage. The character of Batman had previously been associated with all things camp and kitsch, thanks to the splendid but indelible 1960s TV series. But the success of Frank Miller's graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns proved that there was an audience for a harsher Batman. If Burton's film looks light now compared to Christopher Nolan's miserabilist take on the franchise, it should not be forgotten that it was vital in paving the way for that later incarnation. Similarly, Michael Keaton's subtle, even sexy, portrayal of Batman/ Bruce Wayne as a tentative loner laid the groundwork for Christian Bale's hushed interpretation.</p><p>But just as any superhero's biggest threat comes from a megalomaniac villain, so a leading man in a superhero movie is lucky not to be upstaged by his on-screen adversary. And for all Keaton's velvety sadness and Kim Basinger's vitality as the reporter Vicki Vale, Batman belongs to Jack Nicholson as the Joker as surely as The Dark Knight would later be stolen by Heath Ledger in the same part. Nicholson is wayward, indulgent and bags of fun; something of his devilish spirit is mirrored in the specially-composed Prince songs that vie for space on the soundtrack with Danny Elfman's brooding score. Perhaps the only thing Nicholson can't overshadow is the imposing, Gothic, Oscar-winning production design by the late Anton Furst. <strong>RG</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/102423/incredibles\">2. The Incredibles </a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421644204'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/06/05/incredibles460.jpg' alt='The Incredibles' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A superhero family – why did nobody think of this before? Maybe they did (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/88138/spy.kids\">Spy Kids?</a>) but nobody found a way to make it work. The Incredibles has the advantage of animation, of course, which you could call cheating when it comes to the rendering of superhuman action. But it's also a deeper exploration of superheroism than most live-action movies.</p><p>The story harks back to that pulpy golden age of comic books – with its 1950s-ish suburban setting and space-age stylings. The traditional superheroes of the era (the ones they're still making films out of today) were invariably young, single males, but what happens, The Incredibles asks, when they become parents? Or when they're children? Or if they've been outlawed and are forced to hide their powers? Being \"special\", and having to conceal that specialness – at school, at work, on the streets – is one of the forces that rips this nuclear family apart. The other is an insane tyrant in a volcano with a fiendishly destructive plan, of course.</p><p>These are heavy themes: conformity, mediocrity, exceptionalism – the stuff of Ayn Rand novels. But, like Mr Incredible juggling small vehicles, the movie handles them effortlessly. The story fizzes with sight-gags and snappy lines, riffing on both family and superhero cliches – which come together beautifully in scenes such as the super-powered dinner-table squabble, which suddenly freezes when the front doorbell rings. And it still delivers on the action front too, with a climax that's suitably awesome without feeling bloated (live-action movies could learn a trick or two there).</p><p>None of this would be possible without a deep love of the genre, and few can doubt The Incredibles' knowledge and commitment. It's a movie crammed with details and references, that points out the rules even as it plays by them. Its mischievous identification of \"monologuing\", for example, cast a retrospective shadow over many a prior movie, and after hearing Edna Mode's lecture on costumes, you'll never look at a superhero in a cape the same way again. <strong>SR</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122806/dark.knight\">1.

This movie (the best of Nolan's three Batman films) was widely gasped-at in Imax cinemas; it descended on us with a deafening clang like a piece of giant industrial machinery designed and built by extra-terrestrials. Nolan's Batman wrenched the franchise away from the self-aware comedy and campery with which it had been associated by virtue of the Adam West 60s TV show and the Joel Schumacher movies with George Clooney and Val Kilmer as the Caped Crusader. Without so much as a backward glance at those interpretations, Christopher Nolan put the Batman narrative unapologetically into a vein of almost Wagnerian seriousness.<br /> <br />There is a fascinating kind of sleek digital brutalism in the hardware and the action sequences themselves: the chase sequence between a truck and Batman's motorbike has muscular power, and so does the strange, nightmarish \"heist\" scene at the beginninig which appears to be carried out by dozens of clones of the Joker.<br /> <br />Which brings us to the source of the film's power: the faceoff itself, and the confrontation between two of the most formidable performances in the modern superhero canon. Christian Bale is disturbing and sinister as the ambiguous \"Bat man\" and his performance clearly owes a great deal to the creepily potent serial killer Patrick Bateman he portrayed in American Psycho. Of course, Batman fans have long savoured the subtextual mythic link between Batman and Dracula: the charismatic batlike creatures of the night, but it was only when I was confronted with Bale and his uniquely menacing performance that I put that together for myself.<br /> <br />As the Joker, Heath Ledger has to be best supervillain of all: genuinely scary, satanically ingenious and bizarrely tricked out in sweatily smudged clown makeup that makes him look like a Pagliacci from hell. Somehow, the Joker has huge logistical resources at his disposal, despite apparently being a lone figure — equal to those deployed by the army, the police or the billionaire Bruce Wayne. How is he doing it? The mystery makes him even more evil. It is a sensational performance from the late Heath Ledger, something to be considered alongside his work on Ang Lee's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/108296/brokeback.mountain\">Brokeback Mountain</a> or Neil Armfield's underrated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115218/candy\">Candy</a>.<br /> <br />Nolan's Dark Knight, in all its sepulchral darkness and madness, is a superhero movie with super power. <strong>Peter Bradshaw</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/top-10-films\">More Guardian and Observer critics' top 10s</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/10/top-10-action-movies\">• Top 10 action movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/11/top-10-comedy-movies\">• Top 10 comedy movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/14/top-10-horror-movies\">• Top 10 horror movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/16/top-10-sci-fi-movies\">• Top 10 sci-fi movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/18/top-10-crime-movies\">• Top 10 crime movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/21/top-10-arthouse-movies\">• Top 10 arthouse movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/25/top-10-family-movies\">• Top 10 family movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/oct/28/top-10-war-movies\">• Top 10 war movies</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/nov/01/top-10-teen-movies\">• Top 10 teen movies</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421383201|2013-11-05T11:23:37Z|0a7543fe379fafb0cbe0c4eaf5235da17a1ced18 -->",

        "body":"<p>The inaugural <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/11/03/youtube-music-awards-live-stream-video-watch-2013-ytma/\">YouTube music awards</a> aired live across the internet from Pier 36 in New York on Sunday night, a messy affair that achieved its goal of being the antithesis of regular awards ceremonies: not least because the hosts, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/jason-schwartzman-youtube-music-awards-652622\">Jason Schwartzman and Reggie Watts</a>, ended the night covered in paint and fake blood.</p> <p>Somewhere among the chaos, the hosts presented awards in seven categories – giving winners a small, shiny, YouTube logo or, as innovation of the year winner <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/DeStorm\">DeStorm</a> called it, “the dopest paperweight”.</p> <p>The goal of the show's creative director, Spike Jonze, was to be prepared for as little as possible – each host was armed solely with a list of bullet points about the awards, all of which were voted on by YouTube users.</p> <p>“I’m used to that and that’s the way I like to work,&quot; said Watts, whose favourite YouTube video is an hour-long UFO documentary.</p> <p>“I cannot reiterate how we had no idea what was going to happen, ever,&quot; said Schwartzman after the show. &quot;All we had on the cards were the next award, but there were no lines and nothing scripted and we had no idea what was going to happen next.”</p> <p>That simple premise did not satisfy the show producer, so the hosts were also presented with &quot;obstacles” . Just 20 minutes into the show, the hosts’ humorous diatribe was interrupted as they were sent to the VIP section where actress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iamrashidajones\">Rashida Jones </a>presented them with two babies, then walked away once the hosts had them in hand.</p> <p>Schwartzman, a father, was visibly upset as the baby he held cried, and repeatedly said he was concerned about the loud music – one of several elements that helped create an over-stimulating environment, even for mature adults watching from the comfort of their screens.</p> <p>&quot;I can’t speak for the baby, nor can the baby speak for itself, but it seemed like the baby just wanted its mother more than it was nervous to meet me,” he joked later, adding that the baby stopped crying when she was returned to her mother.</p> <p>The show had glimmers of promise during the live music video segments, in which filmmakers including Jonze, <a href=\"http://fafi.net/\">Fafi</a> and <a href=\"http://milk.co/\">Chris Milk </a>showed off their talent and seized on the crowd of revellers to create some genuinely impressive images.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VevSFuDm12E\">Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler the Creator rapped Sasquatch</a> in a pink cube filled with enthusiastic kids fight-dancing toward the cameras. Lady Gaga dressed as a male skateboarder for a piano ballad – <a href=\"http://www.hitfix.com/news/lady-gaga-strips-herself-bare-for-dope-at-youtube-music-awards-watch\">the live premiere of her song Dope</a>, backed by an enraptured audience. MIA held a brightly-lit parade filled with hula-hooping dancers and paint-throwing for her <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/11/03/mia-performance-come-walk-with-me-2013-ytma/\">Come Walk With Me</a> video.</p> <p>The consistently artful videos strayed into gimmick territory in DJ Avicii's short film, which paired a sullen concert-goer with the mocking stereotype of a rave girl, against a foreign DJ and the concertgoer's ex-girlfriend, played by <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2486926/Vanessa-Hudgens-gets-thrown-floor-overzealous-fan--But-dont-worry-music-video.html\">Vanessa Hudgens</a>.</p> <p>Towards the end of the film, both pairs froze in place and the in-house audience was invited to vote on whether the prior pair could “hail a taxi, meet each other's parents and have some soup” or partake in a “double tragedy”. Audience members were overwhelmingly in favour of tragedy, which resulted in a mock double-suicide from the ceiling, replete with red string guts splayed on the audience below.</p> <p><strong>Award winners:</strong></p> <p><strong>Video of the year</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq7ftOZBy0E\">Girls' Generation – I Got A Boy</a></p> <p><strong>Artist of the year</strong><br /> Eminem</p> <p><strong>Response of the year</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh-72yBP7sw\">Lindsey Stirling and Pentatonix – Radioactive</a></p> <p><strong>YouTube phenomenon</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNoKguSdy4Y\">I Knew You Were Trouble</a></p> <p><strong>YouTube breakthrough</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes\">Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis</a></p> <p><strong>Innovation of the year</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6FepyR0KuE\">DeStorm – See Me Standing</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421591893|2013-11-05T11:23:37Z|69be84e7e13f4e96911a3c2d42a70de4d2bfd3af -->",

        "headline":"The 100 best novels: No 7 – Emma by Jane Austen (1816)",
        "body":"<p>How on earth to choose just one Jane Austen novel? Austen, for some, is simply the supreme English novelist, on any list. Some will say: she is the greatest. Nominate all six, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/26/pride-prejudice-200th-anniversary\" title=\"\"><em>Pride and Prejudice</em></a> on. But the rules of our selection only allow one title per author: there has to be a choice. So, to represent her fiction here, I've chosen <em>Emma</em> for three particular reasons.</p><p>First, it's my personal favourite, a mature and brilliant comedy of manners (and much more besides) completed towards the end of her life. Second, published by John Murray, <em>Emma</em> takes us into a new literary landscape, the beginnings of a book world that lingers unto the 21st century. And third, most importantly of all, Austen's last novel has the sparkle of early books such as <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, mixed with a sharper and deeper sensibility. There's no accounting for taste: I simply prefer it to the others.</p><p><em>Emma</em> was written in a white heat – according to the scholars – between 21 January 1814 and 29 March 1815 (the year of Waterloo), and it comes as the climax to a remarkable period of intense creativity. <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (whose first draft, \"First Impressions\", was written in 1796-7) had been published in 1813, <em>Mansfield Park</em> in 1814. Austen's work was becoming something of a cult, and she was aware of her audience. Indeed, the Prince Regent was a fan (<em>Emma</em> is dedicated to him). Austen must have been conscious that she was no longer writing just for herself. She was at the peak of her powers, yet had less than two years to live. All this, I think, gives <em>Emma</em> an added depth as the final flowering of a great artist and her work.</p><p>The novelist herself is highly conscious of her art. Emma, she wrote to a friend, is \"a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\". Perhaps. However, compared with her other heroines – Elizabeth Bennet, Fanny Price, Anne Elliot, and Catherine Morland – Emma is the most complex, subtle and complete. Yes, she is \"handsome, clever and rich\". But she's only 21 and will be sent on the familiar Austen cycle of wrong-headedness, remorse, repentance and ultimate self-realisation (with Mr Knightley) in a far deeper way than her predecessors.</p><p><em>Emma</em> represents mature Austen in another way, too. She has perfected the art of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_indirect_speech\" title=\"\">free indirect speech</a> to convey the inner life of her heroine while retaining her control of the narrative as the omniscient author. Light and shade are expertly and satisfyingly in harmony, and the novel's deceptively simple plot is spun into so much teasing variety, through games, letters and riddles – the book is exceedingly playful – that the reader is never less than fully engaged, even charmed. Then there's Austen's mature delight in her milieu. She herself famously wrote that \"three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on\", and <em>Emma</em>'s Highbury exemplifies this credo. Here, fully in command of her genre, Austen revels in her characters and their foibles. Mr Woodhouse, Mr and Mrs Elton, poor Miss Bates, Jane Fairfax and her fiance, deceitful Frank Churchill and, of course, noble Mr Knightley – these are among the most vivid and universal characters in English fiction, as real to us as Pickwick or Jeeves.</p><p>Emma herself is endlessly fascinating, a woman to whom the reader returns again and again for the seductive intimacy of her thoughts, a secret communion that's braided with the lesson that self-knowledge is a mystery, vanity the source of the worst pain, and the subconscious a treacherous and imperfect instrument in the management of the psyche. You can object that Emma is a lady and a snob, but she also makes a timeless appeal to the reader's better nature.</p><p>Austen seems to have known that she was working on something special. <em>Mansfield Park</em> had been published by Thomas Egerton. This time, however, she wanted better terms and more literary prestige. There was only one address for that: 50 Albemarle Street, Mayfair. She approached John Murray, Byron's publisher, offering her new manuscript. Murray accepted at once and his edition appeared in December 1815, after a trouble-free editorial process in which her new publisher made a point of treating her with the greatest respect, though author and publisher never actually met.</p><p><em>Emma</em> occupies a special place in this list because it is supremely English – in character, landscape, sensibility and wit. It's provincial, opaque, sparkling and wonderfully optimistic while being at the same time tinged with intimations of sorrow and mortality. In the end, it answers Jane Austen's own high-spirited prescription for the novel, expressed in <em>Northanger Abbey</em>: \"in short, only some work in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language\".</p><p><strong>A Note on the Text:</strong></p><p>There was just one text prepared in Austen's lifetime, the John Murray edition, dated 1816, though it was actually published in three volumes in December 1815. No manuscript survives. Subsequent editions, notably by RW Chapman, have made silent corrections to typographical errors, but no substantial emendations. <em>Emma</em> has been continuously in print since its first publication: that's one definition of a classic.</p><p><strong>Other Austen Titles:</strong></p><p><em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (1811); <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (1813); <em>Mansfield Park</em> (1814); <em>Northanger Abbey</em> and <em>Persuasion</em>, published posthumously in 1817.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421127092|2013-11-05T11:23:37Z|d958baf68533c914bb1a193d7506d6f473ff7e0e -->",

        "headline":"Does the Munich hoard turn the story of art and the Nazis on its head?",
        "body":"<p>It is one of the most shuddered-at chapters in the story of art. In July 1937, Nazi officials turned up in full uniform alongside evening-suited cultural eminences of the Third Reich at an art gallery in Munich for the opening of the Exhibition of Degenerate Art. They came not to praise modern art, but to laugh at it.</p><p>Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Georg Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner – the masters of modernism, including giants of Germany's own avant garde, were shown in this exhibition as deviant, decadent practitioners of so-called Degenerate Art – \"<em>Entartete Kunst\"</em>. Sections of the show had titles such as&nbsp;\"Total Madness\", \"The Prostitute Raised to a Moral Ideal\", \"The Negroisation of Art\". Modern art was interpreted in the catalogue as a conspiracy by Russian Bolsheviks and Jewish dealers to destroy European culture. The admiration for African carvings that had so fired Picasso and other artists was taken as proof of modern art's racial degeneracy.</p><p>Vile stuff – but the Nazi attitude to modern art may have been radically misunderstood. An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police\" title=\"\">amazing discovery in 21st-century Munich</a> turns the story of art and the Nazis on its head.</p><p>Cornelius Gurlitt's flat looks meagre in photographs. It is located in an apartment block in Munich that, from the outside, appears to have seen better days. Yet in that flat lay secrets of the Third Reich only now accidentally uncovered. Intrigued by Gurlitt's lack of German identity documents and odd behaviour while crossing the border on a trip to Switzerland, police raided his home and found a hoard of more than 1,500 works of art including pieces by Picasso, Matisse, Renoir, Paul Klee, Emil Nolde, Franz Marc, Otto Dix and Oskar Kokoschka. The understandably reclusive Gurlitt turned out to be the son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer who played a key role in the Nazi roundup of \"degenerate art\". Although half-Jewish, and the cousin of the \"degenerate\" composer Manfred Gurlitt, the Nazis considered him a useful expert. This is not just any haul of stolen goods: it may turn out to be one the most important recoveries of lost art ever. For it takes us to the heart of the cultural policies and crimes of the Third Reich.</p><p>It raises massive questions about the fate of art in and after the second world war. As the allies entered Germany in the last phase of the war they took with them experts, nicknamed the \"monuments men\", whose job was to find out where the Nazis had stashed looted works of art. For it was not just modern art the Nazis abused. All over Europe, they seized the best masterpieces from the&nbsp;finest museums. Many of these, including such treasures as <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Titian_-_Danae_(Hermitage_Version).jpg\" title=\"\">Titian's Danae</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/open-altarpiece.jpg\" title=\"\">Van Eyck's Ghent altarpiece</a>, were found stashed in mountain tunnels and mines. Others, including many of the works of art shown in the Degenerate Art exhibit, are believed lost for ever. Paintings such as <a href=\"http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/374/Painter-on-His-Way-to-Work,-The.html\" title=\"\">Van Gogh's The&nbsp;Painter on his Way to Work</a> and 14&nbsp;masterpieces by Gustav Klimt are written off as destroyed. But is it possible a Nazi network preserved a secret world of stolen art after 1945? Is&nbsp;it even possible such art was used to fund neo-Nazi activities or maintain war criminals in quiet comfort?</p><p>To put it another way: were Hildebrand Gurlitt and his son unique, or is the find in Munich a clue to some larger network of Nazi art hoarders sitting on secret treasures all this time in postwar Europe, living off occasional covert sales of the Picassos that they keep among the canned foods in their anonymous flats?</p><p>One thing is certain: this story comes from the dark heart of Nazi Europe. Munich was Hitler's art capital. As a young man, famously, he wanted to be an artist. He wasted an inheritance trying to get an art education in Vienna. While Klimt was creating modern art there, Hitler was going to the opera to&nbsp;hear Wagner (conducted by the modernist Gustav Mahler), and soon eking a living painting drab topographic scenes. Eventually he left for Munich, where he survived as a hack painter of typical German scenery until the first world war gave him a new life as a soldier. Hitler loved Munich, and when he came to power lavished money on its art scene. The city's expressionist painters were in trouble. But while Degenerate Art pilloried them, in 1938 Hitler opened a huge exhibition of \"proper\" German art at the newly built House of German Art, a grand neo-classical temple to the art of a new, fascist Europe. Where the year before thousands had flocked to see the art they were told to hate, far fewer went to see Nazi-favoured art.</p><p>This is where the cliches start. It is conventional to contrast the avant-garde art the Nazis maligned with the traditionalism and conservatism of the art they admired. But the National Socialist nightmare was not \"conservative\". It was, in its own way, horribly modern – it imagined a different, perverted vision of modernity. The House of German Art still survives in Munich. Today it is used as an <a href=\"http://www.hausderkunst.de\" title=\"\">alternative arts centre</a>. Video and installation look subversively great in its grand icy halls. You wouldn't call these rooms old-fashioned. Rather they have a chilly neo-classical hauteur that speaks of sublime ambition. <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/M%C3%BCnchen_Haus_der_Kunst_2009.jpg\" title=\"\">This is the neo-classical modern art of Nazism</a> that can&nbsp;still be seen in Leni Riefenstahl's terrifying films – some of the most disturbingly beautiful ever made – and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpY22uSAPAA\" title=\"\">designs of Hitler's architects Paul Troost</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/feb/01/architecture.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Albert Speer</a>.</p><p>Hitler did not hate art – he loved it. Other leading Nazis just saw it as money. Goering, greedy and corrupt, amassed art because it symbolised wealth and power. Munich was at the centre of the regime's cultural pretensions. The Gurlitt hoard is a survival of&nbsp;the Nazis' strange and ambivalent attitude to art, from Hitler's aesthetic New Order to the simple philistine greed that probably motivated most of&nbsp;their art theft.</p><p>Gurlitt's cache reveals that many assumptions about the Nazis and art are simply untrue. The Degenerate Art exhibition was real enough – but did it really mean the Nazis hated modern art? It is because we take this for granted that no one has been searching for lost \"degenerate\" works such as those in the flat in Munich. Some works from the Entartete Kunst exhibition, many seized from once-progressive German museums, were sold abroad afterwards. Others have vanished. As the war began and Nazi racial policies became ever more explicit, more modern and pre-modern works were seized or bought for a pittance from Jewish owners. Much was destroyed. Or was it?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421693865'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/4/1383591133414/Goerings-art-collection-009.jpg' alt='Goering's art collection' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>An American soldier examines part of Herman Goering's personal collection of looted art, recovered as the allies invaded Germany in 1945. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most suspicious cases is that of Klimt's lost works. Fourteen paintings by this Austrian visionary of dreams and desire were stored in an Austrian castle during the war. In 1945, an SS battalion reportedly held an orgy there before setting the castle alight. The Klimts are presumed lost, but there were rumours that some might have been spirited away. Now, surely, such stories need to be re-examined. The 1,500 works hidden by the Gurlitts, father and son, were also presumed lost.</p><p>The allies tend to blame themselves for art lost in Germany in the 1940s. Almost every major German city was bombed by Britain and the US during the second world war. Firestorms ravaged museums and art stores as well as killing thousands of civilians. \"Bomber\" Harris, Britain's Bomber Command mastermind who insisted this was the way to win the war, was apparently responsible for burning paintings such as Van Gogh's Painter on the Way to Work and Caravaggio's first version of St Matthew, as well as his portrait of a courtesan.</p><p>Perhaps the single most significant fact that has so far come out about Hildebrand Gurlitt is that he claimed his collection of looted art was destroyed in the bombing of Dresden. So it was the allies who burned it. If he lied so easily about that, what about other Nazi-owned art that supposedly vanished in wartime air raids?</p><p>The massive destruction the Nazis brought down on Germany created chaos in 1945. As the \"monuments men\" were seeking out stolen art treasures in Alpine mines, it seems Gurlitt was carefully and quietly preserving his personal hoard.</p><p>The reason he got away with it is that he had grabbed so many modernist works. Ever since 1937, it has been assumed that \"degenerate art\" was either sold abroad or destroyed. The \"monuments men\" went searching for Titians, not Picassos. But the Munich hoard proves the naivety of this assumption. Even in the mind of Hitler, modern art was bizarrely fascinating. You do not put on an exhibition of something you do not want to look at. In some strange way the Nazis needed modern art, as a demonic image of their nightmares. The Degenerate Art exhibition is, after all, the biggest backhanded compliment ever paid to the avant garde. Many people think art has no influence on the world. Hitler knew&nbsp;it did. The old saw that he hated modernism is just too simple. He loved to hate it. What you love to hate, you want to keep, somewhere, if only as a freakshow curiosity.</p><p>Other Nazis simply went along with&nbsp;Hitler's taste in public but did not really know what the would-be artist in him was talking about. In Mussolini's Italy, the Futurist movement was cosy with fascism. There was no reason – Italy proved – that fascists needed to spurn modernism. Some German modern artists, notably Nolde, were themselves sympathetic to the far&nbsp;right.</p><p>Then there was greed. In the end, the National Socialists were thugs, criminals and murderers. The idea that&nbsp;most of them believed deeply in ideological discriminations about art is not that plausible. For men like Gurlitt, modern art made a good stash. He and his son sat on the hoard while his claim that it was lost in a firestorm was taken at face value.</p><p>Now the books on Nazi loot need to be reopened. It seems only too possible that other Gurlitts hid away other art treasures in the chaos of defeat.</p><p>In one of the last photographs ever taken of Adolf Hitler he is in the bunker in Berlin <a href=\"http://carolynyeager.net/images/TBR_Farewell%20Berlin_html_m47768c16.jpg\" title=\"\">contemplating Albert Speer's design for a new art capital to be built at Linz</a>. Much as he loved Munich, this city was closer to his childhood home. Its massive new museum was to have contained all the art treasures of conquered Europe.</p><p>While Hitler doted on his cultural fantasies, paintings were vanishing into fruit cellars and attics. It was so easy to write them off in the Führer's Götterdämmerung.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/04/missing-in-action-artworks-destroyed-war\"><br />Read Jonathan Jones on the masterpieces that are missing in action</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421646342|2013-11-05T11:23:37Z|b188b53ee4077ca4ea6a6417147aa43c8c63780e -->",

In 2007, Baron Cohen <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3670064/Sacha-Baron-Cohen-Killing-off-Borat.html\" title=\"\">bid farewell to the character</a>, a decision he described as \"upsetting, but the success has been great and better than anything I could have dreamed of\".
