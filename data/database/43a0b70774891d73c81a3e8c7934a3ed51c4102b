        "body":"<p>A new biography of Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos claims to be \"the definitive story\" of the company, but one Amazon reviewer is distinctly unimpressed: Bezos' wife MacKenzie.</p> <p>\"Everywhere I can fact check from personal knowledge, I find way too many inaccuracies, and unfortunately that casts doubt over every episode in the book,\" she wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0T26SV0ELPP/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0316219266&amp;linkCode=&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=\">lengthy one-star critique</a> of The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon by author Brad Stone.</p> <p>\"The book is also full of techniques which stretch the boundaries of non-fiction, and the result is a lopsided and misleading portrait of the people and culture at Amazon.\"</p> <p>Novelist Bezos suggests that Stone's book uses \"weak rhetorical devices\" and \"unbalanced reporting\" on the working culture within Amazon, and claims its descriptions of the company's founder \"passes off speculation about his thoughts and intentions as fact\".</p> <p>\"Readers should remember that Jeff was never interviewed for this book, and should also take note of how seldom these guesses about his feelings and motives are marked with a footnote indicating there is any other source to substantiate them.\"</p> <h2>Amazon questions fact-checking</h2> <p>For its part, Amazon has also criticised the book, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-statement-on-amazon-book-2013-11\">issuing a statement to Business Insider</a>, the technology site in which Jeff Bezos is an investor. It revealed that, while Bezos himself wasn't interviewed for Stone's book, the company did co-operate with its author.</p> <p>\"Over the course of the author&rsquo;s reporting,&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;facilitated meetings for him with&nbsp;more than&nbsp;half a dozen senior&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/\" data-skimwords-id=\"1974447\" data-skimwords-word=\"amazon\" data-group-id=\"0\" data-skim-creative=\"300001\" data-skim-product=\"1974447\">Amazon</a>&nbsp;executives, during which he had every opportunity to inquire about or fact-check&nbsp;claims made by former employees. He chose not to,\" claimed Amazon's spokesperson Craig Berman.</p> <p>\"I met in person with him on at least three occasions and exchanged dozens of emails where he only checked a few specific quotes. He had every opportunity to thoroughly fact-check and bring a more balanced viewpoint to his&nbsp;narrative, but he was very secretive about the book and simply chose not to.\"</p> <h2>Author denies bias</h2> <p>Stone has defended his book, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-wife-reviews-book-on-amazon-2013-11\">telling Business Insider</a> that he interviewed 300 people for the biography, including current and past executives, promising to correct any mistakes for future editions, and defending his claims to know what Bezos was thinking at various points in Amazon's history.</p> <p>\"Narrative non-fiction demands that authors get as close to their characters as possible. I didn't invent those rules,\" said Stone.</p> <p>\"She's accusing me of bias or a hidden perspective. I tried to endeavor to have a balanced view. I didn't have any hidden bias, but I'm certainly less biased than Jeff's wife when it comes to an account of&nbsp;the&nbsp;company's&nbsp;history.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421677249|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|0fe8413bc1a8d4d7daeec938a19d3ca75a9df041 -->",

The issue has caused a 'gripping' resolution war among enlightened video game commentators online, all of them in full possession of the technical specs, development kits, extensive programming experience and knowledge of modern industry production techniques needed to make simultaneously informed and enraged proclamations.</p><p>Anyway... Microsoft is not yet ready to talk about what's happened:</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft has said that it is not yet ready to respond to criticism leveled at Xbox One over the revelation that two of its major launch titles will only output natively at 720p.</p><p>Responding to a NeoGaf user asking about the chances Albert Penello, Xbox director of product planning, \"will presence us with an apology or concession,\" Penello responded: \"Pretty good, I'd say.\"</p><p>\"I'll be back,\" he added moments later. \"You're right, I should talk about it. But right now, still lots of info to come out. Once the dust settles, and all the information is out there, I'll address my comments.\"</p></blockquote><p>This won't go down well with the online graphics war intelligentsia – because it involves waiting a bit and considering the evidence. </p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/436690/gran-turismo-6-to-feature-over-1200-cars-and-100-track-layouts/\">Gran Turismo 6 to feature over 1200 cars and 100 track layouts | CVG UK</a></h2><p>That's pretty much the story in the title – Polyphony Digital is putting seemingly every car on the planet into its next real driving simulator. However, here's an intriguing new feature:</p><blockquote><p>A post-launch update will introduce a new GPS Logger feature. This will use the player's phone or tablet GPS functionality in order to recreate tracks based on daily commutes in the game's Course Maker.</p><p>In the words of Sony's press release:</p><p>\"Drivers will be able to record real GPS data from their own car and then recreate the route as a track in the game. The 'GPS Visualizer' also utilises GPS coordinate data from a real car on the real-life versions of the GT6 circuits. The data can then be imported into GT6 to create a 'virtual' replay image of your laps in the game.\"</p></blockquote><p>That's the sound of a thousand Top Gear fans loosening their shirt collars in flustered excitement.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/steam-machine-prototype-unveiled/0123718\">Steam Machine prototype unveiled | MCV</a></h2><p>Ooh, what will the working version of the  new Valve console look like?</p><blockquote><p>Valve has revealed the prototype design of its upcoming Steam Machine hardware.</p><p>In an <a href=\"http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2022180559_briercolumn04xml.html\">article by the Seattle Times</a> showing off images of the official prototype, Valve designer Greg Coomer reiterated the company's intent to take over the living room with its new hardware -- adding that the PC space's transition to the television set should have taken place years ago.</p><p>\"We think the PC space ought to have been doing this for quite some time,\" Coomer said.</p></blockquote><p>Hey look, it's a big black box!</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://kotaku.com/too-many-choices-of-the-past-gaming-era-werent-choice-1458209319\">Too ​Many Choices Of The Past Gaming Era Weren't Choices At All | Kotaku</a></h2><p>Here's a though-provoking piece from Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton, who argues that most of the current-gen games that appeared to offer moral choices were in fact always manipulating us toward certain outcomes, or not providing us with the tools and systems of a functioning moral universe. He cites Mass Effect:</p><blockquote><p>Imagine: At the end of Return of the Jedi, Darth Vader decides to surprise us all. He stands up behind the Emperor, ready to kill him and save his son Luke Skywalker. Oh, but nope, sorry! He actually can't do that. After a lifetime of evil, Mr. Vader doesn't have the paragon points necessary to do such a thing. He's been evil so long that he can only let his son die, then do whiskey shots with Palpatine while kicking the smoldering corpse.</p><p>That's how the ending of Jedi would've played out in the Mass Effect universe. </p></blockquote><p>I wonder if this will all change in the next generation or if are there inherent game design conventions that limit true moral agency? </p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.pentadact.com/2013-11-04-to-hell-and-back-in-spelunky/\">To Hell And Back In Spelunky | Tom Francis</a></h2><p>To Satre, hell was other people, to Spelunky players, hell is a near-mythical location at the base of this fiendish procedurally generated cavern complex. And games-journalist-turned-developer Tom Francis has found it:</p><blockquote><p>Last night I accomplished probably the hardest thing I've ever managed in a video game: going to hell and back in Spelunky. It only took 41 minutes, but it took me hundreds of hours of play – and about 3,000 deaths – to learn how to do those 41 minutes.</p></blockquote><p>This is a great little blogpost (and video) about a wonderfully rich game and the obsession it has inspired in devotees.</p><p><hr /></p><p>You can follow <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/u:gdngames\">Press Start at Pinboard</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421678094|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|abea02a181db0337eb16c8680bb577abc4a0d76a -->",

I was particularly blown-away by just how well-made the kickstand is; it's crafted from thick aluminum. This enables the tablet to be used as a display for watching video services like Hulu Plus or Netflix. However, the overall package is a cruel joke - beautiful on the outside but horrible on the inside.</p></blockquote><p>Back to work, Mr Kutcher.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57610686-94/android-4.4-gives-apps-vastly-better-web-technology/\">Android 4.4 gives apps vastly better Web technology &gt;&gt; CNET News</a></h2><blockquote><p>Chrome for Android has been available for more than a year, but the improvements it offered over the operating system's more basic browser weren't available to developers who wanted to draw upon the browser's abilities for their own native apps.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>With the KitKat release of Android, Google updated a programming interface called WebView so it now employs Chrome instead of the earlier WebKit-based browser.

That would be good news. Gosney, a password security expert with Stricture Consulting Group, told Ars that of the 130m encrypted passwords, 56m of them are unique. A crack that, in one stroke, unleashed that many plaintext passcodes into the wild would be unprecedented, because a large percentage of people reuse the same or only slightly modified passcode over and over. The biggest single leak to date came in 2009 with the compromise of gaming website RockYou. It forever changed the password-cracking landscape by seeding it with a corpus of 32m passcodes, 14m of which were unique.</p></blockquote><p>Might part of the aim of this attack actually have been to get at this giant corpus of passwords? It seems increasingly likely.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://press.nokia.com/2013/11/04/samsung-extends-the-patent-license-agreement-between-nokia-and-samsung-for-five-years-companies-will-enter-into-binding-arbitration-to-settle-the-amount-of-additional-compensation/\">Samsung extends the patent license agreement between Nokia and Samsung for five years; companies will enter into binding arbitration to settle the amount of additional compensation &gt;&gt; Nokia Press</a></h2><blockquote><p>Nokia announced that Samsung has extended a patent license agreement between Nokia and Samsung for five years. The agreement would have expired at the end of 2013. According to the agreement, Samsung will pay additional compensation to Nokia for the period commencing from January 1, 2014 onwards, and the amount of such compensation shall be finally settled in a binding arbitration which is expected to be concluded during 2015.</p><p>\"This extension and agreement to arbitrate represent a hallmark of constructive resolution of licensing disputes, and are expected to save significant transaction costs for both parties\", said Paul Melin, Chief Intellectual Property Officer of Nokia.</p></blockquote><p>The \"binding arbitration\" phrase makes it pretty clear that these are standards-essential patents (SEPs) which Nokia is licensing. If they weren't, they'd be fighting it out in court. Though of course Samsung now knows how much Apple is paying Nokia for its SEPs, and non-essential patents through the leaking of documents from a court case against Apple.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://getwired.com/2013/11/04/plan-on-profiting-off-of-windows-xp-holdouts-theres-no-gold-left-in-them-thar-hills/\">Plan on profiting off of Windows XP holdouts?

It looks more like a tiny UFO than a fitness tracker, and that’s a good thing for something you are going to wear day in and day out.</p> <p>The outside of the Shine is made of aircraft-grade aluminium, with no buttons or visible display. The top of the device has a ring of embedded LEDs that light up when activated by a double or triple tap on the touch-sensitive metal casing.</p> <p>The lights indicate your progress towards your daily activity challenge, but can also be used to tell the time, lighting up in the hour and minute positions.</p> <p>The Shine is currently available in a dark grey, almost black colour or silver, but will also be available in &quot;champagne&quot; and a light blue topaz colour in the next few months.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f1057207-2fdf-4695-9609-4004b9759b5d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383581386466/f51160d0-5b4e-44a7-a964-2ac17e67ba99-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - sealed back shell makes it waterproof to 50m.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - sealed back shell makes it waterproof to 50m.</figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>Worn almost anywhere on the body</strong></h2> <p>Using the Shine couldn’t be easier. It is one of the most robust fitness trackers out there despite weighing just 9.4g, waterproof to 50m and can be worn almost anywhere on the body.</p> <p>Included in the box is a rubberised plastic bracelet so the Shine can be worn comfortably on the wrist. There's also a magnetic clasp so you can clip it to pretty much any piece of clothing.</p> <p>If you're performing a specific activity, such as running, playing tennis or sleeping, for instance, a triple tap sets the Shine into activity mode for more accurate recording of your motions and exertions.</p> <p>The Shine then syncs with an iPhone or iPad via Bluetooth – place the Shine directly onto the glass of the screen of your phone or tablet, on the spot indicated by the sync circle, and tap down to initiate a sync. The <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id564157241\">iOS app</a> allows you to configure your bespoke activity, update the tracker and review your activity from the past days and weeks, as well as your sleep patterns if you use the Shine to track your sleep at night.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-69680245-f985-438c-8a5a-0bb30f9abbb0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383588798146/92835c09-37c3-409e-ad76-497d16d050fa-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Misfit shine iPhone app screens\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Three screens from the Misfit Shine iPhone app. Photograph: /PR/Misfit</figcaption> </figure> <p>An Android app is currently in the works, and is due to be released before the year is out, but the Shine is currently iPhone-only.</p> <p>During a normal day, the Shine charts different levels of activity, including low, medium and energetic motions like walking during your commute, as well as light and deep sleep, allowing you to see your varying activity throughout the day.</p> <p>One of the best features of the Shine is its ultra low-power requirement. It has a battery life of between four and six months – which far outdoes the average 10-14 battery life of most other trackers – and uses traditional circular watch batteries. That does mean that you have to keep a few of them handy, but two are included in the box and they cost as little as 70p each – a small price to pay for never having to remember to charge your tracker.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c9b3c25d-4a50-4bea-a2e9-326985ff9ecd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383581468507/3c012326-27f0-4027-a793-95f5f6d62470-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - can be worn with its magnetic clasp on almost any piece of clothing.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - can be worn with its magnetic clasp on almost any piece of clothing.</figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>Price</strong></h2> <p>The Misfits Shine costs &pound;100 in the UK. It comes in black or silver, with topaz and Champagne colour variants available in early 2014. For comparison, other fitness trackers like the Fitbit Flex and One cost &pound;80 each, while the Withings Pulse costs &pound;90 and the Jawbone Up &pound;100. Nike’s new Fuelband SE is currently available for pre-order at &pound;129.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fef36f6a-aa10-48ff-8ed7-b8fbcc70076b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383581539490/ec8a2a4f-7f03-4c5b-8c41-194aa94d9877-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - solid metal construction makes it incredibly durable.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - solid metal construction makes it incredibly durable.</figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>Verdict: one of the easiest trackers to live with</strong></h2> <p>The Misfit Shine is one of the easiest fitness trackers to live with. It is light, small and discrete, doesn’t require charging and is both waterproof and hardy. You can easily clip it onto almost any piece of clothing and forget about it, while the wristband is both comfortable and easily fits under a shirt cuff.</p> <p>There's no vibrate function, or screen, but the built-in LED light display and simple double and triple tap interface is an attractive, intuitive compromise.</p> <p>Short of tracking stair climbs, the Shine does what a fitness tracker needs to do with the minimum of fuss, although Android users need not apply; it can only sync with an iPhone or iPad for now. An Android app is in the works - and if it is as well-designed and easy to use as the iPhone app, Android users will be in for a treat.</p> <p>Overall, the Shine isn’t the cheapest fitness tracker out there, nor the most feature-packed, but it is one of the best-designed, most attractive and discrete, which is pretty important for something meant to be worn every day.</p> <p><strong>Star rating: 5/5</strong></p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Attractive, slim and compact design, solid all-metal build quality, waterproof, four to six month battery life, magnetic clasps</p> <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Disposable batteries, iPhone-only (for now), no altitude measurement, no vibrating alert</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421636340|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|6aac2488b93ca9ee052dc824c78d3700d9ec29e2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Google is launching a service that lets consumers pay for live video chats with experts who can provide everything from step-by-step turkey cooking instructions to marriage counselling.</p> <p>The Google Helpouts service, introduced on Monday, features roughly 1,000 partners in fashion, fitness, computers and other topics, available for live, one-on-one video consultations. The video sessions can be as short as a few minutes or can last several hours, depending on the topic, with pricing set by each individual provider.&nbsp;</p> <p>The video consultations represent an expansion of Google's traditional web search service, which for years has answered consumers' questions by pointing people to the most appropriate web page after they enter a search query.</p> <p>However while Google remains the world's biggest internet search engine in the west, consumers are increasingly turning to social networks such as Facebook to get advice and recommendations from their friends about movies, restaurants and other topics.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Most of the world's useful information still resides in people's heads,\" Udi Manber, vice president of engineering at Google said at a small briefing with reporters in San Francisco on Monday. Helpouts \"opens the door to that information as well.\"</p> <p>Manber said that Google will initially provide tight oversight of the Helpouts website, deciding which types of services can be offered on Helpouts - possibly as a measure to prevent it being used for pornography.</p> <p>For providers of medical consultations, Google will conduct background checks to ensure that the provider has valid credentials.</p> <p>In addition to individual experts, large US brands such as cosmetics brand Sephora, dieting company Weight Watchers and translation tuition service Rosetta Stone will also be offering video sessions on the Helpouts service.</p> <p>Google will take 20% of the fee that the providers collect from consumers for the video chats, though Google is initially waiving the transaction fee for providers in the \"Health\" category.</p> <p>Consumers can leave reviews of the different video chat experts and Google will refund consumers who are not satisfied with their video consultation, the company said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421674966|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|83ddedd8cbddc16fd2351a105f1957b53a661041 -->",

        "body":"<p>Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, has attacked the US government for apparently breaking into the connections that link the company's data centres around the world as \"outrageous\" and described other surveillance practices as \"possibly illegal\".</p><p>Speaking at an event in Hong Kong, Schmidt stepped up the company's response to revelations in the Washington Post that the National Security Agency, working with its British counterpart, GCHQ, had broken into fibre optic cables that carry the transfer of data around the world for Google and Yahoo.</p><p>\"It's really outrageous that the National Security Agency was looking between the Google data centers, if that's true,\" Schmidt <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/11/04/googles-schmidt-on-nsa-china-and-north-korea/\">told the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>\"The steps that the organization was willing to do without good judgment to pursue its mission and potentially violate people's privacy, it's not OK.\"</p><p>The comments reflected Silicon Valley's hardening criticism of government snooping amid continued revelations based on documents leaked by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</p><p>Just two months ago,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/eric-schmidt-google-nsa-surveillance\"> Schmidt declined</a> to \"pass judgment\" on the surveillance programmes.</p><p>But last week it was reported that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-reports-nsa-secretly-intercepts-data-links\">NSA intercepted communications</a> links used by Google and Yahoo to move vast amounts of data between overseas data centres.</p><p>On Monday, the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/04/how-we-know-the-nsa-had-access-to-internal-google-and-yahoo-cloud-data/\">published further Snowden documents</a> and additional context for its story. Among the details published in the latest report is the claim the interception took place on \"British territory\".</p><p>It also claimed that none of the statements issued by the NSA since the story was published contained substantive denials. It said the source documents showed the NSA, rather than break directly into Google or Yahoo data centres, intercepted communication between them that ran on private fibre optic cable circuits. The former is known as \"data at rest\", the latter as \"data on the fly\".</p><p>It was clear spies broke into both companies' private \"clouds\", or internal networks, said the report, because some of the extracted data existed nowhere else.</p><p>It remained unclear how the NSA did this, and whether it had help from inside the technology giants.</p><p>Asked if it had launched an internal security review, Google on Monday reissued a statement given last week from chief legal officer David Drummond, saying the company did not give access to its systems to any government and that it was expanding encryption across more Google services and links.</p><p>In his interview, Schmidt said Google had lodged complaints with the NSA, the White House and members of Congress. He also attacked the separate NSA program that sweeps up the telephone metadata relating millions of Americans. \"The NSA allegedly collected the phone records of 320 million people in order to identify roughly 300 people who might be a risk. It's just bad public policy … and perhaps illegal,\" he said.</p><p>Google itself has faced repeated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/19/google-privacy-laws-uk-lawsuit\">accusations of privacy violations</a>, including illicitly tracking web browsing. </p><p>Schmidt has made no secret that the company tests boundaries of what is acceptable. \"Google policy is to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it,\" he said in 2010.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/germany-edward-snowden-asylum\">Outcries in Europe </a>and growing momentum in Washington to rein in surveillance has put the NSA on the defensive.</p><p>Asked to respond to Schmidt's criticism, an NSA spokesperson said the agency was \"focused on valid foreign intelligence targets\" and referred to a previous statement that press articles had misstated facts and mischaracterised NSA activities.</p><p>\"NSA conducts all of its activities in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies – and assertions to the contrary do a grave disservice to the nation, its allies and partners, and the men and women who make up the National Security Agency.\"</p><p>Last week the agency's director, General Keith Alexander, said the agency had not used a presidential order to circumvent domestic legal restrictions: \"I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers. We go through a court order.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421648807|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|379492eabae820962f1227f5dd1f70bd4ed09aec -->",

        "headline":"BlackBerry fires CEO Thorsten Heins as $4.7bn Fairfax rescue bid collapses",
        "body":"<p>Struggling smartphone maker BlackBerry has fired its chief executive and abandoned a $4.7bn (£3bn) rescue bid from its largest shareholder as it turned to a $1bn fundraising plan in a battle to stay afloat.</p><p>Thorsten Heins, brought in to run the company in January 2012, will leave with a $22m payoff, and be replaced by John Chen, a seasoned technology industry executive. The surprise move by BlackBerry indicates that it has failed to find a buyer for the company after a six week process in which it has discussed deals with industry powerhouses including Google, Cisco and Facebook.</p><p>The company said it will raise $1bn in convertible bonds instead of pursuing a deal with Fairfax Financial, its 10% shareholder. Fairfax, whose ability to raise the financing for its $4.7bn bid was widely questioned, has pledged to buy $250m worth of the bonds.</p><p>The company, which has endured a rapid fall from grace, did not say why it was trying to raise the extra money amid predictions that it will burn through its $2bn cash pile within 18 months. Its last quarterly results showed revenues and handset sales plunging and it is trying to cut costs by firing almost a quarter of its staff. BlackBerry controlled close to 50% of the handset market in the US in 2009 but its share now stands at less than 3% after it buckled under competition from Apple and Samsung.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421643557'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383586583276/BlackBerry_Sales_WEB.png' alt='BlackBerry sales' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>BlackBerry handset sales: units shipped per year</figcaption></figure><p>\"This does look like panic stations,\" said Neil Mawston, executive director at the research company Strategy Analytics. \"The trouble is that when a company's in that downward spiral, nobody wants to catch a falling knife – so operators don't want to work with them, and retailers don't want the stock.\"</p><p>BlackBerry's chairwoman, Barbara Stymiest, thanked Heins for his \"significant accomplishments\" at the company he joined in 2007. His interim replacement Chen is an adviser to Silver Lake, the private equity group that played a leading role in the recent buyout of Dell. In an interview with Reuters, Chen said he had no plans to shut down the company's handset business, thought to be a significant loss maker.</p><p>\"I know we have enough ingredients to build a long-term sustainable business. I have done this before and seen the same movie before,\" he said. \"BlackBerry is an iconic brand with enormous potential – but it's going to take time, discipline and tough decisions to reclaim our success.\"</p><p>BlackBerry shares plunged by 13% to $6.79, from $7.70 before the market opened, far below the $9 per share that Fairfax was attempting to offer ahead of Monday's bid deadline.</p><p>There are growing expectations that the handset business will be severely cut back after market failure of the new BB10 handsets. \"BlackBerry needs to use the new cash infusion to change its market approach [to one] where saving the devices business is not the main priority,\" said Carolina Milanesi of the research group Gartner, which recently advised business clients using BlackBerry to examine alternatives. The new unsecured funding will be in the form of debentures, convertible into BlackBerry shares priced at $10, a premium of 28.7% to Friday's closing price, within seven years.</p><p>But analysts remained sceptical about the future of the firm formerly known as Research in Motion. \"If you wouldn't lend money to buy BlackBerry, why would you lend money to BlackBerry?\" queried Benedict Evans, of Enders Analysis.</p><p>BlackBerry was believed to have held talks with a number of companies while Fairfax said it was working on its bid. The bid was announced on 23 September, just after the company had announced disastrous results with a second quarter loss of $965m – largely due to a $934m writeoff on unsold Z10 handsets – on revenues of just $1.6bn.</p><p>Among the companies which BlackBerry is understood to have spoken to about a buyout are Google, Cisco, SAP and China's Lenovo. But no bids materialised to challenge the putative one from Fairfax – that itself failed to materialise.</p><p>\"Looks like nobody was interested in buying BlackBerry outright,\" commented Avi Greengart, research director at Current Analytics. \"The announcement does not even hint at what BlackBerry does next.\"</p><p>Having concluded a strategic review with Monday's short statement, BlackBerry must now rely on the $1bn fundraising and its own finances, having seen former arch-rival Nokia capitulate this year with the sale of its handset business to Microsoft. BlackBerry says it has taken measures to cut costs – but equally could see increasing pressure on margins if its business continues to decline.</p><p>The company's cash position could also be hit if suppliers begin demanding payments on shorter terms, which would mean paying cash for components before they can be sold as finished items. One major supplier, Jabil, warned in September that it might stop building parts for the company, which could completely kill off the handset business.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421642880|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|6b4d631d69cd554fb6fe20c40ef407971198d356 -->",

        "headline":"Twitter claims $13.6bn market valuation as tech rivals take aim",
        "body":"<p>Twitter, after canvassing professional investors for a week on how much they would be willing to pay for its shares, raised the asking price of its stock by 25% on Monday.</p> <p>The company said it would value its IPO at between $23 and $25 a share, up from the&nbsp;$17 to $20 range, indicating that it was a popular potential investment. Traditionally, however, the banks advising companies on their public debuts start out with a modest asking price, in the hopes that investors will prove willing to pay more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter also stopped selling its shares a day early, according to a news report by Reuters. It's common for companies to keep order books open for investors until the day before the IPO, but Twitter plans to close the books on Tuesday at noon, Reuters said. In the traditional signals of Wall Street, that move could be interpreted in two ways: it could indicate either high demand for the shares or that investors are tapped out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter, which plans to list its shares for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, can now claim a market value of $13.6bn before its shares have even started trading. The company could raise as much as $1.4bn in the offering.&nbsp;</p> <p>MKM Partners, a research firm for professional investors, said Twitter will be in the competitive \"elite\" of tech companies by its market value.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"We look at a [comparison] group including Facebook, LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Yelp and Zillow,\" MKM analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a client note late last week. \"These companies are regarded as 'category killers', each with very strong operating momentum, disruptive characteristics and open-ended opportunities.\"</p> <p>That doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing ahead, however. Twitter is facing business challenges from rivals as well as skepticism from investors burned by the Facebook IPO.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter is not seen as a good investment by nearly half of active investors, according to<a href=\"http://marketingland.com/poll-public-skeptical-about-twitter-ipo-63942\"> a new CNBC-AP poll out Monday</a>.</p> <p>\"That sentiment is stronger from higher-income respondents; some 56% of those with incomes of $75,000 a year have doubts about its investment prospects,\" <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101165620\">CNBC wrote</a>.</p> <p>In addition, as Twitter's profile rises, rivals are taking aim at its business prospects. \"We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow,\" the company said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter revealed on Monday, for instance, that <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312513424297/d564001dfwp.htm\">tech giant IBM has claimed that Twitter has violated three of its patents</a>. The patents involve the presentation of advertising and the process of searching for user contacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>By striking at Twitter's advertising plans, IBM is striking at the company's heart. Twitter gained&nbsp;85% of its revenue from advertising in 2012, and an even higher percentage &ndash; 89% &ndash; in the first nine months of this year. \"We generate substantially all of our advertising revenue through the sale of our three promoted products: promoted Tweets, promoted accounts and promoted trends.\"</p> <p>Twitter said IBM was not suing, however, and only inviting a negotiation. In its public filing, Twitter said \"we believe we have meritorious defenses,\" although it also said \"there can be no assurance that we will be successful\" in resolving the dispute.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421639031|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|14ea7624f9f5c53f00c7777bb180a6578f076d00 -->",

        "headline":"Google chairman: NSA spying on our data centres 'outrageous'",
        "body":"<p>Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, has attacked the US government for apparently breaking into the connections that link the company's data centres around the world as \"outrageous\" and described other surveillance practices as \"possibly illegal\".</p><p>Speaking at an event in Hong Kong, Schmidt stepped up the company's response to revelations in the Washington Post that the National Security Agency, working with its British counterpart, GCHQ, had broken into fibre optic cables that carry the transfer of data around the world for Google and Yahoo.</p><p>\"It's really outrageous that the National Security Agency was looking between the Google data centers, if that's true,\" Schmidt <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/11/04/googles-schmidt-on-nsa-china-and-north-korea/\">told the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><p>\"The steps that the organization was willing to do without good judgment to pursue its mission and potentially violate people's privacy, it's not OK.\"</p><p>The comments reflected Silicon Valley's hardening criticism of government snooping amid continued revelations based on documents leaked by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</p><p>Just two months ago,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/eric-schmidt-google-nsa-surveillance\"> Schmidt declined</a> to \"pass judgment\" on the surveillance programmes.</p><p>But last week it was reported that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-reports-nsa-secretly-intercepts-data-links\">NSA intercepted communications</a> links used by Google and Yahoo to move vast amounts of data between overseas data centres.</p><p>On Monday, the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/04/how-we-know-the-nsa-had-access-to-internal-google-and-yahoo-cloud-data/\">published further Snowden documents</a> and additional context for its story. Among the details published in the latest report is the claim the interception took place on \"British territory\".</p><p>It also claimed that none of the statements issued by the NSA since the story was published contained substantive denials. It said the source documents showed the NSA, rather than break directly into Google or Yahoo data centres, intercepted communication between them that ran on private fibre optic cable circuits. The former is known as \"data at rest\", the latter as \"data on the fly\".</p><p>It was clear spies broke into both companies' private \"clouds\", or internal networks, said the report, because some of the extracted data existed nowhere else.</p><p>It remained unclear how the NSA did this, and whether it had help from inside the technology giants.</p><p>Asked if it had launched an internal security review, Google on Monday reissued a statement given last week from chief legal officer David Drummond, saying the company did not give access to its systems to any government and that it was expanding encryption across more Google services and links.</p><p>In his interview, Schmidt said Google had lodged complaints with the NSA, the White House and members of Congress. He also attacked the separate NSA program that sweeps up the telephone metadata relating millions of Americans. \"The NSA allegedly collected the phone records of 320 million people in order to identify roughly 300 people who might be a risk. It's just bad public policy … and perhaps illegal,\" he said.</p><p>Google itself has faced repeated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/19/google-privacy-laws-uk-lawsuit\">accusations of privacy violations</a>, including illicitly tracking web browsing. </p><p>Schmidt has made no secret that the company tests boundaries of what is acceptable. \"Google policy is to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it,\" he said in 2010.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/germany-edward-snowden-asylum\">Outcries in Europe </a>and growing momentum in Washington to rein in surveillance has put the NSA on the defensive.</p><p>Asked to respond to Schmidt's criticism, an NSA spokesperson said the agency was \"focused on valid foreign intelligence targets\" and referred to a previous statement that press articles had misstated facts and mischaracterised NSA activities.</p><p>\"NSA conducts all of its activities in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies – and assertions to the contrary do a grave disservice to the nation, its allies and partners, and the men and women who make up the National Security Agency.\"</p><p>Last week the agency's director, General Keith Alexander, said the agency had not used a presidential order to circumvent domestic legal restrictions: \"I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers. We go through a court order.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421648807|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|379492eabae820962f1227f5dd1f70bd4ed09aec -->",

It revealed that, while Bezos himself wasn't interviewed for Stone's book, the company did co-operate with its author.</p> <p>\"Over the course of the author&rsquo;s reporting,&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;facilitated meetings for him with&nbsp;more than&nbsp;half a dozen senior&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/\" data-skimwords-id=\"1974447\" data-skimwords-word=\"amazon\" data-group-id=\"0\" data-skim-creative=\"300001\" data-skim-product=\"1974447\">Amazon</a>&nbsp;executives, during which he had every opportunity to inquire about or fact-check&nbsp;claims made by former employees. He chose not to,\" claimed Amazon's spokesperson Craig Berman.</p> <p>\"I met in person with him on at least three occasions and exchanged dozens of emails where he only checked a few specific quotes. He had every opportunity to thoroughly fact-check and bring a more balanced viewpoint to his&nbsp;narrative, but he was very secretive about the book and simply chose not to.\"</p> <h2>Author denies bias</h2> <p>Stone has defended his book, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-wife-reviews-book-on-amazon-2013-11\">telling Business Insider</a> that he interviewed 300 people for the biography, including current and past executives, promising to correct any mistakes for future editions, and defending his claims to know what Bezos was thinking at various points in Amazon's history.</p> <p>\"Narrative non-fiction demands that authors get as close to their characters as possible. I didn't invent those rules,\" said Stone.</p> <p>\"She's accusing me of bias or a hidden perspective. I tried to endeavor to have a balanced view. I didn't have any hidden bias, but I'm certainly less biased than Jeff's wife when it comes to an account of&nbsp;the&nbsp;company's&nbsp;history.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421677249|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|0fe8413bc1a8d4d7daeec938a19d3ca75a9df041 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Where and why is my face being scanned, and who is doing it?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Tesco has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/03/privacy-tesco-scan-customers-faces\">announced</a> that it will begin using a face-scanning technology in all of its 450 petrol stations in the UK that can determine your gender and approximate age (child, young adult, adult, senior adult) while you wait in a line to pay. That information will be used to show relevant adverts in a screen visible from the line.</p> <p><strong>Q: Who's behind this technology?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Amscreen - run by Simon Sugar, son of Lord Sir Alan Sugar, of Am-company fame - has licensed the technology from a French company called Quividi, which developed the face detection software.</p> <p><strong>Q: So it's not a British innovation?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The advertising part is: Amscreen says its \"real-time digital network\" will \"deliver engaging and dynamic content to a weekly audience of over five million adults.\" (The demonstration picture shows a middle-aged man being confronted with an advert for Sky.) It's part of Amscreen's \"<a href=\"http://www.amscreen.eu/en/optimeyes-real-time-insight-for-digital-media-advertising\">Optimeyes</a>\"&nbsp;system which uses 6,000 screens around petrol forecourts, health clubs, shops and airports: \"the rollout of this technology represents the largest of its kind anywhere in the world.\"</p> <p>The face detection, though, comes from Quividi, based in Paris. It set up in 2006, and has clients including Coca-Cola and Plan, which used its technique earlier this year in the UK for bus adverts which showed different</p> <p><strong>Q: Doesn't this invade my privacy? I don't want to be recorded when I visit a petrol station</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> \"We don't do facial recognition, we do face detection,\" Ke Quang, chief operating officer of Quividi, told the Guardian on Monday. \"It's software which works from the video feed coming off the camera. It can detect if it's seeing a face, but it never records the image or biomorphological information or traits. It picks up if it's seeing a man or a woman, the amount of time they pay attention to the screen, and their presence in front of the screen. The key thing though is that it never records or remembers any information. If you go from one camera in one location to another, it can't tell.\"</p> <p><strong>Q: What's the point of it?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> To show you more adverts when you might otherwise not be looking at adverts.</p> <p><strong>Q: How accurate is the face detection system?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Pretty good when it comes to telling men from women - unless you wear a baseball cap. Quividi <a href=\"http://www.quividi.com/blog/index.php/2012/how-precise-is-quividis-gender-classification/\">has a study on its site</a>&nbsp;carried out by an independent company in the US: from a sample of 856 people, of whom 72% were men, it was 95% accurate in spotting men, and 87% for women. The score with women was lower because nearly a fifth of them were wearing baseball caps. If you exclude them, it hit 92% accuracy in spotting women. There's no way that's chance.</p> <p><strong>Q: How exactly does the facial detection work?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Quang wouldn't explain - \"that's our secret sauce\" - but it's long been known that there are key differences between male and female faces, relating to width of forehead, ratio of facial height to width, and so on. Quividi apparently recognises faces and then carries out this calculation very rapidly, adding in details about age.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is this the first time this has been used in the UK?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> No - in February 2012 the charity Plan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/feb/24/ad-sorts-girls-from-boys\">used it for adverts on bus shelters</a>: if the person looking at the screen was male, they saw details of Plan's website; if they were female, they saw a video campaign in which three girls talked about their lives.</p> <p><strong>Q: Where else is this used?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> In quite a few locations around the world, judging by Quividi's site: it shows customers in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. It claims to be used in 2,500 locations in 35 countries.</p> <p><strong>Q: How do I beat it?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Wear a baseball cap or other hat that covers your eyes and forehead; don't look at the screen showing the ads; and try using the \"Pay at Pump\" option so you don't have to go inside the petrol station shop.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421632877|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|1c295d6814f5040aae8f82cd5b43bf23c01d4106 -->",

        "body":"<p>Google is launching a service that lets consumers pay for live video chats with experts who can provide everything from step-by-step turkey cooking instructions to marriage counselling.</p> <p>The Google Helpouts service, introduced on Monday, features roughly 1,000 partners in fashion, fitness, computers and other topics, available for live, one-on-one video consultations. The video sessions can be as short as a few minutes or can last several hours, depending on the topic, with pricing set by each individual provider.&nbsp;</p> <p>The video consultations represent an expansion of Google's traditional web search service, which for years has answered consumers' questions by pointing people to the most appropriate web page after they enter a search query.</p> <p>However while Google remains the world's biggest internet search engine in the west, consumers are increasingly turning to social networks such as Facebook to get advice and recommendations from their friends about movies, restaurants and other topics.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Most of the world's useful information still resides in people's heads,\" Udi Manber, vice president of engineering at Google said at a small briefing with reporters in San Francisco on Monday. Helpouts \"opens the door to that information as well.\"</p> <p>Manber said that Google will initially provide tight oversight of the Helpouts website, deciding which types of services can be offered on Helpouts - possibly as a measure to prevent it being used for pornography.</p> <p>For providers of medical consultations, Google will conduct background checks to ensure that the provider has valid credentials.</p> <p>In addition to individual experts, large US brands such as cosmetics brand Sephora, dieting company Weight Watchers and translation tuition service Rosetta Stone will also be offering video sessions on the Helpouts service.</p> <p>Google will take 20% of the fee that the providers collect from consumers for the video chats, though Google is initially waiving the transaction fee for providers in the \"Health\" category.</p> <p>Consumers can leave reviews of the different video chat experts and Google will refund consumers who are not satisfied with their video consultation, the company said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421674966|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|83ddedd8cbddc16fd2351a105f1957b53a661041 -->",

        "headline":"Twitter claims $13.6bn market valuation as tech rivals take aim",
        "body":"<p>Twitter, after canvassing professional investors for a week on how much they would be willing to pay for its shares, raised the asking price of its stock by 25% on Monday.</p> <p>The company said it would value its IPO at between $23 and $25 a share, up from the&nbsp;$17 to $20 range, indicating that it was a popular potential investment. Traditionally, however, the banks advising companies on their public debuts start out with a modest asking price, in the hopes that investors will prove willing to pay more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter also stopped selling its shares a day early, according to a news report by Reuters. It's common for companies to keep order books open for investors until the day before the IPO, but Twitter plans to close the books on Tuesday at noon, Reuters said. In the traditional signals of Wall Street, that move could be interpreted in two ways: it could indicate either high demand for the shares or that investors are tapped out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter, which plans to list its shares for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, can now claim a market value of $13.6bn before its shares have even started trading. The company could raise as much as $1.4bn in the offering.&nbsp;</p> <p>MKM Partners, a research firm for professional investors, said Twitter will be in the competitive \"elite\" of tech companies by its market value.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"We look at a [comparison] group including Facebook, LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Yelp and Zillow,\" MKM analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a client note late last week. \"These companies are regarded as 'category killers', each with very strong operating momentum, disruptive characteristics and open-ended opportunities.\"</p> <p>That doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing ahead, however. Twitter is facing business challenges from rivals as well as skepticism from investors burned by the Facebook IPO.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter is not seen as a good investment by nearly half of active investors, according to<a href=\"http://marketingland.com/poll-public-skeptical-about-twitter-ipo-63942\"> a new CNBC-AP poll out Monday</a>.</p> <p>\"That sentiment is stronger from higher-income respondents; some 56% of those with incomes of $75,000 a year have doubts about its investment prospects,\" <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101165620\">CNBC wrote</a>.</p> <p>In addition, as Twitter's profile rises, rivals are taking aim at its business prospects. \"We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow,\" the company said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter revealed on Monday, for instance, that <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312513424297/d564001dfwp.htm\">tech giant IBM has claimed that Twitter has violated three of its patents</a>. The patents involve the presentation of advertising and the process of searching for user contacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>By striking at Twitter's advertising plans, IBM is striking at the company's heart. Twitter gained&nbsp;85% of its revenue from advertising in 2012, and an even higher percentage &ndash; 89% &ndash; in the first nine months of this year. \"We generate substantially all of our advertising revenue through the sale of our three promoted products: promoted Tweets, promoted accounts and promoted trends.\"</p> <p>Twitter said IBM was not suing, however, and only inviting a negotiation. In its public filing, Twitter said \"we believe we have meritorious defenses,\" although it also said \"there can be no assurance that we will be successful\" in resolving the dispute.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421639031|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|14ea7624f9f5c53f00c7777bb180a6578f076d00 -->",

        "headline":"BlackBerry fires CEO Thorsten Heins as $4.7bn Fairfax rescue bid collapses",
        "body":"<p>Struggling smartphone maker BlackBerry has fired its chief executive and abandoned a $4.7bn (£3bn) rescue bid from its largest shareholder as it turned to a $1bn fundraising plan in a battle to stay afloat.</p><p>Thorsten Heins, brought in to run the company in January 2012, will leave with a $22m payoff, and be replaced by John Chen, a seasoned technology industry executive. The surprise move by BlackBerry indicates that it has failed to find a buyer for the company after a six week process in which it has discussed deals with industry powerhouses including Google, Cisco and Facebook.</p><p>The company said it will raise $1bn in convertible bonds instead of pursuing a deal with Fairfax Financial, its 10% shareholder. Fairfax, whose ability to raise the financing for its $4.7bn bid was widely questioned, has pledged to buy $250m worth of the bonds.</p><p>The company, which has endured a rapid fall from grace, did not say why it was trying to raise the extra money amid predictions that it will burn through its $2bn cash pile within 18 months. Its last quarterly results showed revenues and handset sales plunging and it is trying to cut costs by firing almost a quarter of its staff. BlackBerry controlled close to 50% of the handset market in the US in 2009 but its share now stands at less than 3% after it buckled under competition from Apple and Samsung.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421643557'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383586583276/BlackBerry_Sales_WEB.png' alt='BlackBerry sales' width='460' height='277' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>BlackBerry handset sales: units shipped per year</figcaption></figure><p>\"This does look like panic stations,\" said Neil Mawston, executive director at the research company Strategy Analytics. \"The trouble is that when a company's in that downward spiral, nobody wants to catch a falling knife – so operators don't want to work with them, and retailers don't want the stock.\"</p><p>BlackBerry's chairwoman, Barbara Stymiest, thanked Heins for his \"significant accomplishments\" at the company he joined in 2007. His interim replacement Chen is an adviser to Silver Lake, the private equity group that played a leading role in the recent buyout of Dell. In an interview with Reuters, Chen said he had no plans to shut down the company's handset business, thought to be a significant loss maker.</p><p>\"I know we have enough ingredients to build a long-term sustainable business. I have done this before and seen the same movie before,\" he said. \"BlackBerry is an iconic brand with enormous potential – but it's going to take time, discipline and tough decisions to reclaim our success.\"</p><p>BlackBerry shares plunged by 13% to $6.79, from $7.70 before the market opened, far below the $9 per share that Fairfax was attempting to offer ahead of Monday's bid deadline.</p><p>There are growing expectations that the handset business will be severely cut back after market failure of the new BB10 handsets. \"BlackBerry needs to use the new cash infusion to change its market approach [to one] where saving the devices business is not the main priority,\" said Carolina Milanesi of the research group Gartner, which recently advised business clients using BlackBerry to examine alternatives. The new unsecured funding will be in the form of debentures, convertible into BlackBerry shares priced at $10, a premium of 28.7% to Friday's closing price, within seven years.</p><p>But analysts remained sceptical about the future of the firm formerly known as Research in Motion. \"If you wouldn't lend money to buy BlackBerry, why would you lend money to BlackBerry?\" queried Benedict Evans, of Enders Analysis.</p><p>BlackBerry was believed to have held talks with a number of companies while Fairfax said it was working on its bid. The bid was announced on 23 September, just after the company had announced disastrous results with a second quarter loss of $965m – largely due to a $934m writeoff on unsold Z10 handsets – on revenues of just $1.6bn.</p><p>Among the companies which BlackBerry is understood to have spoken to about a buyout are Google, Cisco, SAP and China's Lenovo. But no bids materialised to challenge the putative one from Fairfax – that itself failed to materialise.</p><p>\"Looks like nobody was interested in buying BlackBerry outright,\" commented Avi Greengart, research director at Current Analytics. \"The announcement does not even hint at what BlackBerry does next.\"</p><p>Having concluded a strategic review with Monday's short statement, BlackBerry must now rely on the $1bn fundraising and its own finances, having seen former arch-rival Nokia capitulate this year with the sale of its handset business to Microsoft. BlackBerry says it has taken measures to cut costs – but equally could see increasing pressure on margins if its business continues to decline.</p><p>The company's cash position could also be hit if suppliers begin demanding payments on shorter terms, which would mean paying cash for components before they can be sold as finished items. One major supplier, Jabil, warned in September that it might stop building parts for the company, which could completely kill off the handset business.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421642880|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|6b4d631d69cd554fb6fe20c40ef407971198d356 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Misfit Shine is a small, attractive all-metal fitness tracker that is easy to live with and effortlessly&nbsp;does what it needs to do.</p> <p>The first product from a company that counts John Sculley, former Apple CEO, as a co-founder, the Shine was successfully funded on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo, before going on general sale in November in the UK.</p> <p>The name, Misfit Wearables, was chosen because the company happened to be founded on the day of Steve Jobs' death, with “misfit” being a tribute to one of Apple’s signature adverts, “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different#Text\">Here’s to the crazy ones</a>”.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fe6e1031-a1a4-4ab0-b1f9-ec66f3d6aed5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383581225535/30bb0885-d056-4e43-abe5-a87029f71a89-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - wearable on the wrist using the sportband\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - wearable on the wrist using the sportband</figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>Designed like jewellery</strong></h2> <p>The Misfit Shine is arguably the best looking fitness tracker out there. It looks more like a tiny UFO than a fitness tracker, and that’s a good thing for something you are going to wear day in and day out.</p> <p>The outside of the Shine is made of aircraft-grade aluminium, with no buttons or visible display. The top of the device has a ring of embedded LEDs that light up when activated by a double or triple tap on the touch-sensitive metal casing.</p> <p>The lights indicate your progress towards your daily activity challenge, but can also be used to tell the time, lighting up in the hour and minute positions.</p> <p>The Shine is currently available in a dark grey, almost black colour or silver, but will also be available in &quot;champagne&quot; and a light blue topaz colour in the next few months.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f1057207-2fdf-4695-9609-4004b9759b5d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383581386466/f51160d0-5b4e-44a7-a964-2ac17e67ba99-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - sealed back shell makes it waterproof to 50m.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - sealed back shell makes it waterproof to 50m.</figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>Worn almost anywhere on the body</strong></h2> <p>Using the Shine couldn’t be easier. It is one of the most robust fitness trackers out there despite weighing just 9.4g, waterproof to 50m and can be worn almost anywhere on the body.</p> <p>Included in the box is a rubberised plastic bracelet so the Shine can be worn comfortably on the wrist. There's also a magnetic clasp so you can clip it to pretty much any piece of clothing.</p> <p>If you're performing a specific activity, such as running, playing tennis or sleeping, for instance, a triple tap sets the Shine into activity mode for more accurate recording of your motions and exertions.</p> <p>The Shine then syncs with an iPhone or iPad via Bluetooth – place the Shine directly onto the glass of the screen of your phone or tablet, on the spot indicated by the sync circle, and tap down to initiate a sync. The <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id564157241\">iOS app</a> allows you to configure your bespoke activity, update the tracker and review your activity from the past days and weeks, as well as your sleep patterns if you use the Shine to track your sleep at night.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-69680245-f985-438c-8a5a-0bb30f9abbb0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383588798146/92835c09-37c3-409e-ad76-497d16d050fa-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Misfit shine iPhone app screens\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Three screens from the Misfit Shine iPhone app. Photograph: /PR/Misfit</figcaption> </figure> <p>An Android app is currently in the works, and is due to be released before the year is out, but the Shine is currently iPhone-only.</p> <p>During a normal day, the Shine charts different levels of activity, including low, medium and energetic motions like walking during your commute, as well as light and deep sleep, allowing you to see your varying activity throughout the day.</p> <p>One of the best features of the Shine is its ultra low-power requirement. It has a battery life of between four and six months – which far outdoes the average 10-14 battery life of most other trackers – and uses traditional circular watch batteries. That does mean that you have to keep a few of them handy, but two are included in the box and they cost as little as 70p each – a small price to pay for never having to remember to charge your tracker.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c9b3c25d-4a50-4bea-a2e9-326985ff9ecd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383581468507/3c012326-27f0-4027-a793-95f5f6d62470-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - can be worn with its magnetic clasp on almost any piece of clothing.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - can be worn with its magnetic clasp on almost any piece of clothing.</figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>Price</strong></h2> <p>The Misfits Shine costs &pound;100 in the UK. It comes in black or silver, with topaz and Champagne colour variants available in early 2014. For comparison, other fitness trackers like the Fitbit Flex and One cost &pound;80 each, while the Withings Pulse costs &pound;90 and the Jawbone Up &pound;100. Nike’s new Fuelband SE is currently available for pre-order at &pound;129.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fef36f6a-aa10-48ff-8ed7-b8fbcc70076b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383581539490/ec8a2a4f-7f03-4c5b-8c41-194aa94d9877-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - solid metal construction makes it incredibly durable.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Misfit Shine fitness tracker review - solid metal construction makes it incredibly durable.</figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>Verdict: one of the easiest trackers to live with</strong></h2> <p>The Misfit Shine is one of the easiest fitness trackers to live with. It is light, small and discrete, doesn’t require charging and is both waterproof and hardy. You can easily clip it onto almost any piece of clothing and forget about it, while the wristband is both comfortable and easily fits under a shirt cuff.</p> <p>There's no vibrate function, or screen, but the built-in LED light display and simple double and triple tap interface is an attractive, intuitive compromise.</p> <p>Short of tracking stair climbs, the Shine does what a fitness tracker needs to do with the minimum of fuss, although Android users need not apply; it can only sync with an iPhone or iPad for now. An Android app is in the works - and if it is as well-designed and easy to use as the iPhone app, Android users will be in for a treat.</p> <p>Overall, the Shine isn’t the cheapest fitness tracker out there, nor the most feature-packed, but it is one of the best-designed, most attractive and discrete, which is pretty important for something meant to be worn every day.</p> <p><strong>Star rating: 5/5</strong></p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Attractive, slim and compact design, solid all-metal build quality, waterproof, four to six month battery life, magnetic clasps</p> <p><strong>Cons: </strong>Disposable batteries, iPhone-only (for now), no altitude measurement, no vibrating alert</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421636340|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|6aac2488b93ca9ee052dc824c78d3700d9ec29e2 -->",

        "headline":"GTA Online 'stimulus package' to drop this week",
        "body":"<p>Rockstar is finally preparing to gift $500,000 of virtual cash to every player of its GTA Online mode – a promise the company made on 14 October, but has so far been unable to deliver. <a href=\"http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51636/grand-theft-auto-online-update.html\" title=\"\">An online update issued on Friday</a> informed gamers that another update to the online multiplayer servicer, which is free to owners of Grand Theft Auto 5, will be made available for download early this week. The money will then be dropped into the accounts of players, in two equal payments of $250,000, a few days later.</p><p></p><p>There's a condition, however: the package will only be provided to veterans who played GTA Online during its shaky debut month. Launched on 2 October, the ambitious online option, which allows players to compete for cash and experience points on the streets of Los Santos, has been beset by server breakdowns as well as data loss problems. Thousands complained of losing characters and money as Rockstar engineers fought to cope with the demand of several million players hitting its online infrastructure simultaneously. Several downloadable updates have followed, some to solve technical issues, other to prevent wily players from exploiting glitches in the game to make easy money.</p><p></p><p>The continuing problems with data loss, as well as ongoing attempts to balance the in-game economy, are almost certainly behind the delay in issuing the $500,000 payout. Players have seen several major changes to the financial system over the past few weeks including a large reduction in the cost of being killed in the game's open-world \"free\" mode, but also a reduction in the amount that can be made from repeatedly beating the same money-making missions.</p><p></p><p>Away from money woes, the publisher is promising a range of new content for the GTA Online game mode in order to maintain interest. The free \"Beach Bum\" downloadable content pack, due in \"early November\", adds new beach-themed vehicles and clothes as well as extra races and Gang Attack, Survival and Last Team Standing jobs. A content creator mode is also due, allowing players to create their own customised races and death matches, with the best featured on the Rockstar site. The company has also announced a series of Grand Theft Auto Online Social Club Event weekends, with special bonuses, rewards and limited edition crate drops into the online city.</p><p></p><p>More intriguingly, Rockstar assures us this will be the week we find out about the new Heists, which are set to bring more in-depth cooperative missions to the online offering. A Capture The Flag mode is also imminent. The publisher's mailout ends with yet another seductive promise: \"We will also have initial details on more additional content coming for both Story Mode and GTA Online in the next few weeks.\"</p><p></p><p>For now, though, many GTA Online players have just one demand for Rockstar: show me the money.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421606575|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|f03c4ccb3a1762f1f1fcb48c5d1fd2c88899f00d -->",

In contrast, the HDMIPi can currently be purchased for a &pound;75 pledge <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/697708033/hdmipi-affordable-9-high-def-screen-for-the-raspbe\">supporting the Kickstarter project</a>.</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi can be purchased from around &pound;30 and is capable of running Linux as well as other software, and can be used for anything from learning to programme to turning your TV into a smart TV with media playing software like Plex or XBMC.</p> <p><strong>• In November, Kickstarter UK celebrated its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/04/kickstarter-crowdfunding-uk-projects-success\">one year anniversary</a>&nbsp;generating more than &pound;22.5m in funding for successful projects</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421626269|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|615b75e8be65464e4fa391d1d2f2f86e6ad62fe3 -->",

We didn't have any firm expectations, we just simply hoped that it would work – and so far, so good.\"</p><p>Kickstarter allows anyone to be a philanthropist, music to the ears of the government, which has made encouraging greater philanthropy one of its central arts policies.</p><p>The closest analogy, said Strickler, would be Medici-like patronage or the subscription models of the 17th and 18th centuries, \"but then you had to be rich or the pope to participate and now everyone can, which is pretty radical\".</p><p>By far the most popular category for pledgers is film and video, accounting for 25%. That is followed by publishing (13%), games (13%), music (11%), art (9%), design (7%), down to dance at 1%.</p><p>The UK's most prolific backer of projects – a stunning 276, pledging everything from £1 to £200 – is <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1491463476\" title=\"\">David Wardrop</a>, a 28-year-old parks worker from Glasgow. He said: \"It's the diversity of all the projects that is something special and it is good to be part of something. A lot of it is different from the mainstream.\"</p><p>Among successful Kickstarter projects in the UK are one to publish an anthology of <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/98074079/waverton-writes?ref=live\" title=\"\">original writing by the residents of Waverton, a small Cheshire village</a>; Sixteen, <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/382223528/sixteen-a-new-british-feature-film?ref=\" title=\"\">a film about a former African child soldier living in the UK, which premiered at the London film festival</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1330406716/lets-build-nana-a-home\" title=\"\">Nana, a community comfort food cafe staffed by retired women with time on their hands.</a></p><p>This month Kickstarter will open to Australian projects and will develop further, said Strickler.</p><p>\"We always believed very strongly in this, but it is amazing to see how far it has gone and we do feel that this is just the beginning – this is just scratching the surface. We're still figuring out what it means for works to be funded in this way and for the means of production to shift so dramatically.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421559390|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|e5fe55e12b6475cbf3ad00268c1408392850624d -->",

Don't drink and tweet.&nbsp;Don't be self-indulgent.&nbsp;Don't use it just to promote yourself. That's boring.\"</p> <p>Perry's Twitter success is matched on Facebook, but she's not the most popular star on that social network, despite her official page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/katyperry\">having accumulated 59.25 million likes</a> &ndash; ahead of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JustinBieber\">Bieber's 57.27 million</a>, but behind <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ladygaga\">Gaga's 60.35m</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421595006|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|c981c1e7de6cd29b363e8efa738497bc5af7047f -->",

        "headline":"Vine: in the future everyone can be famous for six seconds",
        "body":"<p>Six seconds doesn't seem like a long time but <a href=\"https://vine.co/\" title=\"\">Vine</a>, the white-hot video app, has made it an eternity. Created just last year, Vine now has 40 million-plus registered users uploading short videos featuring everything from waves crashing and comedy sketches to Harry Styles brushing his teeth that all loop back on themselves, again and again and again – six seconds stretched to infinity.</p><p>The infinity loop, and ease of use, has punted Vine out ahead of a competitive pack. Its instant appeal led to Twitter snapping it up, for an undisclosed sum, before it had even officially launched. Now Facebook has paid it the ultimate compliment, adding a similar service to its <a href=\"http://instagram.com/#\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> picture service. Andy Warhol – whose famous Factory was a short walk from Vine's Union Square Manhattan office – predicted that everyone would be famous for 15 minutes. It seems he was optimistic. In the future everyone will be famous for six seconds.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhof\" title=\"\">Dom Hofmann</a>, one of Vine's co-founders, knew he was on to something but the video-obsessed 26-year-old tech entrepreneur wasn't sure how big it would be. A lot of people were talking about mobile video, not a lot of people were doing it. \"We knew that people all had these smartphones with great video cameras on them but they weren't using them at all,\" he says, when I meet him at his Manhattan offices.</p><p>The reasons were many. Videos are hard to upload, they take a long time to make, often you have to pull it off the phone to edit it easily. \"We needed to have a technique that was really easy to do, otherwise people wouldn't be able to tell their story,\" he says.</p><p><a href=\"https://vine.co/v/bPWbDJVlPjT\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch video</a></p><p>Hofmann and his partners Rus Yusupov, 28, and Colin Kroll, 29, came up with a simple display, touch the screen to start and stop, film upright in the square, that's it. No bells, no whistles (well not yet) and six seconds so it uploads fast even without Wi-Fi.</p><p>At first the Vine crew experimented with a range of time limits from no limit at all to 30 seconds. \"We went down to one second for a day, which was interesting. Six felt like everything you needed and not any more,\" he says. But the abrupt ending felt wrong. \"It's strange to shoot something and think about an ending.\" When he thought of the loop, Hofmann knew immediately that they were on to something. It took a long time to make that loop seamless but when they had done it, the videos suddenly had a new depth: \"It made sense immediately,\" he says.</p><p>Like Twitter and its 140 characters, Vine's limitations have been its making, says Hofmann. \"If you give somebody constraints, it's easier to be creative,\" he says. \"There's a quote by Orson Welles, he was a film-maker [he adds helpfully], he said: 'The enemy of art is the absence of limitation.'\"</p><p>Initially Vine was conceived as a video tool, not as a social media app. But from the start the team noticed how much their small group of test users wanted to share. They saved the&nbsp;videos to their phones and sent them as text. \"That's a lot of work,\" says Hofmann. \"There was just this feeling that there was something more&nbsp;here,\" he said.</p><p>The team had other projects on the go. They had met at <a href=\"http://www.jetsetter.com/\" title=\"\">Jetsetter</a>, the New York-based luxury vacation company, and were considering some travel-related technology among other projects. \"But we realised pretty quickly that this was it.\"</p><p>The service launched in January and was an immediate sensation. \"We were blown away by how quickly it resonated with people and by how quickly people pushed the boundaries of creativity,\" he says.</p><p>Sites like <a href=\"http://www.vpeeker.com/\" title=\"\">Vpeeker</a> post the latest \"vines\" as they come up. A sneezing puppy is followed by a man in a wheelchair shouting: \"Death to all tyrants.\" A girl squeezing what looks like saline solution up her nose is followed by people bowling, a woman licking a pizza, a man dressed as a panda pushing over a trolley in a supermarket, someone waving a big red flag under a waterfall. Vine offers a mesmerisingly odd global snapshot, a planet at play six seconds at a time.</p><p><a href=\"https://vine.co/v/b0dVA9wmQI6\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch video</a></p><p>The content is getting increasingly professional, says Hofmann. When it launched, Vine was used by many people as a broadcasting tool to show what they were doing at that moment. Blowing out birthday candles, jumping in the pool. \"Now we have another class of people looking at the world, coming up with ideas and then framing them within the limits of Vine,\" he says.</p><p>Comedy sketches are big. It's also provided a renaissance for <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2013/05/02/khoa-vine-interview/\" title=\"\">stop-motion animators,</a> some of whom are making astonishingly complex pieces using the simplest of tools.</p><p>The app has attracted the film world's attention. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattspangler\" title=\"\">Matt Spangler</a>, who oversees marketing and content at <a href=\"http://tribecafilm.com/festival\" title=\"\">Tribeca film festival</a>, helped co-ordinate a vine competition for this year's festival. \"We were blown away by the quality of the submissions&nbsp;we received. And now you see all these actors and comedians collaborating on one another's stuff, turning up in one another's vines. It's like they are creating a TV network. It's really interesting.\"</p><p>Even the festival's co-founder Robert De Niro is a fan. Ahead of this year's festival he told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>: \"Six seconds of beginning, middle and end. I was just trying to time on my iPhone six seconds just to get a sense of what that is. It can actually be a long time. One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand, four one-thousand, five one-thousand, six one-thousand – you can tell a whole story in six seconds.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://adamgoldbergdilettante.com/\" title=\"\">Adam Goldberg</a> has built one of Vine's biggest followings with a <a href=\"http://www.blackbookmag.com/art/actor-adam-goldberg-is-the-king-of-vine-twitter-s-indie-filmmaker-app-1.58150\" title=\"\">series of sketches</a> that resemble a messed-up mix of David Lynch, Roman Polanski's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiQ-SNzqTOc\" title=\"\"><em>The Tenant</em></a> and Lena Dunham's <em>Girls</em>.</p><p>The actor and musician, whose credits include <em>Entourage</em> and <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>, plays himself and a blond wig-wearing, cross-dressing maniac who often appears in the same scene. His girlfriend, Roxanne, worries about what Vine is doing to him; he seems more concerned about whether he can make it through the day without the&nbsp;wig.</p><p>Goldberg says when he first saw Vine he thought of it as a \"horror app\". The jittery quality has some of the filmic qualities of horror classics such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrg73BUxJLI\" title=\"\"><em>The Cabinet of Dr Caligari</em></a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcyzubFvBsA\" title=\"\"><em>Nosferatu</em></a>. He said the second post he made, a jumpy but formally composed piece featuring his girlfriend and a chair, reminded him of Ingmar Bergman's modernist horror classic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuVVlrM0hic\" title=\"\"><em>Persona</em></a>. \"I was making a joke, it's like Insta-pretension,\" Goldberg&nbsp;laughs.</p><p>At first he says he found Vine's limits \"extremely frustrating\". \"Then I started thinking of it in terms of a haiku,\" he says. Whatever he did, it worked. The series took off, earning Goldberg the title King of Vine. He says it has affected some of his other work. The video for his band the Goldberg Sisters' latest record, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssuSrSIdR_g\" title=\"\">Stranger's Morning</a>, is made with the same jarring jump cuts that pepper his vines.</p><p>But uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. The King of Vine is ambivalent about what the app may represent. He is currently directing a comedy, <em>No Way Jose</em>, about a struggling indie rocker. One of the scenes is 18 minutes long, another is 11 minutes, and he worries that a new generation of attention-deficient media consumers may find that just too much. \"Attention is a big issue for people growing up in this environment,\" he says. \"It's odd to be a kind of spokesman for an app that in many ways represents everything that disgusts me.\"</p><p>He isn't posting as much to Vine these days, partly because he is busy on <em>Jose</em> but also because of the inevitable online backlash. \"I'd get so many comments, with people saying: 'sick of this' or 'come on, move on'. Really? It's six seconds and it's free.\"</p><p>For less established stars Vine still offers a way to get noticed. Comedian <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQrV88bAfJ8\" title=\"\">Brittany Furlan</a> has built up a following of more than 2.8 million people with her anarchic sketches in which she kisses strangers, stands way too close to them, steals their shopping carts and commits other random acts of comedy. Furlan's videos rack up tens of thousands of likes and shares – known as \"revines\" – within hours of her posting them and have attracted the attention of stars including <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/JimmyKimmelLive\" title=\"\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chelseahandler\" title=\"\">Chelsea Handler,</a> who have featured Furlan's skits on their programmes, a big break for any aspiring comedian.</p><p>Advertisers are also piling in. Fox recently promoted its latest <em>Wolverine</em> movies with <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/bDExaiMjJ1F\" title=\"\">six-second vines</a>. Dunkin' Donuts, Trident chewing gum, <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/b5HEYV0IQPJ\" title=\"\">Urban Outfitters</a> — all have produced mini ads. Burberry used it during New York fashion week to promote its shows.</p><p>Making a vine that goes viral is more art than science, but when it happens it's all down to numbers. \"If I choose to share something with you, it has a better than zero chance of going viral. If you choose to share that with someone else, it has an even better chance. Each time that continues, the chances increase. At some point the coefficent goes over one,\" says Hofmann, but the fundamental question is: \"Is this worth sharing?\"</p><p><a href=\"https://vine.co/v/bUjwx7aVl5h\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to watch video</a></p><p>The big question for Vine, as with any other service, is also is it worth sharing? The explosion of social media services is inevitably creating more casualties than winners.&nbsp;Remember Color? Probably not. But the investors who poured $41m into the now defunct photo-sharing app once touted as the Next Big Thing surely do.</p><p>The biggest winner in the latest wave of social media startups is probably Instagram, the photo-sharing service that also looks set to be Vine's main competition. Twitter co-founder <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/06/kara-swisher-instagram\" title=\"\">Jack Dorsey told <em>Vanity Fair</em></a> he was \"heartbroken\" when Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg snapped up Instagram, the social media photo-sharing app, in 2012. He had been a fan from day one. \"From the start, Instagram was a simple application and a joy to use,\" Dorsey said. \"I was blown away by how much detail they put into the experience.\"</p><p>The close ties between Dorsey and Instagram proved no match for Zuckerberg's $1bn offer for the company. When Vine popped up on Twitter's horizon, the company moved fast to make sure it didn't lose out again.</p><p>Last year Twitter was on the point of launching Cards – a service that offers a snapshot of other content such as a newspaper article, a photo or a video alongside the tweet. Vine's founders reached out to the company as they considered places to syndicate their service. The two sides realised they had a lot in common. \"We are both focused on being public, on real time, on constraints, on free speech,\" says Hofmann. Very quickly talks about syndication turned into an acquisition.</p><p>Dorsey has gone on to be something of a Vine sensation himself. <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/100706850\" title=\"\">Posting a series of spooky selfies</a>, standing stock-still and wearing shades in passing crowds or poised on top of a bridge, his face as expressionless as Ryan Gosling at his impassive best.</p><p>In June Dorsey's old pals at Instagram launched a 15-second video-sharing service to rival Vine. It has a couple of advantages. First, it has a more established base – 150 million active users. Second, it has Facebook's backing. Facebook has 1.15 billion users compared with Twitter's 200 million.</p><p>Hofmann doesn't seem worried: \"There are quite a few mobile video products and people are&nbsp;hungry for it,\" he says. \"Our goal is to build the best service. I think that if the world of mobile video is growing larger, that's a good thing for us.\"</p><p>For all the hype, says Brian Wieser, senior research analyst at Pivotal Research, when it comes to making money, Vine and its rivals are a long way from being the new TV. Television is experiencing the same seismic ructions that have shaken music, books and newspapers but there are few signs that – financially – social media is taking its place. \"Vine has a lot of promise as a marketing product and you are seeing a lot of experimentation. But the scale is to be determined, not unlike Twitter itself or <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/\" title=\"\">Pinterest</a> or Instagram,\" he says.</p><p>The advertising dollars now going into Vine are largely coming from other, more established internet companies such as AOL and Yahoo, says Weiser. In this tech-dog-eats-tech-dog world, TV&nbsp;is holding its own. \"TV advertising is not cheap but from an advertiser's point of view it's ridiculously effective. If you cut your TV spending when your rivals don't, you lose. It doesn't matter how cool your vine is.\"</p><p>So where does Vine go from here? Hofmann says the initial idea was to get the service out and make it as easy as possible to use. Now the company is looking at ways to better promote its content. A website or partnership deals are under discussion. Channels are being added so people can filter the content they want to see. Last month <a href=\"http://blog.vine.co/\" title=\"\">two new editing tools</a> were added; other features in the pipeline include a way to change the focus and a grid for stop-motion movie‑makers.</p><p>\"When we first went out, we were art. Now we're comedy and art,\" says Hofmann. But he says news services are also increasingly looking at Vine. A&nbsp;vine of the Boston marathon bombing, taken from TV, attracted 35,000 people in less than a minute when it was posted back in April. Celebrities such as Harry Styles, whose vines dominate the top of the chart, are also using the service to broadcast to their fans.</p><p>Will Vine stand the test of time? Goldberg is on the fence. \"I was auditioning for teenagers to be in my movie and this girl really stood out, ad-libbing about Vine. It was hilarious.\" He wonders whether he should use it in the movie. \"A year from now, will it be seen as an archaic reference? I don't really know.\" But if Vine can do this much in six seconds – who knows what&nbsp;it can do in a year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421197994|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|767fa283ab5c16932388bdc8f91ce172ceb11ebb -->",

        "headline":"Children and the internet: a parent's guide",
        "body":"<p>You can't blame Jamie Oliver for being worried. As the father of Poppy, 11, Daisy, 10, Petal, four, and Buddy, three, he really needs some long-term tech ground rules in his house. So he announced last week that he has <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2478967/Jamie-Oliver-bans-oldest-daughter-having-phone-social-networks-case-gets-bullied.html\" title=\"\">banned his eldest daughters from using a mobile phone</a> or any kind of social media. &quot;I found out my two eldest girls had set up Instagram accounts in secret, which I wasn't happy about and soon put a stop to,&quot; he said. &quot;Poppy is the only girl in her class without a mobile. It may sound harsh, but I do worry about the bullying that can go on with these sites.&quot;</p><p>Oliver's fears are certainly exacerbated by his celebrity status. But they are shared by many parents who, faced with mixed messages about the dangers and benefits of technology, choose simply to ban whatever they can for as long as they can. It doesn't help that there is often a hypocritical element to all this for modern parents. Oliver announced the birth of both of his younger children to his 3.6 million Twitter followers. If we spend hours on Facebook and Pinterest – in full view of our children – how can we expect them not to go on Moshi Monsters, Club Penguin, Friv or Minecraft as soon as they can wield a mouse?</p><p>Sara Bran is from north London and writes on creativity and parenting. She has two daughters, Mia, seven, and Lily, 17. &quot;I don't think 'the internet' is taught well in school,&quot; she said. &quot;It is only mentioned to children in the context of safety and danger. It needs to be broken down into a) health issues – eyesight, sitting still for long periods of time, brain plasticity and creativity; b) intellectual issues about where information comes from and the ability to think independently; and c) social media and ideas about empathy, friendship, bullying, communication and relationships.&quot;</p><p>She says that Lily worries a lot for her little sister and feels there has been a huge change in internet use and access in the last few years: &quot;When Lily was seven, there was one central computer in our house that we all used. Now smartphones mean that all of us are in our own private worlds, having private relationships with the internet and social media. At 17, she doesn't consider herself a digital native, but her younger sister at seven is completely immersed.&quot;</p><p>Stay-at-home dad Mark Bryce, who blogs at <a href=\"sonnyandluca.co.uk\" title=\"\">sonnyandluca.co.uk</a>, is from Manchester. His two boys are three and four, so their internet use is rare and supervised but he already worries: &quot;We tend to stick with CBeebies but when we've occasionally used other sites, particularly YouTube, it's frightening how quickly they can stumble across other material just by clicking on links. Once I took a phone call and within a few minutes they were watching something quite violent – and that was only a couple of clicks away from the cartoon I'd left them viewing.&quot;</p><p>The arguments against are well-rehearsed. A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sedentary-lifestyles-and-too-much-screen-time-affect-childrens-wellbeing\" title=\"\">recent report</a> for Public Health England concluded that &quot;children who spend more time on computers, watching TV and playing video games tend to experience higher levels of emotional distress, anxiety and depression&quot;.</p><p>Then there's the sedentary effect: more than 70% of young people do not undertake the recommended one hour of physical activity a day. Earlier this year the Public Health Sciences Unit in Glasgow found a correlation between viewing television for longer than three hours a day (from age five) and &quot;conduct disorder&quot;.</p><p>The safety issue is an equal concern. Last month Peter Davies, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.ceop.police.uk\" title=\"\">Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre</a> (Ceops), said that &quot;half of all child sexual exploitation takes place on social networks. Facebook is a major one, but not the only one&quot;. Last year the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported that Facebook was developing technology to link children's accounts to those of their parents. At the moment, no under 13s are allowed on the site. The most recent report on Facebook use [<a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2011/june/electronics-computers/state-of-the-net/facebook-concerns/index.htm\" title=\"\">Consumer Reports 2011</a>] found that &quot;of the 20 million minors who use Facebook, 7.5 million were younger than 13 and more than five million were younger than 10&quot;.</p><p>But as long as you manage and intervene sensibly, technology has so much to offer, argues Heather Ticheli, a London-based home educator and campaigner for Mothers At Home Matter. She has two boys aged four and eight and sees technology as a life-saver: &quot;I wouldn't want to home educate without screens. Particularly because tech opens up the world to my dyslexic son in a way that books just can't.&quot;</p><p>This generation of parents also realises that it's likely that the ability to programme, use code, vlog and blog is as essential to the current cohort of children as a degree was in times gone by. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/04/raspberry-pi-programming-jam-cern\" title=\"\">The excitement about Raspberry Pi</a>, the &pound;30 credit-card-size mini PC that plugs into a TV and keyboard – &quot;unlocking a new generation of programmers&quot; – is built on this feeling.</p><p>&quot;There are so many amazing apps, from phonics and maths to video blogging and stop-motion animation,&quot; Ticheli adds. &quot;We watch documentaries and videos on YouTube. We can use my smartphone to find the answers to the barrage of random questions my children think of while we are stuck in traffic on the bus.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Parents are fighting back by personally policing their children's use – the only way you can really know what's going on. With older children, you need to be up close and personal with their online use, says Tanya Barrow, who writes the award-winning blog <a href=\"http://www.mummybarrow.com\" title=\"\">Mummy Barrow</a>. She lives in Fleet, Hampshire, with two girls aged 14 and 19 and an 18-year-old son.</p><p>&quot;There should be supervision until you know that your children are safe and know what they are doing,' she said. &quot;Is their profile locked down? Who can see their pictures? What are they sharing? Once you know that your child understands they should not be posting home addresses and so on, then maybe the supervision can be lessened. It is all about talking and understanding. I follow them all on Twitter and am friends with them on Facebook. Yes, I know my comments get deleted. And I am not allowed to 'like' statuses on Facebook. But at least they know I know what they are up to.&quot;</p><p>Her children all had phones from the age of 10, but &quot;for use in emergencies – not smartphones&quot;. She adds: &quot;I am not too scared about my children being bullied online, we have that conversation a lot and are very open about it and they would talk to me if this happened.</p><p>&quot;But we heard of an incident where a friend had added a young lad on Facebook and had been chatting to him for a few months. Just chatting, nothing sinister. But it transpired he was not a young lad and had been biding time and gaining her trust, looking through her photos on Facebook and those of her friends. They were contacted by another worried parent who had called Ceop [the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre] and this person was duly blocked.</p><p>&quot;That sort of thing terrifies me. Children are trusting and I don't want to change that and make them suspicious of everybody, but it is a very fine line.&quot;</p><p>Jennifer Howze, co-founder of online community <a href=\"http://www.britmums.com\" title=\"\">BritMums</a> and mother of a nine-year-old daughter and 14-year-old stepson, says this is perhaps the hottest topic for parents: &quot;Many parents take a stepped approach. Kids first get a phone with very few credits that they can only use to call home in emergencies, then they get one with more credits that they can use to call a close circle of family and friends, then they're allowed to use their own allowance or earnings to add credit to use it with more people. A big concern is that the phone makes them a target for mugging by other kids.&quot;</p><p>She adds: &quot;I'm most concerned about appropriate use of social media. It's so easy when you're just learning how to use social media to overshare, say something that you shouldn't, even take a picture and send it to a boyfriend and girlfriend that gets shared with others.</p><p>&quot;They don't comprehend the repercussions or foresee the issues that might develop. I think every parent also worries that their child might be the one bullying or not being nice to others online. Any way you can have those conversations are good. The earlier, the better.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps the worst thing for this generation of busy and over-worked parents, often tech overusers themselves, is that this is one more thing to drive us all apart.</p><p>&quot;I worry that screen time will become the norm rather than one of a variety of activities, and also the lack of exercise that will result from it,&quot; Bryce said. &quot;Most of all though I worry that it will become something that comes between them and me as they grow older. I know it's only natural for kids to seek independence and time away from their parents but I can't help but feel this inevitable eventuality will only be hastened by the advent of so much time in front of a screen.</p><p>&quot;On a positive note, I have utilised their obsession in order to get vegetables into their diet. I now suggest they do something without a screen and then flick carrots into their gaping, unbelieving open mouths.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421501572|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|ad04f3d7447836d6771fff9f1e620d8f3ad766d3 -->",

        "headline":"Twitter flotation: the next Google, or another Groupon?",
        "body":"<p>'We've only just scratched the surface of everything that Twitter can become,\" chief executive Dick Costolo tells viewers in the roadshow video made to woo investors before the company's stock-market debut this week.</p><p>There are around 2.4 billion people online worldwide, and 10% of them are active on Twitter. Impressive, but a long way behind Facebook, which claims its monthly users amount to half the online population – 1.2 billion. Costolo's challenge is to coax the many millions who are too daunted or confused by Twitter into joining the conversation.</p><p>The extent to which investors believe he can do this will help set the float price, which is due to be confirmed on Wednesday. And that price will determine whether Twitter surges during its first day of trading on Thursday, or goes the way of online coupon site Groupon, whose shares have lost half their original value since it floated in 2011.</p><p>When Groupon came to market it was the first major internet stock to go public since Google in 2004. Although pre-IPO investors complained at the time that Google had underestimated its own value, helping the shares soar on the first day, Facebook last year illustrated the dangers of allowing a privileged few early backers to cash in too handsomely at the IPO. Despite the early controversy, the search giant's successful career as a public company remains the ideal.</p><p>In its roadshow, which started last Monday, Twitter is marketing 70m shares at between $17 and $20 apiece, valuing it at $10.9bn (£6.8bn). But Wall Street believes either the price or the number of shares sold are likely to be increased; Facebook notoriously increased both just before its first day of trading.</p><p>\"It's conservative and likely going to be raised as they start the roadshow at least once if not twice,\" Sam Hamadeh of PrivCo, a research firm that specialises in private companies, said of Twitter's pricing. \"The size of the offering is also a bit small. But they may only choose to raise the price once they gauge investor demand. Raising both the price and the size was Facebook's fatal mistake.\"</p><p>Pivotal Research Group has set a $29 price target, painting a picture of Twitter in five years' time as a company whose revenues have grown from the $650m forecast for this year to $4bn. The profit margin, it said, will be in the 30% range;  Twitter is loss-making today. As a new business with losses to carry forward, Twitter will pay little tax in cash. Any levies due will be reduced by the granting of tax deductible stock options to employees. But Twitter will remain much smaller than Facebook – about a fifth of its size. \"Twitter is a niche business that will not likely be used by everybody, versus Facebook, which essentially is,\" said Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser.</p><p>Rick Sumner at research group Morningstar said Twitter was \"undervalued\" at $20 and has put a $26 fair value estimate on the shares. He is more bullish about its prospects than Wieser. His \"base case\" scenario – pitched between the most negative and positive outcomes –  envisages that, in 10 years, Twitter will have 1&nbsp;billion users, reaching about half Facebook's eventual size. It will also earn about $10 per user – giving annual sales approaching $10bn.</p><p>\"Although the company has not yet penetrated the mass market, we believe it will succeed in simplifying its applications, improving accessibility for users, and delivering a more pervasive Twitter experience,\" Sumner said.</p><p>Although Barack Obama, Pope Francis and a long list of celebrities, politicians, business leaders and journalists have made Twitter famous, by new media standards it is still not considered mass-market. The company's own IPO filings explain succinctly why this is. The prospectus states: \"New users may initially find our product confusing.\"</p><p>The signup process is partly to blame. When a user joins Facebook, the software can immediately delve into their contacts list and finds other friends  on the platform. Twitter has not yet found a way to do this: new arrivals have to build their own lists of people to follow, which means deciding what they have come to the platform to learn about.</p><p>While Facebook is the internet equivalent of a telephone directory, where just a home page is enough of a presence, Twitter is a platform for those who actively have something to say and are not afraid of the backlash expressing an opinion can often generate. But not everyone wants to be a  public opinion-former, or engage in pithy 140-character exchanges with academics and analysts.</p><p>Twitter is doing everything to make itself easier to use. Costolo promises in his video that it will \"bridge the gap\" between wide awareness and the actual number of people signing up. Potential investors will have to decide whether taking Twitter to the mass market could justify some of the more bullish Wall Street predictions, or merely dilute the platform's power to influence.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421498655|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|67413be9142422a154d3775706a803cacb14923f -->",

        "headline":"Europe looking to follow US to approve in-flight electronics",
        "body":"<p>The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is scrutinising the use of electronic devices during take-off and landing following the American Federal Aviation Administration&rsquo;s (FAA) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/31/faa-electronic-devices-airplane-flights\">approval on 31 October</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=15254\">FAA ruled</a> that devices such as ebooks, tablet computers and portable games consoles could be used &ldquo;during all phases of flight&rdquo;. Mobile phones will also be allowed, as long as their cellular radios are disabled or they are put into &ldquo;airplane mode&rdquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;We will be studying the review&rsquo;s recommendations closely and discussing their implications directly with the FAA and also with the European Aviation Safety Agency, which will be responsible for deciding a Europe-wide response and next steps,&rdquo; said a CAA spokesperson talking to the Guardian.</p> <h2><strong>Europe expected to follow US 'within months'</strong></h2> <p>The ultimate decision over the use of electronic devices during all phases of flight now lies with the pan-European body, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which oversees flight safety within Europe and has &ldquo;responsibly for these kinds of airworthiness issues&rdquo;, said the CAA.</p> <p>The EASA will liaise with the CAA, as well as all the other European aviation authorities, to come to a final decision that is expected &ldquo;relatively quickly&rdquo; or &ldquo;within months&rdquo;.</p> <p>Following EASA&rsquo;s decision, the CAA can then implement the recommendation with individual airlines. Instead of a blanket change, the approval for use of electronic devices within take-off and landing will be made on an airline by airline basis.</p> <h2><strong>Airlines to present 'safety cases'</strong></h2> <p>Each airline that would like to allow the use of electronic devices during the entire flight will have to present &ldquo;safety cases&rdquo; to the CAA in the UK, as <a href=\"http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=2152\">Delta Airlines has already done</a> within the US to the FAA.</p> <p>&ldquo;The airlines now have access to new methodology for the safety testing of devices, which could be a relatively quick process, especially as some airlines are likely to have already done a fair bit of testing,&rdquo; said the CAA.</p> <p>A ruling from EASA on the use of electronic devices during all phases of flight is expected within the next couple of months and is anticipated to follow the lead of the FAA.</p> <p><strong>&bull; Using the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/27/using-the-internet-on-planes-your-questions-answered\"><strong>internet and mobile electronics on planes</strong></a><strong>, is it dangerous?</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421458394|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|54ac97920d89b47bcb4db02964b652e379095483 -->",

        "body":"<p>Google unwrapped a brand new version of its mobile software on 31 October called <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/android-for-all-and-new-nexus-5.html\">Android 4.4 “Kitkat”</a>, featuring an always listening intelligent search and more.</p> <p>With Android 4.4 Kitkat Google has improved Android’s performance, added new features and services, as well as integrated new software to support the potential for innovative new uses.</p> <h2><strong>Android 4.4 continues the confectionary naming scheme</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-be6311aa-b1a8-4205-bd78-7cdbae2ffc1c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383307324966/0949e0fb-17b0-42ed-ad4a-9d377d3b7b98-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Android is now named after the Kitkat Nestle chocolate biscuit.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Android is now named after the Kitkat Nestle chocolate biscuit. Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters</figcaption> </figure> <p>Since its inception, Google has used both an increasing numeric value, like Android 4.4, as well as names taken from famous confectionary.</p> <p>It started with Android 1.5 “Cupcake”, and continued through the alphabet via Android 1.6 “Donut”, Android 2.0 “Eclair”, Android 2.2 “Froyo” (frozen yoghurt), Android 2.3 “Gingerbread”, Android 3.0 “Honeycomb”, Android 4.0 “Ice Cream Sandwich” and most recently Android 4.1 “Jelly Bean”.</p> <p>It was long-rumoured that the follow up to Jelly Bean would be “Key Lime Pie”, however in a deal with Nestle, Google named Android 4.4 after the Kitkat chocolate biscuit.</p> <h2><strong>Always listening Google Now</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-90d802dd-5df5-4df6-9920-b7843c3aae9b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383307716913/246fb148-a2d7-4368-88cf-be1b88a61265-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Google Now is constantly listening out for \" ok=\"\" google\".\"=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Google Now is constantly listening out for &quot;OK Google&quot;.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Google’s intelligent digital assistant and smart search, Google Now, has been given much larger prominence within Android 4.4 Kitkat, integrating an always listening feature, which will instantly respond to voice commands triggered by the phrase “OK Google”.</p> <p>Instead of having to launch a separate app, your searches can be made directly from the homescreen without having to tap any buttons, just by starting your commands with “OK Google”. This always-listening feature was first introduced with Google’s smart glasses Google Glass, which is voice-activated by the phrase “OK Glass”.</p> <h2><strong>Full-screen immersion</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7de04f3a-4f1b-4b13-affc-a2df833b1286\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383307780304/0ffa3869-3535-4905-a336-1c253e11bd26-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kitkat hides the status bar and menu bar when in full screen mode.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Kitkat hides the status bar and menu bar when in full screen mode.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Google has taken steps with Android 4.4 Kitkat to make the experience of using apps like ebook readers or web browsers a much more immersive experience. It has changed the way the system-level interface elements are presented, including the status bar at the top of the screen and the Android menu buttons at the bottom.</p> <p>Instead of permanently bracketing your screen with two black bars, the top notification bar is now transparent, allowing more of your homescreen wallpaper to shine through. The menu bar at the bottom of the screen can now also disappear when an app is put into a full-screen mode, allowing content to take up the full real estate of the screen.</p> <p>Dragging your finger down from the top of the screen or up from the bottom of the screen now reveals the notification or menu bars when in full screen applications.</p> <h2><strong>Support for lower-end phones</strong></h2> <p>Android fragmentation has been a big problem for app developers ever since the operating system’s inception. Essentially it means that multiple versions of Android that aren’t up to date exist on various devices. While that’s not an issue in and of itself, for developers it presents a massive challenge as they have to programme their apps to support multiple versions of Android – all with differing capabilities.</p> <p>Google has already taken steps towards minimising fragmentation through the decoupling of its own applications and services from the operating system into separate downloadable apps. That allows users on older versions of Android to update these apps separately through the Google Play store and gain access to the new services and features.</p> <p>Now Google is taking its battle with fragmentation a step further by reducing the system requirements for Android 4.4 Kitkat. In doing this Google has made it possible to run Kitkat on much lower power devices.</p> <h2><strong>Low-power sensors without battery drain</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2e5b8f21-018c-4e63-91bf-785f41fcc307\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383308076042/93431389-ecee-4c25-ae23-f4bfa695fe65-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kitkat uses batch processing to reduce the battery drain while still allowing your phone to track your movements and use other sensors.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Kitkat uses batch processing to reduce the battery drain while still allowing your phone to track your movements and use other sensors.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Following Apple’s lead with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/18/iphone-5s-review-apple\">iPhone 5S and its low-power M7 motion co-processor</a>, Kitkat also features support for low power sensors using a process called “hardware sensor batching”.</p> <p>Essentially, Android will now queue up sensory input to be processed in batches, which means that the central processor doesn’t need to be in a high-power state all the time to accept and process data from the phone’s sensors like the GPS, accelerometers and gyroscopes.</p> <p>The end result is much improved battery life, while maintaining the data logging and sensory activities that facilitate great features like Google Now, fitness trackers and location reporting.</p> <h2><strong>NFC payments enhancement</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fb2c0859-f178-448f-829d-13793886b98c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383308172935/d04ba39a-78cd-4e8d-bbf2-2d8895d6cf02-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Kitkat simplifies the use of NFC for payments and other functions.\" width=\"315\" height=\"189\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Kitkat simplifies the use of NFC for payments and other functions.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Google has also taken steps to simplify and hopefully accelerate the use of near-field communication (NFC) for payments. A significant proportion of Android phones come with an NFC chip built in, which is currently mainly used for pairing accessories and Bluetooth devices.</p> <p>Now Google has baked a new feature into Android Kitkat that aims to simplify the use of NFC applications for payments called “Host Card Emulation”, which facilitates the connection between the applications and the NFC hardware within the Android device.</p> <p>Google hopes that this new simplification within the Android software will help NFC payments, as well as other NFC uses gain traction.</p> <h2><strong>Coming to a device near you soon</strong></h2> <p>Following the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/31/google-nexus-5-android-kitkat-smartphone\">announcement of the Nexus 5 smartphone</a>&nbsp;and Android 4.4 Kitkat, various manufacturers announced that they would be updating their smartphones with Kitkat.</p> <p>Google announced that previous Nexus devices, including the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/02/nexus-4-review\">Nexus 4</a>&nbsp;smartphone and Nexus 7 and 10 tablet computers would get the update within the coming weeks.</p> <p>HTC also confirmed that it would be updating its HTC One line of devices, including the new One Max phablet to Android 4.4 Kitkat, with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/09/htc-one-review\">HTC One</a>&nbsp;seeing the update within 90 days.</p> <p>Other smartphone manufacturers are currently looking at the update, although it is known that the Samsung Galaxy Nexus will not get the Kitkat update.</p> <p><strong>• In October, Google launched its new flagship Android smartphone <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/31/google-nexus-5-android-kitkat-smartphone\">the Google Nexus 5</a> that provides high-end features at a more affordable price</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421448881|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|ea81d62b336ff8578b6155eaad44b7bfdba5822e -->",

        "body":"<p>The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.</p><p>Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5bn (£2.8bn), sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for alleged infringement in the US district court in Texas. Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.</p><p>Google is accused of infringing seven patents. The patents cover technology that helps match internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google's search business.</p><p>A Google spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.</p><p>Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that run Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.</p><p>In 2011, Google placed an initial $900m bid for Nortel's patents. The company increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4bn.</p><p>After losing out to Rockstar, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5bn, a deal driven partly by Motorola's library of patents.</p><p>\"Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe,\" the lawsuit said.</p><p>Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims the firm's patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421439630|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|d40d18032ee3762a8a91507d1560297661fe3144 -->",

        "body":"<p>Two-year old Hailo, which lets people order taxis from their smartphones, claims to have generated $55m in new business.</p> <p>Chief executive Jay Bregman told the Guardian's Jemima Kiss at Dublin's Web Summit that the company now has a dedicated team working on complementary, mobile-first products.</p> <p>&quot;This is all based on the platform we have created,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of these people come from Zynga, so this is based on a highly experimental culture we have built for mobile. They do&nbsp;substantial AB testing on mobile to see if certain features work before&nbsp;you waste time building them.</p> <p>&quot;This doesn't necessarily mean taxis. What is Hailo? It's a brand that is on-demand and mobile native ... we can use that data and those wallets ... there are people screaming out for smartphone&nbsp;technology to enable them to get together for closer, more intimate&nbsp;experiences&nbsp;for their customers without&nbsp;intermediaries.&quot;</p> <p>Bregman said Hailo was dependent on a network of skilled&nbsp;professional&nbsp;drivers who could apply &quot;the knowledge&quot; across the scope of the business, but that that would still apply even when self-driving cars become common in five to 10 years' time.</p> <p>&quot;That would be the best driver engagement and recruitment tool that we could possibly imagine. I would urge Google to do that as soon as possible.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• Hailo was named one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/17/zoopla-mind-candy-hailo-and-more-named-as-winners-in-the-future-fifty\">25 top London-focused tech startups</a> recently announced by the UK government</strong></p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://new.livestream.com/websummit/MainStage2013/videos/33537583\"> <iframe src=\"https://new.livestream.com/accounts/60688/events/2478447/videos/33537583/player?autoPlay=false\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\"></iframe> <figcaption>Jemima Kiss interviews Hailo chief executive Jay Bregman</figcaption> </figure><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421447222|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|17952d3910e12202eb9adb9efbe0071a538d1f10 -->",

It's good&nbsp;to be having this discussion right at the beginning of these services.&quot;</p> <p>Libin has described his vision for Evernote as a &quot;100-year company&quot;, and says that 75% of users find the service on mobile first.

        "body":"<p>Keys have been a necessary evil for the last century or so, but what if you could unlock your house, your phone or you computer with just your hand? That is what the xNT will enable using near field communication (NFC).</p> <p>Produced by biohacking and NFC-firm Dangerous Things, the xNT is the world’s first NFC-compliant radio frequency identity tag that can be implanted inside your body.</p> <p>Measuring 2 x 12mm the NFC tag is encased in a biologically resistant glass capsule and <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-xnt-implantable-nfc-chip\">is looking for $8,000 in funding</a> on Indiegogo to start mass production, with pledges of $99 and up winning you your very own xNT pre-loaded into an injection tube ready for implantation.</p> <h2>The chip can be programmed for just about anything</h2> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://vimeo.com/78136289\"> <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/78136289\" width=\"460\" height=\"258\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Dangerous Things xNT Campaign Video\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> <figcaption>The xNT implantable NFC chip has the potential to rid you of the need for keys.</figcaption> </figure> <p>NFC works by emitting a low power radio-frequency signature that can be recognised by sensors, which can then trigger pre-programmed events. NFC is currently used by mobile devices for one-tap Bluetooth pairing, as well as the transfer of photos and even payments.</p> <p>Once implanted in your hand, the NFC chip can be programmed for just about anything, including opening locks, starting your car, unlocking your computer or phone, or as a one-tap digital business card.</p> <h2><strong>Why it might not work</strong></h2> <p>The chip has to be implanted directly into your body, normally between the thumb and first finger, which might put people off the xNT over something like an NFC band or bracelet.</p> <p>NFC also hasn’t seen massive uptake to date, but that may change in the near future, as NFC payments and one-tap functions become more commonplace. To get the most out of an xNT at the moment, the user will have to create custom solutions and won’t be able to rely on off-the-shelf devices for the most part.</p> <h2><strong>Why it might take off</strong></h2> <p>Having a programmable NFC chip permanently implanted inside your hand has the potential to rid you of the need for keys, a wallet and to trigger all sorts of labour and time-saving automated processes.</p> <p>The ability to instantly unlock a phone or computer alone would see the chip being used tens of times a day on their own, which combined with almost limitless identification possibilities could make the nXT invaluable.</p> <p>The implantable xNT chip certainly holds a lot of potential, and could be the tip of the iceberg for body modification, if you can get over the surgical procedure required to actually fit the chip.</p> <p><strong>Star rating: 4/5</strong></p> <p><strong>• With&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/01/google-android-44-kitkat-update\">Android 4.4 “Kitkat”</a>&nbsp;Google reduced the complexity of using NFC-based applications, which is likely to lead to more widespread adoption of NFC payments and other one-tap solutions</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421468652|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|a8f1f25c665034592ba89a797a7f7c32e91e99c3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Google has just announced the release of its latest flagship Android smartphone, the 5in Nexus 5 that comes running the next iteration of Android 4.4 &ldquo;Kitkat&rdquo;.</p> <p>With a 5in full HD screen and high-end specifications, the Nexus 5 offers a premium Android experience with a more affordable price tag, starting at &pound;299, than other flagship Android smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One, as well as Apple's iPhone 5S.</p> <p>Based on the underlying hardware of one of LG&rsquo;s current Android smartphones, the LG G2, the Nexus 5 features, a top-of-the-line 2.3GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB of RAM and 16 or 32GB of&nbsp;built-in storage, which should perform well for both multi-tasking and graphically intensive gaming.</p> <h2>Colourful and flat Android 'Kitkat'</h2> <p>\"For KitKat, we partnered with LG to develop Nexus 5 &ndash; the slimmest and fastest Nexus phone ever made,\" said <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/android-for-all-and-new-nexus-5.html\">Google in a blogpost</a>.</p> <p>The Nexus 5 also features an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a 1.3-megapixel camera on the front for video chatting, as well as wireless charging and Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth 4.0 for communication with low-power accessories like the Fitbit One and a plethora of other fitness gadgets.</p> <p>\"The advanced new lens on Nexus 5 captures more light for brighter night and sharper action shots. And with optical image stabilisation, you no longer have to worry about shaky hands and blurry pictures,\" Google said.</p> <p>The Nexus 5 is the first smartphone to run Google&rsquo;s latest iteration of Android &ndash; version 4.4 &ldquo;Kitkat&rdquo; &ndash; which continues the refinement of the mobile operating system becoming more colourful and flatter, similar to Apple&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/18/ios-7-review-apple\">latest revision of iOS</a>.</p> <p>Google Now, Google&rsquo;s context-sensitive digital assistant, has also been given greater prominence in the new software, after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/27/google-biggest-algorithm-change-hummingbird\">new \"Hummingbird\" algorithm update</a> made Google's core search better at answering longer, more complex and spoken queries.</p> <h2>As Google intended</h2> <p>The Nexus 5, as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/02/nexus-4-review\">excellent Nexus 4</a> was before it, is the result of a continuing partnership between Korean phone manufacturer LG and Google, which sees high-end phone hardware paired with an unmodified Android experience, often referred to as being &ldquo;as Google intended&rdquo;, without the usual customisations phone manufacturers typically make to the perfectly usable operating system.</p> <p>\"Its design is simple and refined to showcase the 5&rdquo; Full HD display. Nexus 5 also keeps you connected at blazing speeds with 4G/LTE and ultra fast Wi-Fi,\" said Google.</p> <p>The Nexus 5 is available <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_5_black_16gb\">starting today </a>from &pound;299/$349 for the 16GB and faces stiff competition from the Samsung Galaxy S4, which won <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/24/samsung-galaxy-s4-review-roundup\">critical praise</a>, as well as the likes of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/09/htc-one-review\">HTC One</a>, Sony Xperia Z1 and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/18/iphone-5s-review-apple\">iPhone 5S</a>.</p> <p><strong>&bull; Google's Nexus 5 also features competition from a range of larger-screened devices or phablets like the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review-is-it-a-tablet-or-a-phone\">Samsung Galaxy Note 3</a>.</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420034985|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|de6c37e29b1a56b7837139fcb004ce88215e02e5 -->",

        "trailText":"Sony's PlayStation 4 can&rsquo;t play audio CDs or MP3s, will allow you to use two machines simultaneously, and other facts. By <strong>Samuel Gibbs</strong>",
        "headline":"PS4: five new things we've learned",
        "body":"<p>Sony recently posted an <a href=\"http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/10/30/ps4-the-ultimate-faq-north-america/\">extensive frequently asked questions</a> (FAQ) list for the PS4 ahead of its November debut, explaining several facts about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/playstation-4\">PS4</a> we didn&rsquo;t already know.</p> <p>Here are five of the most important facts we&rsquo;ve learned from the FAQ.</p> <h2><strong>You will be able to log into two machines simultaneously</strong></h2> <p>Now that games, game saves and a whole host of player information is stored on a Playstation Network account, Sony has made it possible to log into two PS4 systems at the same time. This will allow you to take your purchased games and saves to a friend&rsquo;s house without causing issues with your home console.</p> <h2><strong>The PS4 has an internal power supply</strong></h2> <p>Unlike Microsoft's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/xbox-one\">Xbox One</a>, with its <a href=\"http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/08/wow-the-xbox-ones-power-brick-is-massive/\">large, bulky external power brick</a>, the PS4 houses its power transformer and all the electrical workings within the console&rsquo;s enclosure, just like the PS3 before it. That may not sound like a lot, but for those who are confined on space, or have TV stands with limited room behind, it should make fitting the next-generation console into your existing setup a lot easier.</p> <h2><strong>The PS4 can&rsquo;t play CDs or MP3s or media streamed from a PC</strong></h2> <p>A strange omission given that the PS3 can play both CDs and a variety of digital music files, as well as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Audio_CD\">Super Audio CDs</a>, the PS4 will no longer support audio playback media other than Sony&rsquo;s own Music Unlimited subscription service. Sadly the excellent audio visualiser has also been removed.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s not only audio playback that has been crippled on the PS4 versus the PS3, media playback via <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2004/jun/23/dlnapromotesh\">DLNA</a> over your home network from a PC has also been removed. That means you will no longer be able to stream movies and music from a computer.</p> <h2><strong>The PS Vita&rsquo;s Remote Play isn&rsquo;t quite as robust as Sony&rsquo;s marketing makes out</strong></h2> <p>One of the most interesting differentiators for the PS4 over Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox One rival console is the interlink with the Sony PS Vita handheld console. You will be able to play PS4 games on your PS Vita streamed over a wireless network with its &ldquo;Remote Play&rdquo; feature.</p> <p>In the FAQ, however, Sony makes it very clear that &ldquo;a robust and stable Wi-Fi connection and broadband Internet connection&rdquo; is required to play PS4 games on a PS Vita. It &ldquo;strongly recommends&rdquo; that you only use the feature when the Vita and PS4 are both on your home network or at least the same local network.</p> <p>Sony&rsquo;s marketing for the Remote Play functionality has certainly given the impression that it would work just fine from pretty much everywhere. Now it seems that the data bandwidth required for Remote Play to work as advertised will be pretty high.</p> <h2><strong>You&rsquo;ll be able to command the PS4 via voice, just like the Xbox One</strong></h2> <p>One of the most marketed features of the Xbox One is the ability to fully control the console via voice using the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/kinect\">Kinect</a> sensor system. The PS4 will also allow the user to &ldquo;control key PS4 functions using commands such as starting up a game or taking a screenshot&rdquo; via voice using either the PlayStation Camera or the included headset.</p> <p>Sony has mentioned it before in passing, but certainly hasn&rsquo;t marketed it as a primary feature like Microsoft has for the Xbox One.</p> <p>There are many more titbits buried within Sony&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/10/30/ps4-the-ultimate-faq-north-america/\">extensive FAQ for the PS4</a>, which are worth reading through if you are considering purchasing one of the &pound;350 machines next month.</p> <p><strong>&bull; If you're still on the fence of which next-generation console to buy in the run up to Christmas, read our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/jun/18/xbox-one-vs-playstation-4-at-a-glance\">Xbox One versus PS4 comparison</a> to help you weigh up the pros and cons of each machine</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421357264|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|85a56a4b138f20d263e2a9cceadfd627b4785f3b -->",

        "headline":"Reports that NSA taps into Google and Yahoo data hubs infuriate tech giants",
        "body":"<p>Google and Yahoo, two of the world's biggest tech companies, reacted angrily to a report on Wednesday that the National Security Agency has secretly intercepted the main communication links that carry their users' data around the world.</p><p>Citing documents obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and interviews with officials, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html\">the Washington Post claimed</a> the agency could collect information \"at will\" from among hundreds of millions of user accounts.</p><p>The documents suggest that the NSA, in partnership with its British counterpart GCHQ, is copying large amounts of data as it flows across fiber-optic cables that carry information between the worldwide data centers of the Silicon Valley giants. The intelligence activities of the NSA outside the US are subject to fewer legal constraints than its domestic actions. </p><p>The story is likely to put further strain on the already difficult relations between the tech firms and Washington. The internet giants are furious about the damage done to their reputation in the wake of Snowden's revelations.</p><p>In a statement, Google's chief legal officer, David Drummond, said the company was \"outraged\" by the latest revelations. </p><p>\"We have long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping, which is why we have continued to extend encryption across more and more Google services and links, especially the links in the slide,\" he said.  </p><p>\"We do not provide any government, including the US government, with access to our systems. We are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform.\"</p><p>Yahoo said: \"We have strict controls in place to protect the security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government agency.\"</p><p>According to a top-secret document cited by the Post dated 9 January 2013, millions of records a day are sent from Yahoo and Google internal networks to NSA data warehouses at the agency's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. The types of information sent ranged from \"metadata\", indicating who sent or received emails, the subject line and where and when, to content such as text, audio and video.</p><p>The Post's documents state that in the preceding 30 days, field collectors had processed and sent on 181,280,466 new records.</p><p>Internet firms go to great lengths to protect their data. But the NSA documents published by the Post appear to boast about their ability to circumvent those protections. In one presentation slide on \"Google Cloud Exploitation,\" published by the Post, an artist has added a smiley face, in apparent celebration of the NSA's victory over Google security systems.</p><p>The Post said that the interception took place on the cables that connect the internet giants' data centers. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/technology/nsa-is-mining-google-and-yahoo-abroad.html\">New York Times reported on Wednesday</a> evening that one of the companies that provides such cables for Google was <a href=\"http://www.level3.com/\">Level 3</a>. It said in a statement provided to the Times: \"We comply with the laws in each country where we operate. In general, governments that seek assistance in law enforcement or security investigations prohibit disclosure of the assistance provided.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html\">In its report</a>, the Post suggested the intercept project was codenamed Muscular, but the Guardian understands from other documents provided by Snowden that the term instead refers to the system that enables the initial processing of information gathered from NSA or GCHQ cable taps.</p><p>The data outputted from Muscular is then forwarded to NSA or GCHQ databases, or systems such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data\">XKeyscore search tool, previously reported by the Guardian</a>.</p><p>The Post said that by collecting the data overseas, the NSA was able to circumvent the legal restrictions that prevent it from accessing the communications of people who live in the United States, and that it fell instead under an executive order, signed by the president, that authorised foreign intelligence operations.</p><p>In response, the NSA specifically denied that it used the presidential order to circumvent the restrictions on domestic spying, though the agency said nothing about the rest of the story.</p><p>The NSA statement said, in full: \"NSA has multiple authorities that it uses to accomplish its mission, which is centered on defending the nation. The Washington Post's assertion that we use Executive Order 12333 collection to get around the limitations imposed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and FAA 702 is not true.  </p><p>\"The assertion that we collect vast quantities of US persons' data from this type of collection is also not true. NSA applies attorney general-approved processes to protect the privacy of US persons – minimizing the likelihood of their information in our targeting, collection, processing, exploitation, retention and dissemination.</p><p>\"NSA is a foreign intelligence agency. And we're focused on discovering and developing intelligence about valid foreign intelligence targets only.\"</p><p>A GCHQ spokesman said: \"We are aware of the story but we don't have any comment.\"</p><p>The NSA statement was much more narrowly drawn than the initial response by the agency's director, General Keith Alexander. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/30/nsa-director-surveillance-foreign-leaders\">At a Washington conference on Wednesday</a> as the Post story broke, Alexander issued an immediate denial, but was not specifically asked to address allegations that the NSA intercepted data transiting between the companies' data centers. </p><p>The latest disclosures may shed new light on a reference in a GCHQ document, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security\">first reported in September</a> by the Guardian, the New York Times and ProPublica. As part of its efforts with the NSA to defeat internet encryption, GCHQ, the 2012 document said, was working on developing ways into the major webmail providers, including Google and Yahoo. It added that \"work has predominantly been focused this quarter on Google due to new access opportunities being developed\".</p><p>Other documents provided to the Guardian by Snowden suggest that GCHQ's work on Muscular, and a related tool called Incensor, is regarded as particularly valuable by the NSA, providing intelligence unavailable from other sources.</p><p>\"Muscular/Incensor has significantly enhanced the amount of benefit that the NSA derives from our special source access,\" one 2010 GCHQ document notes. It adds that this highlights \"the unique contribution we are now making to NSA, providing insights into some of their highest priority targets\".</p><p>Relations between the tech companies and the government are already strained over the Snowden revelations. Speaking at a tech conference in September, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said the government had done a \"bad job\" of balancing people's privacy. \"Frankly, I think the government blew it,\" he said.</p><p>Google will have its first turn before a legislative panel to confront surveillance questions next month. Senators Al Franken and Dean Heller, who are backing a bill to compel the government to provide more transparency about bulk surveillance, announced Wednesday that the Internet giant will send a representative to a Senate hearing they will hold on 13 November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421313603|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|78e845f31d84a6f1fd6b536cd5d813ea327a48e1 -->",

        "headline":"iPad Air review: lighter, thinner and raising the bar for software",
        "body":"<p>If you want a first reaction, how about that of the video producer who was an onlooker in our rough comparison of the Surface Pro and the new iPad Air? &quot;Wow,&quot; he said, on picking up Apple's latest revision to the iPad. &quot;That's amazing, isn't it?&quot;</p> <p>Compared with the Surface Pro – which at 903g (without keyboard) is nearly twice as heavy – the iPad Air is indeed a svelte chunk of &quot;wow&quot;. It makes the previous generations of iPads look a bit clunky, and heavy; their bathtub-shaped profile has been replaced with a rounded one which precisely echoes last year's iPad mini (and this year's catch-it-if-you-can iPad mini retina). And it's really light. And thin. Put beside it, the Surface Pro, with its abruptly acute angles and uncompromising heft, seems like a piece of 1960s brutalist architecture.</p> <p>Yet Apple doesn't think that design is enough in tablets now. By making its creativity apps – the iLife suite (Garageband, iMovie, iPhoto) and iWork suite (the Numbers spreadsheet program, Pages document editor, Keynote presentation program) – free with each new device, and the upgrade free for those who already bought them on the iOS platform, it is raising the bar both for what tablets should look and feel like (and especially weigh), and what they should be able to do.</p> <p>Plus by adding its 64-bit A7 chip into the iPad Air, it has created a device that doesn't pause in handling pretty large spreadsheets and drawing graphs that would have other tablets lagging, in every sense.</p> <h2>SPECIFICATIONS</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Screen:</strong> 9.7in 2048x1536 &quot;retina&quot; (264 pixels per inch)</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple 64-bit A7 custom ARM plus M7 coprocessor</li> <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 1GB (reported)</li> <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 16/32/64/128 GB SSD</li> <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> on chip</li> <li><strong>Operating system:</strong> iOS 7</li> <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), optional 4G (compatible with UK and international networks though not all simultaneously), AirPlay, Bluetooth 4.0 with BLE, AirDrop, Lightning port (connectors available to HDMI, SD cards)</li> <li><strong>Cameras:</strong> 5MP back, 1080p HD video recording with stabilisation, face detection, 3x video zoom, 1.2MP front with 720p HD video</li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 6.6in (169.5mm) x 9.4in (240mm) x 0.29in (7.5mm) for both Wi-Fi and LTE versions</li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 469g (LTE version: 478g)</li> </ul> <h2>HARDWARE</h2> <p>As with so much of Apple's stuff, photos don't really do it justice. The iPad 3 was pretty and thin; the iPad mini was thinner and much more elegant. Now the iPad Air takes its cues from the mini – a thinner bezel around the screen (but with thumb detection so you don't accidentally activate it), an almost-vertical profile (but gently rounded), and so little weight that you might think it's just a large mini. (Which in a sense it is, since it contains the same number of pixels and processor as the new iPad mini.)</p> <p>The build quality is terrific; the screen is crisply sharp; and it leaves one wondering whether you can make a tablet any thinner and still get the same battery life.</p> <p>Speaking of battery life, it's as colossal as ever – about 10 hours, as promised. What's noticeable is that with the M7 motion coprocessor, which detects movement (or lack of it), the standby time is greater because when the device detects that nothing's happening – no screen input, no movement of the device – then it reduces battery use. That doesn't mean that background tasks (such as uploading to Dropbox) stop but does mean when the cover is closed and it's motionless, it uses almost nothing.</p> <h2>SOFTWARE</h2> <p>If you've already got an iOS device, you can restore it onto a new iPad. This still works better than on Android, where my experience is that certain apps won't download when restoring a device.</p> <p>Besides the huge number of apps designed for the iPad – on which those running the Android team gaze enviously, if their efforts to create a similar <a href=\"http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-play-store-adds-designed-for-tablets-apps-section\">&quot;designed for tablet&quot; section in Google Play</a>&nbsp;are any guide – Apple is also making its play with those free apps for people who buy a new device. (Enough people are expected to do the latter that Apple had to make some allowance in its revenues.)</p> <p>The message here is that tablets aren't just for consumption; they're to let you do useful stuff too. Arguably, they can become a PC replacement for a lot of things. And since one of the most-used phrases whenever someone says &quot;tablets are taking over from PCs&quot; is &quot;yeah, well I'll always want a PC to run Photoshop&quot; (in itself a daft idea, given Photoshop's comparatively tiny user base), let's look at iPhoto.</p> <p><strong>iPhoto</strong> <br />This has gone from being a rather clunky photo editing app on the Mac and iPad to something which you could happily use to enhance pictures at a level that's well beyond &quot;no more red eye&quot;. There are tons of effects, and touch-sensitive editing controls which let you alter the colour intensity of different areas within a photo (using a neat filter set called &quot;drama&quot;). You can crop, rotate, erase, saturate, add filters, apply effects – and where it used to be a puzzling, mute affair, iPhoto now (at last) comes with a Help menu that actually helps.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8acbba30-daeb-4ac8-b6c4-da267d4a69e5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383124312538/809ca005-96e0-49c6-9079-f897bc9181a6-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"iPhoto has extensive help\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>iPhoto has extensive help – as do the other iLife and iWork apps (photo downsampled from 4MB screenshot)</figcaption> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f66f02a2-c4fb-4950-ad0b-6b0296abc0c9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383124225701/3c8c64ff-9d8c-4660-b862-7fc9bd22a0b8-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"iPhoto has multiple editing elements\" width=\"367\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>iPhoto on iPad now has multiple filter effects (photo downsampled from 4MB screenshot)</figcaption> </figure> <p>What it really shows is that Apple has finally given some thought to how a photo-editing app ought to function on a large touchscreen device. iPhoto still has its challenges on the iPhone – principally, that that screen is too small to make sensible overview decisions – but on the iPad you can do detailed work at a fraction of the price of any big photo editing app.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-126d78f5-33ed-41a4-b27f-6bf9221ff2c8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383124111583/87571710-64c3-4e8c-9391-7ab5249feb22-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"iPhoto edit controls\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>iPhoto on iPad has standard controls you'd find on a desktop image editing program (photo downsampled from 4MB screenshot)</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>iMovie</strong><br />Originally, iMovie was the first big desktop program that demonstrated that Apple could write software which simplified life for those who weren't professionals but wanted to do thing. Its &quot;big preview pane/video clip/editing area&quot; paradigm was so good it drove Bill Gates to chew out the team on Microsoft Movie Maker because theirs wasn't nearly as good.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-19263242-bd0f-4fa4-9a33-c593df103fae\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383125189755/5a53a2d6-a995-49af-bd84-ecaec7a59d3f-460x345.png\" alt=\"iMovie on iPad has lots of help\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>iMovie on the iPad offers plenty of help, and has a sensible layout, with the timeline editor at the bottom</figcaption> </figure> <p>Now, Apple's doing this on the iPad. It's the same recipe: video clips, editing area, preview pane. Split the clip? No problem. Slow it down or speed it up? Sure. Freeze frame? Duplicate? Change the audio level? Add your own audio? Can do. Add themes? Fade in or out? Rotate the clip? Zoom in? No problem. (The last two are done with your fingers.) Again, it's a poke in the eye for anyone who insists that tablets are just for &quot;consumption&quot;. Moreover, the A7 chip is scarily fast. Where the first iMovie – and quite a few successors, a decade ago – needed time to render clips at different speeds, the A7 does it right away.</p> <p><strong>Garageband</strong><br />I know professional musicians who like to jot down ideas on Garageband (though they then use the power of something like ProTools when they get back to the studio). If making music is your thing, then there are enough drum loops and other input methods to keep you completely happy. Even though I can barely scratch the surface of Garageband, it's evident that there are vast areas that a talented – or budding – musician could exploit, all without ever cracking open a physical keyboard.</p> <p>But of course, people keep saying (in yet another of the wearying Canute-ish refrains about the iPad), iOS &quot;isn't a full-fat operating system. For that you need Windows.&quot; However, <a href=\"http://stratechery.com/2013/magical-ipad/\">as Ben Thompson puts it</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;the iPad is a truly disruptive product. It is inferior to a PC on the attributes that matter to PC-users, even as it excels on orthogonal attributes that appeal to a new type of customer. Those orthogonal attributes certainly include things like portability and battery life.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Or as Ian Betteridge <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ianbetteridge/status/394511207723720705\">put it more succinctly</a>, the &quot;full-fat operating system&quot; argument mistakes means for ends: &quot;The answer to 'what do you want to do with a computer?' is not 'run a full operating system'. It's write/draw/paint/program/whatever.&quot;</p> <p>Talk of &quot;<em>needing</em> Windows&quot; is rubbish. What you <em>need</em>&nbsp;is a device that does the computing tasks you want to get done. Microsoft puts Microsoft Office on the Surface (at a price); now, Apple is putting its <strong>iWork</strong> suite for free on the iPad Air.</p> <p><strong>Numbers</strong><br />Most people don't need the deep functionality that Excel offers. Which is fortunate, because Numbers doesn't have that deep functionality; pivot tables aren't catered for, though there's a very large range of formulae available. It can open Excel spreadsheets (though some compatibility may be lost).</p> <p>What I did fund was that Numbers on the iPad is as usable as its sibling on a desktop. (I use Numbers all the time for calculations and graphing of all sorts; it's a long way ahead of Google Docs, and a lot more comprehensible than OpenOffice.) The new interactive charts are fun, certainly.</p> <p>Nor does the iPad choke on workload. Given a spreadsheet containing a main workbook of 81 rows x 50 columns, with multiple interdependency in each column, and two attached workbooks, Numbers on the iPad Air scrolls through it without trouble. I tested the same spreadsheet (saved via iCloud) on an iPad 2: it had trouble keeping up with the screen fills – patches would appear where it hadn't been able to draw the numbers quickly enough for the scrolling.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b861465c-1458-47e8-b49c-2cfd19296950\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383124007088/fe65dabc-b509-4b0a-a03f-dd4e02d8182b-460x297.png\" alt=\"An animated spreadsheet in Numbers\" width=\"460\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>An animated spreadsheet in Numbers: the tab below lets you step through a time series</figcaption> </figure> <p>Plus the iPad Air can draw graphs on Numbers without a pause: I could pick out a multi-row 50-column set and draw a graph (including the interesting new interactive graphs, which weren't available on previous versions) in seconds. It's actually easier doing that on the iPad than on a laptop – the scrolling works better.</p> <p>The clear space for improvement: you can't (at present) choose a chart you've already created in Numbers and paste it or link to it in Keynote, the presentation program – though you can into Pages (with a static or interactive chart). The absence from Keynote feels like a silly oversight; it certainly needs to be fixed.</p> <p><strong>Pages</strong><br />On the desktop, this has always been a slightly odd hybrid of desktop publishing and simple document editing, a strange fish-fowl. On the tablet, it makes more sense: it's all your document editing functions rolled together so you don't need separate apps. It even has change tracking. And it's Office-compatible – at least, coming in. Once it's in Pages format, it's pretty much stuck there until it gets to someone with Pages on a Mac desktop, who can output it in Word format. However, before that you can share the link for collaborative editing on iCloud, and for general editing – by sending a link to someone who can then read and edit it, even if they don't have an iCloud account, on a Windows (with IE9+ or Chrome) or Mac.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5b7448c7-05f8-4714-b94d-e683184b06f6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383123661535/62d5a6ab-86c9-4db2-b125-b6d398d3b61c-460x292.png\" alt=\"Pages with Track Changes\" width=\"460\" height=\"292\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Using Pages on the iPad with Track Changes enabled, and a chart pasted from the Numbers spreadsheet</figcaption> </figure> <p>Again, Pages isn't as powerful as Word. But then again, there are so many functions in word that that's like comparing the Swiss army to a Swiss army knife. The latter suffices fine for most things except dealing with war.</p> <p><strong>Keynote</strong><br />As presentation software goes, Keynote does have the merit that it's hard to create ugly presentations. But that aside, you have pretty much all the elements you would like: presenter notes (appear on your screen, not the presentation one), links out to web pages, &quot;kiosk&quot;-style presentations which work on a loop. When you're working on a presentation, you also get dynamic lines showing whether you've got elements of a slide arranged correctly in relation to each other. (The picture below shows what happens when you resize an image inside a shape.)</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-92ff2181-a98b-4465-aba3-5045400b4485\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383122626963/c0347f24-532a-46f1-93f4-1296c5ce3e0d-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Editing a Keynote slide\" width=\"460\" height=\"322\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Editing a Keynote slide: guide lines show when you have proportions correct (photo downsampled from 4MB screenshot)</figcaption> </figure> <p>If you're a Powerpoint whiz (everyone thinks they are; very few are) then this won't satisfy you. If you like to get presentations together in a handy form, it will. And yes, it does open Powerpoint files – both the .ppt and .pptx formats. You can take them direct from Dropbox (via the &quot;Open in&quot; menu). Or you can import them via iCloud (though that requires a desktop Mac.)</p> <p>The previously-mentioned problem – you can't copy or incorporate charts from Numbers into it – is the key one I'd point to. The big problem is that Keynote lacks a &quot;paste&quot; control, which is a pretty big oversight. If you want to paste an image into a presentation from Dropbox, say, you have to first save it into the onboard Photo library, and then incorporate that via Keynote's menu. It's a bit clunky; let's hope this gets solved in an update.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6da285b7-7240-40a2-92ac-6563c4fe3aa9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383122303125/6d831eeb-cfaf-4855-814a-5e1529bc04ed-460x276.png\" alt=\"Open Powerpoint in Keybote\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Opening a Powerpoint (.pptx) in Keynote from Dropbox</figcaption> </figure> <p>Overall, though, Keynote on the iPad sticks two bullet-pointed fingers up at the idea that you can't do office work on an iPad. Just make sure you're on a good connection for moving any media around.</p> <h2>CAMERA</h2> <p>It's surprising how many people you see taking pictures with an iPad. That big clunky thing? Yet you see them doing it at weddings, while touring around, in really surprising situations – the most remarkable I recall being an aid worker taking a picture of a dead animal in a drought area in Africa.</p> <p>Why? Clearly, people find it useful. The new camera is just the same as the old one, at 5MP, as is the camera on the front. Apple seems as surprised as anyone that people use iPads as cameras.</p> <h2>KEYBOARD</h2> <p>Apple didn't announce its own keyboard to do with the iPad Air; it was obvious from the moment Tim Cook said &quot;the competition is trying to turn a laptop into a tablet, and a tablet into a laptop&quot; that Apple wasn't going to follow the Surface route to a keyboard. Nevertheless, there are lots of add-on Bluetooth keyboards for the iPad (Logitech has one which fits the bill excellently).</p> <h2>PRICING</h2> <p>The iPad Air starts at &pound;399/$499 for the 16GB Wi-Fi model, through &pound;479/$599 (32GB), &pound;559/$699 (64GB) and &pound;639/$799 (128GB).<br />The 3G/LTE model starts at &pound;499/$629 (16GB), to &pound;579/$729 (32GB), &pound;659/$829 (64GB), and finally &pound;739/$929 (128GB).</p> <p>Yes, that's really a lot more than you'd pay for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/04/tesco-hudl-tablet-android-review\">Tesco Hudl</a>.

The latter, though, truly is a waste of money (in testing for our video review of the tablets, the on-screen button for the MyTablet didn't respond to a touch in any orientation across five different takes).</p> <p>In general, Android tablets are cheaper – although Apple is starting to make life harder for them, first by the pricing of last year's iPad mini at &pound;249/$299 for the 16GB version (and doesn't the US price look a lot more appealing there?), secondly by adding all that extra software (eschew the fake versions you'll see in the Google Play store, unless you like malware), and third by keeping the iPad 2 – from 2011 – on sale. (This is principally aimed at enterprises and education, but is the best-selling model.)</p> <p>Apple has always been unashamed about pricing at a premium. But it also lays on free stuff; the iLife suite has come with Macs for years, and there still isn't a comparable suite on Windows. Now it's doing the same on the iPad. Sure, you can spend less. But you don't get the apps. For example, Google's own free app QuickOffice&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/software/quickoffice-android/4505-3513_7-35828124.html\">can't edit Google Docs files</a>. You can hunt around for Garageband-alikes on Android (<a href=\"http://pocketband.net:8080/home\">Pocketband's Uloops</a>&nbsp;seems to be preferred, though it requires a fast connection, and doesn't have the same range of instruments; it's essentially just a sequencer). And that's before we get on to AirPlay, which lets you play content wirelessly on a TV via an Apple TV (&pound;99/$99).</p> <h2>VERDICT</h2> <p>It's only when you get hold of an iPad Air that you realise how well Apple has crafted this device. It's lighter and the internals are faster. Add in the free software, and it has raised the bar on what you can do out of the box with a tablet. The iPad now isn't just something to do a few functions around and about. It's a device to replace your computer for almost everything.</p> <p>Apple hasn't joined in the &quot;spec wars&quot; by upping its screen resolution beyond the &quot;retina&quot; level (where in theory you won't be able to see individual pixels at typical arm's length), even though lots of Android tablets have. But then, if your only metric is screen resolution, of course you're going to think that's the most important. Apple seems to think that getting things done matters more.</p> <p><strong>Stars: 5/5</strong></p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;not the cheapest; screen PPI lower than some Android tablets; Keynote missing some functionality</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;very light; very thin; large screen area; powerful A7 chip deals with big spreadsheets or games easily; long battery life; great free iLife and iWork software; huge third-party app ecosystem designed for tablets.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421258632|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|6c732089b049c543ea671e3fea9f218acd1b5d04 -->",

        "headline":"Apple's iPad slips to lowest share ever as Samsung chases",
        "body":"<p>Apple&rsquo;s iPad market share has slipped to less than 30%, its lowest since launch in 2010, allowing its biggest rival Samsung to catch up.</p> <p>By moving its iPad release event from earlier in the year to November, the lack of a new iPad models has allowed rivals Samsung, Asus, Lenovo and Acer grow, pushing Apple&rsquo;s global tablet market share to below 30% for the first time in the third quarter of 2013, down from 40.2% year on year according to new data <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24420613\">from research firm IDC</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The Android threat</strong></h2> <p>&ldquo;Apple&rsquo;s tablet market share decline was inevitable because it solely targets the premium segment of the market,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Tim Coulling senior analyst with research firm Canalys talking to the Guardian.</p> <p>While Apple shipped 14.1m iPads, claiming 29.6% of the market in the quarter, Android tablet manufacturers Samsung, Asus, Lenovo and Acer all saw large growth. Apple&rsquo;s arch rival Samsung shipped 9.7m tablets alone, securing a 20.4% chunk of the device market share in Q3 - a 123% year-on-year growth.</p> <p>&ldquo;The biggest threat to Apple&rsquo;s tablet market share are the low cost Android tablets - Apple essentially doesn&rsquo;t compete in the low end,&rdquo; Coulling said.</p> <h2><strong>The days of a 50% share are gone</strong></h2> <p>Apple is attempting to expand its tablet customer base with previous generation products kept on at lower price points, however, according to <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24420613\">IDC&rsquo;s Jitesh Ubrani</a>.</p> <p>\"With two 7.9-inch models starting at $299 and $399, and two 9.7-inch models starting at $399 and $499, Apple is taking steps to appeal to multiple segments,&rdquo; said Ubrani.</p> <p>With the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/ipad-air-review-apple-thin-light-software-iwork-ilife\">iPad Air</a> due for release on 1 November, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/22/apple-ipad-mini-2-launch-retina-display\">high-resolution iPad mini with retina display </a>set to join it on sale later in November, Apple&rsquo;s tablet market share is expected to recover to some extent, but &ldquo;the days of Apple&rsquo;s 50% tablet share are gone, and no amount of product refreshes are likely to change that,&rdquo; Coulling explained.</p> <p>Data from UK electronics recycler SellMyMobile.com shows that the unveiling of the iPad Air triggered a large 585% surge in the number of tablet trade-ins, with 38% of those surveyed specifically trading in their existing tablet to fund the purchase of the new full-sized Apple tablet.</p> <h2>Apple doesn't chase market share</h2> <p>Apple&rsquo;s ownership of the overall tablet market share isn&rsquo;t necessarily as significant for the company as it might be for others, however, as long as the iPad still maintains a strong position at the premium end.</p> <p>Apple specifically targets high value consumers, as they spend more money on content and services than any other segment, generating significant revenue though the company&rsquo;s iTunes and App Store ecosystem.</p> <p>&ldquo;Apple doesn&rsquo;t chase market share. Its business is all about revenue and margin over volume, which is something very different to the other tablet manufacturers, who mostly operate on very thin margins and attempt to make it up in volume,&rdquo; concluded Coulling.</p> <p>That point has been hammered home by Apple execs during recent press launches. Chief executive Tim Cook hailed iPad's 81% \"usage share\" in the tablet market at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/22/ipad-5-and-ipad-mini-2-launch-coverage-live\">the recent unveiling of its new models</a> as \"over four times more than all of those other tablets put together, and this is what is important to us...&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not about quantity. It&rsquo;s about quality.\"</p> <h2><strong>Tablets still growing</strong></h2> <p>Overall, global tablet shipments increased by 36.7%, with third quarter tablet shipments totalling to 34.8m. The fourth quarter is expected to see dramatically increased tablet sales as we head into the Christmas gifting period, where tablets are anticipated to be even more popular than last year.</p> <p>In the UK, Europe&rsquo;s biggest tablet market for instance, the tablet category has exploded in the last few years, with tablet sales dominating in the run up to Christmas. According to data from research firm CCS Insight, 8.3m tablets were sold in the UK in 2012, with more than half of sales coming in the last quarter of the year alone. 2013 is anticipated to mirror that increased demand in Q4.</p> <p><strong>&bull; Apple&rsquo;s </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/ipad-air-review-apple-thin-light-software-iwork-ilife\"><strong>iPad Air is thinner, lighter, more powerful</strong></a><strong> and packed with free entertainment and productivity software</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421373235|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|83c57d66821e94d30508a2d21ce95bda6b211a68 -->",

        "body":"<p>A silver and blue ATM, perched up next to the espresso bar in a trendy Vancouver coffee shop, could launch a new era for the virtual currency bitcoin, offering an almost instant way to exchange the world's leading virtual money for cash.</p><p>The value of a bitcoin soared from $13 in January to a high of $266 in April as more businesses and consumers used them to buy and sell online. Some investors are also treating bitcoins like gold, using them to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on their rise.</p><p>The kiosk, which looks like the average ATM but with hand and barcode scanners, opened for business on Tuesday and by mid-morning people were lined up to swap their bitcoins for cash, or to deposit cash to buy more bitcoins.</p><p>\"It's as easy as walking up to a machine, scanning your hand, entering some cash and buying bitcoin,\" said Jordan Kelley, chief executive of Las Vegas-based Robocoin, the company that builds the ATMs. \"With this, it's a 2-minute process. For any online exchange, it's at least two days.\"</p><p>Bitcoins, currently worth about $210 each, can be transferred without going through banks or clearing houses, thereby cutting fees. Users can buy products and services online or in a handful of stores, including the Waves coffee shop where the ATM is located.</p><p>With the bitcoin ATM, users scan their hand to confirm identity, then funds move to or from a virtual wallet on their smartphone. The system limits transfers to $1,000 a day, in an effort to curb money laundering and other fraud.</p><p>Bitcoiniacs, the local dealer that operates the ATM, will roll out four other kiosks across Canada in December. Robocoin said Canada was the ideal place to launch the kiosk due to a critical mass of users and less stringent oversight than in the US, where the bitcoin trade is monitored by anti-money laundering regulators.</p><p>\"We think the Vancouver market is enormous and we're excited to be here,\" said Kelley. \"By the end of 2013, we'll be all over Canada. By the end of 2014, we'll be all over the world, including the US.\"</p><p>Bitcoin is not a recognised currency in Canada, so Ottawa's anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre, does not monitor its trade.</p><p>However, Bitcoiniacs' founders say they are working with the agency to be ready for when Canada does start regulating them.</p><p>\"We're already being proactive in our business,\" said Bitcoiniacs co-founder Mitchell Demeter. \"We abide by any guidelines they would impose - which includes the 'know your customer' laws and anti-money laundering laws.\"</p><h2>Going mainstream</h2><p>Bitcoins were launched in 2008 and are traded within a global network of computers. They are not backed by a single company or government, but their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system's control over the minting of money.</p><p>Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.</p><p>The currency's reputation took a hit this month, when US regulators shut down Silk Road, an online marketplace used to buy and sell illegal drugs, and seized $3.6m (£2.3m) in bitcoins.</p><p>But the virtual currency is gaining hold among businesses and consumers, a key step to a bigger role.</p><p>\"I think it's definitely going mainstream,\" said Demeter. \"I think as things progress, and the infrastructure is built, it will become easier for people to buy and sell, and so more people will start using it.\"</p><p>In Vancouver, for example, dozens of people attend weekly bitcoin meet-ups and a member co-op is promoting the currency to a growing list of local retailers.</p><p>At Waves, Vancouver resident Chung Cheong used bitcoin to pay for his mug of tea and was happy to mull over the future of the digital currency.</p><p>\"It's been said that we're at the stage where email was in 1992,\" he said. \"Is it risky? Sure. But look at how the internet and email changed the world.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421280547|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|4c259fdbfd7503c34253daa9ded44f60383ad483 -->",

        "headline":"Call of Duty: Ghosts – the billion-dollar new beginning",
        "body":"<p>Infinity Ward knows a thing or two about change – even if it has worked on the same multimillion-dollar franchise since its origins as a splinter group from the Medal of Honor series 11 years ago.</p> <p>In that time it has seen the Call of Duty brand catapulted from a modestly successful cinematic shooter to the biggest entertainment property in the world. It has also seen its founders Jason West and Vince Zampella, leaving under a vast mushroom cloud of controversy and recrimination, taking many veteran staff with them, to the new horizons of Respawn Entertainment.</p> <p>It has seen FPS contenders come and go; it is now staring down the barrel of a new console generation that may have fresh ideas about the shooter genre.</p> <p>I visited this studio two years ago, its battered old office in Encino looking tired and dark. Since then the company has moved to Woodland Hills, and into a cavernous bespoke building, designed to accommodate the huge development teams that a game of this size requires.</p> <p>Now, that team is putting the finishing touches to Call of Duty: Ghosts, a very recognisable CoD game, but with a brand new setting and story, and a few little twists to the formula. With its release sandwiched between the gargantuan success of GTA V and the promise of Destiny and Titanfall, the pressure is on. And the pressure never lets up for these guys.</p> <p>Executive producer Mark&nbsp;Rubin is his usual relaxed yet resolute self when I meet up with him, first in LA for the Ghosts multiplayer announcement, and then weeks later at Gamescom. &quot;It's been refreshing,&quot; he tells me about the move to a new narrative universe.</p> <p>&quot;On many levels, the game has been such a new experience for us – and moving into a new studio was part of that. It feels like a fresh start. And this is a console transition year so we knew we were going to be on new hardware; because of that we knew we'd need a new engine. That made it feel different, too. We felt that Modern Warfare had completed its story arc and we wanted to start a new one that would be in a completely refreshed universe. We just carried that theme throughout the entire project. Everything felt different. I mean, in terms of formula there are pieces that are very obviously Call of Duty, but with multiplayer, we just felt that we were going to take some bigger risks – we changed some systems that have been pretty sacred since Modern Warfare.&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2f75d8f1-bc56-48d4-8092-63949a0e8686\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383134314126/e3180b65-5995-4008-9bed-9b50548f1497-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Ghosts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Call of Duty: Ghosts</figcaption> </figure> <h2>'Dynamic maps won't always mean destruction'</h2> <p>It's the multiplayer that I've seen most of so far. The new character system, which does away with anonymous custom load-out mannequins in favour of actual customisable soldiers all with their own kit. The emphasis on ground warfare rather than aerial killstreak blitzkriegs. There are 30 new weapons, including a new class of marksman rifles; Perks now have a points system, allowing you to buy several weaker options or opt for one or two really meaty specials.</p> <p>None of this represents the big risk that Rubin alluded to. &quot;It's the whole dynamic map system,&quot; he says, alluding to the feature which sees buildings collapse and train carriages fall into chasms. &quot;People who've played Call of Duty over the years are used to a a certain style of map, a certain design. We really branched away from that. Dynamic maps won't always mean destruction. You can blow up a gas station or parts of the wall in some environments, but in others you can move objects or open and close doors to change paths.</p> <p>&nbsp;&quot;Controlling those points becomes part of the strategy of defending those maps. And there are other maps where it's about full-on massive change. So in Strikezone, when someone earns the relevant care package from completing a Field Order challenge, they can destroy the entire map. Then there are the more environmental non-player controlled versions of that. So we have a map where the environment is falling and as it falls things change, like walls collapse or paths alter – you're fighting in a crumbling world. The whole idea started with the concept of bringing campaign cinema beats to multiplayer.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;We chat about the maps I've seen so far; the abandoned sports stadium in StrikeZone, the wrecked cityscape in Chasm … How do these designs start? &quot;It either comes up at a brainstorming session, or someone – it does't matter who – pitches an idea to someone else,&quot; says Rubin.</p> <p>&quot;From here, it begins to gather momentum. Usually when we pitch things to each other, the person being pitched to attacks the idea – it's how we're used to doing it, playing the devil's advocate. You have to defend your ideas. If you can't do that straight up then it's not good enough to continue with. Later someone will make a prototype and we'll try it out, get lots of feedback, make lots of changes and continue the iteration. Blitz didn't start out the way it is now, it has shaped itself over many playtests.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;So what's the hit to waste ratio during this process? &quot;You'd be surprised at how many levels get thrown out,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;There are six to eight maps that aren't going to ship that I've seen multiple iterations of. Early on, we had a group of maps that were really fun and I thought they'd ship, but we keep going, keep going and they don't work out. There's a lot of that stuff on the cutting room floor. That's a general philosophy for us – we're really good at cutting. If it doesn't make the game better, it doesn't belong.&quot;</p> <h2>'We're trying a more organic new style of design'</h2> <p>I'm interested in this process – after-all there must be a financial impetus to just keep everything. In these days of downloadable content, each map represents potential revenue. So if creativity and gameplay rule, I want to know what makes a classic map, and how easy one is to spot.&nbsp;There have been some fantastic ones in the CoD lifeline – Crash, Terminal, Crossfire – but also some stinkers that somehow made it though; maps with horrible camping spots and site lines that strafe the whole arena.</p> <p>What's clear is that there is a formula: most maps have three parallel paths allowing flanking play, or they generate out from a central hub in concentric circles. You learn the layout and you exploit it. The same tricks always work the same way. Ghosts is in on that of course, but Rubin insists that his team is playing with some of the conventions this time round. Chasm, for example.</p> <p>&quot;Chasm is a medium to large map – it plays a little larger than it is. From one end to another isn't that long, but there are a lot of twisting routes. We're trying a more organic new style of design; we wanted to come up with some maps that don't feel like gameplay arenas, that feel like real places, but still have the necessary routing to make them play like Call of Duty,&quot; says Rubin.</p> <p>&quot;It's a real challenge and there were some maps that we really struggled with. Chasm fits into the organic style. It's a broken down building on the edge of a giant crater from one of the Odin strikes [the massively destructive super-weapon that forms the basis of the single-player campaign] – the paths all flow in and out, they're like spaghetti going over and under each other.&quot;</p> <p>&nbsp;So there are no choke or skirmish points? &quot;There are still fun engagement areas,&quot; he continues. &quot;But we want it to feel like something you've never played before. There's a section where you're in a broken building with an elevator where the shaft around it is damaged and it's just hanging by a few wires. You can run and jump onto the elevator and then on to the floor on the other side. But I've watched players take a C4, throw it on the elevator roofs as they pass, then fire it off to cause the elevator to fall, taking anyone following into the shaft.&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fe7d7b0c-5b7e-4e7f-b156-bac69526d36d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383134390729/b61cd97c-f1a3-433a-ae26-5ddbd2ac0660-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Ghosts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Call of Duty: Ghosts</figcaption> </figure> <h2>'No one starts with a blank piece of paper'</h2> <p>I wanted to talk about the stuff people don't like – at least people not entirely embedded in the CoD community. The over-riding power of certain killstreaks for example. &quot;We've altered every system someway to make it interesting,&quot; insists Rubin.</p> <p>&quot;For killstreaks, one of the things we noticed when we've watched players is that they'll spend a lot of time just running and then being killed by something from the sky, or running around looking up, trying to fire their stinger missile at something above and not paying attention to what's in the game around them. We felt … let's get people's heads back down to ground level. We still have some air stuff – it's important to have that balance. But there are less air-based killstreaks now.&quot;</p> <p>The other thing people always pick up on is the Infinity Ward engine – the rusting battery that's been powering the series for many years, with seemingly only the occasionally half-hearted re-charge. Ghosts has a 'new' engine apparently, but what does that mean? How new is new? Rubin takes it in his stride. &quot;No one starts with a blank piece of paper – you have to start with something,&quot; he says.</p> <p>&quot;But then you go through and you pick apart systems. Some of them are much broader: if it's a tool-based change or a massive change to the way memory is handled – which we had to do this time around in order to provide customisation – we have to add in a whole new system of transient files. That's a new tech that effected everything in the game. It all had to be rewritten to work with that system. Sometimes it's a few lines of code, but it can require massive changes. So the engine starts with what we had before, but it changed dramatically over time.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>Actually, you know, I don't really care about the engine – and for all the faults of CoD, one of the things I like about this game is, it doesn't much care either. Obviously, it cares that things work, but the engine is there to service the flow of the action, the 60-frames-per-second hyper-pace of spawning, shooting and sprinting.</p> <p>Whatever this game is, whatever it says about us that it's the biggest entertainment leviathan on the planet, it just wants to get its bloody job done. And some of the biggest changes are to the flow state of the game – the fact that players can now knee slide across the ground into cover, or vault seamlessly over obstacles. These are little additions we know well from other games, but here they will make more of an impact than, I don't know, super advanced particle effects.</p> <h2>'Separate multi- and single player modes has a very long future'</h2> <p>Anyway, I want to get away from all this. I want to talk about the future. Infinity Ward must have looked across at Respawn and wondered what those guys, those ex-colleagues, were up to. And now we know. It's Titanfall, the undisputed winner at Gamescom.</p> <p>There's this new game design concept – mingle player – that seeks to merge single- and multiplayer components together into seamless experiences. There's Destiny lurking out there, too. Does the rigid structure of CoD have a place in this nascent universe? Can the centre hold? What about this brave new era of campaign multiplayer and online narratives?</p> <p>&quot;I've thought about this a lot myself,&quot; says Rubin. &quot;I think it would be really fun to try something like that with Call of Duty, but I don't think it's the required future. I think there will always be a mass audience that wants one aspect of the game, and not the others. That's the problem when you blend the two. If you look at PvE and PvP servers on MMORPGs – the PvP guys hate the PvE guys and vice versa. Blending the two isn't necessarily always the right idea. So I think separate multi- and single player modes has a very long future … but again, from an artistic standpoint, it would be an interesting thing to do.&quot;</p> <p>This might be a polite brush-off, the typically open-ended, non-committal answer of the media-trained exec. But Rubin continues. &quot;It could be handled in a very game-like way,&quot; he says. &quot;You could be in an open-world single-player environment where you can go up to a gate and when you enter that base, you're walking into a multiplayer map. That would be fun.&quot; This is, of course, how Destiny is handling things, and how GTA Online works, too. CoD rarely breaks new ground, but it has always quietly adapted. How much more can this behemoth adapt to the vagaries of cloud-based persistent worlds?</p> <p>How about, say, more players in these new next-gen modes? &quot;It's possible, but ground war in general has always been a difficult mode for CoD,&quot; says Rubin. &quot;It's fun, but spawning is horrible … and with that many people you can cover the whole map. There's nowhere you can spawn that someone from the other team doesn't see you. The easy thing is, we can always do that – tomorrow we can set up a new playlist and say now it's 24 players . The question is, should we?&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-70479113-d51e-4615-a2e7-9c23bd8f60e2\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383134528599/b8dea688-71cf-414e-a7eb-6103e1ba1da8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Ghosts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Call of Duty: Ghosts</figcaption> </figure> <h2>'The interactivity of it is the thing that's most compelling'</h2> <p>And that's always the question with this series. CoD is a billion-a-year business, with 30 million customers – all of that starts in Rubin's office. When I talk about how the next ten consoles are seeking to revolutionaries the concept of matchmaking and lobbies, he bats the issue away – the CoD system works just fine, thank you.</p> <p>When I put a similar question to Eric Hirshberg, the CEO of Activision, the response is slightly different. &quot;I agree that games need to be more social,&quot; he says as we talk in Gamescom meeting room. &quot;That's why we developed Call of Duty Elite – the design conceit was, wouldn't it be great if we could unlock the game as a more social experience. At the time, with the current gen consoles as our platforms, we had to do a lot of technological gymnastics just to do simple things like creating your character's load out on your smartphone on the train then have it waiting for you on the console when you got home. Now that wall has been lowered - the idea of the second screen is baked right into the hardware design.&quot;</p> <p>Hirschberg, an advertising industry veteran, sees the value in engaging with and encouraging social activity away from the raw game – or the brand – itself. &quot;We put a lot of capabilities into Black Ops II that were designed for e-sports competition and again, the creative process has a way of repurposing things that aren't always expected,&quot; he says. &quot;The theatre mode for example, was designed to capture highlights, but it has turned into a cottage industry of blooper films and other user-generated content that our fans have had a blast with. There are thousands of videos getting millions of views from that mode because we handed creative tools over to players and they used them in ways we never anticipated.&quot;</p> <p>But I don't want to get bogged down in the issue of audiences and social content systems. I want to question how games like Call of Duty can continue to function in a changing industry. After The Last of Us, we're seemingly moving toward an era of emotional realism. What does it mean for CoD? Can it just go along as it always has?</p> <p>Fans will say yes, that it fulfils a particular need. But let's look at cinema – in America, the Western was the predominant action genre for decades, and it spoke to its audience in the same way as military first-person shooters talk to gamers: tough men, following arcane codes of honour, brawling in the streets, bringing order to anarchy. But socio-political changes and the rise of auteur cinema in the seventies effectively killed the western. People change. Do people want meaning now?</p> <p>Hirshberg is fascinatingly mechanistic in his response. &quot;With the enhanced graphics and facial animations in Ghosts, we've made the decision to have it be about one platoon of characters that you're with from the beginning to the end of the campaign - it's the first time we've done that. We've brought in Steve&nbsp;Gaghan to hopefully provide a more rich and compelling story. But at the end of the day it's a Call of Duty game and there will be a percentage of people who press the X button to skip past all that wonderful rich story to get to the action faster. That's because it's a game and the interactivity of it is the thing that's most compelling, and that's what it is designed to driver first and foremost.&quot;</p> <h2>'The content level keeps climbing… it's… it's scary'</h2> <p>Rubin is more circumspect. He considers the question very carefully. &quot;There's a simple side to this. The tech will make characters look more realistic and more believable. That's the obvious part. We can do amazing CG-style moments, like big character interaction moments, which could be really cool,&quot; he says.</p> <p>&quot;I'll use Quantic Dream as an example: that Kara demo is the perfect example of where you <em>could</em> go in terms of storytelling. I think Kara is stunning, amazing quality in terms of tech and interesting emotional story-telling. I get teary in the part where she says she wants to live. It's so impactful. Putting that into games is something I think will make games better.</p> <p>&nbsp;&quot;But there's a downside – we've seen it happen with a lot of developers and it's hurting. We're having to put in so much more content and that content is getting harder and harder to make, and taking longer and longer, and more and more resources and money … I mean, it's something we all want to do but there's an obvious challenge there that I don't think enough people are really thinking about. Do we understand where we may be going if we start down this route? I still want us to do it, it's awesome, but as a producer, it scares me! If we have to do a whole game with masses of emotional intensity, the content level keeps climbing … it's … it's scary.&quot;</p> <p>This is where I wanted to go. Toward the future of game design and what that can mean for a studio of creative people working on a 'franchise' that makes money on a vast industrial scale. We're talking fresh starts now, so how about it? Can Call of Duty be an emotional journey? Ghosts is marketed as a human story, but death will be the one writing the script, we all know that. Does Infinity Ward care at all about fear and loss and humanity? Does it need to?</p> <p>&quot;We do try to have those moments, and we tie them together. There's a moment early in CoD 4 when you're sitting in a helicopter flying in at night to a cargo ship. And Price is there, smoking a cigarette, expressionless … then he throws the cigarette away, pulls the mask down and he's ready for action. That told a story about a character who can just get into combat mode, this intensity, without worrying about dying,&quot; says Rubin.</p> <p>&quot;In Modern Warfare 2, we have Soap on the side of a cliff about to engage an enemy base; and he's just sitting smoking a cigar, then he tosses it and the level begins. It was a purposeful tie in between the two characters. Doing things like that, is something we always want to try. The moment when you jump across the ice chasm and slip, and someone catches you – there's a little bit of emotion in his face that says 'I've got your back'.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;That's always something we're trying to do,&quot; he says. &quot;The problem with Call of Duty is, most of the time, you're shooting guys.&quot;</p> <p><strong><em>&nbsp;• Call of Duty: Ghosts is due out on PC, PS3, Wii U and Xbox 360 on November 5 and on next-gen consoles later in the month</em></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421275999|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|9ebe37a502c3f13aaebb5e9896cbc785cb4b8847 -->",

        "body":"<p>Isohunt, previously the third most popular&nbsp;BitTorrent search engine, has been resurrected after having been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/isohunt-bittorrent-search-shut-mpaa\">shut down through legal action</a> from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).</p> <p>The notorious 10-year-old&nbsp;BitTorrent indexing site has been brought back online by a group unaffiliated with the original Isohunt and its creator Gary Fung, complete with familiar branding and interface along with about 75% of the data that was pulled from Isohunt before it was shutdown in October.</p> <p>“IsoHunt can definitely be called a filesharing icon. People got used to it and they don’t want to simply let it go. We want those people to feel like being at home while visiting isohunt.to. The main goal is to restore the website with torrents and provide users with the same familiar interface,” one of the anonymous members of the new group <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/isohunt-resurrected-less-than-two-weeks-after-110-million-mpaa-deal-131029/\">explained to TorrentFreak</a>.</p> <p>Some parts of the new Isohunt site remain inactive, including the forum, user profiles and comments, however the rest of the site faithfully mimics the original Isohunt site in form and function.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5717d6d7-b75f-407e-81bd-1736f7baf092\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383142149672/f3062f12-936d-4d2e-a0d0-507d1501bcd1-460x256.png\" alt=\"Isohunt brought back online after MPAA shutdown\" width=\"460\" height=\"256\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Isohunt brought back online after MPAA shutdown</figcaption> </figure> <h2><strong>‘Copyright infringers will be held accountable for their actions’</strong></h2> <p>Fung's decision to close the site and pay the MPAA the huge settlement in mid-October came amid claims that the site &quot;induced the pirating of movies and TV shows&quot;. A US federal court had previously issued an injunction against the site in 2009, but Isohunt kept operating via servers in Canada until it was shutdown prematurely in an attempt to thwart a team of people from making a complete backup of the site.</p> <p>&quot;It's sad to see my baby go. But I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, and I have remained faithful,&quot; Fung&nbsp;<a href=\"http://garyfung.ca/index.php/2013/10/17/hello-brave-new-world/\">wrote</a>&nbsp;on his blog before the shutdown. &quot;10.5 years of isoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition, and forever in Internet startup time.&quot;</p> <p>The MPAA's chairman Chris Dodd said&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/isohunt-bittorrent-search-shut-mpaa\">in a statement at the time</a>&nbsp;that the settlement sent “a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their actions.&quot;</p> <p>It is unclear what the legal ramifications of the resurrection of Isohunt will have, although the new team will almost certainly have the MPAA to contend with in the near future.</p> <p><strong>• In October, 57% of UK game developers said&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/28/games-piracy-uk-tiga-developers\">piracy was hurting their business</a>, but only 10% wanted legal action over new business models</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421292903|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|313f43d0a5c957b645d4cf07e34f3ca44d17f1b0 -->",

        "body":"<p>They are young, famous and adored by fans around the world. But boy band One Direction can now boast another achievement: they're&nbsp;more influential on Twitter than David Cameron, Piers Morgan, Caitlin Moran, Ricky Gervais and other British users of the social networking service.</p> <p>That's according to <a href=\"http://www.peerindex.com/\">PeerIndex</a>, which has released its third annual chart of the top Twitter users in the UK, ranked by influence rather than just how many followers they have.</p> <p>One Direction's five members take the top five slots in the chart, with Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson all scoring 98 out of 100 for their Twitter influence, while Zayn Malik scores 97.</p> <p>The top 10 is rounded out by Ed Sheeran, Cameron, Morgan, Moran and Gervais, with the chart based on PeerIndex's analysis of more than 10bn tweets from 150m people, focusing on UK Twitter users and the influence they have on other Brits.</p> <p>&quot;As Twitter has become more mainstream, the top 140 starts to resemble the contours of popular culture and power, the footballers, politicians and boy bands,&quot; said PeerIndex founder Azeem Azhar.</p> <p>&quot;However, social media’s democratising effects still allow those with challenging, well-defined or interesting views to build influence. Witness the number of independent media stars, like&nbsp;Marius Listhrop&nbsp;and Dan Howell and authors like Owen Jones and Caitlin Moran.&quot;</p> <p>Corporate and brand accounts were excluded from the list, as were parody accounts and journalists from the main national newspapers, although those with external activities such as writing books (Moran and Jones, for example) stayed in.</p> <p>PeerIndex is keen to point out that Twitter users can be influential without millions of followers, while also suggesting that the social network has fragmented into &quot;subcultures&quot; that exist almost entirely separately.</p> <p>&quot;Twitter is so rich and vast, that subcultures co-exist on it, often without knowing about each other,&quot; said Azhar. &quot;For example, even though more than 900, 000 people follow both George Osborne, the chancellor, and Rylan, the reality TV celebrity, they only share six followers in common.&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/bu0ih/1/\" data-alt=\"Top tweeters\"> <iframe src=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/bu0ih/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"500\" height=\"850\"></iframe> <figcaption>Scroll down to see the full list of 140 top Tweeters from Liam Payne to Dianne Abott and scroll right to see their description and category</figcaption> </figure> <p>Reading on mobile?

        "headline":"BlackBerry: is this RIP for BBM?",
        "body":"<p>Back in 2005, when BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone, the company was just entering its boom times. While the iPhone was still a gleam in Steve Jobs' eye, BlackBerry's innovations ensured its smartphone joined maple syrup on the list of Canada's biggest exports.</p><p>Six years later, in the summer of 2011, as violence engulfed London and spread to Birmingham, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester, so effective was BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) at mobilising the rioters that politicians called for the service to be temporarily shut down.</p><p>But two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug.</p><p>As demand for BlackBerry handsets fades, the once noisy BBM grapevine is falling silent. Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from Facebook and Apple's own-brand instant messaging applications to independent startups such as WhatsApp and Kik (which also hails from Canada).</p><p>Free to download and use (although WhatsApp costs $1 a year after the first year), they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, \"stickers\", and even videos in WhatsApp's case, between most types of phones.</p><p>In an attempt to retain its following, BBM was last week released on Android and Apple phones. Despite the competition, the response has been overwhelming, with an announcement  that there have been more than 20m downloads. But despite the initial interest, many believe BBM's wider release will do little to save the service.</p><p>\"The move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late,\" says James Gooderson, an 18-year-old classical civilisation  student at Nottingham University who blogs on technology. \"WhatsApp has captured the reason why young people would use a BlackBerry.\"</p><p>BBM claims 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has 300 million. Other services expose BBM's limitations: unlike Skype and Viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls. Unlike Path, it does not do location sharing. There is no video sharing, as on iMessage. And the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face) adored by kids the world over are also unforgivably absent. Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry handsets have not migrated to the Apple and Android versions.</p><p>Messaging is moving from verbal to visual. Photos uploaded to Instagram trigger a wave of comments and Snapchat's pictures, which self-delete after 10 seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. Like BBM, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection.</p><p>Yet only three years ago, BBM was so powerful it was credited with starting a revolution in Egypt; and at the time of the London riots, it was a more urgent source of news than the television screen.</p><p>\"We could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next; TV news would catch up four hours later,\" said Jean-Pierre Moore, 28, . He  manages the karting track at Oasis youth club in Stockwell, south London, an  area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in Britain.</p><p>Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now. He dismisses the notion that the BBM curfew urged by some MPs would have stopped the looting.</p><p>\"The social networking wasn't the reason,\" he says. \"I know a lot of people who were out rioting. People had been angry for a long time. Mention the words stop and search around here, and you immediately have a room full of angry young men.\"</p><p>Yet for the young people around the karting track, no single alternative with the same viral power, the ability to connect a generation on one platform, has replaced BBM. \"There's too many things now. I'm on WhatsApp, iMessage, Instagram, Kik. Every year a new one comes out,\" says Moore.</p><p>Nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application, says the research firm Enders Analysis, but two-thirds use more than one. Among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use Facebook everyday, but 46% use alternatives.</p><p>\"It's a much more complex, multi-faceted environment,\" says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist at Enders. \"The smartphone itself has become the platform. All of these apps plug into your phone book and your photo library. Apps rise and fall like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last, others disappear into thin air.\"</p><p>Bennett, a 13-year-old at Oasis, is typical of this dispersed smartphone culture. He has three devices, all hand-me-downs from family members. He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone over Wi-Fi to play games and makes phone calls on an HTC-branded Android phone. His friends are still on BBM – the four phone robberies at his school so far this term were all BlackBerrys. At the touch of a few buttons, a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the phone owner's entire contacts book – several hundred people in some cases; on WhatsApp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50.</p><p>But for Bennett, Instagram is now a major social network. \"Instagram is Facebook without parents,\" he says. \"Facebook has been taken over by the older generation. Once I saw my mum on Facebook, I deleted my account.\"</p><p>For families that may struggle to pay their heating bills this winter, the low price tag attached to buying and communicating on a BlackBerry retains its appeal. Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a secondhand device and a £7-a-month deal from T-Mobile.</p><p>But trust in the privacy of BBM's system has been eroded. Part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and rioters was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company's secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. Prosecutions after the riots put an end to  that belief.</p><p>In the aftermath, BlackBerry worked closely with police to help identify those who had used BBM to incite violence. In Nottingham, a young man called Sam Lowe was last year jailed for a message, later deleted, which he sent to his 160 contacts.</p><p>It read: \"Girls, grannies, mums, dads, lads, grandads – everyone meet on Sneinton Dale tonight at 9 o'clock as we are all going to kick off …\" Lowe  a 39-month prison sentence.</p><p>Across town from Stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in well-heeled South Kensington, the older pupils all have Apple logos on their handsets. They all use WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory. \"I still have a Blackberry, but I'm the only one,\" says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. And how does that make him feel?</p><p>\"Isolated,\" he replies.</p><h2>The contenders<br /></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.whatsapp.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Whatsapp</strong></a><strong>: 300 million active users</strong></p><p>The most popular cross-platform phone messaging app, WhatsApp is the go-to text message replacement.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://line.naver.jp/en/\" title=\"\"><strong>Line</strong></a><strong>: 270 million users</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/23/line-social-app-uk-paul-mccartney\" title=\"\">Japan's answer to WhatsApp</a> now has 80% of its users outside Japan, challenging for the text-message replacement crown.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/#\" title=\"\"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong>: 150 million monthly active users, 55m photos per day</strong></p><p>Packed with filters, this photosharing app allows you to blast your best images out into the ether.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/28/snapchat-funding-4bn-valuation\" title=\"\"><strong>Snapchat</strong></a><strong>: 350m photos shared per day</strong></p><p>A playful, picture messaging app, Snapchat allows you to send drawings your five-year-old would be proud of.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://kik.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Kik Messenger</strong></a><strong>: 80 million registered users</strong></p><p>Kik messenger is another, smaller cross-platform text-messaging replacement that once challenged WhatsApp.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.viber.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Viber</strong></a><strong>: 200m downloads in May</strong></p><p>Viber is a free phone-calling app that lets you send messages and make calls over the internet to other Viber users, just like Skype.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/29/blackberry-bbm-20m-iphone-android-users\" title=\"\"><strong>BBM</strong></a><strong>: 60 million monthly active users</strong></p><p>The original phone-to-phone messenger, recently unshackled from its BlackBerry phone exclusivity to go land on Android and iPhone.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.wechat.com/en/\" title=\"\"><strong>WeChat</strong></a><strong>: (with Chinese sister app Weixin) 240 million active users</strong></p><p>WeChat is China's equivalent to Line and WhatsApp.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/mobile/messenger\" title=\"\"><strong>Facebook Messenger</strong></a><strong>: 819 million mobile monthly active users</strong></p><p>Starting as an instant messenger isolated on the social network, Facebook Messenger now has dedicated cross-platform apps on mobile too.</p><p></p><p><strong>iMessage: 140 million users (at latest count, in June 2012)</strong></p><p>Built into iOS, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/imessage-qualcast-security-weakness\" title=\"\">iMessage</a> allows iPhone users to seamlessly swap between text and iMessages within the same application.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421220930|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|6aded30c44f09e42e374052da909c38502dc03ac -->",

He promptly forgot about them until widespread media coverage of the anonymous, decentralised, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/04/bitcoin-what-you-need-to-know-silk-road\">peer-to-peer digital currency</a> in April 2013 jogged his memory.</p> <p>Bitcoins are stored in encrypted wallets secured with a private key, something Koch had forgotten. After eventually working out what the password could be, Koch got a pleasant surprise:&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It said I had 5,000 bitcoins in there. Measuring that in today's rates it's about NOK5m ($886,000),&quot; Koch <a href=\"http://www.nrk.no/okonomi/kjopte-bolig-for-internettpenger-1.11314773\">told NRK</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Silk Road fluctuations</strong></h2> <p>In April 2013, the value of bitcoin peaked at $266 before crashing to a low of $50 soon after. Since then, bitcoin has seen large fluctuations in its value, most recently following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/alleged-silk-road-website-founder-arrested-bitcoin\">seizure of online drugs marketplace Silk Road</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/bitcoin-price-silk-road-ulbricht-value\">plummeting</a> before jumping $30 in one day to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/21/bitcoin-price-surges-to-post-crash-high\">a high of $197 in October</a>.</p> <p>Koch exchanged one fifth of his 5,000 bitcoins, generating enough kroner to buy an apartment in Toyen, one of the Norwegian capital’s wealthier areas.</p> <h2><strong>Two ways to acquire bitcoins</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-480840c9-5847-4374-8059-0037eb5c3961\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383093762289/d4c7ce7c-974a-4c3b-a780-3793c0cc382e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bitcoin ATM at a coffee shop in Vancouver.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Customers line-up to use the world's first ever permanent bitcoin ATM at a coffee shop in Vancouver, British Columbia. Photograph: Andy Clark/Reuters</figcaption> </figure> <p>Typically bitcoins are bought using traditional currency from a bitcoin &quot;exchanger&quot;, although due to strict anti-money laundering controls, the process can can be tricky. A user can then withdraw those bitcoins by sending them back to an exchanger like <a href=\"https://www.mtgox.com/\">Mt Gox</a>, the best known bitcoin exchange, in return for cash.</p> <p>However, bitcoin is gaining more and more traction within the physical world too. It is now possible to actually spend bitcoins without exchanging them for traditional currency first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2013/jun/23/britains-first-bitcoin-pub\">in a few British pubs</a>, including the Pembury Tavern in Hackney, London, for instance. On 29 October, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/bitcoin-first-atm-vancouver-canada\">world's first bitcoin ATM</a> also went online in Vancouver, Canada, which scans a user's palm before letting them buy or sell bitcoins for cash.&nbsp;</p> <p>A small group of hardcore users also generate extra bitcoins by &quot;mining&quot; for them – a process that requires computers to perform the calculations needed to make the digital currency work, in exchange for a share of the built-in inflation.</p> <p>Mining is a time-consuming and expensive endeavour due to the way the currency is designed. Each subsequent bitcoin mined is more complex than the previous one, requiring more computational time and therefore investment through the electricity and computer hardware required.</p> <p><strong>• In August, Germany <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/19/bitcoin-unit-of-account-germany\">recognised bitcoin as a &quot;unit of account</a>&quot;, allowing the country to tax users or creators of the digital currency</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421199275|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|38c0118bbacef593c313e399cc120fe0a5c0e7e1 -->",

        "headline":"Sherlocked: how Mavericks is making some apps obsolete",
        "body":"<p>The launch of a new version of Mac OS X is normally an exciting time for members of the development community.</p> <p>The pre-release software they have been using for the last few months will be opened up to the wider world, and they can start making the most of all the fancy new features to improve their applications.</p> <p>But with every release there is also a smaller group of developers who aren't quite so happy, because Apple's update renders their own apps obsolete.</p> <p>OS X Mavericks, released on Tuesday 22 October, includes a number of additional features which had previously been a key selling point for specific apps. From major system features like iCloud Keychain, which synchronises saved passwords across multiple devices, to smaller tweaks like the introduction of tabs in Finder windows, most of those are also offered by independent developers.</p> <p>\"We expected this to come,\" says one such developer, Antonin Hildebrand. Hildebrand is the chief programmer of <a href=\"http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/\">TotalFinder</a>, an app which, among other things, adds tabbed browsing to the Finder. \"Tabs in Finder is such an obvious feature that it cannot be called duplication &hellip; I personally expected tabs in Finder to appear in Lion. Apple gave us a good two years to serve this niche.\"</p> <p>Hildebrand is resigned to the fact that Apple has knocked out a key selling point for his app &ndash; \"We will definitely lose many customers\" &ndash;&nbsp;but emphasises that TotalFinder <a href=\"http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/documentation\">still has advantages over what Apple offers</a>.</p> <h2>We aren't worried</h2> <p>It's a common refrain amongst developers placed in a sticky situation.&nbsp;\"There's a huge list of other stuff that Moom does that Mavericks doesn't,\" says Rob Griffiths, a partner at developers <a href=\"http://manytricks.com/\">Many Tricks</a>. <a href=\"http://manytricks.com/moom/\">Moom</a>, one of the company's programs, is favoured by users who have multiple monitors and want to have a different app running full-screen on each &ndash; a feature now built in to Mavericks.</p> <p>\"You can lay out your windows as you like, save that layout, and call it up when you wish. You can even have the layout activate automatically when you add or remove a display, as many do with laptops &hellip; I think you get the idea: we're not worried about Mavericks impacting Moom in any negative way.\"</p> <p>Some developers are even more upbeat, arguing that Apple moving onto their turf will be an overall positive. \"To be honest, we're pretty excited Apple is talking about strong passwords again,\" says David Chartier, from <a href=\"https://agilebits.com/\">AgileBits</a>, developers of <a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\">1Password</a>. With iCloud Keychain, Apple seems to be on the cusp of taking much of AgileBits' business, but Chartier doesn't see it that way.</p> <p>\"The good news is that the world listens when Apple speaks, so now the world is listening to the need for strong, unique passwords. As they say, a rising tide lifts all ships.\"</p> <p>Like Hildebrand and Griffiths, Chartier emphasises his company's unique additions. 1Password works with browsers other than Safari, operating systems other than Mac OS, and offers features beyond just password syncing. \"1Password is truly a full-featured identity manager with features like Secure Notes, Multiple &amp; Shared Vaults, and Wi-Fi Sync, a way to remain in complete control of your data so it never leaves your network or ends up in the cloud.\"</p> <h2>Sherlocked</h2> <p>All three developers are in a position common enough that it even has a name in the community. They have been \"sherlocked\".</p> <p>The term comes from 2002, when Apple updated Sherlock, an app built into OS X which searched users' computers and the web for them. Users noticed similarities between the new version 3.0 and Watson, a competing program developed by Karelia Software.</p> <p>\"Many users have contacted Karelia, congratulating us on Apple &lsquo;buying out&rsquo; Watson. However, Karelia Software was not involved in any aspect of Sherlock 3, other than serving as &hellip; shall we say &hellip; inspiration,\" <a href=\"http://www.karelia.com/watson/watsonFAQ.html\">the company wrote at the time</a>. But they were sanguine.</p> <p>\"With the addition of the new Google searching Tool for Watson &ndash; much more useful than the web-searching feature that is part of Sherlock 3 &ndash; we are confident that Watson will continue to be the market leader in web services, in spite of Sherlock 3.\"</p> <p>Sadly, Watson rapidly lost market share, and in 2004, Karelia discontinued the software.</p> <p>But not every program duplicated by Apple suffers the same fate. In 2011, the company upgraded its mobile operating system to iOS 5, and included a new feature called Reading List. Allowing users to save articles to read offline across multiple devices, it looked sure to put paid to the burgeoning field of &lsquo;read-later&rsquo; apps, such as Instapaper, Read It Later (now Pocket), and Readability.</p> <p>Instead, Chartier's prediction came true. Users, having been introduced to the concept of saving an item and reading it at their leisure, rapidly outgrew the tools Apple offered, and switched to dedicated apps. Pocket, which had <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/read-it-later-users-want-watch-it-later-too-638461\">4.5 million users in April 2012</a>, now boasts <a href=\"http://getpocket.com/blog/2013/09/10-million/\">over 10 million</a>.</p> <p>What makes the difference? Why did Watson die while Pocket soared?</p> <p>It helps if Apple's intervention into a field increases awareness of it, rather than simply doing a job previously done by others. When the company started shipping the Mail app with Macs in 2001, few will have seen it and been inspired to start using email, instead merely switching from previous paid apps to the free option.</p> <p>But even if Apple does introduce users to a new type of program, that counts for nothing if developers can't offer a reason to upgrade. \"One example: is that anyone can use QuickTime to record screen movies in Mountain Lion or Mavericks &hellip; yet ScreenFlow is doing a great business, because they offer so much more,\" says Griffiths. \"In general, you've got to offer a compelling feature that people feel is worth paying for. That's a tough thing to do, but some have managed to do quite well with it.\"</p> <p>&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/25/apple-os-x-mavericks-updates-pirated-iwork-aperture-apps\">It's hard to compete against free. It's even harder when Apple encourages piracy.</a></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420974774|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|e85c8d34055f6fbd7e0c2cfdaa553b2212bc41ad -->",

        "headline":"Berlin and the tech startup scene – 10 things to know before making the move",
        "body":"<p>I moved to Berlin in January this year and lived there for eight months, in which I gained and lost three jobs, two boyfriends, and one flat. Clearly, I had a whale of a time. Nonetheless, it's not quite as wonderful as the media would have you believe. Here's what I wish someone had told me beforehand:</p><p><strong>1. The Berlin startup scene is a total bubble</strong></p><p>It is without a doubt a 'scene': people value being part of it, they socialise within it, use startup buzzwords like UX and MVP, and in the process they cut off access to outsiders. Some people don't actually know what startups are. Seriously. When I first got a whiff of the startup scene, I was intrigued, and I think I started emitting some kind of hormone and was quickly dragged into its orbit.</p><p><strong>2. Wearing a tiger onesie to work isn't necessarily a smart plan</strong></p><p>This one I should have been able to work out for myself. Morale was low in the office as the future of our startup (Gidsy) was uncertain, and a tiger suit seemed like an excellent idea at the time. As it turns out, that was the day I was made redundant. So that was awkward. Lesson learned.</p><p><strong>3. Nobody has a real job</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421630414'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/25/1382700580502/Brandenburg-Gate-008.jpg' alt='Brandenburg Gate' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Admittedly, people tried to warn me. Like a relationship with a dodgy new boyfriend, I said: \"Oh but it'll be different with me\". It's not different. Proper, full-time jobs are few and far between, everybody else works weird hours for low pay, has various \"projects\" on the go which never materialise, and goes out on Sunday nights until 5am. It's a totally unsustainable (if highly enjoyable) lifestyle.</p><p><strong>4. It's possible to fall down the party hole</strong></p><p>Clubs stay open from Friday until Monday, so it's no wonder that people don't have real jobs. In fact, from my tireless field research, I've concluded that clubs are open all week too. Sometimes you find yourself coming home at 7am on a Wednesday, wondering what you're doing with your life. Spotting a man with a syringe doesn't help.</p><p><strong>5. It's incredibly inward-looking</strong></p><p>Everyone living in it is very Berlin-centric. They talk about the city, they love it, they live and breathe it and they complain about it. They follow Berlin blogs, they post about Berlin on Facebook, they share Berlin moments like in-jokes. The very act of writing this is hypocritical because it's all about Berlin. \"Oh, how meta,\" the hipsters would say.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421630415'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/25/1382700499522/Berlin-wall-004.jpg' alt='Berlin wall' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>6. Getting paid is a luxury not a right</strong></p><p>There's no minimum wage in Germany (land of plenty, yes, that economic superpower). Luckily, it's possible to live even on the princely sum of €491 (£418) per month. Expats love to complain that rent is no longer cheap due to the flood of expats (!) driving up prices. However, my rent was €225 per month including bills. It wasn't even a crack den.</p><p><strong>7. Fail culture rules</strong></p><p>Talk of failure is everywhere, and to be honest I would rather be winning. Startups choose to 'fail fast, fail hard, embrace failure', and so on. Sometimes this probably means: \"We have no idea what we're doing, but when we get it wrong it doesn't matter because we're a startup, and failure is awesome. The internet told me so.\"</p><p><strong>8. The independent bars and cafes are surprisingly similar</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421630416'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/25/1382700670519/Berlin-hustles-harder-008.jpg' alt='Berlin hustles harder' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When I was a tourist in Berlin, I bemoaned the lack of indie cafes in London and preached to the uninitiated about the myriad places in Berlin. Living there made me realise that 90% of them have identikit mismatched vintage furniture, candles, and possibly the same playlist audible in the background. Still rather lovely though.</p><p><strong>9. Nobody speaks German</strong></p><p>That's a slight exaggeration. However, despite spending time, money and effort grappling with the unwieldy German language, I found that I was surrounded by people from Spain, Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, everywhere. So English is what you hear in the streets and the office, and Germans I met spoke it fluently. So all this \"ich habe eine Schwester\" business was frankly embarrassing.</p><p><strong>10. Your circle of friends will be ever decreasing</strong></p><p>Berlin is amazingly transient. When I arrived, I went to lots of networking events, and a friend who had been there for two years asked if I could take her along as many of her friends had already left the city. Fortunately, the constant shift means that people are very open and friendly, and you might leave with a different batch of pals than the ones you started with.</p><p>Ok, so it goes up to 11 … Hey, it worked for Spinal Tap.</p><p><strong>11. The streets are not paved with gold</strong></p><p>They are strewn with graffiti and crack-addled weirdos, but don't let that stop you from visiting. A whirlwind weekend break in the city will leave you a little breathless and wanting more. I made the decision to break up with Berlin. We were in love, we fought a lot, and it was exhilarating for the most part, but I'm getting back together with London, my long-term love.</p><p><em>At the end of her time in Berlin, Lauren compiled a list of people to see, places to go, and more, in the form of the <a href=\"http://fakebananas.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/the-berlin-startup-cheat-sheet/\">Berlin Startup Cheat Sheet</a>.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420936900|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|b8ae4c6955c073014a894a51fa889ce836481d76 -->",

Both iPads will be on sale on 1 November.</p><p>Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, attempted to dismiss the growing threat from rivals fighting for consumer attention, saying:\"Everyone seems to be making a tablet, even some of the doubters. But regardless of what you might hear or read about how many are bought or sold or activated, iPad is used a lot more.\"</p><p>\"These new iPads underline Apple's dominance of the premium tablet market,\" said Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight. \"Apple seems determined to disrupt Microsoft's business model. Apple's strength in hardware is allowing it make free updates to its OS X operating system and offer its iLife suite free of charge with new devices. That's a real headache for Microsoft, whose business model for Windows and Office depends on licence fees and upgrade charges.\"</p><p>Earlier this month Reuters had warned that there was a risk that Apple could not deliver the new gadgets to consumers in time for Christmas, because of manufacturing delays. Cook, appearing to rebut those reports, said: \"But we couldn't be prouder to present all of them to you in time for the holidays.\"</p><p>Speaking at the launch event in California, Cook resorted to history to justify his company's competitive prospects, noting that the iPad had sold 170m units, which he said was \"four times more than all of those other tablets put together, and this is what is important to us, because when you make a great product with a great experience, this is how you know it, because people use it and, even more important to us, people love it.\"</p><p>Apple will have to contend with competing offerings in the shape of Google's  Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle Fire. The company's response was to drop the price of the year-old iPad mini to £249.</p><p>Tablet sales are expected to boom in the runup to Christmas – so much so that research companies reckon they will outsell PCs worldwide during this period. IDC estimates that a total of 84.1m tablets will be sold, against 83.1m PCs – which have seen sliding sales for more than a year and a half.Tablets are seeing rapid uptake. According to research firm eMarketer, there are 69.9m iPad users in the US, making up 22.1% of the population; overall, it reckons there are a total of 128.1m tablet users there, and that by 2017 it will hit 160.7m, or just under half the entire population. For the UK, it puts the figures at 11.8m iPad users, and 20m tablet users in all; by 2017, it reckons there will be 34.8m tablet users, 52.7% of the entire population, of which iPad users will make up 40%.</p><p>The first iPad mini, introduced last year, has become the world's bestselling tablet, even though Apple has seen its share of the market eroded in past months. In the second quarter, iPad sales fell to 14.6m, from 17m a year ago – though the previous year had included the launch of a new retina iPad with a higher-quality screen. That pushed Apple's overall share of the tablet market down to 39%.</p><p>Microsoft and Nokia – two rivals once dominant in their market segments – also unveiled new tablets on Tuesday. Microsoft refreshed its Surface line – including the RT version, which has seen such poor sales that the company had to write off $900m on unsold ones in July, and admitted it had only sold $833m worth.Nokia meanwhile launched its own tablet, the Lumia 2520. That too runs Windows RT – and makes Nokia the only other company besides Microsoft to run that software. Microsoft is presently bidding to buy Nokia's handset and tablet business in a deal that is expected to complete early in 2014.</p><p>While tablets running Google's Android software tend to be cheaper, Apple is able to point to its larger library of apps specifically designed for the iPad and iPad mini. Apple lists more than 375,000 apps designated to work on the iPad, compared with the \"low tens of thousands\" tablet apps in Google Play, according to research firm Canalys.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420688991|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|de2adda1de56895b6c511a215fa697bc87e15e35 -->",

        "headline":"Apple results: five things we learned",
        "body":"<p>During Apple&rsquo;s fourth quarter&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/28/apple-shares-fall-results-iphone-5c\">earnings call</a> chief executive Tim Cook expressed concern about the iPad mini and reiterated that Apple was still exploring 'new categories'.</p> <p>Along with a breakdown of the company&rsquo;s revenue, profits and sales, we learned a few things about Apple, its movements in the market and where it is likely heading to next.</p> <p>Here are five of the most interesting titbits.</p> <h2><strong>There may not be enough iPad minis with retina displays to go around</strong></h2> <p>Having just announced two brand new iPads, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/22/apple-ipad-air-launch-slimmer-design-fingerprint-sensor\">slimline 9.7in iPad Air</a> and the high-resolution 7.9in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/22/apple-ipad-mini-2-launch-retina-display\">iPad mini with retina display</a>, Apple doesn&rsquo;t seem confident that supply of the new iPad mini will keep up with demand.</p> <p>During the earnings call Cook said that \"it's not clear if we'll have enough\" stock of the new iPad mini to meet demand for launch on 1 November: \"it's not clear that everyone who wants one will be able to find one\". That means supplies of the new iPad mini will likely be limited in the run up to &ldquo;an iPad Christmas&rdquo;.</p> <h2><strong>Apple&rsquo;s still looking at &lsquo;new product categories&rsquo;</strong></h2> <p>Apple has long been anticipated to be working on a smart watch to challenge the Pebble, Sony&rsquo;s Smartwatch 2 and Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Gear. <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/apple-sold-37-4m-iphones-19-5m-ipads-as-mac-numbers-dip-1146484\">Sticking to his April statement</a>, Cook reiterated that Apple sees \"significant opportunities ahead of us in both current product categories and new ones.\"</p> <p>Cook continued: \"In terms of new product categories, if you look at the skills Apple has in hardware, software and services and an incredible app ecosystem, these set of things are very unique.&nbsp;We obviously believe that we can use our skills in building other great products that are in categories that represent areas we do not participate in today. We're confident in that.\"</p> <p>While that doesn&rsquo;t specifically call out any particular new products, Cook has said in the past that &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/sep/02/smart-watch-apple-samsung-google-microsoft\">the wrist is interesting</a>&rdquo;, while analysts and industry experts have long speculated an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/10/smartwatch-apple-iwatch\">Apple iWatch</a> to be the next big Apple product category shift. It is also possible that Apple&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;hobby&rdquo;, the Apple TV set top box will see an upgrade to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/23/apple-future-analysis\">something more than a simple smart TV extender</a>, as has long been suggested by analysts.</p> <h2><strong>iPhones growing fast, but Samsung growing faster</strong></h2> <p>During the earnings call, Cook explained that Apple&rsquo;s iPhone sales are up 25.7% year-on-year to 33.8m units sold globally. However, research firm Strategy Analytics claimed this morning that global smartphone shipments grew 45% annually, and that Samsung&rsquo;s product line was up 55% in sales.</p> <p>Cook stuck to Apple's now-traditional response to market-share questions: \"it's about usage and love, not shipments&rdquo; while maintaining that that customer loyalty and device usage is the most important part of Apple&rsquo;s revenue stream going forward.</p> <p>\"We are not solely focused on unit share, as I&rsquo;ve said many times, but we&rsquo;re focused on usage in customer&rsquo;s side, the loyalty and other things that are very important to us.\"</p> <p>Apple's chief financial officer Peter Oppenheimer pointed to another regular source for Apple: ChangeWave's customer satisfaction rate surveys, with the most recent one giving iPhone a 96% score. Oppenheimer also poked at Apple's main rivals.</p> <p>\"Kantar measured a 92% customer loyalty rate, significantly higher than the competition. And we believe that a great customer experience translates to much higher usage. In fact, Experian reported that iPhone users spend an average of 53% more time each day on their phone than Android phone users,\" he said.</p> <p>Apple generated $4.3bn in iTunes revenue in the last quarter, mainly driven by the sales of apps, something itself driven by user engagement with the company&rsquo;s phones and tablets.</p> <h2><strong>The iPhone 5c isn't Apple's entry-level iPhone. It's the older iPhone 4S</strong></h2> <p>Responding to criticism that Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;entry-level&rdquo; iPhone 5c experiment had failed to secure the lower end of the market, Cook explained that the iPhone 5c was never meant as a cut-price iPhone:</p> <p>\"If you look at what we&rsquo;ve done with our iPhone line, we&rsquo;re selling the iPhone 4s as our entry offer.&rdquo;</p> <p>Cook continued by clarifying that the iPhone 5c was aimed as a mid-range device in Apple&rsquo;s smartphone portfolio, despite what analysts had been saying:</p> <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re selling the iPhone 5c as sort of a mid-tier offer. I realise that some people were reading rumours that the entry phone would be the 5c, but that was never our intent, obviously.&rdquo;</p> <p>Using the iPhone 4 as a testbed, Cook described Apple&rsquo;s experimentation with lower price points in different regions, saying that &ldquo;we were selling the iPhone 4 in very good volumes&rdquo; and that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hoping and thinking that, that will continue with the 4s.\"</p> <h2><strong>Apple bought 15 companies, but we only know who eight of them are</strong></h2> <p>Apple is well known for sitting on a large stockpile of $146.8bn in cash, which likely came in handy for the 15 &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; company acquisitions Apple made in its fiscal 2013 - &ldquo;an average of one acquisition every three to four weeks,\" Cook said.</p> <p>While Apple is known to buy up smaller companies to acquire skills and technologies, it generally doesn&rsquo;t announce or comment on purchases. However, as technology blog <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/28/apple-made-15-strategic-acquisitions-in-fiscal-13-leaving-7-undiscovered/\">TechCrunch points out</a>, we already know about eight of Apple&rsquo;s acquisitions this year, leaving seven unaccounted for.</p> <p>Within the last year, Apple bought several location services technology companies including WiFiSlam, Locationary, Hopstop and Embark, collectively covering indoor location and public transport.</p> <p>Apple also acquired Cue, likely as a boost to Siri&rsquo;s functionality; Matcha, perhaps to enhance Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; smart recommendation technology for iTunes; Passif Semiconductor, which manufactured low-energy processor components, and AlgoTrim, a company that specialised in data compression.</p> <p><strong>&bull; In October, Apple's profits and shares fell amid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/28/apple-shares-fall-results-iphone-5c\">fears over the company's iPhone 5C sales</a>, despite a record 33.8m iPhones sold in the last quarter</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421190439|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|8c525fae5aff32cf2bb1daa08590e6eee51218da -->",

        "body":"<p>It's January 2015 and my four-year plan to take Swindon Town to the Premier League isn't going so well. We're mired in a League One relegation dogfight, the players are injured or knackered, and every day an ex-pro, rival manager or snarky journalist publicly reminds everybody I'm under pressure. I'm hauled before the board and hold onto my job only by promising 10 points from the next five games, an all-but-impossible feat given the fixture list and rock-bottom morale. It's then that Nile Ranger knocks on my door and says he's better than Swindon and wants out. I want to sing \"go go Nile Ranger\" to the Power Rangers theme tune, but I need his goals and tell him he's going nowhere. \"I'm not at all happy with how you've handled this,\" he says, storming out, and a day later a story is leaked to the press that I've lost the dressing room. A month later, I'm toast.</p><p>I was expecting a terrific tactical simulation from Sport's Interactive's latest offering – and it is – but I was surprised to find it's also akin to a crude Telltale adventure game you could call The Walking Damned United. Interactions with press, players and staff have featured before, but never with this sophistication. From asking your captain to have a quiet word with a sulking striker, to rebuking a fellow manager for failing to give your loanee youngster first team football as agreed, the possibilities are vast. There's no headline-grabbing improvement in 2014 to match last year's Classic mode – discounting Linux support and cloud saves – but it's these dealings that define its character.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421132390'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/10/28/1382971219107/Football-Manager-2014-tac-001.jpg' alt='Football Manager 2014: tactics' width='460' height='345' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Football Manager 2014: tactics</figcaption></figure><p>Media relations are significantly spruced up and you'll be asked more varied questions, your responses ranging from calm to animated. While fieriness can be fun, it makes managerial progression much harder, like adopting evil-alignment in an RPG or being Paolo Di Canio. Play the media's game and you can build relationships with individual journalists, making them more susceptible to your car window patter on transfer deadline day. The latter now appears in Classic mode and captures brilliantly the day's absurd countdown, with you failing to get players you should have got cheaply a month ago owing to paperwork not being completed on time. The only thing missing is a running commentary from Jim \"Two Phones\" White.</p><p>Still, dealings with the media remain imperfect. You can be asked the same question, worded slightly differently, three times in a row. While this is indeed what real press conferences can be like, the unintentional satire isn't fun to play. At other times, the questions bear no relation to reality. A week after a defender made two individual errors that led directly to goals, I'm asked to explain the secret of his \"great form\". Likewise, there's a lack of context to the pronouncements others make. A week that sees a local derby in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday followed by the same fixture in the league on Saturday produces identikit reactions from players and pundits before each game.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421132391'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/10/28/1382971098691/Football-Manager-2014-tra-001.jpg' alt='Football Manager 2014: transfer deadline day' width='460' height='345' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Football Manager 2014: transfer deadline day</figcaption></figure><p>Such frustrations are noticeable because the developers have done a great job of cutting them elsewhere. Your newly colour-coded inbox allows you to prioritise and deal with almost every issue from a single screen, which frees you up to focus on the important matters like why your corners hit the first defender every single time. Tactics are filtered through one unified system, with sliders replaced by a raft of more realistic instructions and expanded player roles. The latter go far beyond the traditional playmaker/ball winner axis, but there are decent descriptions of the false nine or enganche provided in case you don't have Inverting the Pyramid to hand. Feedback from your staff is better than ever, with star ratings indicating a player's proficiency in any given role, and during matches your assistant will offer a running commentary of suggestions which can be implemented with a single click. These mostly make sense but there's an occasional disconnect between the proposal and intended outcome. Accepting the advice that \"we need to get more shots on target\" translates to \"work ball into box\" for example, which might go against your core match plan.</p><p>Such discrepancies are amplified by the match engine, which remains the least satisfying aspect of the series. Nobody expects Fifa 13 presentation, but you do hope for a better translation of your tactics to the engine. It generally works well but errors are glaring. One particular bugbear was defenders standing off opponents no matter how many times I screamed at them to mark tightly and get stuck in. On the umpteenth occasion a striker ran unimpeded through the heart of my defence to score I nearly quit-out in frustration. Still, for the other times when everything comes together, you can now create and export custom highlights packages.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421132392'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/10/28/1382971384877/Football-Manager-2014-mat-001.jpg' alt='Football Manager 2014: match report' width='460' height='308' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Football Manager 2014: match report</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, if those in-depth features aren't your thing then Classic mode returns in improved form. The developers have wisely avoided adding many more features, concentrating instead on making the pared-down experience respond better to your choices. You can now create detailed plans for instant matches, explicitly stating when subs should be made and how your team should react to different eventualities. This makes using the instant result button less of a lottery should you choose to power through a season in an evening.</p><p>It's no longer a straight shoot between the simplicity of Classic mode and a behemoth, however. Play the standard career and you start by sitting down with your assistant to flesh out precisely which aspects of management you want to handle. If you're bored by the toil of training regimes or talking to the press gives you hives, you can entrust your number two with such distractions. If you want something compact then challenges also make a welcome reappearance and the integration of Steam Workshop should also ensure a bountiful supply of user-created content in the near future.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421132393'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/10/28/1382971851328/Football-Manager-2014-neg-001.jpg' alt='Football Manager 2014: negotiations with the board' width='460' height='339' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Football Manager 2014: negotiations with the board</figcaption></figure><p>Promoting his book recently, Sir Alex Ferguson kept reiterating his mantra of control. The joy of Football Manager 2014 comes in deciding precisely what aspects of management of which you want to take direct direct control, and in navigating its myriad systems to stamp your own philosophy on a club. Where it falls down, most notably with the match engine, is in those moments where your control seems inexplicably lost and the carefully constructed alternate-reality breaks. At its best, you see the fruits of your labours all too clearly. Ahead of derby day with Bristol City, I declared midfielder Stephen McLaughlin to be their weak link. He promptly volleyed home his first strike of the season to give them the win. A fun and life-absorbing game, yes, but a fickle one. In so many ways, it's like the real thing.</p><p><em>Reviewed on PC</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421129078|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|4c497ae30385898e5dff94fb834b3d0567b35e3e -->",

        "body":"<p>Motorola has revealed its latest effort to shake up the smartphone market: Project Ara, described by the Google subsidiary as \"a free, open hardware platform for creating highly modular smartphones\".</p> <p>It was <a href=\"http://motorola-blog.blogspot.jp/2013/10/goodbye-sticky-hello-ara.html\">announced last night in a blog post</a> explaining that Project Ara handsets will consist of a central \"endoskeleton\" and additional modules created by a range of other developers and companies.</p> <p>The first Module Developer's Kit will be made available \"sometime this winter\", raising the prospect that Project Ara smartphones could be on sale sometime in 2014. <a href=\"http://www.dscout.com/ara\">Motorola is recruiting people to become \"Ara Scouts\"</a> to help test the devices, similar to Google's Glass Explorer scheme for its Glass augmented eyewear.</p> <p>\"We want to do for hardware what the Android platform has done for software: create a vibrant third-party developer ecosystem, lower the barriers to entry, increase the pace of innovation, and substantially compress development timelines,\" explained Paul Eremenko from Motorola's advanced technology and projects team, which is leading the Project.</p> <p>\"Our goal is to drive a more thoughtful, expressive, and open relationship between users, developers, and their phones. To give you the power to decide what your phone does, how it looks, where and what it&rsquo;s made of, how much it costs, and how long you&rsquo;ll keep it.\"</p> <p>Eremenko added that Project Ara has been in development for more than a year now, although a six-month road-trip for Sticky &ndash; \"a truck wrapped entirely in velcro and filled with rooted, hackable Motorola smartphones and high-end 3D printing equipment\" &ndash; was a key influence on the current shape of the project.</p> <p>This isn't the first attempt at a modular smartphone. Motorola is already working with Dave Hakkens, founder of the <a href=\"https://phonebloks.com/\">Phonebloks</a> project to create a similar device, where each hardware \"blok\" is repairable and replaceable.</p> <p>\"We&rsquo;ve done deep technical work. Dave created a community. The power of open requires both. So we will be working on Project Ara in the open, engaging with the Phonebloks community throughout our development process,\" wrote Eremenko.</p> <p>Just as relevant a comparison is Modu, the Israeli startup that tried to get a modular smartphone off the ground in 2008, but which <a href=\"http://bgr.com/2011/01/12/employees-fight-for-pay-as-modu-is-forced-to-close-its-doors/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+TheBoyGeniusReport+(BGR+|+Boy+Genius+Report)\">shut down in early 2011</a>. Google reportedly <a href=\"http://bgr.com/2011/05/19/google-to-acquire-modu-patents-for-4-9-million/\">acquired the company's patent portfolio later that year</a>, so Modu's technology may live on in Project Ara.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421177643|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|f1659f420be293760263f3d9ac85fa694d9c66af -->",

More Explorers means more feedback, and more feedback means better Glass.\"</p> <p>Igloo-dwellers shouldn't get too excited: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/28/google-will-soon-let-glass-users-upgrade-their-hardware-and-invi\">Engadget has published the email</a> being sent out to Explorers, and it specifies that all new buyers must be a US resident with a local shipping address or the ability to pick up their Glass from Google offices in New York, San Francisco or Los Angeles.</p> <p>Google is also promising the first batch of Explorers that they'll be able to \"swap out\" their Glass for a new and improved model later in 2013. \"This hardware update will allow your Glass to work with future lines of shades and prescription frames, and we&rsquo;ll also include a mono earbud,\" explained Google.</p> <p>The hardware upgrade will apply to anyone who bought Glass before 28 October, with customers due to be emailed with details in November.</p> <p>Google hopes expanding the Glass Explorer programme will bring it more feedback to continue refining the product ahead of its commercial release in 2014, but will its chosen method bring more diversity to the scheme?</p> <p>Past criticism that Glass's early adopters are heavy on white, male technology executives may not be countered by getting that same group to pick the next wave of users.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421186578|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|52994124b257ffc985e99ee9a6b6cb623843e7c7 -->",

        "body":"<p>A high-profile file-sharing site has been revealed to be a year-long pirate \"honeypot\", collecting data on users, file hosters and websites.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.uploadertalk.com/ut-site-information-center/ut-news-announcements/2008-special-announcement-ut-acquired-nukepiracy-wdf-consultant-nukepiracy.html\">The revelation</a>, which had users of the forum up in arms, accompanied the purchase of the UploaderTalk (UT) site by US-based anti-piracy company <a href=\"http://www.nukepiracy.com/\">Nuke Piracy</a>.</p> <p>A honeypot is a facility, in this case a site, run under false pretences that encourages criminal behaviour in an effort to collect incriminating data.</p> <p>&ldquo;That's right &ndash; the biggest swerve ever,&rdquo; the operator of UT, known only as WDF, <a href=\"http://www.uploadertalk.com/ut-site-information-center/ut-news-announcements/2008-special-announcement-ut-acquired-nukepiracy-wdf-consultant-nukepiracy.html\">said in a statement</a> about the purchase of the site. &ldquo;I, WDF, work for the anti-piracy people!&rdquo;</p> <h2>Set up to collect data</h2> <p>WDF, having previously been a senior member of another high-profile filesharing site called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wjunction.com/\">WJunction</a>, started UT a year ago &ndash; a site designed to attract people who upload copyrighted files to file-hosting sites for profit, as well as representatives of file-hosters touting affiliate and incentive schemes.</p> <p>&ldquo;UT was set up for a number of reasons. But mostly to be a sounding board, proof of concept ... and to collect data,&rdquo; said WDF.</p> <p>&ldquo;I collected info on file hosts, web hosts, websites. I suckered shitloads of you,&rdquo; WDF bragged.</p> <h2>Proprietary and unconventional methods</h2> <p>It is unclear what WDF or Nuke Piracy, a private anti-piracy firm, intends to do with the data collected. Nuke Piracy, based in Arkansas, USA, clearly states on its website that it uses &ldquo;proprietary and unconventional methods we do not discuss or disclose our methodologies, processes, and procedures publicly.&rdquo;</p> <p>It is likely that Nuke Piracy will use the data as part of its anti-piracy actions, collected from UT and possibly WJunction as well, given that WDF had access to sensitive data on the site as a senior management including user accounts.</p> <p>&ldquo;I work for Nuke Piracy now, this is very bad for anyone profiting from piracy,&rdquo; proclaimed WDF.</p> <p>Nuke Piracy, which launched its own site and &ldquo;IP theft and copyright infringement detection, mitigation, and prevention&rdquo; services in February 2013, has reportedly made several moves to <a href=\"http://www.nukepiracy.com/special-announcement-nukepiracy-acquires-several-related-websites/\">acquire active piracy sites</a>, set up honeypots, as well as an anti-piracy news site called <a href=\"http://www.cashwhore.net/\">CashWhore.net</a>.</p> <p><strong>&bull; In October, the notorious BitTorrent site <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/isohunt-bittorrent-search-shut-mpaa\">isoHunt shut down prematurely</a> after losing its battle with copyright holders</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420934801|2013-11-05T11:03:59Z|7ffd6975672eaa890fceefa2a49276ad46991e8d -->",
