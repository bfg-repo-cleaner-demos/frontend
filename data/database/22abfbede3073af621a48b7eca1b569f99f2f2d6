You know, just between you and me, I think that ‘Dick’ might be a euphemism for ‘penis’. Anyway, thanks for reading. I’ll be back next week to liveblog another film, so be sure to join me for that. Follow me on Twitter (I’m <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/StuHeritage\">@StuHeritage</a>) for even more terrible genital-related puns than you’ve just seen.

Really slowly, on a horse-drawn carriage that moves slowly enough to be caught by plenty of other vehicles. But then Big Dick has full sex with Barbara Windsor, so he wins.

The chase is on. Kenneth Williams recognises the face of the prostitute who held him up, but isn't sure where from. This is despite the fact that he has spent approximately 90% of his screentime talking to the rector.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280e0c9e4b0f37bee4ff4d5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:53:31.512Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Kenneth Williams doesn't recognise that the prostitute he's just accosted is actually Big Dick. In fact, he actually seems fairly aroused by the sight of him. But Big Dick uses Kenneth's inexplicable sexual desire against him. It's a stick up. This is also a double entendre, because 'stick up' means 'erection', but it doesn't count because it wasn't in the film.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280e053e4b07aa4168b49c2\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:50:23.564Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Because the Carry On films are precise bits of machinery where everything onscreen plays a vital role in progressing the plot, Big Dick decides that the best way to break Barbara Windsor out of jail is to dress up as a prostitute himself. Because of course it is.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280e008e4b0f37bee4ff4d4\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:49:01.283Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Kenneth Williams is now seeking counsel from Big Dick (posing as the rector) about what to do with Barbara Windsor. But enough of that because here come the prostitutes again.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280df9ae4b0f37bee4ff4d3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:47:15.910Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&quot;I'm not easy to pluck&quot; says Joan Sims. The word 'pluck' rhymes with a vulgarity that means 'sexual intercourse'. This is classic misdirection, because Joan Sims is a prostitute.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280df17e4b07aa4168b49c1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:45:32.528Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>However, she's now been outed as one of Big Dick's accomplices. Big Dick discovers this during a scene where Hattie Jacques reveals the care in which she's been tending to his organ. Not to belabour the point, but 'organ' is another word for 'penis'.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280de5ee4b07aa4168b49c0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:43:38.482Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Williams has spied Barbara Windsor, and mistakes her for Big Dick. There is a chase where people skid around on soap and fall over onto prostitutes and then, to prove her identity, Windsor takes her top off. She's wearing an especially see-through vest. So now I know what Barbara Windsor's boobs look like. It's weird. It's like seeing your granny naked.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280ddefe4b0f37bee4ff4d1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:40:34.218Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Kenneth Williams's boss has now come to visit. &quot;Turpin took my most treasured possession, his ladyfriend says. &quot;I thought that disappeared long ago&quot; says Williams. &quot;I mean my mother's bracelet!&quot; she replies. There is an audible 'wah-wah' noise. He thought she was talking about her hymen!&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280dd32e4b07aa4168b49bf\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:38:08.793Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Big Dick is holding a fundraising jumble sale for the church. It serves only to make Hattie Jacques suspicious that her beloved rector is actually Big Dick. Also 'rector' sounds a bit like 'rectum' and 'erection'. I am disappointed that Carry On Dick didn't do more with golden material like this.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280dbc1e4b07aa4168b49be\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:30:37.295Z\">1.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&quot;She's after a rise&quot; says Sid James. This is funny because she is an employee of his, and also because 'rise' is another word for 'erection', which is something that happens to a penis.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280db7be4b0f37bee4ff4cd\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:29:26.385Z\">1.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Hattie Jacques, who plays Big Dick's housemaid, is now attempting to have sex with Big Dick. Even though Big Dick is basically Robin Thicke's grandpa.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280db33e4b0f37bee4ff4cc\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:28:08.072Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Big James is now teaching Barbara Windsor how to count. He is doing this by counting her boobs. In case you're not watching this live, Barbara Windsor has got two boobs.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280da9ae4b0f37bee4ff4cb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:25:45.560Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Barbara Windsor is trying to have sex with Big Dick. He manages to protest in a way that makes him sound as if he's talking about Jesus. Which serves some sort of purpose, I think.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d9d5e4b07aa4168b49bb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:22:54.952Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And Kenneth Williams is in the stocks, being pelted with bad cabbages by peasants. He's constantly pelted, unless he happens to be having a conversation with Jock Strapp, in which case the peasants stop and wait for him to finish. If nothing else, you can't deny that this film has very polite peasants.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d981e4b07aa4168b49ba\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:20:15.033Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>This film is basically Batman Begins, isn't it?</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d91ee4b0f37bee4ff4c7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:19:35.732Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>At the meeting point that I told you would be important just now, there's an elaborate double-bluff and Kenneth Williams ends up being arrested. Kenneth Williams isn't really having a very good time of it.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d8aae4b07aa4168b49b9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:17:44.057Z\">1.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&quot;I shall piss in your ale&quot; says the cheating man from earlier. The melodica tries to censor the word 'piss' but it starts late and only obscures the word 'it'. Still, boobs and moderate swearing. Best lunchtime ever.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d863e4b0f37bee4ff4c5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:16:17.414Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Then Barbara Windsor accosts him and arranges a meeting with Big Dick. I'm telling you this because it's probably going to be important later on.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d81be4b055987af6775f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:14:54.211Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Kenneth Williams sends information about Big Dick to his boss by carrier pigeon. But the pigeon poos on his hat.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d792e4b055987af6775c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:12:58.545Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Back at the church, the rector tells anyone who has managed to stay faithful to their wife to leave. One man gets up to go, but only because he remembered where he left his hat last night. He left it at the home of the woman who he is cheating on his wife with.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d733e4b08521f0cfb5bb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:11:37.155Z\">1.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Meanwhile, back at the church, there is a terrible bell-ringing accident and Barbara Windsor's boobs fall out of her top. In the trailer I posted, this scene was blurred out. It's quite graphic for a Monday lunchtime.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d556e4b055987af6775b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:04:19.326Z\">1.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Joan traps Kenneth in her bedroom. She tries to undress him, but he's suspicious because she's French. Then he falls over into a bath and gets chased around by prostitutes. Then he falls down the stairs, and his extensive injuries are soundtracked by a timpani noise. Just like in real life.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d46be4b08521f0cfb5b9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:01:14.019Z\">1.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The rector has now snuck upstairs to see Sims, who he robbed half an hour earlier under the guise of Big Dick. He informs her of the deformation on Big Dick's penis. We're basically watching a middle-aged man tell a woman what his penis looks like. Sims reacts with enthusiasm, because it means she gets to look at a lot of penises - starting with Kenneth Williams's.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T13:01:38.225Z\">at 1.01pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d3f4e4b08521f0cfb5b8\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T12:57:38.653Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Interestingly, the word 'penis' appears to be censored here. Every time someone tries to say it, it's replaced with a weird blast of melodica. It's as if Damon Albarn had soundtracked a Lars Von Trier film.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d39fe4b08521f0cfb5b5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T12:56:11.413Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Joan Sims is introducing the prostitutes with a cheeky rhyme. &quot;Here are the prostitutes, they live under the sea/ If you pay them extra, they'll cover you in wee&quot;.

He's looking at the prostitutes, who are all dressed like Romans now. Shame. I miss the mermaids. They're shepherdesses now. I miss the Romans. They're nymphs now. I miss the shepherdesses.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d1dfe4b055987af67756\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T12:48:32.747Z\">12.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Some of the prostitutes are dressed like mermaids. But there's an ad break. Of all the cliffhangers I've ever seen, 'How did the prostitutes become mermaids?' is probably my least favourite.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d180e4b08521f0cfb5b1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T12:47:13.272Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So Jock Strapp tries to identify Big Dick by crawling around public toilets staring at penises with a magnifying glass. Needless to say, the men in the pub don't take too kindly to this! But it's OK, because here come the prostitutes.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d0d8e4b08521f0cfb5b0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T12:45:49.612Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Williams is posing as a highwayman called Dandy Desmond. He's bribing a crone, who reveals that Big Dick has a funny birthmark on his penis. Do you see? Carry On Dick has a double meaning, because it's about a man called dick who has a distinctive penis. It's this intelligent attention to detail that made the carry on films what they are today.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5280d09be4b08521f0cfb5af\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-11T12:42:39.783Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Fancy and Strapp are now in The Old Cock Inn.

This week, I’m liveblogging Carry On Dick. I’ve give you a minute to let the magnitude of that last sentence sink in fully.</p> <p>Carry On Dick marks a watershed moment in the Carry On series. It’s the last one to star Sid James, Barbara Windsor and Hattie Jacques, as well as the last one to be written by Talbot Rothwell. I expect this is either because they all wanted to go out on a high, or because this film is so monumentally terrible that none of them wanted to be associated with the series any more. I guess we’ll find out soon enough.</p> <p>Anyway, you may have guessed that Carry On Dick is about Dick Turpin, although I suspect that the fact that this film exists has less to do with Turpin’s historical relevance and more to do with the way that he was named after a penis. Imagine if his parents had called him Big Wobbly Boobies instead. We’d have never heard the end of it.</p> <p>Carry On Dick begins at 12:25 on Channel 4. I do hope you’ll join me. To whet your appetite, here’s the trailer. I sure hope you like punishingly unrelenting repetition of the word ‘Dick’ for comic effect.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywswzAK26CI\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywswzAK26CI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422186326|2013-11-11T15:34:09Z|eaa9c1e6340f1fe604db7fcc35e0b0a0ac000246 -->",
