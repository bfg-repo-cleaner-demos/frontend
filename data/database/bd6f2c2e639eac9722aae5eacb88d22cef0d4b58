Moraes, head of the civil liberties committee inquiry on mass surveillance of EU citizens, writes that the Snowden documents suggest that &quot;the type of surveillance that is taking place by intelligence services is completely disproportionate in the important fight against terrorism and for security&quot;. The allegations &quot;need to be investigated&quot;, he writes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am leading a European Parliament delegation to Washington on 28-30 October which will allow us to discuss directly with US counterparts the alleged surveillance activities by the American NSA and any impact they have in terms of EU citizens' fundamental right to privacy.<br />Since the Edward Snowden revelations in June, both authorities in the US and the EU agree that a public debate on these issues is welcome and necessary. <br />We consider it extremely important to meet with NSA’s Director, General Keith Alexander, who has repeatedly stated the importance of dialogue. Given the gravity of these accusations, the pivotal role he plays within the NSA and the political message that such a meeting would make, we are hoping that he will respond to our invitation positively.</p> </blockquote> <p>Moraes mentions the recent approval by the European parliament of an amended package of legislation that would overhaul EU data protection rules that date from 1995. The European parliament also voted on Wednesday to suspend the Swift agreement, the international system used for transferring money electronically, which is based in Europe, because of suggestions the United States may have violated it, accessing more data than it was allowed to. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key question is where will all these allegations lead to - for my part and my involvement with the European parliament's inquiry, emphasis has to be put on ensuring that there is a strong legal framework in place in the EU which not only protects EU citizens’ fundamental right to privacy but also ensures that member states and third countries, including the US, respect this right too.</p> </blockquote> <p>In September the European parliament's civil liberties committee launched a public inquiry into the surveillance of EU citizens revealed by Snowden. But Moraes complains that no EU member states have agreed to have their intelligence agencies appear at the public hearings.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is absolutely necessary that EU governments respond to these requests so that we can establish facts and ensure that European citizens are fully informed. It is only by participation of these intelligence authorities that we can get clarification on their surveillance programmes, especially in relation to their existence, scope, legality and proportionality.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T16:55:13.476Z\">at 4.55pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-526e83d5e4b08f00895224f3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T15:35:52.431Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/28/us-ambassador-spain-nsa-spying-allegations-costos-video\">video shows James Costos</a>, the US ambassador to Spain, arriving at the foreign ministry to meet officials. </p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/28/us-ambassador-spain-nsa-spying-allegations-costos-video\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"1987917\" data-video-name=\"US ambassador to Spain, James Costos, summoned over NSA spying allegations - video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\" data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/28/1382970287154/US-ambassador-to-Spain-Ja-001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-421129663\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/28/1382970287154/US-ambassador-to-Spain-Ja-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/28/131028Spain-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/28/131028Spain_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/28/131028Spain_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/28/131028Spain/131028Spain.m3u8\"></source> </video> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526e82c6e4b0509529e124ab\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T15:31:16.293Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spain</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Spanish government has warned the US that revelations of widespread spying by the National Security Agency could, if confirmed, “lead to a breakdown in the traditional trust” between the two countries, writes <strong>Paul Hamilos</strong> in Madrid.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The White House has so far declined to comment on the El Mundo report.

They reveal that during G20 meetings in April and September 2009 GCHQ used what one document calls &quot;ground-breaking intelligence capabilities&quot; to intercept the communications of visiting delegations.</p> <p>This included:</p> <p>• Setting up internet cafes where they used an email interception programme and key-logging software to spy on delegates' use of computers;</p> <p>• Penetrating the security on delegates' BlackBerrys to monitor their email messages and phone calls;</p> <p>• Supplying 45 analysts with a live round-the-clock summary of who was phoning who at the summit;</p> <p>• Targeting the Turkish finance minister and possibly 15 others in his party;</p> <p>• Receiving reports from an NSA attempt to eavesdrop on the Russian leader, Dmitry Medvedev, as his phone calls passed through satellite links to Moscow.</p> <p>The documents suggest that the operation was sanctioned in principle at a senior level in the government of the then prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown\">Gordon Brown</a>, and that intelligence, including briefings for visiting delegates, was passed to British ministers.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526e7879e4b0509529e124a5\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T14:53:01.642Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Washington rally</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In case you missed it, there was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/26/protesters-rally-washington-against-nsa-surveillance-video\">rally </a>in protest against the surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden in Washington, DC, on Saturday.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/nsa-rally-stop-watching-washington-snowden\">Jim Newell reports</a>, thousands gathered to march, chant and listen to speakers and performers in a day called &quot;Stop Watching Us&quot;. </p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/26/protesters-rally-washington-against-nsa-surveillance-video\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"1987386\" data-video-name=\"Protesters rally in Washington against NSA surveillance - video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\" data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/26/1382806821105/Demonstrators-Protest-NSA-005.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-421029776\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/26/1382806821105/Demonstrators-Protest-NSA-005.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/26/131024NSA-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/26/131024NSA_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/26/131024NSA/131024NSA.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/26/131024NSA_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure> <p>As Jim points out, Stop Watching Us was sponsored by an unusually broad coalition of left- and rightwing groups, including everything from the American Civil Liberties Union, the Green Party, Color of Change and Daily Kos to the Libertarian Party, FreedomWorks and Young Americans for Liberty.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526e718ae4b08f00895224ef\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T14:18:22.640Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Associated Press has a report on how the meeting between US ambassador James Costos and Spanish foreign ministry officials went.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Afterward, the ministry made no direct reference to the El Mundo report but called on US authorities to hand over all the necessary information concerning &quot;supposed eavesdropping carried out in Spain&quot;.</p> <p> Spain warned the United States &quot;of the importance of preserving the climate of confidence existing in bilateral relations and to know the extent of practices, which if true, are impropriate and unacceptable between friendly allies,&quot; the ministry said in a statement.</p> <p> Costos, for his part, reminded Spain how it has benefited from US intelligence.</p> <p> The US &quot;acknowledges that some of our closest allies have raised concerns about the recent series of unauthorised disclosures of classified information,&quot; the ambassador said.</p> <p> He said the programmes referred to in the media &quot;are national security programmes that have played a critical role in protecting citizens of the United States.

But he also looks at the extraordinary level of legal, and possibly illegal, phone-tapping carried out by the Spanish intelligence services. Paul writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Under Spanish law a judge must give permission before a phone can be tapped, and is then required to permanently supervise the execution of that legal order. According to Boye, there are around one million phone lines currently being monitored in Spain, and given the number of judges, he says that works out at an average 600 wiretaps supposedly being supervised by each judge. That's a lot of work.

The piece shone some light on how Greenwald may proceed in reporting on the Snowden documents he has in his possession once he moves on to the new news website he is setting up with eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.</p> <p>Keller asked Greenwald what his policy would be on publishing information “that some would argue jeopardises national security”. Greenwald replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As for taking into account dangers posed to innocent life before publishing: nobody disputes that journalists should do this. But I don’t give added weight to the lives of innocent Americans as compared to the lives of innocent non-Americans, nor would I feel any special fealty to the US government as opposed to other governments when deciding what to publish …</p> <p>I have no objection to the process whereby the White House is permitted to give input prior to the publication of sensitive secrets.</p> <p>Indeed, WikiLeaks, advocates of radical transparency, went to the White House and sought guidance before publishing the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, but the White House<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/08/20/wikileaks_5/\"> refused</a> to respond, then had the temerity to criticize WikiLeaks for publishing material that it said should have been withheld. That pre-publication process is both journalistically sensible (journalists should get as much relevant information as they can before making publication decisions) and legally wise (every Espionage Act lawyer will say that such consultation can help prove journalistic intent when publishing such material). For all the N.S.A. reporting I’ve done — not just at The Guardian but with media outlets around the world — the White House was notified by editors before the fact of publication (though in the vast, vast majority of cases, their demands that information be suppressed were disregarded due to lack of specific reasons in favor of suppression).</p> <p>My objection is not to that process itself but to specific instances where it leads to the suppression of information that ought to be public.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is what Greenwald said when asked about his venture with Omidyar:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We absolutely believe that strong, experienced editors are vital to good journalism, and intend to have plenty of those. Editors are needed to ensure the highest level of factual accuracy, to verify key claims, and to help journalists make choices that avoid harm to innocents.</p> <p>But they are not needed to impose obsolete stylistic rules, or to snuff out the unique voice and passion of the journalists, or to bar any sort of declarative statements when high-level officials prevaricate, or to mandate government-requested euphemisms in lieu of factually clear terms, or to vest official statements or official demands for suppression with superior status. In sum, editors should be there to empower and enable strong, highly factual, aggressive adversarial journalism, not to serve as roadblocks to neuter or suppress the journalism.</p> <p>We intend to treat claims from the most powerful factions with skepticism, not reverence. Official assertions are our stating point to investigate (“Official A said X, Y and Z today: now let’s see if that’s true”), not the gospel around which we build our narratives (“X, Y and Z, official A says”).</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f3e05d8d-44b7-4773-b372-de679f4cdbd0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/02/18/DSC01121newyorktimes089.jpg\" alt=\"The New York Times building in New York.

That reaction gives potent insight into the true mindset of many western leaders.</p> <p>• Second, all of these governments keep saying how newsworthy these revelations are, how profound are the violations they expose, how happy they are to learn of all this, how devoted they are to reform. If that's true, why are they allowing the person who enabled all these disclosures –<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\"> Edward Snowden</a> – to be targeted for persecution by the US government for the &quot;crime&quot; of blowing the whistle on all of this? ...</p> <p>• Third, is there any doubt at all that the US government repeatedly tried to mislead the world when insisting that this system of suspicionless surveillance was motivated by an attempt to protect Americans from The Terrorists™? Our reporting has revealed spying on<a href=\"http://epoca.globo.com/tempo/noticia/2013/08/carta-em-que-o-atual-bembaixadorb-americano-no-brasil-bagradece-o-apoio-da-nsab.html\"> conferences designed to negotiate economic agreements</a>, the Organization of American States,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/nsa-spying-brazil-oil-petrobras\"> oil companies</a>, ministries that<a href=\"http://m.g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/10/american-and-canadian-spies-target-brazilian-energy-and-mining-ministry.html\"> oversee mines and energy resources</a>, the democratically elected leaders of allied states, and entire populations in those states.</p> </blockquote> <p>Greenwald also drew attention to the comments made by NSA director Keith Alexander last week; Alexander said ”we ought to come up with a way of stopping” reporting on Snowden’s leaks. He also accused journalists of “selling” the Snowden documents – which is not the case. Greenwald noted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are 25,000 employees of the NSA (and many tens of thousands more who work for private contracts assigned to the agency). Maybe one of them can tell The General about<a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZS.html\"> this thing called &quot;the first amendment&quot;</a>.</p> <p>I'd love to know what ways, specifically, General Alexander has in mind for empowering the US government to &quot;come up with a way of stopping&quot; the journalism on this story. Whatever ways those might be, they are deeply hostile to the US constitution – obviously. What kind of person wants the government to forcibly shut down reporting by the press?</p> </blockquote> <p>The debate over Alexander’s comments also illustrates the difference between the debate over the Snowden files in the US and in the UK. In Britain some spy chiefs, politicians and even rival newspapers have attacked the Guardian’s publication of these stories.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2d718715-327a-4aae-95be-370e295293c0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381957734300/f740f8cc-5b6f-46b0-aacc-77c72c1d78ec-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"NSA director Gen Keith Alexander.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>NSA director Gen Keith Alexander.

El Mundo said that a document provided by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden shows that the NSA monitored the phone calls from 10 December 2012 to 8 January 2013, but not their content. The dates were the same <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/nsa-files-live-coverage-developments-reaction#block-5264e9ade4b0bbc67cfff627\">in the French case</a>.</p> <p>• <strong>The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security\"> US National Security</a> Agency was forced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/27/barack-obama-nsa-angela-merkel-germany\">on Sunday</a> to deny that its director ever discussed a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\"> surveillance</a> operation against the German chancellor with President<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama\"> Barack Obama</a>, as the White House tried to contain a full-scale diplomatic crisis over<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/espionage\"> espionage</a> directed at allied countries. </strong>The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration\"> Obama administration</a> appeared in disarray as it struggled with the fallout over the disclosure that the National Security Agency<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls\"> monitored the phone conversations</a> of at least 35 world leaders, and that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/nsa-surveillance-brazil-germany-un-resolution\"> the phone of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had been monitored</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Early on Sunday, the White House refused to comment on<a href=\"http://www.dw.de/media-reports-suggest-obama-knew-nsa-spied-on-merkel/a-17185662\"> an overnight report in the German tabloid Bild</a>, which alleged that Obama was personally briefed about by the operation to target Merkel's phone by the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\"> NSA</a>'s director, Keith Alexander, and allowed it to continue.</p> <p>That appeared to conflict with a second report, in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. It said that when Obama spoke to Merkel over the phone on Wednesday, he assured the German leader he had not previously known her phone had been monitored.</p> <p>Caitlin Hayden, the White House's national security council spokeswoman, declined to comment on the reports, telling the Guardian: &quot;We are not going to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity.&quot;</p> <p>However just over three hours later, that position appeared to have been reversed, when the NSA said in a statement that Alexander &quot;did not discuss with President Obama in 2010 an alleged foreign intelligence operation involving German Chancellor Merkel, nor has he ever discussed alleged operations involving Chancellor Merkel. News reports claiming otherwise are not true&quot;.</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong>The first signs are emerging that Obama's administration may seek to distance itself from the NSA, concluding that the spy-agency has strayed beyond its remit and overreached.</strong> Many senior figures in Congress have already said the NSA failed to properly inform them of the nature and scope of its surveillance activities.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>A delegation of nine MEPs are due to travel to Washington today for a three-day visit, during which they will press senior US government and intelligence officials for answers on allegations of widespread spying by the US, and explore &quot;possible legal remedies for EU citizens&quot; resulting from the alleged surveillance.</strong> The EU's civil liberties committee will meet members of Congress to express their concerns over the impact on EU citizens' fundamental right to privacy. Separately, the German government said on Friday that a group of senior officials including the heads of its foreign and domestic intelligence agencies would travel to the US &quot;shortly&quot; for talks at the White House and with the NSA.</p> <p>We’ll have all this and more throughout the day today.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T10:42:40.637Z\">at 10.42am GMT</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421103644|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|3f84eb70c517d3ed9bc19ac4f6ab5a6fa328245b -->",

        "headline":"Spying excesses threaten democracy",
        "body":"<p>The Guardian has served us all well by drawing attention day after day to the excesses of spying on individuals and of mass surveillance practised by GCHQ and the US National Security Agency, revealed in the secret material made available by Edward Snowden (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/25/leaked-memos-gchq-mass-surveillance-secret-snowden\" title=\"\">GCHQ fears challenge over mass spying, leak reveals</a>, 26 October).</p><p>In a world of sophisticated global organised crime, terrorism both imported and home-grown, and trafficking of children and modern slaves, I recognise the need for intelligence agencies. Undoubtedly their work has unearthed criminal gangs and terrorist plots, and we have reason to be grateful for that.</p><p>But Snowden's revelations show a deeply troubling imbalance between their operations and the respect for individual liberty and personal privacy that citizens of a democracy are entitled to enjoy. I congratulate the government on the new powers it has given to the intelligence and security committee of parliament, which has one of the most thoughtful and impressive MPs as its chairman. But it needs to exercise detailed oversight of an intelligence structure that is running out of control, and badly needs a dose of political common sense.</p><p>Let me offer one current example. I became an active member of the Anglo-German (Königswinter) Association many years ago. Over the course of those years, Germany has become the most transformed country in Europe in terms of its values and its behaviour. It is our most important partner in the European Union, and a significant ally in Nato. Its chancellor, Angela Merkel, was brought up in a country, East Germany, racked by suspicion and distrust, in which there were thousands of Stasi, fellow citizens engaged in spying on one another and reporting everything to a ruthless totalitarian state. It is impossible to imagine any leader more likely to be infuriated by being the object of espionage by her supposedly closest allies.</p><p>I hope the usually courteous prime minister and US president have already offered personal apologies, and a rock-solid commitment to rein in their respective agencies from such offensive and ill-judged actions. What starts with our closest allies must go on to include our innocent citizens as well.<br /><strong>Shirley Williams</strong><br /><em>Liberal Democrat, House of Lords</em></p><p></p><p>• David Cameron's response to the scandal of Angela Merkel's phone being tapped was to tell us that \"there are lots of people … who want to blow up our families\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/david-cameron-agrees-eu-concern-nsa-surveillance\" title=\"\">Cameron 'agrees' with EU over US spying</a>, 26 October). Is he suggesting that bugging European political leaders' phones will save us from terrorists?</p><p>Snooping on the entire UK population has nothing to do with democracy, it is the conduct of a totalitarian regime. The&nbsp;coalition government rightly abandoned the previous Labour government's plans for biometric passports. Such schemes simply erode the liberties of the innocent.</p><p>Most of the British public understand that there are bad guys out there. Cameron needs to represent the public and defend our democracy, and avoid being an apologist for those who are happy to trample over the human rights of the entire population.<br /><strong>Christian Vassie</strong><br /><em>Wheldrake, North Yorkshire</em></p><p></p><p>• Oliver Cromwell once posed himself the question: can it ever be lawful to resist the lawful authority of parliament? To which he answered that no authority has the right to do anything it pleases regardless of the consequences –&nbsp;that \"all agree there are cases in which it is lawful to resist\". It seems pretty clear, from some of the pronouncements made by establishment figures, that they, by apparent dint of divine right, see no such limit to their actions, or powers. Furthermore, very soon, mass surveillance will make it impossible for the public, who should be the ultimate arbiters of these matters, to lawfully resist.<br /><strong>Kevin Bell</strong><br /><em>Tyldesley, Greater Manchester</em></p><p></p><p>• GCHQ is deemed to be our jewel in the crown that enables Britain to punch above its weight. But worship of the Cheltenham-based panopticon is too high a price to pay given the attendant loss of liberty. Better to trade our place at the top negotiating table for an informed open society.<br /><strong>Yugo Kovach</strong><br /><em>Winterborne Houghton, Dorset</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421073606|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|0957b440c247f573f6c1bfd5b10b8c3d4a7617ea -->",

        "headline":"The NSA scandal puts Europe to the test",
        "body":"<p>On one level we should hardly be shocked by the revelations that the National Security Agency has been tapping our phones and monitoring our metadata. The thing about secret services that is not so secret is that they all spy on each other. Some, like the Americans, probably do it better than others. Countless Hollywood movies and BBC dramas about spooks and covert operations have brought this reality into our living rooms. Yet we probably laboured under the assumption that our spies were only after the \"bad guys\" – those broadly falling inside George Bush's definition of the \"axis of evil\" – not our friends and allies.</p><p>Angela Merkel's discovery that her personal mobile phone had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/angela-merkel-bugging-snowden-leaks-mp\" title=\"\">a target of NSA hacking</a> disrupted this week's EU summit. The relationship she nurtured with the US president was suddenly undermined by questions about the true level of trust she thought they enjoyed. She was not alone, though. Leaked NSA memos revealed by the Guardian suggest up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls\" title=\"\">35 world leaders</a> have been similarly treated. But this is not just an elite spying exercise. The NSA has been trawling through 70m communications from French citizens in the space of just one month. This is spying on a massive scale and clearly not exclusively directed at combating terrorism.</p><p>A case can be made for secret services to monitor phone calls and internet use of suspected terrorists or criminal gangs under the supervision of a judge or a minister who can be held accountable, but the systematic hacking of world leaders goes way beyond the bounds of good behaviour; it would be a very ugly world if no one could be trusted.</p><p>We should now be asking whether we have entered an Orwellian world of \"thought crimes\" and \"Big Brother\". The anti-terrorism measures we are taking are having a deleterious effect on our civil liberties – our right to privacy and freedom to go about our business without fear that we are being monitored. The Snowden revelations have pointed to NSA \"back door\" spyware being implanted in devices at the point of manufacture and of internet and social media giants being compromised. Data stored on servers on US soil is no longer above suspicion, and who knows what happens to our airline passenger data that is collected every time we take a flight?</p><p>Only last week MEPs voted to recommend the suspension of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/eu-threat-us-data-sharing-terrorist-funding\" title=\"\">a controversial EU-US financial data-sharing agreement</a> to assist with the US <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/eu-threat-us-data-sharing-terrorist-funding\" title=\"\">terrorist finance tracking programme</a>. The agreement allows the US department for homeland security to access data from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_Finance_Tracking_Program\" title=\"\">the Swift database</a> (the conduit for all global financial transactions). Parliament had reluctantly accepted the agreement, following the personal intervention of Joe Biden, the US vice-president, and on condition of extra privacy safeguards. But allegations broadcast on Brazilian TV suggest that the system was hacked illegally. In light of all the evidence and new revelations, the US does not deserve the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>The spying scandal will now put Europe to the test. It must show that it is both willing and able to protect the rights of European citizens and uphold its core principles. The European Commission and member states should translate their indignation into a firm response, not brush the scandal under the carpet, for there will surely be more to come. Parliament's recommendation to suspend the exchange of Swift data requires a proposal from the commission and backing from two-thirds of EU member states. They should dangle this like a sword of Damocles over the heads of the Americans: that co-operation will be halted if the snooping on allies does not stop.</p><p>Second, no final agreement on a transatlantic trade and investment agreement between the EU and US can be concluded until this issue has been satisfactorily resolved.  I would not recommend halting negotiations since a transatlantic free-trade area is manifestly in our own interests, but there will undoubtedly be chapters related to data privacy and regulation of online services that would be problematic in the current climate.</p><p>Third, the EU is updating its data protection legislation in light of developments in digital and online technology over the last 15 years. The legislation was voted at committee stage last week and is due to be completed before the end of the current European parliamentary mandate in June next year. Indeed, this legislation is urgently needed so that nationals of all member states are equally protected from unauthorised data gathering.  The US spying scandals have also forced the issue of extra-territoriality into the foreground. MEPs have reinserted the <a href=\"http://www.dataguidance.com/news.asp?id=2120\" title=\"\">\"anti-Fisa\" clause</a>, enabling the blocking of surveillance by foreign law-enforcement bodies, despite lobbying by the US administration to drop it.</p><p>Guaranteeing national security is no easy matter and often pits one right against another. There will always be those who want more security or more privacy.  What matters is knowing what is being done to protect our freedom so we can judge for ourselves and hold our politicians to account for the balance they strike. Without accountability, the state becomes all-powerful and we slip from democracy to dictatorship. The US (and possibly other countries participating in their programme or operating similar schemes) have been put in the spotlight and now have a duty to explain themselves to those they represent and serve.</p><p></p><p>Governments have a duty to look after our safety, but in a free and open democracy they also have a duty to look after our liberty. In some countries, not least those in the Arab world fighting for their rights and freedoms, many are prepared to risk their lives for liberty. It is a sobering thought for all those who bear the responsibility of government.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420972815|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5acacfe2becbba483f4071fa849694a2b5880929 -->",

        "headline":"Congressional oversight of the NSA is a joke. I should know, I'm in Congress",
        "body":"<p>In the 1970s, Congressman Otis Pike of New York chaired a <a href=\"http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/docset/getList.do?docSetId=1918\">special congressional committee</a> to investigate abuses by the American so-called \"intelligence community\" – the spies. After the investigation, Pike commented: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It took this investigation to convince me that I had always been told lies, to make me realize that I was tired of being told lies.</p></blockquote><p>I'm tired of the spies telling lies, too.</p><p>Pike's investigation initiated one of the first congressional oversight debates for the vast and hidden collective of espionage agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA). Before the Pike Commission, Congress was kept in the dark about them – a tactic designed to thwart congressional deterrence of the sometimes illegal and often shocking activities carried out by the \"intelligence community\".  Today, we are seeing a repeat of this professional voyeurism by our nation's spies, on an unprecedented and pervasive scale.</p><p>Recently, the US House of Representatives voted on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/25/nsa-surveillance-amash-amendment-narrow-defeat\">an amendment</a> – offered by Representatives Justin Amash and John Conyers – that would have curbed the NSA's omnipresent and inescapable tactics. Despite furious lobbying by the intelligence industrial complex and its allies, and four hours of frantic and overwrought briefings by the NSA's General Keith Alexander, 205 of 422 Representatives <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/25/nsa-surveillance-amash-amendment-narrow-defeat\">voted for the amendment</a>. </p><p>Though the amendment barely failed, the vote signaled a clear message to the NSA: we do not trust you. The vote also conveyed another, more subtle message: members of Congress do not trust that the House Intelligence Committee is providing the necessary oversight. On the contrary, \"oversight\" has become \"overlook\".<br /> <br />Despite being a member of Congress possessing security clearance, I've learned far more about government spying on me and my fellow citizens from reading media reports than I have from \"intelligence\" briefings. If the vote on the Amash-Conyers amendment is any indication, my colleagues feel the same way. In fact, one long-serving conservative Republican told me that he doesn't attend such briefings anymore, because, \"they always lie\".</p><p>Many of us worry that Congressional Intelligence Committees are more loyal to the \"intelligence community\" that they are tasked with policing, than to the Constitution. And the House Intelligence Committee isn't doing anything to assuage our concerns. </p><p>I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/aug/04/email-exchange-alan-grayson\">requested classified information</a>, and further meetings with NSA officials. The House Intelligence Committee has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/04/congress-nsa-denied-access\">refused to provide either</a>. Supporters of the NSA's vast ubiquitous domestic spying operation assure the public that members of Congress can be briefed on these activities whenever they want. Senator <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/08/04/1228860/-Saxby-Chambliss-NSA-Spying-Uncovered-Current-Terrorist-Threats#\">Saxby Chambliss</a> says all a member of Congress needs to do is ask for information, and he'll get it. Well I did ask, and the House Intelligence Committee said \"no\", repeatedly.  And virtually every other member not on the Intelligence Committee gets the same treatment. </p><p>Recently, a member of the House Intelligence Committee was asked at a town hall meeting, by his constituents, why my requests for more information about these programs were being denied. This member argued that I <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/10/house-panel-nixes-graysons-request-for-syria-intelligence-175396.html\">don't have the necessary level of clearance </a>to obtain access for classified information. That doesn't make any sense; every member is given the same level of clearance. <br />There is no legal justification for imparting secret knowledge about the NSA's domestic surveillance activities only to the 20 members of the House Intelligence Committee. Moreover, how can the remaining 415 of us do our job properly, when we're kept in the dark – or worse, misinformed?<br /> <br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\">Edward Snowden's revelations</a> demonstrate that the members of Congress, who are asked to authorize these programs, are not privy to the same information provided to junior analysts at the NSA, and even private contractors who sell services to foreign governments. The only time that these intelligence committees disclose classified information to us, your elected representatives, is when it serves the purposes of the \"intelligence community\".</p><p>As the country continues to debate the supposed benefits of wall-to-wall spying programs on each and every American, without probable cause, the spies, \"intelligence community\" and Congressional Intelligence Committees have a choice: will they begin sharing comprehensive information about these activities, so that elected public officials have the opportunity to make informed decisions about whether such universal snooping is necessary, or constitutional? </p><p>Or will they continue to obstruct our efforts to understand these programs, and force us to rely on information provided by whistleblowers who undertake substantial risks to disseminate this information about violations of our freedom in an increasingly hostile environment? And why do Generals Alexander and Clapper remain in office, when all the evidence points to them committing the felony of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order\">lying to Congress </a>and the American people?</p><p>Representative Pike would probably say that rank-and-file representatives will never get the information we need from the House Intelligence Committee, because the spying industrial complex answers only to itself. After all, Pike, and many of the members of his special congressional committee, voted against forming it. As it is now constituted, the House Intelligence Committee will never decry, deny, or defy any spy. They see eye-to-eye, so they turn a blind eye. Which means that if we rely on them, we can kiss our liberty good-bye.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420893903|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|b29d200ec184d9fa6d21175b1bf5af3690d8e731 -->",

        "headline":"As Europe erupts over US spying, NSA chief says government must stop media",
        "body":"<p>The most under-discussed aspect of the NSA story has long been its international scope. That all changed this week as both Germany and France <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/angry-european-and-german-reactions-to-merkel-us-phone-spying-scandal-a-929725.html\">exploded with anger</a> over new revelations about pervasive NSA surveillance on their population and democratically elected leaders.</p><p>As was true for Brazil previously, reports about surveillance aimed at leaders are receiving most of the media attention, but what really originally drove the story there were revelations that the NSA is <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2013/10/21/france-in-the-nsa-s-crosshair-phone-networks-under-surveillance_3499741_651865.html\">bulk-spying on millions and millions</a> of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/07/nsa-brazilians-globo-spying\">innocent citizens</a> in <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/nsa-spies-on-500-million-german-data-connections-a-908648.html\">all of those nations</a>. The favorite cry of US government apologists -–<em>everyone spies!</em> – falls impotent in the face of this sort of ubiquitous, suspicionless spying that is the sole province of the US and its four English-speaking surveillance allies (the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand).</p><p>There are three points worth making about these latest developments.</p><p>• <strong>First</strong>, note how leaders such as Chancellor Angela Merkel reacted with basic indifference when it was revealed months ago that the NSA was bulk-spying on all German citizens, but suddenly found her indignation only when it turned out that she personally was also targeted. That reaction gives potent insight into the true mindset of many western leaders.</p><p>• <strong>Second</strong>, all of these governments keep saying how newsworthy these revelations are, how profound are the violations they expose, how happy they are to learn of all this, how devoted they are to reform. If that's true, why are they allowing the person who enabled all these disclosures – Edward Snowden – to be targeted for persecution by the US government for the \"crime\" of blowing the whistle on all of this?</p><p>If the German and French governments – and the German and French people – are so pleased to learn of how their privacy is being systematically assaulted by a foreign power over which they exert no influence, shouldn't they be offering asylum to the person who exposed it all, rather than ignoring or rejecting his pleas to have his basic political rights protected, and thus leaving him vulnerable to being imprisoned for decades by the US government? </p><p>Aside from the treaty obligations these nations have to protect the basic political rights of human beings from persecution, how can they simultaneously express outrage over these exposed invasions while turning their back on the person who risked his liberty and even life to bring them to light?</p><p>• <strong>Third</strong>, is there any doubt at all that the US government repeatedly tried to mislead the world when insisting that this system of suspicionless surveillance was motivated by an attempt to protect Americans from The Terrorists™? Our reporting has revealed spying on <a href=\"http://epoca.globo.com/tempo/noticia/2013/08/carta-em-que-o-atual-bembaixadorb-americano-no-brasil-bagradece-o-apoio-da-nsab.html\">conferences designed to negotiate economic agreements</a>, the Organization of American States, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/nsa-spying-brazil-oil-petrobras\">oil companies</a>, ministries that <a href=\"http://m.g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/10/american-and-canadian-spies-target-brazilian-energy-and-mining-ministry.html\">oversee mines and energy resources</a>, the democratically elected leaders of allied states, and entire populations in those states.</p><p>Can even President Obama and his most devoted loyalists continue to maintain, with a straight face, that this is all about Terrorism? That is what <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/140155/henry-farrell-and-martha-finnemore/the-end-of-hypocrisy#\">this superb new Foreign Affairs essay by Henry Farrell and Martha Finnemore</a> means when it argues that the Manning and Snowden leaks are putting an end to the ability of the US to use hypocrisy as a key weapon in its soft power.</p><p>Speaking of an inability to maintain claims with a straight face, how are American and British officials, in light of their conduct in all of this, going to maintain the pretense that they are defenders of press freedoms and are in a position to lecture and condemn others for violations? In what might be the most explicit hostility to such freedoms yet – as well as the most unmistakable evidence of rampant panic – the NSA's director, General Keith Alexander, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/10/nsa-chief-stop-reporters-selling-spy-documents-175896.html\">actually demanded</a> Thursday that the reporting being done by newspapers around the world on this secret surveillance system be halted (Techdirt <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131024/18093325010/keith-alexander-says-us-govt-needs-to-figure-out-way-to-stop-journalists-reporting-snowden-leaks.shtml\">has the full video here</a>):</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The head of the embattled National Security Agency, Gen Keith Alexander, is accusing journalists of \"selling\" his agency's documents and is calling for an end to the steady stream of public disclosures of secrets snatched by former contractor Edward Snowden.</p><p>\"I think it's wrong that that newspaper reporters have all these documents, the 50,000 – whatever they have and are selling them and giving them out as if these – you know it just doesn't make sense,\" Alexander said in an interview with the Defense Department's \"Armed With Science\" blog.</p><p><em>\"We ought to come up with a way of stopping it.</em> I don't know how to do that. That's more of the courts and the policy-makers but, from my perspective, it's wrong to allow this to go on,\" the NSA director declared. [My italics]</p></blockquote><p>There are 25,000 employees of the NSA (and many tens of thousands more who work for private contracts assigned to the agency). Maybe one of them can tell The General about <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZS.html\">this thing called \"the first amendment\"</a>.</p><p>I'd love to know what ways, specifically, General Alexander has in mind for empowering the US government to \"come up with a way of stopping\" the journalism on this story. Whatever ways those might be, they are deeply hostile to the US constitution – obviously. What kind of person wants the government to forcibly shut down reporting by the press?</p><p>Whatever kind of person that is, he is not someone to be trusted in instituting and developing a massive bulk-spying system that operates in the dark. For that matter, nobody is.</p><h2>Leaving</h2><p>As many of you likely know, it was announced last week that I am leaving the Guardian. My last day here will be 31 October, and I will write my last column on that date.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420985700|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|dfd8e0d5fde3afe0caecac62739d0c845ae64f14 -->",

        "headline":"Leaked memos reveal GCHQ efforts to keep mass surveillance secret",
        "body":"<p>The UK intelligence agency GCHQ has repeatedly warned it fears a \"damaging public debate\" on the scale of its activities because it could lead to legal challenges against its mass-surveillance programmes, classified internal documents reveal.</p><p>Memos contained in the cache disclosed by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden detail the agency's long fight against making intercept evidence admissible as evidence in criminal trials – a policy supported by all three major political parties, but ultimately defeated by the UK's intelligence community.</p><p>Foremost among the reasons was a desire to minimise the potential for challenges against the agency's large-scale interception programmes, rather than any intrinsic threat to security, the documents show.</p><p>The papers also reveal that:</p><p>• GCHQ lobbied furiously to keep secret the fact that telecoms firms had gone \"well beyond\" what they were legally required to do to help intelligence agencies' mass interception of communications, both in the UK and overseas.</p><p>• GCHQ feared a legal challenge under the right to privacy in the Human Rights Act if evidence of its surveillance methods became admissible in court.</p><p>• GCHQ assisted the Home Office in lining up sympathetic people to help with \"press handling\", including the Liberal Democrat peer and former intelligence services commissioner Lord Carlile, who this week criticised the Guardian for its coverage of mass surveillance by GCHQ and America's National Security Agency.</p><p>The most recent attempt to make intelligence gathered from intercepts admissible in court, proposed by the last Labour government, was finally stymied by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 in 2009.</p><p>A briefing memo prepared for the board of GCHQ shortly before the decision was made public revealed that one reason the agency was keen to quash the proposals was the fear that even passing references to its wide-reaching surveillance powers could start a \"damaging\" public debate.</p><p>Referring to the decision to publish the report on intercept as evidence without classification, it noted: \"Our main concern is that references to agency practices (ie the scale of interception and deletion) could lead to damaging public debate which might lead to legal challenges against the current regime.\" A later update, from May 2012, set out further perceived \"risks\" of making intercepts admissible, including \"the damage to partner relationships if sensitive information were accidentally released in open court\". It also noted that the \"scale of interception and retention required would be fairly likely to be challenged on Article 8 (Right to Privacy) grounds\".</p><p>The GCHQ briefings showed the agency provided the Home Office with support in winning the PR battle on the proposed reforms by lining up people to talk to the media – including Lord Carlile, who on Wednesday gave a public lecture <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/10401711/Publishing-Edward-Snowden-security-secrets-a-criminal-act-says-former-terrorism-watchdog.html\" title=\"\">condemning the Guardian's decision to publish stories based on the leaked material from Snowden</a>.</p><p>Referring to the public debate on intercept evidence, the document notes: \"Sir Ken McDonald [sic] (former DPP [director of public prosecutions]), Lord Goldsmith (former AG [attorney general]) and David Davis (former Shadow HSec [home secretary) [have been] reiterating their previous calls for IaE [intercept as evidence].</p><p>\"We are working closely with HO [Home Office] on their plans for press handling when the final report is published, e.g. lining up talking heads (such as Lord Carlisle [sic], Lord Stevens, Sir Stephen Lander, Sir Swinton Thomas).\"</p><p>Carlile was the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation in 2001-11, and was awarded a CBE in 2012 for his services to national security.</p><p>Another top GCHQ priority in resisting the admission of intercepts as evidence was keeping secret the extent of the agency's co-operative relationships with telephone companies – including being granted access to communications networks overseas.</p><p>In June, the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\" title=\"\">disclosed the existence of GCHQ's Tempora internet surveillance programme</a>. It uses intercepts on the fibre-optic cables that make up the backbone of the internet to gain access to vast swaths of internet users' personal data. The intercepts are placed in the UK and overseas, with the knowledge of companies owning either the cables or landing stations.</p><p>The revelations of voluntary co-operation with some telecoms companies appear to contrast markedly with statements made by large telecoms firms in the wake of the first Tempora stories. They stressed that they were simply complying with the law of the countries in which they operated.</p><p>In reality, numerous telecoms companies were doing much more than that, as disclosed in a secret document prepared in 2009 by a joint working group of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6.</p><p>Their report contended that allowing intercepts as evidence could damage relationships with \"Communications Service Providers\" (CSPs).</p><p>In an extended excerpt of \"the classified version\" of a review prepared for the Privy Council, a formal body of advisers made up of current and former cabinet ministers, the document sets out the real nature of the relationship between telecoms firms and the UK government.</p><p>\"Under RIPA [the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000], CSPs in the UK may be required to provide, at public expense, an adequate interception capability on their networks,\" it states. \"In practice all significant providers do provide such a capability. But in many cases their assistance – while in conformity with the law – goes well beyond what it requires.\"</p><p>GCHQ's internet surveillance programme is the subject of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/08/nsa-gchq-spy-programmes-legal-challenge\" title=\"\">a challenge in the European court of human rights</a>, mounted by three privacy advocacy groups. The Open Rights Group, English PEN and Big Brother Watch argue the \"unchecked surveillance\" of Tempora is a challenge to the right to privacy, as set out in the European convention on human rights.</p><p>That the Tempora programme appears to rely at least in part on voluntary co-operation of telecoms firms could become a major factor in that ongoing case. The revelation could also reignite the long-running debate over allowing intercept evidence in court.</p><p>GCHQ's submission goes on to set out why its relationships with telecoms companies go further than what can be legally compelled under current law. It says that in the internet era, companies wishing to avoid being legally mandated to assist UK intelligence agencies would often be able to do so \"at little cost or risk to their operations\" by moving \"some or all\" of their communications services overseas.</p><p>As a result, \"it has been necessary to enter into agreements with both UK-based and offshore providers for them to afford the UK agencies access, with appropriate legal authorisation, to the communications they carry outside the UK\".</p><p>The submission to ministers does not set out which overseas firms have entered into voluntary relationships with the UK, or even in which countries they operate, though documents detailing the Tempora programme made it clear the UK's interception capabilities relied on taps located both on UK soil and overseas.</p><p>There is no indication as to whether the governments of the countries in which deals with companies have been struck would be aware of the GCHQ cable taps.</p><p>Evidence that telecoms firms and GCHQ are engaging in mass interception overseas could stoke an ongoing diplomatic row over surveillance ignited this week after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, accused the NSA of monitoring her phone calls, and the subsequent revelation that the agency monitored communications of at least 35 other world leaders.</p><p>On Friday, Merkel and the French president, François Hollande, agreed to spearhead efforts to make the NSA sign a new code of conduct on how it carried out intelligence operations within the European Union, after EU leaders warned that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/germany-france-nsa-spying-merkel-hollande-eu\" title=\"\">international fight against terrorism was being jeopardised</a> by the perception that mass US surveillance was out of control.</p><p>Fear of diplomatic repercussions were one of the prime reasons given for GCHQ's insistence that its relationships with telecoms firms must be kept private .</p><p>Telecoms companies \"feared damage to their brands internationally, if the extent of their co-operation with HMG [Her Majesty's government] became apparent\", the GCHQ document warned. It added that if intercepts became admissible as evidence in UK courts \"many CSPs asserted that they would withdraw their voluntary support\".</p><p>The report stressed that while companies are going beyond what they are required to do under UK law, they are not being asked to violate it.</p><p>Shami Chakrabarti, Director of Liberty and Anthony Romero Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union issued a joint statement stating:</p><p>\"The Guardian's publication of information from Edward Snowden has uncovered a breach of trust by the US and UK Governments on the grandest scale. The newspaper's principled and selective revelations demonstrate our rulers' contempt for personal rights, freedoms and the rule of law.</p><p>\"Across the globe, these disclosures continue to raise fundamental questions about the lack of effective legal protection against the interception of all our communications.</p><p>\"Yet in Britain, that conversation is in danger of being lost beneath self-serving spin and scaremongering, with journalists who dare to question the secret state accused of aiding the enemy.</p><p>\"A balance must of course be struck between security and transparency, but that cannot be achieved whilst the intelligence services and their political masters seek to avoid any scrutiny of, or debate about, their actions.</p><p>\"The Guardian's decision to expose the extent to which our privacy is being violated should be applauded and not condemned.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420974026|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|644cb6ec61b96a9c433365e1b2a83df45288ebdd -->",

The German chancellor found the evidence substantial enough to call the White House and demand clarification.</p><p>The outrage in Berlin came days after President François Hollande of France also called the White House to confront  Obama with reports that the NSA was targeting the private phone calls and text messages of millions of French people.</p><p>While European leaders have generally been keen to play down the impact of the whistleblowing disclosures in recent months, events in the EU's two biggest countries this week threatened an upward spiral of lack of trust in transatlantic relations.</p><p>Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, made plain that Merkel upbraided Obama unusually sharply and also voiced exasperation at the slowness of the Americans to respond to detailed questions on the NSA scandal since the Snowden revelations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">first appeared in the Guardian in June</a>.</p><p>Merkel told Obama that \"she unmistakably disapproves of and views as completely unacceptable such practices, if the indications are authenticated,\" Seifert said. \"This would be a serious breach of confidence. Such practices have to be halted immediately.\"</p><p>The sharpness of the German complaint direct to an American president strongly suggested that Berlin had no doubt about the grounds for protest. Seibert voiced irritation that the Germans had waited for months for proper answers from Washington to Berlin on the NSA operations.</p><p>Merkel told Obama she expected the Americans \"to supply information over the possible scale of such eavesdropping practices against Germany and reply to questions that the federal government asked months ago\", Seibert said.</p><p>The White House responded that Merkel's mobile is not being tapped. \"The president assured the chancellor that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor,\" said a statement from Jay Carney, the White House spokesman.</p><p>But Berlin promptly signalled that the rebuttal referred to the present and the future and did not deny that Merkel's communications had been monitored in the past.</p><p>Asked by the Guardian if the US had monitored the German chancellor's phone in the past, a top White House official declined to deny that it had.</p><p>Caitlin Hayden, the White House's National Security Council spokeswoman, said: \"The United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of Chancellor Merkel. Beyond that, I'm not in a position to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity.\"</p><p>Obama and Merkel, the White House said, \"agreed to intensify further the co-operation between our intelligence services with the goal of protecting the security of both countries and of our partners, as well as protecting the privacy of our citizens.\"</p><p>The explosive new row came on the eve of an EU summit in Brussels opening on Thursday afternoon. Following reports by Le Monde this week about the huge scale of US surveillance of France, Hollande insisted that the issue be raised at a summit which, by coincidence, is largely devoted to the \"digital\" economy in Europe. Hollande also phoned Obama to protest and insist on a full explanation, but received only the stock US response that the Americans were examining their intelligence practices and seeking to balance security and privacy imperatives, according to the Elysee Palace.</p><p>The French demand for a summit debate had gained little traction in Europe. On Wednesday morning, briefing privately on the business of the summit, senior German officials made minimal mention of the surveillance scandal. But by Wednesday evening that had shifted radically. The Germans publicly insisted that the activities of the US intelligence services in Europe be put on a new legal basis.</p><p>\"The [German] federal government, as a close ally and partner of the USA, expects in the future a clear contractual basis for the activity of the services and their cooperation,\" Merkel told Obama.</p><p>In 2009, it was reported that Merkel had fitted her phone with an encryption chip to stop it being bugged. As many as 5,250 other ministers, advisers and important civil servants were supplied with similar state-of-the-art encryption technology. Merkel is known to be a keen mobile user and has been nicknamed \"die Handy-Kanzlerin\" (\"Handy\" being the German word for mobile phone).</p><p>When asked how he had communicated with Merkel during an EU summit in Brussels in 2008, then French president Nicolas Sarkozy said: \"We call each other's mobiles and write text messages.\"</p><p>Katrin Goring-Eckhart, parliamentary leader of the Greens, said: \"If these allegations turn out to be true, we are dealing with an incredible scandal and an unprecedented breach of trust between the two countries, for which there can be no justification.\"</p><p>On social media, a number of Germans mocked Merkel's change of tone over the NSA affair, given her previous reluctance to talk about the controversy. Jens König, a reporter for the news weekly Stern, tweeted that it was \"the first time that Merkel is showing some proper passion during the NSA affair\".</p><p>The European Commission has thrown its weight behind new European Parliament proposals for rules governing the transfer of data from Europe to America and demanded that the forthcoming summit finalise the new regime by next spring.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/merkel-calls-obama-over-suspicions-us-tapped-her-mobile-phone-a-929642.html\" title=\"\">a</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420795449|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|de9f4f81a80dc49c87e5ba81b03d63eda5ef624c -->",

        "body":"<p>International anger over US government surveillance has combined with a backlash against its current Middle East policy to leave President Obama increasingly isolated from many of his key foreign allies, according to diplomats in Washington.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\" >furious call that German chancellor Angela Merkel made to the White House on Wednesday</a> to ask if her phone had been tapped was the latest in a string of diplomatic rebukes by allies including France, Brazil and Mexico, all of which have distanced themselves from the US following revelations of spying by the National Security Agency.</p><p>But the collapse in trust of the US among its European and South American partners has been matched by an equally rapid deterioration in its relationships with key allies in the Middle East. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/kerry-talks-us-saudi-rift-foreign-policy\" >Saudi Arabia</a> this week joined Israel, Jordan and United Arab Emirates in signalling a shift in its relations with the US over its unhappiness at a perceived policy of rapprochement toward Iran and Syria.</p><p>Though the issues are largely unrelated, they have led to a flurry of diplomatic activity from Washington, which is anxious to avoid a more permanent rift in the network of alliances that has been central to its foreign policy since the second world war.</p><p>Secretary of state John Kerry has been meeting with Saudi and Israeli leaders in an effort to keep them involved in Middle East peace talks about Palestine and Syria, Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/pakistani-pm-obama-end-drone-strikes\" >met Wednesday with Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif</a> to reassure him over separate anxiety over US drone attacks, and the White House has been privately trying to mend fences with world leaders on the surveillance issue.</p><p>\"The [NSA] revelations have clearly caused tension in our relationships with some countries and we are dealing with that through diplomatic channels,\" said White House spokesman Jay Carney on Thursday.</p><p>\"These are very important relations both economically and for our security, and we will work to maintain the closest possible ties.\"</p><p>But the Guardian has spoken with several diplomats and foreign government officials – all of whom agreed to talk only on the condition of anonymity – who say the White House is still underestimating the anger felt over recent disclosures.</p><p>They argue that US officials are being deliberately disingenuous when they claim that all countries engage in similar forms of espionage, even against allies. While it is widely accepted that the US, Britain, France, Russia and China engage in counter-espionage, other countries do not have the tools to conduct surveillance on the scale of the NSA.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420898420'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/24/1382636332279/Obama-Merkel-Hollande-010.jpg' alt='Obama, Merkel, Hollande' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Obama, Merkel and Hollande at the G20 summit in St Petersburg. Photograph: Getty</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p>A European diplomat said that the White House had presented a false comparison by claiming all countries were engaged in the same tactics.</p><p>\"How would the US respond if it discovered a friendly country was covertly listening to the calls of thousands of US citizens – including Obama?\" the diplomat said.</p><p>France, Mexico, Brazil and Germany have all provided the White House with a list of detailed questions about the reports of surveillance, demanding explanations and assurances it will stop. None have so far received what they believe to be a satisfactory answer.</p><p>Some foreign officials posted in Washington have changed the way they conduct business since the revelations about US surveillance: not speaking about sensitive information over the phone, increasing the frequency of de-bugging inspections in embassies, and keeping some communications – those deemed most secret – out of secure cables, having now concluded that their encryption may have been compromised by the NSA.</p><p>In Brazil, thousands of federal workers are now being ordered to adopt a form of highly-encrypted email – a program that was quickly accelerated after the Edward Snowden disclosures. And although the State Department insists that a planned bilateral meeting between Obama and Brazillian president Dilma Rousseff has merely been \"postponed\", it has not yet been rescheduled. Brazil is insisting the US come clean about the nature of the surveillance it has been conducting before it schedules another summit.</p><p>Speaking before Wednesday's revelation about Merkel's phone, a senior western diplomat speculated that the tenor of debate would be transformed if it emerged that an elected European politician had been targeted – as occurred in Brazil and Mexico.</p><p>\"If that happened, there would be a huge uproar,\" the diplomat said. \"This is not an issue that will go away.</p><p>\"The surveillance debate in the US is focused on the constitution – and whether the privacy of US citizens is compromised. There seems to be minimal acknowledgement about the concern other countries have about the rights of their citizens.\"</p><p>One European official said the disclosures had prompted EU countries to review policies on internet governance, privacy and data-sharing, amid growing scepticism about whether the US can be trusted. Major transatlantic trade negotiations have also been jeopardised amid anxiety that the US' surveillance tools give it an advantage during talks.</p><p>\"It has become clear we're not doing business on a level-playing field during negotiations,\" the official said.</p><p>A Brazilian official said that some top-level discussions with the US on energy matters had been suspended as a consequence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/08/brazil-accuses-canada-spying-nsa-leaks\" >leaks</a>, which suggested Canada may have spied on its energy and mines ministry. It would be \"impossible\" for discussions to proceed on that basis, the official added.</p><p>A Latin American diplomat said that if no satisfactory answer and apology was forthcoming, a scenario they thought unlikely, there would be enormous pressure for affected countries to react with more than just rhetoric.</p><p>\"Countries that have close partnerships simply should not spy on each other to that kind of level,\" they said. \"There has to be some kind of consequences.\"</p><p>The combination of diplomatic setbacks has led to particular scorn from Obama's critics on the American right, who compare his growing international unpopularity with his criticism of George W Bush for damaging America's reputation through the Iraq war.</p><p>\"This is a perfect storm,\" said Jim Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank. \"Countries are getting impatient with US foreign policy largely because they see it as one of disengagement, but the NSA scandal has given them fresh reason to mistrust us, too.\"</p><p>So far the official response in Washington has been muted, but there are signs of growing American frustration with the criticism it is receiving at the same time that it is expected to act as world leader.</p><p>On Wednesday, for example, Washington's outgoing ambassador to Saudi Arabia, James Smith, rebuked those calling for greater US involvement in the Middle East.</p><p>\"Much criticism has been directed at the US and there is a mounting frustration at the perceived lack of a coherent foreign policy in the region but then we hear the same refrain that somehow only we can fix it,\" he told an Arab/US policy conference in Washington.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420892017|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|edf54c8bab8ec109b33b26fb3e6541c4f868c8f8 -->",

According to court papers in the case, the FBI investigated Muhtorov because of his communications with a website administrator for the group.</p><p>In a court filing on Friday, the government said it intended to offer into evidence in Muhtorov's case \"information obtained or derived from acquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978\".</p><p>Last February a sharply divided supreme court <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/26/supreme-court-eavesdropping-law-doj-argument\">threw out an attempt by US citizens to challenge the expansion of the surveillance law</a> used to monitor conversations of foreign spies and terrorist suspects. In a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that a group of US lawyers, journalists and organisations could not sue to challenge the 2008 expansion of the law, because they could not prove that the government would monitor their conversations along with those of potential foreign terrorist and intelligence targets.</p><p>In the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito suggested a way for a challenge to be heard. He said if the government intends to use information from such surveillance in court, it must provide advance notice. In his argument before the court's decision, solicitor general Donald Verrilli had made similar comments to the justices on behalf of the administration.</p><p>In September, the supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, who ruled with the majority in the earlier 5-4 ruling, said the courts ultimately would have to determine <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/30/nsa-surveillance-framework-nsa-chief\">the legality of National Security Agency surveillance programmes</a>.</p><p>In the Muhtorov case, the FBI obtained email communications from two accounts that Muhtorov used, according to the court papers. The FBI also obtained communications originating from Muhtorov's phone lines. In one call, Muhtorov told an associate that the Islamic Jihad Union said it needed support, an FBI agent said in an affidavit filed in the case. The associate warned Muhtorov to be careful about talking about a founder of group, the affidavit stated.</p><p>The FBI also said Muhtorov communicated with a contact with the group by email using code words, telling a contact that he was \"ready for any task, even with the risk of dying\".</p><p>Muhtorov and another man, Bakhtiyor Jumaev, are suspected of plotting a terrorist attack planned by the Islamic Jihad Union, an FBI agent said in an affidavit. The group first conducted attacks in 2004, targeting a bazaar and police, and killing 47 people. The organisation subsequently carried out suicide bombings of the US and Israeli embassies and the Uzbekistani prosecutor general's office in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.</p><p>Muhtorov, a human rights worker, resettled in Aurora, Colorado, in 2007 with the help of the United Nations and the US government. He was arrested on 21 January 2012, in Chicago and when in possession of about $2,800 in cash, two shrink-wrapped iPhones and an iPad as well as a GPS device. He has denied the criminal charge.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421030098|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|f7d41480930043bf0cb8788fe0a875a83b1fb4f1 -->",

Props abounded, with a model drone hoisted by one member of the crowd and a large parachute carried by others. One member of the left-wing protest group Code Pink wore a large Barack Obama mascot head and carried around a cardboard camera. Organizers supplied placards reading \"Stop Watching _____\", allowing protesters to fill in their own name – or other slogans and occasional profanities. Homemade signs were more colorful, reading \"Don't Tap Me, Bro\" \"Yes, We Scan\" and \"No Snitching Allowed\".</p><p>\"They think an open government means our information is open for the taking,\" David Segal of Demand Progress, an internet activist group, said to kick off events. As the march proceeded from Union Station to the Capitol reflecting pool, the crowd sang various chants, from \"Hey hey, ho ho, mass surveillance has got to go\" to \"They say wire tap? We say fight back!\"</p><p>David Reed, of Maryland, said he felt compelled to show up because of the \"apathy\" he sees among much of the public towards whistleblowers. Reed said he attended the trial of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/chelsea-manning\">Chelsea Manning, the military whistleblower</a> who leaked thousands of State Department cables to Wikileaks, as an observer, and was \"disappointed that so few people showed up\".</p><p>\"The courtroom only held about 30 people, and there were few days that it was filled up,\" said Reed, who described himself as \"just a concerned citizen\". \"We just stand by and watch.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421038845'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/26/1382820857186/Protester-at-anti-NSA-ral-010.jpg' alt='Protester at anti-NSA rally in Washington DC' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A protester wears a mask depicting a skull beneath the head of the Statue of Liberty, beneath a model of a US drone aircraft.

Why would you violate her rights? Because, what, she might know something about terrorism?\" he said. \"What is that all about? They're an ally! They're partnered with us. I mean there are threats to the international order and stability. Why would you breach the trust of the chancellor of Germany?\" </p><p>When Drake addressed the crowd, he said any domestic surveillance legislation that might result from the Snowden leaks \"must include whistleblower protection\", because \"without adequate protections, [government employees] are more likely to turn a blind eye\" to abuses of power. He warned against the \"acid turned up by the potent brew of secrecy and surveillance\".</p><p>Another well-received speaker, Gary Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico and 2012 Libertarian party candidate for president, said \"there's only one way to fix the Patriot Act: and that's to repeal the Patriot Act\". He too was concerned about the apathy towards surveillance programs that comes when someone thinks it's \"not about me\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421038846'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/26/1382820979022/Demonstrators-hold-placar-001.jpg' alt='Demonstrators hold placards supporting Edward Snowden' width='220' height='372' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Demonstrators hold placards supporting Edward Snowden.

Jesselyn Radack, a former Justice Department ethics advisor who is now a director with the Government Accountability Project, read a statement from Snowden to the crowd. </p><p>\"This isn't about red or blue party lines, and it definitely isn't about terrorism,\" Snowden wrote. \"It's about being able to live in a free and open society.\" He also noted that \"elections are coming up, and we are watching you\". Members of Congress and government officials, he said, were supposed to be \"public servants, not private investigators\".</p><p>William Evans, of Richmond, Virginia, may have best embodied the nonpartisan atmosphere and message of the event. He wore a \"Richmond Tea Party\" baseball cap, as well as a Code Pink sticker saying \"Make Out, Not War\". He is a member of the Richmond Tea Party but not of Code Pink, he said, adding that he \"just loved\" what the sticker said. Evans said he was attending to protest the \"shredding of the constitution\" and added that he was happy that \"you guys on the left are finally starting to see it\".</p><p>\"We may not always agree on our belief system,\" he added, \"but thank God we agree on the constitution.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421038013|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|cc08c4d4a6a10b8a089eb7af0fb3847f85e459f1 -->",

The allegations were made after German secret service officials were already preparing to travel to Washington to seek explanations into the alleged surveillance of its chancellor.</p><p>A report in <em>Der Spiegel</em> said Merkel's mobile number had been listed by the NSA's Special Collection Service (SCS) since 2002 and may have been monitored for more than 10 years. It was still on the list – marked as \"GE Chancellor Merkel\" – weeks before President Barack Obama visited Berlin in June.</p><p>In an SCS document cited by the magazine, the agency said it had a \"not legally registered spying branch\" in the US embassy in Berlin, the exposure of which would lead to \"grave damage for the relations of the United States to another government\".</p><p>From there, NSA and CIA staff were tapping communication in Berlin's government district with high-tech surveillance. Quoting a secret document from 2010, <em>Der Spiegel</em> said such branches existed in about 80 locations around the world, including Paris, Madrid, Rome, Prague, Geneva and Frankfurt. Merkel's spokesman and the White House declined to comment on the report.</p><p>The nature of the monitoring of Merkel's mobile phone is not clear from the files, <em>Der Spiegel</em> said. It might be that the chancellor's conversations were recorded, or that her contacts were simply assessed.</p><p>Ahead of the latest claims , the German government's deputy spokesman, Georg Streiter, said a high-level delegation was heading to the White House and National Security Agency to \"push forward\" investigations into earlier surveillance allegations.</p><p>Meanwhile several thousand people marched to the US Capitol in Washington yesterday to protest against the NSA's spying programme and to demand a limit to the surveillance. Some of them held banners in support of Edward Snowden, the former CIA contractor who revealed the extent of the NSA's activities.</p><p>The march attracted protesters from both ends of the political spectrum as liberal privacy advocates walked alongside members of the conservative Tea Party movement.</p><p>The delegation will include senior officials from the German secret service, according to German media reports.</p><p>Germany and Brazil are spearheading efforts at the UN to protect the privacy of electronic communications. Diplomats from the two countries, which have both been targeted by the NSA, are leading efforts by a coalition of nations to draft a UN general assembly resolution calling for the right to privacy on the internet. Although non-binding, the resolution would be one of the strongest condemnations of US snooping to date.</p><p>\"This resolution will probably have enormous support in the GA [general assembly] since no one likes the NSA spying on them,\" a western diplomat told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, had previously cancelled a state visit to Washington over the revelation that the NSA was scooping up large amounts of Brazilian communications data, including from the state-run oil company Petrobras. The drafting of the UN resolution was confirmed by the country's foreign ministry.</p><p>The Associated Press quoted a diplomat who said the language of the resolution would not be \"offensive\" to any nation, particularly the US. He added that it would expand the right to privacy guaranteed by the international covenant on civil and political rights, which went into force in 1976.</p><p>The draft would be sent next week to the general assembly subcommittee on social, humanitarian, cultural and human rights issues, and be put to the full general assembly in late November.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/germany-france-nsa-spying-merkel-hollande-eu\" title=\"\">Germany and France demanded on Thursday that the Americans agree to new transatlantic rules on intelligence and security service behaviour</a> by the end of the year. Merkel added that she wanted action from Obama, not just apologetic words.</p><p>British and US civil liberties groups on Saturday added their voices to the criticism of snooping by both UK and US intelligence services after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/25/leaked-memos-gchq-mass-surveillance-secret-snowden\" title=\"\">the <em>Guardian</em> revealed that the British intelligence agency GCHQ repeatedly said it feared a \"damaging public debate\" on the scale of its own activities</a>.</p><p>Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, and Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, issued a joint statement, saying: \"The <em>Guardian</em>'s publication of information from Edward Snowden has uncovered a breach of trust by the US and UK governments on the grandest scale. The newspaper's principled and selective revelations demonstrate our rulers' contempt for personal rights, freedoms and the rule of law.</p><p>\"Across the globe, these disclosures continue to raise fundamental questions about the lack of effective legal protection against the interception of all our communications.

        "headline":"NSA denies discussing Merkel phone surveillance with Obama",
        "body":"<p>The US National Security Agency was forced on Sunday to deny that its director ever discussed a surveillance operation against the German chancellor with President Barack Obama, as the White House tried to contain a full-scale diplomatic crisis over espionage directed at allied countries.</p><p>The Obama administration appeared in disarray as it struggled with the fallout over the disclosure that the National Security Agency <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls\">monitored the phone conversations</a> of at least 35 world leaders, and that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/nsa-surveillance-brazil-germany-un-resolution\">the phone of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had been monitored</a>. </p><p>Early on Sunday, the White House refused to comment on <a href=\"http://www.dw.de/media-reports-suggest-obama-knew-nsa-spied-on-merkel/a-17185662\">an overnight report in the German tabloid Bild</a>, which alleged that Obama was personally briefed about by the operation to target Merkel's phone by the NSA's director, Keith Alexander, and allowed it to continue.</p><p>That appeared to conflict with a second report, in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. It said that when Obama spoke to Merkel over the phone on Wednesday, he assured the German leader he had not previously known her phone had been monitored.</p><p>Caitlin Hayden, the White House's national security council spokeswoman, declined to comment on the reports, telling the Guardian: \"We are not going to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity.\"</p><p>However just over three hours later, that position appeared to have been reversed, when the NSA said in a statement that Alexander \"did not discuss with President Obama in 2010 an alleged foreign intelligence operation involving German Chancellor Merkel, nor has he ever discussed alleged operations involving Chancellor Merkel. News reports claiming otherwise are not true\".</p><p>Bild cited \"a secret intelligence employee who is familiar with the NSA operation against Merkel\" in its story, which was widely-picked up by global media.</p><p>The intervention by the NSA was unusual – the agency rarely comments publicly on specific allegations about its surveillance activities. </p><p>However the White House and NSA are coming under intense pressure to reveal the extent to which Obama and senior administration officials knew about US surveillance operations targeting the leaders of allied countries.<br />The agency did not dispute another report in Germany, based on documents disclosed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/nsa-surveillance-brazil-germany-un-resolution\"> the NSA's Special Collection Service (SCS) had listed Merkel's phone number since 2002</a>. The report, in Der Spiegel, said the phone number was still on the list – marked as \"GE Chancellor Merkel\" – weeks before Obama visited Berlin in June, raising the possibility that the German leader had been under surveillance for more than a decade. </p><p>In an SCS document cited by the magazine, the agency said it had a \"not legally registered spying branch\" in the US embassy in Berlin, the exposure of which would lead to \"grave damage for the relations of the United States to another government\".</p><p>A delegation of German intelligence officials are due to arrive in the US to meet counterparts in the coming days. They are expected to demand clarity on the nature and scope of NSA activities in their country. </p><h2>'A greater focus'</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421111505'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380641091821/NSA-headquarters-in-Fort--010.jpg' alt='NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>However in Washington, the first signs are emerging that Obama's administration may seek to distance itself from the NSA, concluding that the spy-agency has strayed beyond its remit and overreached. Many senior figures in Congress have already said the NSA failed to properly inform them of the nature and scope of its surveillance activities.</p><p>Lisa Monaco, a homeland security advisor to the White House, called on Friday for a \"greater focus\" to ensure the US was balancing \"security needs with the privacy concerns all people share\". <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/10/24/nsa-foreign-leaders-president-obama-lisa-monaco-editorials-debates/3183331/\">Her op-ed piece in USA Today</a> was widely interpreted as a signal of growing concern within the administration.</p><p>Monaco wrote: \"We want to ensure we are collecting information because we need it and not just because we can.\"</p><p>In August, announcing a review of US intelligence activities in the aftermath of the first disclosures based on documents leaked by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\">whistleblower Edward Snowden</a>, Obama gave the impression that the NSA was solely focused on counter-terrorism measures.</p><p>\"I don't have an interest and the people at the NSA don't have an interest in doing anything other than making sure that where we can prevent a terrorist attack, where we can get information ahead of time, that we're able to carry out that critical task,\" he said. \"We do not have an interest in doing anything other than that.\"</p><p>The Spiegel report said the NSA's Berlin-based surveillance hub, adjacent to the Brandenburg gate, was one of several in Europe, citing a 2010 document that referred to branches existing in about 80 locations across the world, including Paris, Madrid, Rome, Prague, Geneva and Frankfurt. The article said it was not clear whether the monitoring of Merkel's phone included actual telephone conversations or was restricted to call data, but raised the question over whether a surveillance operation, which began three years before she became chancellor, was initially intended to gather intelligence ahead of the Iraq War, which Germany opposed. </p><p>Merkel, then in opposition, was critical of Germany's anti-war stance. Bild reported that the then-chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, was also the target of surveillance, at the behest of the George Bush administration.</p><h2>A new dimension</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421111506'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/8/14/1376489918799/Mike-Rogers-of-Michigan-010.jpg' alt='Mike Rogers of Michigan' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Republican Mike Rogers is the chair of the House intelligence committee. Photograph: AP</figcaption></figure><p>Revelations about the NSA monitoring foreign leaders – particularly allies – have blown open a dimension of the NSA scandal which, until now, has proven relatively uncontroversial in the US: surveillance conducted abroad.</p><p>The US debate over NSA surveillance has focused almost exclusively on operations that may involve US citizens – such as a program to collect the phone records of millions of Americans. Until the recent revelations, there was virtually no concern raised over surveillance involving foreign citizens, even among vocal critics of the NSA on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Legislation to reform the NSA, which is being introduced in both houses of Congress this week, focuses almost entirely upon surveillance activities that might involve US citizens. Few in Washington are challenging the administration's claim that \"all nations\" engage in similar forms of espionage. </p><p>However diplomatic sources have told the Guardian that the White House's declarations that its practices do not differ from those employed by \"all nations\" are deeply misleading. </p><p>The sources said that while the US, Russia, China, Britain and France are well-known to engage in aggressive cyber espionage, including against allies, many other countries do not have anywhere near the same surveillance infrastructure – and concentrate their more limited resources on counter-terrorism and serious crime.</p><p>The revelations about NSA activity in Germany were discussed on the US Sunday morning political talkshows. Speaking on Face the Nation, on CBS, the Republican Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House oversight and government reform committee was asked if he thought Obama had known about the surveillance of Merkel's phone. </p><p>He said: \"Remember, the NSA works for the president. Through his national security advisers he knew or should have known.\"</p><p>Asked about the propriety of such surveillance, Issa answered: \"If what you do in Germany helps the Germans, then fine. But you don't spy on a head of state.\"</p><p>Mike Rogers, the Republican chair of the House intelligence committee, was more bullish in defending surveillance practices, criticising press coverage of the latest NSA revelations and arguing that Europeans were unaware of the extent of surveillance conducted by their own governments and had been misled by incorrect media reports about the nature of NSA activities.</p><p>He told CNN recent reports in France about the NSA's monitoring of millions of phone calls in the country were \"100% wrong\".</p><p>\"I would argue by the way, if the French citizens knew exactly what that was about, they would be applauding and popping champagne corks,\" he said. \"It's a good thing – it keeps the French safe.\"</p><p>Going further, Rogers claimed that the emergence of fascism in Europe in the early 20th century could be partly explained by a conscious decision by the US not to monitor its allies. </p><p>\"We said: 'We're not going to do any kinds of those things, that would not be appropriate,\" he said. \"Look what happened in the 30s: the rise of fascism, the rise of communism, the rise of imperialism. We didn't see any of it. And it resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of people.\"</p><p>Rogers added: \"Remember: sometimes our friends have relationships with our adversaries.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 28 October 2013.

Moraes, head of the civil liberties committee inquiry on mass surveillance of EU citizens, writes that the Snowden documents suggest that &quot;the type of surveillance that is taking place by intelligence services is completely disproportionate in the important fight against terrorism and for security&quot;. The allegations &quot;need to be investigated&quot;, he writes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am leading a European Parliament delegation to Washington on 28-30 October which will allow us to discuss directly with US counterparts the alleged surveillance activities by the American NSA and any impact they have in terms of EU citizens' fundamental right to privacy.<br />Since the Edward Snowden revelations in June, both authorities in the US and the EU agree that a public debate on these issues is welcome and necessary. <br />We consider it extremely important to meet with NSA’s Director, General Keith Alexander, who has repeatedly stated the importance of dialogue. Given the gravity of these accusations, the pivotal role he plays within the NSA and the political message that such a meeting would make, we are hoping that he will respond to our invitation positively.</p> </blockquote> <p>Moraes mentions the recent approval by the European parliament of an amended package of legislation that would overhaul EU data protection rules that date from 1995. The European parliament also voted on Wednesday to suspend the Swift agreement, the international system used for transferring money electronically, which is based in Europe, because of suggestions the United States may have violated it, accessing more data than it was allowed to. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key question is where will all these allegations lead to - for my part and my involvement with the European parliament's inquiry, emphasis has to be put on ensuring that there is a strong legal framework in place in the EU which not only protects EU citizens’ fundamental right to privacy but also ensures that member states and third countries, including the US, respect this right too.</p> </blockquote> <p>In September the European parliament's civil liberties committee launched a public inquiry into the surveillance of EU citizens revealed by Snowden. But Moraes complains that no EU member states have agreed to have their intelligence agencies appear at the public hearings.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is absolutely necessary that EU governments respond to these requests so that we can establish facts and ensure that European citizens are fully informed. It is only by participation of these intelligence authorities that we can get clarification on their surveillance programmes, especially in relation to their existence, scope, legality and proportionality.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T16:55:13.476Z\">at 4.55pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-526e83d5e4b08f00895224f3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T15:35:52.431Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/28/us-ambassador-spain-nsa-spying-allegations-costos-video\">video shows James Costos</a>, the US ambassador to Spain, arriving at the foreign ministry to meet officials. </p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/28/us-ambassador-spain-nsa-spying-allegations-costos-video\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"1987917\" data-video-name=\"US ambassador to Spain, James Costos, summoned over NSA spying allegations - video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\" data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/28/1382970287154/US-ambassador-to-Spain-Ja-001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-421129663\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/28/1382970287154/US-ambassador-to-Spain-Ja-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/28/131028Spain-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/28/131028Spain_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/28/131028Spain_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/28/131028Spain/131028Spain.m3u8\"></source> </video> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526e82c6e4b0509529e124ab\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T15:31:16.293Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spain</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Spanish government has warned the US that revelations of widespread spying by the National Security Agency could, if confirmed, “lead to a breakdown in the traditional trust” between the two countries, writes <strong>Paul Hamilos</strong> in Madrid.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The White House has so far declined to comment on the El Mundo report.

They reveal that during G20 meetings in April and September 2009 GCHQ used what one document calls &quot;ground-breaking intelligence capabilities&quot; to intercept the communications of visiting delegations.</p> <p>This included:</p> <p>• Setting up internet cafes where they used an email interception programme and key-logging software to spy on delegates' use of computers;</p> <p>• Penetrating the security on delegates' BlackBerrys to monitor their email messages and phone calls;</p> <p>• Supplying 45 analysts with a live round-the-clock summary of who was phoning who at the summit;</p> <p>• Targeting the Turkish finance minister and possibly 15 others in his party;</p> <p>• Receiving reports from an NSA attempt to eavesdrop on the Russian leader, Dmitry Medvedev, as his phone calls passed through satellite links to Moscow.</p> <p>The documents suggest that the operation was sanctioned in principle at a senior level in the government of the then prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown\">Gordon Brown</a>, and that intelligence, including briefings for visiting delegates, was passed to British ministers.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526e7879e4b0509529e124a5\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T14:53:01.642Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Washington rally</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In case you missed it, there was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/26/protesters-rally-washington-against-nsa-surveillance-video\">rally </a>in protest against the surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden in Washington, DC, on Saturday.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/nsa-rally-stop-watching-washington-snowden\">Jim Newell reports</a>, thousands gathered to march, chant and listen to speakers and performers in a day called &quot;Stop Watching Us&quot;. </p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/26/protesters-rally-washington-against-nsa-surveillance-video\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"1987386\" data-video-name=\"Protesters rally in Washington against NSA surveillance - video\" data-video-provider=\"Reuters\" data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/26/1382806821105/Demonstrators-Protest-NSA-005.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-421029776\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/26/1382806821105/Demonstrators-Protest-NSA-005.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/26/131024NSA-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/26/131024NSA_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/26/131024NSA/131024NSA.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/26/131024NSA_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure> <p>As Jim points out, Stop Watching Us was sponsored by an unusually broad coalition of left- and rightwing groups, including everything from the American Civil Liberties Union, the Green Party, Color of Change and Daily Kos to the Libertarian Party, FreedomWorks and Young Americans for Liberty.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526e718ae4b08f00895224ef\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T14:18:22.640Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Associated Press has a report on how the meeting between US ambassador James Costos and Spanish foreign ministry officials went.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Afterward, the ministry made no direct reference to the El Mundo report but called on US authorities to hand over all the necessary information concerning &quot;supposed eavesdropping carried out in Spain&quot;.</p> <p> Spain warned the United States &quot;of the importance of preserving the climate of confidence existing in bilateral relations and to know the extent of practices, which if true, are impropriate and unacceptable between friendly allies,&quot; the ministry said in a statement.</p> <p> Costos, for his part, reminded Spain how it has benefited from US intelligence.</p> <p> The US &quot;acknowledges that some of our closest allies have raised concerns about the recent series of unauthorised disclosures of classified information,&quot; the ambassador said.</p> <p> He said the programmes referred to in the media &quot;are national security programmes that have played a critical role in protecting citizens of the United States.

But he also looks at the extraordinary level of legal, and possibly illegal, phone-tapping carried out by the Spanish intelligence services. Paul writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Under Spanish law a judge must give permission before a phone can be tapped, and is then required to permanently supervise the execution of that legal order. According to Boye, there are around one million phone lines currently being monitored in Spain, and given the number of judges, he says that works out at an average 600 wiretaps supposedly being supervised by each judge. That's a lot of work.

The alarming development means our spies can no longer keep track of militants’ plans and opens Britain up to a possible 9/11-style outrage.</p> </blockquote> <p>It says that “in a bid to show the damage the leaks published by the Guardian have caused, [the spy chiefs] will speak out to intelligence and security committee MPs on November 7&quot;.</p> <p>The paper, which illustrates its piece with a picture of the 9/11 attacks, quotes “a top surveillance source” as saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some very dangerous people have gone quiet.

The piece shone some light on how Greenwald may proceed in reporting on the Snowden documents he has in his possession once he moves on to the new news website he is setting up with eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.</p> <p>Keller asked Greenwald what his policy would be on publishing information “that some would argue jeopardises national security”. Greenwald replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As for taking into account dangers posed to innocent life before publishing: nobody disputes that journalists should do this. But I don’t give added weight to the lives of innocent Americans as compared to the lives of innocent non-Americans, nor would I feel any special fealty to the US government as opposed to other governments when deciding what to publish …</p> <p>I have no objection to the process whereby the White House is permitted to give input prior to the publication of sensitive secrets.</p> <p>Indeed, WikiLeaks, advocates of radical transparency, went to the White House and sought guidance before publishing the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, but the White House<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/08/20/wikileaks_5/\"> refused</a> to respond, then had the temerity to criticize WikiLeaks for publishing material that it said should have been withheld. That pre-publication process is both journalistically sensible (journalists should get as much relevant information as they can before making publication decisions) and legally wise (every Espionage Act lawyer will say that such consultation can help prove journalistic intent when publishing such material). For all the N.S.A. reporting I’ve done — not just at The Guardian but with media outlets around the world — the White House was notified by editors before the fact of publication (though in the vast, vast majority of cases, their demands that information be suppressed were disregarded due to lack of specific reasons in favor of suppression).</p> <p>My objection is not to that process itself but to specific instances where it leads to the suppression of information that ought to be public.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is what Greenwald said when asked about his venture with Omidyar:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We absolutely believe that strong, experienced editors are vital to good journalism, and intend to have plenty of those. Editors are needed to ensure the highest level of factual accuracy, to verify key claims, and to help journalists make choices that avoid harm to innocents.</p> <p>But they are not needed to impose obsolete stylistic rules, or to snuff out the unique voice and passion of the journalists, or to bar any sort of declarative statements when high-level officials prevaricate, or to mandate government-requested euphemisms in lieu of factually clear terms, or to vest official statements or official demands for suppression with superior status. In sum, editors should be there to empower and enable strong, highly factual, aggressive adversarial journalism, not to serve as roadblocks to neuter or suppress the journalism.</p> <p>We intend to treat claims from the most powerful factions with skepticism, not reverence. Official assertions are our stating point to investigate (“Official A said X, Y and Z today: now let’s see if that’s true”), not the gospel around which we build our narratives (“X, Y and Z, official A says”).</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f3e05d8d-44b7-4773-b372-de679f4cdbd0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/02/18/DSC01121newyorktimes089.jpg\" alt=\"The New York Times building in New York.

That reaction gives potent insight into the true mindset of many western leaders.</p> <p>• Second, all of these governments keep saying how newsworthy these revelations are, how profound are the violations they expose, how happy they are to learn of all this, how devoted they are to reform. If that's true, why are they allowing the person who enabled all these disclosures –<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\"> Edward Snowden</a> – to be targeted for persecution by the US government for the &quot;crime&quot; of blowing the whistle on all of this? ...</p> <p>• Third, is there any doubt at all that the US government repeatedly tried to mislead the world when insisting that this system of suspicionless surveillance was motivated by an attempt to protect Americans from The Terrorists™? Our reporting has revealed spying on<a href=\"http://epoca.globo.com/tempo/noticia/2013/08/carta-em-que-o-atual-bembaixadorb-americano-no-brasil-bagradece-o-apoio-da-nsab.html\"> conferences designed to negotiate economic agreements</a>, the Organization of American States,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/nsa-spying-brazil-oil-petrobras\"> oil companies</a>, ministries that<a href=\"http://m.g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/10/american-and-canadian-spies-target-brazilian-energy-and-mining-ministry.html\"> oversee mines and energy resources</a>, the democratically elected leaders of allied states, and entire populations in those states.</p> </blockquote> <p>Greenwald also drew attention to the comments made by NSA director Keith Alexander last week; Alexander said ”we ought to come up with a way of stopping” reporting on Snowden’s leaks. He also accused journalists of “selling” the Snowden documents – which is not the case. Greenwald noted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are 25,000 employees of the NSA (and many tens of thousands more who work for private contracts assigned to the agency). Maybe one of them can tell The General about<a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZS.html\"> this thing called &quot;the first amendment&quot;</a>.</p> <p>I'd love to know what ways, specifically, General Alexander has in mind for empowering the US government to &quot;come up with a way of stopping&quot; the journalism on this story. Whatever ways those might be, they are deeply hostile to the US constitution – obviously. What kind of person wants the government to forcibly shut down reporting by the press?</p> </blockquote> <p>The debate over Alexander’s comments also illustrates the difference between the debate over the Snowden files in the US and in the UK. In Britain some spy chiefs, politicians and even rival newspapers have attacked the Guardian’s publication of these stories.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2d718715-327a-4aae-95be-370e295293c0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381957734300/f740f8cc-5b6f-46b0-aacc-77c72c1d78ec-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"NSA director Gen Keith Alexander.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>NSA director Gen Keith Alexander.

El Mundo said that a document provided by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden shows that the NSA monitored the phone calls from 10 December 2012 to 8 January 2013, but not their content. The dates were the same <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/nsa-files-live-coverage-developments-reaction#block-5264e9ade4b0bbc67cfff627\">in the French case</a>.</p> <p>• <strong>The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security\"> US National Security</a> Agency was forced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/27/barack-obama-nsa-angela-merkel-germany\">on Sunday</a> to deny that its director ever discussed a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance\"> surveillance</a> operation against the German chancellor with President<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama\"> Barack Obama</a>, as the White House tried to contain a full-scale diplomatic crisis over<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/espionage\"> espionage</a> directed at allied countries. </strong>The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration\"> Obama administration</a> appeared in disarray as it struggled with the fallout over the disclosure that the National Security Agency<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls\"> monitored the phone conversations</a> of at least 35 world leaders, and that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/nsa-surveillance-brazil-germany-un-resolution\"> the phone of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had been monitored</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Early on Sunday, the White House refused to comment on<a href=\"http://www.dw.de/media-reports-suggest-obama-knew-nsa-spied-on-merkel/a-17185662\"> an overnight report in the German tabloid Bild</a>, which alleged that Obama was personally briefed about by the operation to target Merkel's phone by the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\"> NSA</a>'s director, Keith Alexander, and allowed it to continue.</p> <p>That appeared to conflict with a second report, in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. It said that when Obama spoke to Merkel over the phone on Wednesday, he assured the German leader he had not previously known her phone had been monitored.</p> <p>Caitlin Hayden, the White House's national security council spokeswoman, declined to comment on the reports, telling the Guardian: &quot;We are not going to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity.&quot;</p> <p>However just over three hours later, that position appeared to have been reversed, when the NSA said in a statement that Alexander &quot;did not discuss with President Obama in 2010 an alleged foreign intelligence operation involving German Chancellor Merkel, nor has he ever discussed alleged operations involving Chancellor Merkel. News reports claiming otherwise are not true&quot;.</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong>The first signs are emerging that Obama's administration may seek to distance itself from the NSA, concluding that the spy-agency has strayed beyond its remit and overreached.</strong> Many senior figures in Congress have already said the NSA failed to properly inform them of the nature and scope of its surveillance activities.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>A delegation of nine MEPs are due to travel to Washington today for a three-day visit, during which they will press senior US government and intelligence officials for answers on allegations of widespread spying by the US, and explore &quot;possible legal remedies for EU citizens&quot; resulting from the alleged surveillance.</strong> The EU's civil liberties committee will meet members of Congress to express their concerns over the impact on EU citizens' fundamental right to privacy. Separately, the German government said on Friday that a group of senior officials including the heads of its foreign and domestic intelligence agencies would travel to the US &quot;shortly&quot; for talks at the White House and with the NSA.</p> <p>We’ll have all this and more throughout the day today.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T10:42:40.637Z\">at 10.42am GMT</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421103644|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|3f84eb70c517d3ed9bc19ac4f6ab5a6fa328245b -->",

It appears that the content of the calls was not monitored but the serial and phone numbers of the handsets used, the locations,  sim cards and the duration of the calls were. Emails and other social media were also monitored.</p><p>The news comes as a parliamentary delegation from the EU prepares to visit Washington to discuss the scale of US spying on its allies. The EU's civil liberties committee will meet members of Congress to express their concerns over the impact on EU citizens' fundamental right to privacy.</p><p>Last week Spain rejected a move by Germany, which wants the EU's 28 member states to sign a \"no-spy deal\" along the lines of an agreement wanted by Berlin and Paris.</p><p>\"We'll see once we have more information if we decide to join with what France and Germany have done,\" Rajoy said at a press conference in Brussels on Friday.</p><p>\"But these aren't decisions which correspond to the European Union. They are questions related to national security and are the exclusive responsibility of member states. France and Germany have decided to do one thing and the rest of us may decide to do the same, or something else.\"</p><p>The White House and NSA are coming under intense pressure to reveal the extent to which Obama and senior administration officials knew about US surveillance operations targeting the leaders of allied countries.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421106251|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d74b151318a69f07a36910398002a361497da61d -->",

        "headline":"Spain warns US of breakdown in trust after new NSA revelations",
        "body":"<p>The Spanish government has warned of a potential breakdown of trust with the US following reports that the National Security Agency monitored more than 60m phone calls in Spain in the space of one month.</p><p>As the White House struggled to contain a growing diplomatic crisis with its allies across the world, Madrid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/28/us-ambassador-spain-nsa-spying-allegations-costos-video\" title=\"\">summoned the US ambassador to Spain</a> to demand an explanation of the extent of US spying. The NSA is alleged to have intercepted 60.5m phone calls in Spain between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013.</p><p>In the latest revelations from the documents leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/28/us-ambassador-spain-nsa-spying-allegations-costos-video\" title=\"\">El Mundo newspaper</a> published an NSA graphic, entitled \"Spain – last 30 days\", showing the daily flow of phone calls within Spain. On one day alone – 11 December 2012 – the NSA reportedly monitored more than 3.5m phone calls.</p><p>The outcry comes days after it emerged that the NSA spied on the phone calls of scores of allies, including the personal phone of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p><p>It appears that the content of the calls was not monitored but the NSA recorded the serial and phone numbers of the handsets used, the locations, sim cards and the duration of the calls. Emails and other social media were also monitored in what human rights groups have called an extraordinary invasion of people's privacy. El Mundo said software called Boundless Informant was used to process the information.</p><p>Following the meeting between the US ambassador, James Costos, and Spanish government ministers, the foreign ministry released a statement, saying: \"Spain has relayed to the United States the importance of preserving a climate of trust … and its interest in understanding the full reach of practices that, if true, would be considered inappropriate and unacceptable between allies\".</p><p>Costos said Washington acknowledged \"that some of our closest allies have raised concerns about the recent series of unauthorised disclosures of classified information\". However, he defended the NSA, saying it had not only played a critical role in protecting the US, but had \"also played an instrumental role in our co-ordination with our allies and in protecting their interests, as well.\"</p><p>At a press conference in Warsaw, during an official visit to Poland, the Spanish foreign minister, José Manuel García Margallo, said that if the monitoring of tens of millions of phone calls was confirmed, it could \"lead to a breakdown in the traditional trust\" between the two countries.</p><p>Margallo, who was kept informed on the showdown with the US ambassador in Madrid, warned that the NSA could have broken Spain's privacy laws, which prohibit the conservation of data in relation to electronic communications. It remains unclear whether the telephone of the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, or other members of the Spanish government, were tapped.</p><p>There is a growing feeling in Spain that the government has not done enough to protect its own citizens. Since 2001, when the then Spanish prime minister, José María Aznar, opted to join the Iraq war, ignoring great public opposition, Spain has enjoyed warm relations with the US, albeit as a very junior partner. Aznar and former president George Bush met on numerous occasions and it is widely understood that they agreed to share intelligence. The US has CIA and NSA offices in Madrid and many believe that there would be little surprise within the Spanish intelligence community at the extent of US spying.</p><p>Amnesty International called on the Spanish government on Monday to \"reflect on its total failure to protect its own citizens' privacy\". The head of Amnesty in Spain, Esteban Beltrán, accused the government of only reacting when the full extent of US spying was revealed in the press: \"It's not a question of legislation – because there are laws that protect the individual's right to privacy – it is question of the government failing in its duties in what can only be called a massive and arbitrary invasion of the rights of all those who live in Spain.\"</p><p>Amnesty called on the government to ensure that all surveillance had a \"legitimate objective, and was carried out with the proper judicial supervision\".</p><p>In a sign that the Spanish government is less troubled than its counterparts in Paris and Berlin, Rajoy last week rejected a move to get the EU's 28 member states to sign a \"no-spy\" deal. \"We'll see once we have more information if we decide to join with what France and Germany have done,\" he said in Brussels on Friday. \"But these aren't decisions which correspond to the European Union. They are questions related to national security and are the exclusive responsibility of member states. France and Germany have decided to do one thing and the rest of us may decide to do the same, or something else,\" he said.</p><p>But the latest revelations have forced Madrid to take a stronger public line against Washington, which is under intense pressure to reveal the extent to which US President Barack Obama was aware of the extent of surveillance operations targeting the leaders of allied countries.</p><p>The latest developments came as an EU parliamentary delegation began a visit Washington to discuss the scale of US spying on its allies. Claude Moraes, the British Labour MP who is leading the delegation, said the Snowden documents suggested that \"the type of surveillance that is taking place by intelligence services is completely disproportionate in the important fight against terrorism and for security\". The allegations resulting from Snowden's leaks need to be investigated, he said.</p><p>He said the MEPs hoped to meet with NSA director General Keith Alexander and said \"emphasis has to be put on ensuring that there is a strong legal framework in place in the EU which not only protects EU citizens' fundamental right to privacy but also ensures that member states and third countries, including the US, respect this right, too\".</p><p>In September, the European parliament's civil liberties committee launched a Moraes-led public inquiry into the surveillance of EU citizens revealed by Snowden. But Moraes complained that no EU member states had agreed to have their intelligence agencies appear at the public hearings. \"It is absolutely necessary that EU governments respond to these requests so that we can establish facts and ensure that European citizens are fully informed,\" he said.</p><p>The White House has not commented on the reports in El Mundo.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421134854|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|ba6ea4d2c33ad61fc08d54d8ab363dd78fe66d70 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Obama administration's international surveillance crisis deepened on Monday as representatives from a Latin American human rights panel told US diplomats that oversight of the programs was \"illusory\".</p><p>Members of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an arm of the Organization of American States, expressed frustration and dissatisfaction with the National Security Agency's mass surveillance of foreign nationals – something the agency argues is both central to its existence and necessary to prevent terrorism. </p><p>\"With a program of this scope, it's obvious that any form of control becomes illusory when there's hundreds of millions of communications that become monitored and surveilled,\" said Felipe Gonzales, a commissioner and Chilean national.</p><p>\"This is of concern to us because maybe the Inter-American Committee on Human Rights may become a target as well of surveillance,\" said Rodrigo Escobar Gil, a commissioner and Colombian citizen.</p><p>Frank La Rue, the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, told the commission that the right to privacy was \"inextricably linked\" to free expression. </p><p>\"What is not permissible from a human rights point of view is that those that hold political power or those that are in security agencies or, even less, those in intelligence agencies decide by themselves, for themselves, what the scope of these surveillance activities are, or who will be targeted, or who will be blank surveilled,\" La Rue said.</p><p>While the US sent four representatives to the hearing, they offered no defence, rebuttal or elaboration about bulk surveillance, saying the October government shutdown prevented them from adequate preparation. \"We are here to listen,\" said deputy permanent representative Lawrence Gumbiner, who pledged to submit written responses within 30 days.</p><p>All 35 North, Central and South American nations are members of the commission. La Rue, originally from Guatemala and an independent expert appointed by the Human Rights Council, travels the world reporting on human rights concerns – often in countries with poor democratic standards. </p><p>Spying on foreigners is the core mission of the NSA, one that it vigorously defends as appropriate, legal and unexceptional given the nature of global threats and widespread spycraft. Monday's hearing suggested that there are diplomatic consequences to bulk surveillance even if there may not be legal redress for non-Americans. </p><p>Brazil has already shown a willingness to challenge Washington over bulk surveillance. President Dilma Rousseff <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/17/brazil-president-snub-us-nsa\">postponed a September meeting</a> with President Obama in protest, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/brazil-president-un-speech-nsa-surveillance\">denounced the spying</a> during the UN general assembly shortly thereafter. Brazil is also teaming up with Germany at the UN on a general assembly resolution demanding an end to the mass surveillance. </p><p>The commission's examination of the NSA's bulk surveillance activities suggested a potential southern front could open in the spy crisis just as the administration is attempting to calm down Europe.</p><p>The Obama administration has been fielding a week's worth of European outrage following media reports that the NSA had collected a similarly large volume of phone calls from France – which director of national intelligence James Clapper, who recently apologised for misleading the Senate about domestic spying, called \"false\" – and spying on German chancellor Angela Merkel's own cellphone, which US officials have effectively confessed to. </p><p>Brazil and Mexico are also demanding answers from US intelligence officials, following reports about intrusive acts of espionage in their territory revealed by documents provided to journalists by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The White House has said it will provide some answers after the completion of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/nsa-surveillance-review-panel-insiders\">external review of its surveillance programs</a>, scheduled to be completed before the end of the year. </p><p>The Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls\">reported on Thursday</a> that the NSA has intercepted the communications of 35 world leaders.</p><p>International discomfort with NSA bulk surveillance is not the only spy challenge the Obama administration now confronts. </p><p>Congressman James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican and key author of the 2001 Patriot Act, is poised to introduce a bill this week that would prevent the NSA from collecting phone records on American citizens in bulk and without an individual warrant. The National Journal reported that Sensenbrenner's bill, which has a companion in the Senate, <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/once-opposed-key-lawmakers-back-new-anti-nsa-bill-20131025\">has attracted eight co-sponsors</a> who either voted against or abstained on a July amendment in the House that would have defunded the domestic phone records bulk collection, a legislative gambit that came within seven votes of passage.</p><p>Sensenbrenner's bill, like its Senate counterpart sponsored by Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy, would not substantially restrict the NSA's foreign-focused surveillance, which is a traditional NSA activity. There is practically no congressional appetite, and no viable legislation, to limit the NSA from intercepting the communications of foreigners. </p><p>An early sign about the course of potential surveillance reforms in the House of Representatives may come as early as Tuesday. The House intelligence committee, a hotbed of support for the NSA, will hold its first public hearing of the fall legislative calendar on proposed surveillance legislation. Its chairman, Mike Rogers of Michigan, has proposed requiring greater transparency on the NSA and the surveillance court that oversees it, but would largely leave the actual surveillance activities of the NSA, inside and outside the United States, untouched. </p><p>Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the ACLU, which requested the hearing at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, warned the human rights panel that the NSA could \"target the foreign members of this commission when they travel abroad\", as well as foreign dissidents of US-aligned governments; foreign lawyers for Guantánamo detainees; and other foreigners.</p><p>\"If every country were to engage in surveillance as pervasive as the NSA, we would soon live in a state … with no refuge for the world's dissidents, journalists and human rights defenders,\" Abdo said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421146201|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|6b9713822935a00cc18e961a4adf7c46ff4588eb -->",

        "headline":"David Cameron makes veiled threat to media over NSA and GCHQ leaks",
        "body":"<p>David Cameron has called on the Guardian and other newspapers to show \"social responsibility\" in the reporting of the leaked NSA files to avoid high court injunctions or the use of D notices to prevent the publication of information that could damage national security.</p><p>In a statement to MPs on Monday about last week's European summit in Brussels, where he warned of the dangers of a \"lah-di-dah, airy-fairy view\" about the dangers of leaks, the prime minister said his preference was to talk to newspapers rather than resort to the courts. But he said it would be difficult to avoid acting if newspapers declined to heed government advice.</p><p>The prime minister issued the warning after the Tory MP Julian Smith quoted a report in Monday's edition of the Sun that said Britain's intelligence agencies believed details from the NSA files leaked by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden had hampered their work.</p><p>The Sun quoted a \"top surveillance source\" as saying that terrorists had \"gone quiet\" after the publication of details about NSA and GCHQ operations.</p><p>Cameron told MPs: \"We have a free press, it's very important the press feels it is not pre-censored from what it writes and all the rest of it.</p><p>\"The approach we have taken is to try to talk to the press and explain how damaging some of these things can be and that is why the Guardian did actually destroy some of the information and disks that they have. But they've now gone on and printed further material which is damaging.</p><p>\"I don't want to have to use injunctions or D notices or the other tougher measures. I think it's much better to appeal to newspapers' sense of social responsibility. But if they don't demonstrate some social responsibility it would be very difficult for government to stand back and not to act.\"</p><p>The Guardian agreed to allow officials from GCHQ to oversee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/nsa-snowden-files-drives-destroyed-london\" title=\"\">the destruction of hard drives</a> in July, after the government threatened to use an injunction to block publication of information from the NSA files.</p><p>Alan Rusbridger, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, said the destruction of the hard drives allowed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters\" title=\"\">the Guardian to continue reporting on the NSA files</a> from its New York office.</p><p>The D-notice system is a voluntary code between government departments with responsibility for national security and the media. A notice can be issued to the media to prevent \"inadvertent public disclosure of information that would compromise UK military and intelligence operations and methods\".</p><p>Cameron had earlier indicated that the oversight of Britain's intelligence agencies may have to evolve in light of the revelations about the reach of new technology. He told MPs: \"We have parliamentary scrutiny of our intelligence agencies through the intelligence and security committee and we have strengthened that oversight.</p><p>\"Our agencies operate under the law and their work is overseen by intelligence commissioners. Of course as technology develops and as the threats we face evolve so we need to make sure that the scrutiny and the frameworks in place remain strong and effective.\"</p><p>Parliament's intelligence and security committee announced earlier this month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/17/uk-gchq-nsa-surveillance-inquiry-snowden\" title=\"\">that it is to scutinise the extent of mass surveillance</a> in response to the concerns raised by the Snowden leaks.</p><p>The prime minister issued his warning to newspapers after Ed Miliband raised concerns about the reports last week that the US has monitored the mobile <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/27/barack-obama-nsa-angela-merkel-germany\" title=\"\">phone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel</a>.</p><p>Miliband said: \"I join the prime minister in his support for the work of our intelligence services. It is vital, it keeps us safe and, by its very nature, it goes unrecognised. I join the prime minister in applauding the men and women who work for our intelligence agencies.</p><p>\"We can all understand the deep concerns that recent reports have caused in some European countries, especially Germany. As well as providing that support for intelligence services it is right that every country ensures proper oversight of those activities.\"</p><p>Julian Smith, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/22/edward-snowden-guardian-should-be-prosecuted-tory-mp\" title=\"\">recently wrote to the Metropolitan police to assess whether the Guardian has broken the law</a> in publishing details from the NSA files, asked the PM in the Commons: \"Following the Sun's revelations this morning about the impact of the Snowden leaks, is it not time that any newspaper that may have crossed the line on national security comes forward and voluntarily works with the government to mitigate further risks to our citizens?\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421149628|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|c844e6018c237fb161faf539bab3ee4beae66e8f -->",

        "body":"<p>Spain's public prosecutor's office announced on Tuesday that it had launched a preliminary inquiry into the alleged widespread surveillance of Spanish citizens' private phone calls and emails by the US National Security Agency, to determine whether it could be prosecuted under Spanish law.</p><p>It was reported on Monday that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/spain-warns-us-ambassador-breakdown-trust-nsa\" title=\"\">NSA had monitored 60.5m Spanish phone calls</a> in the space of one month alone, in the latest revelations from the documents leaked by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>The attorney general, Eduardo Torres-Dulce, issued a statement saying that, having seen the media reports \"about a possible interception and irregular access to telephonic and/or electronic metadata ... by foreign official services\" it would determine the exact nature of any potential crime and whether this could be punished under Spanish law.</p><p>The outcry comes days after it emerged that the NSA spied on the phone calls of scores of allies, including the personal phone of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p><p>On Monday, the Spanish foreign minister warned the US that, if the monitoring of tens of millions of phone calls was confirmed, it could \"lead to a breakdown in the traditional trust\" between the two countries. José Manuel García Margallo said that the NSA's alleged activities could have broken Spain's privacy laws, which prohibit the collecting of data in relation to electronic communications.</p><p>Madrid had earlier on Monday summoned the US ambassador to Spain, James Costos, to meet with government officials and explain the extent of US surveillance.</p><p>García Margallo on Tuesday nonetheless stressed the importance of relations between Spain and the US, and said it would not hold up negotiations over a European free-trade agreement. \"We work very closely with USA on security, we have some common topics where our positions are the same,\" he told a news conference on an official visit to Lithuania.</p><p>Many in Spain feel that the government has not done enough to protect its own interests and had previously shown a surprisingly relaxed attitude to US spying when the allegations first began to emerge in the press last week. Human rights groups have called on the government, led by Mariano Rajoy of the rightwing People's party, to do more to protect its citizens.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421222790|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|b69294c288ee74c82c8b89e9ef23de63c8be8f41 -->",

They include a report in the Guardian, based on documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, that at least 35 world leaders have been monitored by the agency.</p><p>\"Unless the United States is engaged in hostilities against a country or there is an emergency need for this type of surveillance, I do not believe the United States should be collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers. The president should be required to approve any collection of this sort,\" Feinstein added.</p><p>\"The White House has informed me that collection on our allies will not continue, which I support. But as far as I'm concerned, Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing. To that end, the committee will initiate a major review into all intelligence collection programs.\"</p><p>Feinstein's statement comes at a crucial time for the NSA. Legislation will be introduced in Congress on Tuesday that would curtail the agency's powers, and there are the first signs that the White House may be starting to distance itself from security chiefs. On Monday, the White House's chief spokesman, Jay Carney, said the administration \"acknowledged the tensions\" caused by Snowden's disclosures. </p><p>\"The president clearly feels strongly about making sure we are not just collecting information because we can, but because we should,\" Carney said. \"We recognize there needs to be additional constraints on how we gather and use intelligence.\" </p><p>Obama told ABC News on Monday evening that he would not discuss classified information but accepted that security operations were being reassessed to ensure proper oversight of the NSA's technical abilities.</p><p>He said: \"The national security operations, generally, have one purpose and that is to make sure the American people are safe and that I'm making good decisions. I'm the final user of all the intelligence that they gather. But they're involved in a whole wide range of issues.</p><p>\"We give them policy direction. But what we've seen over the last several years is their capacities continue to develop and expand, and that's why I'm initiating now a review to make sure that what they're able to do doesn't necessarily mean what they should be doing.\"</p><p>On Tuesday morning, James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican and author of the 2001 Patriot Act, will introduce a bill called the USA Freedom Act that will ban warrantless bulk phone metadata collection and prevent the NSA from querying its foreign communications databases for identifying information on Americans. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chairs the Senate judiciary committee, will introduce the bill's Senate counterpart that same day. </p><p>Also on Tuesday, the two most senior intelligence leaders are due to testify before the House intelligence committee. Both are now expected to be grilled on why they appear not to have informed either the White House or congressional oversight committees about the spying activities directed at foreign leaders.</p><p>James Clapper, the director of national intelligence who is under fire for misleading Congress on bulk domestic collection, will testify about surveillance reform Tuesday afternoon. He will be accompanied by General Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, who last week mused to a Pentagon blog that \"we ought to come up with a way of stopping\" reporters' stories about the NSA's bulk collection programs. </p><p>Their performance is likely to be influential towards members of Congress on the fence about bulk domestic collection ahead of a vote on Sensenbrenner's bill. A July predecessor came within seven votes of passage. </p><p>Feinstein's shifting position was not the only emerging challenge confronting the NSA late Monday. A new disclosure from the Electronic Frontier Foundation added to the agency's woes by suggesting that it began testing means to gather location data on cellphones inside the US before informing the secret surveillance court that oversees it.</p><p>A short document apparently written in 2011 by an NSA lawyer discussed a 2010 \"mobility testing effort\" involving \"cell site locations.\" The lawyer, whose name was redacted in a document obtained by the group under the Freedom of Information Act, said that the Justice Department was believed to have \"orally advised\" the so-called Fisa Court that \"we had obtained a limited set of test data sampling of cellular mobility data (cell site location information) pursuant to the Court-authorized program\" under section 215 of the Patriot Act, which the NSA uses to justify collecting Americans' phone records in bulk.</p><p>Alexander recently conceded that the so-called \"pilot program\" for cellular geolocation collection existed and said it was potentially a \"future requirement for the country.\" It was previously unknown that the pilot program proceeded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/nsa-us-cell-phone-data-location-programs\">before the Fisa Court knew of it.</a> </p><p>Just a month ago, in her own committee, Feinstein, delivered a full-throated and unequivocal defence of every surveillance activity conducted by the NSA.</p><p>\"It is my opinion that the surveillance activities conducted under FISA, and other programs operated by the National Security Agency, are lawful, they are effective, and they are conducted under careful oversight within the NSA, by the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and by the FISA Court and the Congress,\" Feinstein said on September 26.</p><p>In August, following disclosures that the NSA had improperly collected data on thousands of Americans, Feinstein accused the Washington Post of misquoting her, saying her committee \"has never identified an instance in which the NSA has intentionally abused its authority to conduct surveillance for inappropriate purposes\".</p><p>Feinstein is bringing her own legislation to enable superficial reforms of the NSA and the secret court system, but stops short of curbing the intelligence community's powers, is being marked up at her committee on Tuesday.</p><p>Feinstein's about-face presents the major challenge for the White House, which perceives the California Democrat as a key Senate surrogate on surveillance issues. </p><p>Obama has yet to take a position on the Leahy and Sensenbrenner bills. Congressional aides expect a major push by the NSA to defeat the bills, but are unsure how vigorously the White House will oppose them. </p><p>Carney's remarks on Monday, prompted by a growing sense of diplomatic backlash against the US over the NSA, provide additional uncertainty. US officials have distanced Obama from the foreign-leader spying in anonymous comments to the Wall Street Journal.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421160303|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|3adc32af0bec1212fcbe361ca00333d5391d56a0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Barack Obama will receive a classified dossier in the next two weeks that will lay out the consequences for US foreign relations of the National Security Agency's powerful surveillance apparatus and provide the White House with a raft of possible reforms.</p><p>The document is being drafted by a top-level group of experts appointed by the president to conduct an external review of US surveillance capabilities and the damage to public trust resulting from the Edward Snowden disclosures. </p><p>The review, parts of which will be declassified and released to the public, will be completed by mid-December. However, a senior administration official familiar with the process said a secret \"interim report\" will be shared with the president shortly.</p><p>The group's work has been delayed slightly because of the recent US government shutdown, but it is expected to submit the report to the president via the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, in the week beginning 11 November.</p><p>The review is being carried out by a panel that includes Richard Clarke, a former White House counter-terrorism chief, and Michael Morell, the previous deputy director of the CIA. </p><p>Its importance has been amplified over the last week, after a series of revelations about the nature and scope of monitoring activities abroad, particularly against US allies.</p><p>On Monday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/spain-summons-us-ambassador-nsa-calls\">the US ambassador to Spain, James Costos, was summoned by the prime minister</a> after reports in the El Mundo newspaper that the NSA had spied on 60 million phone calls in the country during one recent 30-day period.</p><p>The Spanish government called on the US to hand over all necessary information concerning \"supposed eavesdropping carried out in Spain\". Spain joins Brazil, Mexico, Germany and France on a list of countries demanding answers from the administration. On Monday, a delegation from the European parliament arrived in Washington to discuss the spy allegations with US lawmakers. </p><p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls\">the Guardian revealed</a> that the NSA monitored the phone conversations of at least 35 world leaders. Separately, Angela Merkel called Obama to protest that her phone had been monitored, with Der Spiegel reporting on Sunday that the surveillance on the German chancellor began as early as 2002.</p><p>Asked about the reports on Monday, the White House's chief spokesman, Jay Carney, said the administration \"acknowledged the tensions\" caused by Snowden's disclosures. \"We understand this has caused concern in countries that represent some of our closest relationships internationally,\" he said, \"and we are working to allay those concerns and to discuss these issues.\"</p><p>\"The president clearly feels strongly about making sure we are not just collecting information because we can, but because we should,\" Carney said. \"We recognize there needs to be additional constraints on how we gather and use intelligence.\" </p><p>Jen Psaki, spokeswoman for the the State Department, which is managing the diplomatic fallout, added that the US was \"not naive\" about the impact of the disclosures on foreign relations.</p><p>The White House has declined to say whether Merkel's phone was monitored in the past. But according to the Wall Street Journal, the Obama administration ordered the NSA to cease the surveillance of her and other leaders after the program emerged over the summer in a separate, internal review of the agency's activities.</p><p>Carney said that internal review, led by the White House with input from agencies across government, will also also be completed before the end of the year. It contains what Carney described as a \"separate\" component dedicated to dealing with issues relating to \"some of the very specific things with regard to intelligence gathered, including matters that deal with heads of states and other governments\". </p><p>The external review, which will feed into the White House's internal assessment of surveillance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/nsa-surveillance-review-panel-insiders\">has itself been criticised</a> for being too close to the Obama administration. </p><p>In addition to Clarke and Morell, the panel, which first met on 27 August, includes a law school professor, Geoffrey Stone, the former White House official Cass Sunstein and Peter Swire, who advised Obama and former president Bill Clinton on privacy. </p><p>The group has been tasked with reconsidering surveillance capabilities \"in light of advancements in technology\", seeking to find the right balance between national security interests and maintaining standards of privacy and civil liberties.</p><p>When he announced the review in early August, Obama specifically said it should consider \"how surveillance impacts our foreign policy – particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public\".</p><p>The foreign policy component of its work has now provided a renewed focus. The extent of anger among foreign countries, particularly in Europe, has taken some administration officials by surprise. The most furious reaction has come from Germany, which is planning to send a delegation to Washington in the coming days.</p><p>The delegation is expected to include the directors of Germany's foreign and domestic intelligence services, who will expect to meet their counterparts, including the director of the NSA, General Keith Alexander, according to a source with knowledge of the trip. </p><p>The delegation, which will arrive late this week or early next, will also include high-ranking officials from Chancellor Merkel's office who will meet with counterparts on the White House's national security council.</p><p>Separately, a group of European Union parliamentarians arrived in Washington on Monday to meet with US lawmakers and senior national security officials and discuss what the White House called \"privacy issues\".</p><p>US representative Mike Rogers, a Republican, said afterward they discussed the need to rebuild trust and share intelligence. </p><p>Rogers, a staunch defender of US intelligence agencies, acknowledged the parliamentarians have brought legitimate concerns, according to Reuters.</p><p>\"It's important to understand that we're going to have to have a policy discussion that is bigger than any individual intelligence agency of either Europe or the United States,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421150470|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|14b5822e47467b35e6c59fdffb084de447d056a7 -->",
