        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.turn2us.org.uk/information__resources/benefits/benefits_news_and_changes/benefit_cap.aspx#whatis\" title=\"\">benefit cap</a> – according to opinion polls the government's <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/07/benefit-caps-polling-success-paves-way-for-tough-2015-promises/\" title=\"\">most popular welfare policy</a> – is neither forcing unemployed people to take a job nor saving taxpayers' money, according to the first in-depth study of the policy.</p><p>Research in the borough of Haringey in north London found just a handful of the 747 households affected by the cap have secured a job or increased their working hours since it was introduced six months ago, despite intensive and personalised support from councils and local jobcentres.</p><p>Although the policy was shaving £60,000 a week from the benefits bill locally, this amounted to just 1% of the council's total weekly benefit expenditure. Haringey has so far spent £55,000 a week on short-term discretionary grants to help claimants affected by the cap meet rent shortfalls, and thousands more on providing extra welfare and employment advice.</p><p>The few capped claimants who had so far moved into employment were already \"close to the labour market\" and were likely to have got a job anyway, or were already working part-time and had increased their hours, according to Haringey jobcentre officials and charity job advisers interviewed by the <a href=\"http://www.cih.org\" title=\"\">Chartered Institute of Housing </a>(CIH).</p><p>CIH chief executive Grainia Long said: \"The government said the benefit cap would save money and encourage people into work, but this report shows it is far from achieving those aims in one of the worst-affected areas.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) insisted the benefit cap was \"definitely helping\" some of those affected to get into work, although it recognised some individuals may take longer to move into employment.</p><p>The benefit cap limits the amount any working-age household can receive in benefits to £26,000 a year, or £500 a week (£350 for those without children). In Haringey, over half of households affected were losing between £50 and £200 a week. Some 2,383 children are in families affected by the cap, while a third of capped households have more than four children.</p><p>Polling suggests <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3194/Benefit-Cap-popular-with-public-but-what-impact-is-it-having-preimplementation.aspx\" title=\"\">a majority of the public approve of the cap</a>, which is set at the median income of a working family. But the government has struggled to prove that it works. In July, work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith controversially said he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/15/iain-duncan-smith-statistics-benefits-cap\" title=\"\">\"believed\" the threat of the cap</a> prior to its introduction had persuaded more jobless people back to work, but was unable to produce robust statistical evidence to support his claim.</p><p>Fears of mass evictions of claimants, or displacements to cheaper areas outside London, have not been realised, says the CIH report. However, it warns that many capped families are dependent on the council's short-term discretionary support fund to meet their rent, and when this runs out, vulnerable claimants who cannot find work are likely to become homeless.</p><p>The report found that the cap had caused serious disruption and hardship to some vulnerable households, as well as triggering some unintended consequences.</p><p>Researchers came across \"several reports\" of women choosing to stay with violent partners who had a job, because they believed that if they took the children and left the family home they would be subject to the benefit cap.</p><p>One Haringey school reported that seven children had left because of the cap as a result of families moving away to cheaper housing, and that it \"expected more to follow\".</p><p>Most of the 25 capped claimants interviewed for the study reported degrees of stress, sleeplessness and depression. One told researchers that she had attempted suicide. \"It is likely that many of these people had existing underlying problems, but these are likely to be worsened by the additional issues raised by benefit capping,\" the report says.</p><p>Ill-health, lack of skills, education, and \"job readiness\", coupled with the cost and lack of availability of childcare were the most \"significant barrier\" preventing many of those affected from getting a job, the report found.</p><p>Claire Kober, leader of Haringey council, said: \"This research shows that the benefit cap has failed in its main objectives. Only a few households have been able to get back into work and, while the government may be making some savings, the real costs are just being passed to local councils already under enormous financial pressure.\"</p><p>The benefit cap was initially estimated to affect 56,000 households nationally. This was revised downwards to 40,000 earlier this year. Roughly half of these are in London, where an estimated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2013/may/17/benefit-cap-7000-families-to-lose-over-100-pounds-a-week\" title=\"\">7,000 families will lose more than £100 a week</a>.</p><p>The Labour party says it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/12/labour-benefits-tories-labour-rachel-reeves-welfare\" title=\"\">supports the benefit cap in principle</a>, but would introduce regional variations so that benefit caps would be set higher in areas like London.</p><p>Haringey was one of four areas that piloted the benefit cap from April. All other English, Scottish and Welsh local authorities have since introduced the cap.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420693236|2013-10-23T16:01:39Z|21863bb19551d25baacb2b947d14a157d53cf872 -->",

        "headline":"Protests grow over benefit cuts",
        "body":"<p>We are the two protesters pictured on the steps of Camberwell magistrates court in Amelia Gentleman's piece (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/18/thousands-court-council-tax\" title=\"\">400 in protest at clampdown on council tax arrears</a>, 19 October). As part of the Southwark Benefit Justice Campaign, we have been trying to persuade Southwark's Labour council not to do the government's dirty work by threatening to evict tenants or remove their benefits through the courts. Southwark has a choice  – 14 councils have adopted some kind of no evictions policy over the bedroom tax, others have absorbed the council tax benefit cut. :</p><p>The real aim of \"welfare reform\" is not to tackle the deficit – it won't do that – but to make life so unbearable on benefits that we will be desperate to take any job, however low the pay, however poor the conditions, just to put food on the table. The growth of food banks shows how the bedroom tax and brutal sanctioning of benefits are literally starving people. That's why we have managed to gather a coalition of our own in Southwark, including not just claimants but tenants, pensioners, disability campaigners and six local trade union branches representing the organised working class in the borough. We are part of a national benefit justice movement that intends to do for the bedroom tax what we did for the poll tax. We will be demonstrating in Southwark on 25 January 2014 and we invite our councillors to join us. It's time they swapped sides. <br /><strong>Shaun O'Regan and Tanya Murat</strong><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/southwarkbenefitjustice\" title=\"\"><em>Southwark Benefit Justice Campaign</em></a></p><p></p><p>• The hardships faced by single mother Lisa Whitman, who is \"short every week\", are shared by many mothers and children. Instead of getting support for our caring work, single mothers are targeted as \"workless\", ie worthless. How else to explain Newham council forcing the eviction of the Focus E15 mothers from their hostel by cutting funding, or that a single mother in the legal challenge to the £500 benefit cap has been left with £1.92 per child per day after rent?</p><p>Both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/11/council-tax-arrears-labour\" title=\"\">Hilary Benn</a> and the debt charity Zacchaeus 2000 condemn the threatening of sick and disabled people with summonses, bailiffs and prison. But for claimants, benefit deductions cut in before bailiffs and prison do. The council hands a printout of names and addresses to a magistrate who makes a global liability order – our individual circumstances and suffering conveniently hidden.</p><p>In Camden, 2,569 people were summonsed in three months, bypassing wheelchair-user discounts and discretionary help. A woman behind by £2.59 had to pay the year's council tax to avoid court fees. Another had her weekly benefit reduced to £63.10, as she already had crisis loan repayments. She goes without food. That is the policy.</p><p>When the community urged Camden councillors to join Brighton, Fife and Leeds in opposition to council and bedroom tax, they responded with eviction notices and food banks. <br /><strong>Claire Glasman</strong> <br /><em>WinVisible (women with visible and invisible disabilities)</em> <br /><strong>Kim Sparrow</strong><br /><em>Single Mothers' Self-Defence</em></p><p></p><p>• Tens of thousands of social tenants are being forced into rent arrears because they cannot afford to pay this unjust levy. Local authorities acknowledge that, across Wales, there are more than 37,000 households deemed under-occupied, with just under 400 available one-bedroom homes, and some of those struggling to pay are being forced to subsist on £7.50 a week – 14p over the UN poverty threshold of $1.50 per day.</p><p>We call upon Welsh social landlords to:</p><p>1: Follow the lead of Labour and SNP councils in Scotland and desist from evicting families for bedroom tax arrears.</p><p>2: Re-designate properties in line with the Fife rulings on bedroom size and<a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/68/part/X/crossheading/definition-of-overcrowding\" title=\"\"> part X of the 1985 Housing Act</a>, following the lead of councils such as Wrexham. Grant tenants with disabilities the dignity of a spare bedroom for respite as ruled by the first-tier tribunal.</p><p>3: Extend the housing association moratorium on mandatory eviction for rent arrears. We also call upon housing associations to work, both with one another, the Welsh government and their tenants, to model more imaginative ways of balancing financial risk.</p><p>4: For Wales' national and local elected representatives and social landlords to unite with tenants and supporting organisations to defeat the bedroom tax, taking the campaign back to Westminster.</p><p><strong>The Most Revd Dr Barry Morgan </strong><br /><em>Archbishop of Wales</em><br /><strong>Steve Clarke </strong><em>Managing director, Welsh Tenants </em><br /><strong>Jennie Bibbings </strong><em>Shelter Cymru</em><br /><strong>Adam Johannes &amp; Jamie Insole </strong><em>Cardiff and South Wales Against the Bedroom Tax</em><br /><strong>Mick Antoniw AM</strong><br /><strong>Bethan Jenkins AM</strong><br /><strong>Linsey Whittle AM</strong><br /><strong>Mark Serwotka </strong><em>General secretary, Public &amp; Commercial Services Union</em><br /><strong>Owen Jones </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420475993|2013-10-23T16:01:39Z|fecf7beb82d39500ca020667338d363f951b719c -->",

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.turn2us.org.uk/information__resources/benefits/benefits_news_and_changes/benefit_cap.aspx#whatis\" title=\"\">benefit cap</a> – according to opinion polls the government's <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/07/benefit-caps-polling-success-paves-way-for-tough-2015-promises/\" title=\"\">most popular welfare policy</a> – is neither forcing unemployed people to take a job nor saving taxpayers' money, according to the first in-depth study of the policy.</p><p>Research in the borough of Haringey in north London found just a handful of the 747 households affected by the cap have secured a job or increased their working hours since it was introduced six months ago, despite intensive and personalised support from councils and local jobcentres.</p><p>Although the policy was shaving £60,000 a week from the benefits bill locally, this amounted to just 1% of the council's total weekly benefit expenditure. Haringey has so far spent £55,000 a week on short-term discretionary grants to help claimants affected by the cap meet rent shortfalls, and thousands more on providing extra welfare and employment advice.</p><p>The few capped claimants who had so far moved into employment were already \"close to the labour market\" and were likely to have got a job anyway, or were already working part-time and had increased their hours, according to Haringey jobcentre officials and charity job advisers interviewed by the <a href=\"http://www.cih.org\" title=\"\">Chartered Institute of Housing </a>(CIH).</p><p>CIH chief executive Grainia Long said: \"The government said the benefit cap would save money and encourage people into work, but this report shows it is far from achieving those aims in one of the worst-affected areas.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) insisted the benefit cap was \"definitely helping\" some of those affected to get into work, although it recognised some individuals may take longer to move into employment.</p><p>The benefit cap limits the amount any working-age household can receive in benefits to £26,000 a year, or £500 a week (£350 for those without children). In Haringey, over half of households affected were losing between £50 and £200 a week. Some 2,383 children are in families affected by the cap, while a third of capped households have more than four children.</p><p>Polling suggests <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3194/Benefit-Cap-popular-with-public-but-what-impact-is-it-having-preimplementation.aspx\" title=\"\">a majority of the public approve of the cap</a>, which is set at the median income of a working family. But the government has struggled to prove that it works. In July, work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith controversially said he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/15/iain-duncan-smith-statistics-benefits-cap\" title=\"\">\"believed\" the threat of the cap</a> prior to its introduction had persuaded more jobless people back to work, but was unable to produce robust statistical evidence to support his claim.</p><p>Fears of mass evictions of claimants, or displacements to cheaper areas outside London, have not been realised, says the CIH report. However, it warns that many capped families are dependent on the council's short-term discretionary support fund to meet their rent, and when this runs out, vulnerable claimants who cannot find work are likely to become homeless.</p><p>The report found that the cap had caused serious disruption and hardship to some vulnerable households, as well as triggering some unintended consequences.</p><p>Researchers came across \"several reports\" of women choosing to stay with violent partners who had a job, because they believed that if they took the children and left the family home they would be subject to the benefit cap.</p><p>One Haringey school reported that seven children had left because of the cap as a result of families moving away to cheaper housing, and that it \"expected more to follow\".</p><p>Most of the 25 capped claimants interviewed for the study reported degrees of stress, sleeplessness and depression. One told researchers that she had attempted suicide. \"It is likely that many of these people had existing underlying problems, but these are likely to be worsened by the additional issues raised by benefit capping,\" the report says.</p><p>Ill-health, lack of skills, education, and \"job readiness\", coupled with the cost and lack of availability of childcare were the most \"significant barrier\" preventing many of those affected from getting a job, the report found.</p><p>Claire Kober, leader of Haringey council, said: \"This research shows that the benefit cap has failed in its main objectives. Only a few households have been able to get back into work and, while the government may be making some savings, the real costs are just being passed to local councils already under enormous financial pressure.\"</p><p>The benefit cap was initially estimated to affect 56,000 households nationally. This was revised downwards to 40,000 earlier this year. Roughly half of these are in London, where an estimated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2013/may/17/benefit-cap-7000-families-to-lose-over-100-pounds-a-week\" title=\"\">7,000 families will lose more than £100 a week</a>.</p><p>The Labour party says it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/12/labour-benefits-tories-labour-rachel-reeves-welfare\" title=\"\">supports the benefit cap in principle</a>, but would introduce regional variations so that benefit caps would be set higher in areas like London.</p><p>Haringey was one of four areas that piloted the benefit cap from April. All other English, Scottish and Welsh local authorities have since introduced the cap.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420693236|2013-10-23T16:01:39Z|21863bb19551d25baacb2b947d14a157d53cf872 -->",

        "headline":"The benefit cap just shunts welfare costs on to councils",
        "body":"<p>Earlier this year, Haringey was unveiled as one of four London boroughs picked by the government as a pilot area for its benefit cap, which limits state benefits to £500 a week for families and £350 for people without children.</p><p>The welfare system needs reform – with a national housing benefit bill of £23bn a year, it is a question no serious political party can avoid. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/benefits-cap-not-address-affordable-housing-crisis\" title=\"\">my fear </a>was always that the cap, which, since April, has affected more than 700 local families, would penalise the most vulnerable, shunt costs to councils and fail to encourage people back into work.</p><p>Six months on, research conducted for us by the <a href=\"http://www.cih.org/\" title=\"\">Chartered Institute of Housing </a>(CIH) shows these fears to be well founded.</p><p>Those desperately needing a job in order to escape the cap are struggling to find work at a time of high unemployment, are too poorly equipped due to a lack of relevant skills and training, or are facing barriers common to many in the capital, such as a lack of affordable childcare.</p><p>And, far from cutting the cost to the taxpayer, much of the bill for supporting those affected has simply been passed from central government to local authorities already facing unprecedented pressure on their budgets. The report published today estimates that while savings to the benefit bill have been made – equivalent to just 1.18% of the total weekly benefit expenditure in Haringey – nearly £1m has been paid out to help affected households pay their rent and keep their home.</p><p>Serious welfare reform has no simplistic solution – it must deal with complexities and address underlying issues. The government must understand that in order to reduce welfare costs, measures have to be implemented hand-in-hand with delivery of more affordable housing and affordable rent, and with better support for families and individuals to find long-term employment with fair pay so that they can meet the rising costs of day-to-day living.</p><p>The CIH report supports these views with firm evidence. This is the first review of the benefit cap since it was introduced, and the findings are clear: just 10% of 747 families affected by the cap in the borough have been able to find work; discretionary housing payments have been a sticking plaster for those affected, but these payments place a huge burden on local council budgets and are not sustainable; tenants have been unable to persuade landlords to drop rents in response to the cap – in fact, a number of landlords have forced them out and a rise in homelessness is likely over time and will place extra pressure on local services.</p><p>And the cap is not addressing the underlying problem. The soaring housing benefit bill stems from a 30-year affordable-housing crisis, with rent levels continuing to rise far faster than incomes and more families priced out of the property market. In Haringey, we are looking at delivering new affordable housing; we have support schemes to help those seeking employment to get the right training and advice and we are working hard to attract new and varied employers to the area. It is essential that the government starts to work more effectively alongside councils to tackle the housing shortage and put some joined-up policies in place so that those seeking a way of out benefits have the right support and opportunities.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420523114|2013-10-23T16:01:39Z|7b41c0e5bb31b7a475138efe9a073b47400c7ffa -->",
