        "body":"<p>John Lennon's modest first home has sold for almost half a million pounds – despite going on the market for just £150,000.</p><p>The property at 9 Newcastle Road in Wavertree, Liverpool, where the Beatles star lived from his birth in 1940, went for £480,000 at auction in the Cavern Club.</p><p>An anonymous American fan of the Beatles placed the winning bid over the phone, exceeding the guide price set at between £150,000 and £250,000.</p><p>The then suburban red brick terraced home where Lennon's mother Julia brought up her first-born son is just a stone's throw away from Penny Lane, which inspired the famous Beatles track.</p><p>It boasts a lounge, upstairs family bathroom, a sitting room, family room and kitchen which leads to a walled yard round the back.</p><p>Lennon made reference to the house later in life, and was quoted as saying: \"I lived in 9 Newcastle Road. I was born on the 9 of October. It's just a number that follows me around.\"</p><p>The previous owner told the Liverpool Echo: \"I'll be sad to leave John Lennon's first home but I am retired now and would really like a property with a bigger garden.</p><p>\"I have made sure original features have been preserved so that they reflect the 1960s period, when the Beatles wowed the whole world with their rock and roll music.\"</p><p>Lennon's second home – Mendips, on Menlove Avenue in Woolton – was last year given Grade II listed status by English Heritage.</p><p>Andrew Brown, managing director of auctioneer Countrywide Property, said: \"There was a lot of interest in the property before the auction from potential buyers who lived in the UK and internationally.</p><p>\"The auction was very exciting with a number of keen buyers bidding for the property and we are delighted to have sold such an iconic piece of The Beatles and Liverpool's history.\"</p><p>Stephen Giddins, regional sales director for selling agent Entwistle Green, said: \"We are delighted for our client as we were consciously aware that there was a lot of interest in the property and we wanted to ensure that this translated into achieving the best price possible for them.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421243715|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|b750717041304962ead29f0f30b5cd1f65853fe9 -->",
