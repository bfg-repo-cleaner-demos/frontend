Home Office minister James Brokenshire speaks next.&nbsp;</p> <p>He says oversight is essential but much of it must necessarily take place behind closed doors to ensure secret intelligence remains secret.</p> <p>He recognises the desire for transparency, but secrets are necessary for the agencies to do the work they do.</p> <p>&quot;Secrecy is essential to safeguard sensitive methods and sources,&quot; he says.</p> <p>There is a difference between transparency and scrutiny, says Tom Watson. He asks why Tempora was not given scrutiny in parliament like RIPA was, for example.</p> <p>Discussing sensitive techniques publicly simply is not appropriate, Brokenshire says.&nbsp;</p> <p>But he says arrangements are in place for GCHQ not to keep any material it does not need.</p> <p>GCHQ operates at all times in accordance with RIPA.

Julian Smith told MPs: &quot;The Guardian, which had every right to report on this issue, which has raised important topics of debate, which has done so in a digital and global way and an interesting way - with good journalism - has threatened the security of our country and which today stands guilty potentially of treasonous behaviour.&quot;</p> <p>Raab opened his speech by praising the work of MI5 and&nbsp;GCHQ, with whom he worked as a Foreign Office lawyer. But he took issue with Parker's claim that the disclosures about the work of GCHQ in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\">NSA</a>files had helped terrorists.</p> <p>Raab said: &quot;In his speech the MI5 director general lambasted the Guardian for handing terrorists a gift - a very potent word he used. Ministers have more recently claimed that the disclosures have put lives at risk.</p> <p>&quot;I want to take that seriously because Mr Parker claimed that making public 'the reach and limits of&nbsp;GCHQ&nbsp;breaches national security'. Let us be very clear about what was being talked of here - not disclosing interception techniques, not the technical aspect, not the revelation of source or operatives - clearly a major cause of concern if that were to happen. Simply revealing our intelligence reach. I find this assertion difficult to take at face value. It may be true but it is not on the mere assertion.&quot;</p> <p>Raab questioned whether national security had been breached because terrorists knew their communications were being routinely monitored. He said: &quot;Any serious terrorist group assumes their phones, emails and internet use will be monitored. That is no secret. Learning that western spies drain the swamp of their own citizens' data in the process does not help terrorists in any tangible way.</p> <p>&quot;If national security were materially breached why hasn't anyone at the Guardian been charged or even arrested since the search of their offices back in July? Why wasn't David Miranda, detained for several hours, arrested and then bailed following his detention at Heathrow in August?&quot;</p> <p>Meanwhile, Smith accused the Guardian of having failed to discuss the documents with the government even though its editor-in-chief, Alan Rusbridger, held a meeting with the cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood. This led the Guardian to agree to destroy hard drives after Heywood threatened to block further publication of details of the files using a high court injunction.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat MP Julian Huppert challenged Smith, saying: &quot;Is he aware that [they] been in touch for many, many months to talk about these things? Does he think part of the onus should be on the government to provide advice if it is concerned about these things?</p> <p>&quot;The Guardian is quite happy to talk about how to make sure this [data] is secure and frankly the&nbsp;NSA&nbsp;should never have lost it in the first place.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-55e8d17f-d48b-4fa0-bb2e-bd6731095f7d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/22/1345643283780/Dominic-Raab---People-who-010.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab … 'People who are coasting – it should be easier to let them go.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Dominic Raab.

It now reports to parliament, not the PM, and in future the chairman will be chosen by the committee itself.&nbsp;</p> <p>The intelligence heads are now required to respond to the committee, he says.</p> <p>We have the right to demand operational information from the agencies, Rifkind says.

We need to discuss publicly what we think the rules should be for state surveillance, how it should be controlled, and what the limits must be.</p> <p>There is no doubt in my mind that we benefit from the intelligence and security agencies. Their work does help to keep us safe. However, we must ensure that as parliamentarians and lawmakers we give the agencies a clear framework to operate in and proper oversight, scrutiny and evaluation to keep them on track. They too should welcome this.</p> <p>It is of course not possible to have total privacy and total security, and there is a balance to be struck. Tracking a specific individual of genuine concern is very different from sweeping everyone into a net. Critically, parliament must be given a say in how this balance is achieved. Our starting point should have the scales tipped in favour of liberty and privacy. This is what western democracy is based on, and if we reject this, those seeking to destroy the fabric of our society will have already won.</p> </blockquote> <p>He explains what he feels needs fixing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/justice-and-security\"> intelligence and security committee</a>, which is supposed to examine the policy and operations of the agencies, consists of a small number of parliamentarians, handpicked by the prime minister, and includes ex-ministers who effectively scrutinise their own past decisions.

Last week Tory MP Julian Smith called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/nsa-files-live-coverage-developments-reaction#block-52669656e4b027bac8ef9915\">a Westminster Hall debate</a> on whether the Guardian had endangered national security by publishing leaks on surveillance from Edward Snowden.</p> <p>Today a cross-party trio of MPs – Lib Dem Julian Huppert, Tory Dominic Raab, and Labour’s Tom Watson – have called a debate looking into the implications of what the Guardian revealed. In <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/backbench-business-committee/news/debate-announced-for-31-october/\">Westminster Hall from 1.30pm-4.30pm</a> MPs will discuss whether oversight of the intelligence and security services is sufficient.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/14/nsa-files-live-coverage-of-all-developments-and-reaction#block-525ff006e4b0bbc67cfff419\">Huppert told me</a> why he was pushing for such a debate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the information that has been revealed by the Guardian has shown just how much the security services have been doing which the public have been unaware of.</p> <p>Of course it’s not up to us to know all the details … but the principles and the frameworks should be discussed and broadly accepted by the public.</p> </blockquote> <p>I’ll be covering the debate live from parliament from 1.30pm. Plus I’ll keep track of all the latest fallout from the Snowden revelations as usual throughout the day.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421352730|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|89df537294df9f0c609f34ce5e2166f29f2a9429 -->",
