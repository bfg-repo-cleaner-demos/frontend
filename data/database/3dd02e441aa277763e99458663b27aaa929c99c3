        "headline":"Roger Federer 'moving maybe slower' says Novak Djokovic ahead of clash",
        "body":"<p>Roger Federer said on his arrival in London this week he can win at least one more grand slam \"on his own racket\", away from the domination of Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros, to add to his record collection of 17. However, Novak Djokovic, who holds the Swiss in the highest regard, thinks he has slowed sufficiently to make him vulnerable.</p><p>Whether or not Federer can resurrect his career in 2014 in the other three slams by the gift of his own talent, he has a chance to answer Djokovic when they meet on the second evening of the ATP World Tour finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich on Tuesday night, so a quick resolution of the discussion is at hand.</p><p>This is the first year since 2002 that Federer has not made a slam final and his drift in the world rankings to seventh has disturbed his army of fans and given his rivals heart – although the conventions of the game dictate respect be shown to their leading light.</p><p>So Djokovic, who came from a set down to beat Federer in the semi-finals of the Paris Masters in Bercy on Saturday, was moved to comment with circumspection on Monday: \"From my point of view he hasn't been moving as well this year as he did the year before, and that's one of the reasons why he hasn't had much success this year, but he is Roger Federer, and he has achieved so much in his career.</p><p>\"He is never to be underestimated as long as he plays tennis. He has an incredible quality in his game. Even though he is moving maybe slower than he used to, he is still striking the ball really well; if he strikes the ball well that day, he can beat anyone.\"</p><p>There are enough considered caveats sprinkled in that observation to suggest Djokovic fancies his chances on Tuesday – even though Federer is in his 12th consecutive season-ending finals and chasing his seventh trophy.</p><p>Federer will take heart, too, from the sparkling debut of his compatriot and friend Stanislas Wawrinka, who, despite a dreadful second-set tie-break, served Tomas Berdych off the court in the opening match on Monday afternoon, winning 6-3, 6-7 (7-0), 6-3.</p><p>Wawrinka, having the best season of his career, is in the slightly easier draw in the round-robin format – although relativity at this level is marginal – alongside Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer, who play on Tuesday afternoon. Although Nadal needs just two wins here to retain the No1 ranking he took from Djokovic this summer, he is not at his happiest playing indoors on hard courts.</p><p>He has never won this tournament – and was exhausted when losing to Federer in the 2011 final after a semi-final against Andy Murray that took everyone's breath away – and said on Monday he considered it \"unfair\" on clay-courters like himself not to take the event outdoors at some point.</p><p>Djokovic agrees it should move every three years. The Spaniard does not have precedent on his side. Since the event started in 1970, it has never been played on clay and only three times properly outdoors (twice in Houston and once on grass in Melbourne in 1974 when, ironically, Guillermo Vilas, a clay specialist, won it).</p><p>Nor does logic help Nadal's case. Given it has to be played at the end of the season, there is nowhere practical in Europe to stage it outdoors or indoors on clay. The Middle East or Asia is an option, but the southern hemisphere is probably not, given nearly all the finalists are from Europe. Not many would welcome travelling to Buenos Aires to accommodate Juan Martín del Potro, who beat the eighth qualifier, Richard Gasquet, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 7-5 in a match of the highest quality on Monday night.</p><p>London has had the jamboree for five years and, I understand, there has been no decision to take it elsewhere when the contract expires in 2015. It has been the game's guaranteed revenue-churner, as the tournament director, Andre Silva, pointed out: \"We have welcomed more than a million fans to the O2 Arena since it moved to London in 2009, [and] we're very proud of the way in which the tournament has established itself as one of London's must-see sporting events over the years.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421649511|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|f1b5d8594cf7a514f1b2cbd785870bddc63b276d -->",

I was hoping for that problem to occur so I'm happy it's gone this way. I'm happy with my game and the confidence is back. That can carry you really far, so that's good. I like this court. It has a great feel to it.\"</p><p>Back problems have been at the heart of Federer's troubles. \"I feel like it's coming together at the right time for me but it has a different feel because it hasn't been as consistent and as good and as solid as it has been in previous years.</p><p>\"I'm maybe still a little bit unsure about how high is my level of play. You wonder if things are going to be how they used to be just going out there and playing tennis. Warming up for one minute like I used to do when I was 20.</p><p>\"You do so much work to be able to be in decent shape and then still you're not feeling great. It becomes quite frustrating and a little disappointing.</p><p>\"But I always see the glass half full, I'm a very positive thinker.\"</p><p>The round-robin stage of the tournament begins on Monday, with the No5 seed Tomas Berdych taking on the finals debutant Stanislas Wawrinka, before the in-form Del Potro plays Gasquet.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421579974|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|9a1eee8472ea539c3b86d6a0e79202566556a766 -->",

        "body":"<p>The last chapter of the tennis season is about to be written but the author remains a mystery. What we do know is it will not be Andy Murray – who has been invited as a non-playing guest to the ATP World Tour finals at the O<sub>2</sub> Arena in Greenwich this week, which will either cheer him up nearly two months into his rehab and inspire him to get ready for the Australian Open in January or be a painful reminder of what he is missing.</p><p>After a grinding few weeks of last-ditch points gathering Novak Djokovic (long safe from the guillotine) looks the strongest of the eight left in the tumbril. He is marginally ahead of Rafael Nadal, who displaced him as world No1 but who has faltered on the hard courts of Asia and Europe, yet can look back on what might be the greatest comeback season in tennis. It seemed inconceivable when he returned from a seven-month break in February to fix his knees that he would win two majors and eight other titles, qualifying for this season-ending jamboree way before everyone else, in June.</p><p>But here he is. He left Bercy earlier than he would have liked – losing in the semi-finals of the Paris Masters to his dogged compatriot David Ferrer, who on Sunday gave Djokovic a tough time in the final, before fading to lose 7-5, 7-5 in just under two hours. It was his third Masters title of the season.</p><p>Nadal plays Ferrer on Tuesday afternoon. If he can win this tournament, he keeps his No1 ranking; if the Serb triumphs, that mantle is again his.</p><p>Djokovic's first match is on Tuesday night against Roger Federer – and what a few weeks the Swiss has had. He lost after leading in the first semi-final to Djokovic on Saturday but knew he had already qualified for London by beating Kevin Anderson in the first round and the comfort showed in his shot-making. It has been his toughest year in a decade with the unwelcome arrival of pain in his lower back – not quite as severe as Murray's, which required surgery, but worrying enough at 32.</p><p>Nevertheless he has won the World Tour Finals six times and is here for a record 12th year in a row. While he will still take some beating on his favourite surface, Federer has for company for the first time his fellow countryman Stanislas Wawrinka, who plays Tomas Berdych in the tournament's opener  afternoon. The night match is between Juan Martín del Potro, who is playing consistently well, and the final qualifier, Richard Gasquet.</p><p>The former world No1 Boris Becker thinks losing top spot to Nadal \"really affected\" Djokovic. \"He didn't think he was going to lose it to Nadal,\" he said. \"I'm sure after Murray won Wimbledon it was more Murray [was the threat], and what he was going to do for the rest of the year.</p><p>\"Then Nadal came out – won Cincinnati, Toronto and the next thing you know he was there. I think it came as a bit of a shock to him. And whatever happened in Asia [where Djokovic beat Nadal in the Beijing final, breaking a run of three straight defeats] explains that he was not happy with that. He wants to get it back.\"</p><p>Becker does not discount Federer. \"Playing well and having fun on any day, Roger can win any tournament. That's part of the charm of this tournament.</p><p>\"Some of these players get their momentum right now. Yes, they will be tired but they will be going to London on such a high that they are dangerous. It happened in my career when I was just squeezing into the Masters but I felt so good indoors, I had confidence and in Frankfurt I went on and won the whole tournament. It was because of those weeks before. It has a different dimension.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421565097|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1c07e9370dbe9b63039e1135a3742337ee4aacc3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Andy Murray believes he will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/24/andy-murray-tweet-hospital-back-surgery\" title=\"\">return from back surgery</a> faster, stronger and able to play shots that were beyond him in the past few years. Unfathomable as that may sound, given that he is the Wimbledon champion, Murray feels that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/19/andy-murray-surgery-back\" title=\"\">the pain in his back has held him back</a>, stopping him from playing his best tennis.</p><p>The world No4, whose rehab has taken him to Chelsea's training ground in Cobham, underwent surgery in September and has refused to set a date for his return, saying that he will enter the Australian Open <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/31/andy-murray-australian-open-contender\" title=\"\">only if he feels fit enough to win</a> it.</p><p>However, while some fear that he will not be the same player, Murray, who will be absent when the ATP World Tour finals start in London, expects the treatment to enhance his movement and allow him to go for more shots. \"I hope I'll be able to play better than before because for a couple of years there's been shots that I couldn't hit any more,\" Murray said at the Queen's Club in London where he helped unveil his new racquet, the Head Graphene Radical.</p><p>\"I couldn't play the shots because it was too painful and because I couldn't generate the power. So, providing the surgery has gone well, it should help me and allow me to play the strokes I want to play and not have to play sort of managing an issue. So that's exciting for me. If I watch videos of when I was playing five years ago, six years ago, there's some shots that I was like 'ahhhh'. I was saying earlier in the year, 'I'd love to be able to do that' and I couldn't any more. So I'm hoping that'll help.</p><p>\"It wasn't so much the serve. It was other shots it was an issue on. And also just general movement. Just not being as stiff or inhibited. I wanted just to be free again in my movement so I guess we'll have to wait and see how it goes but I'm positive that, if I do all the right rehab and recovery stuff and don't rush back, that when I do get back on the court I'll be able to hit shots that I wasn't able to hit for the last 18 months or so.\" Murray, who is expected to head to his annual training camp in Miami next week before hopefully taking part in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/04/andy-murray-return-injury-tennis\" title=\"\">the Dream Cup in Barbados</a> at the end of the month, is tipping Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal to win dominate in London this week, but also believes that Roger Federer will shine despite his recent poor form.</p><p>\"His record indoors is unbelievable,\" Murray said. \"He plays very well indoors. He has a great record in the finals. There's some guys that have never been there before. It's very different – it's a big stage and you're there as one of the top players in the world. You're expected to perform well and play great tennis, so that's different. So that will be a new experience for some guys and against most of the players that are there, Roger's got a pretty good record against all of them so I think he'll do fine.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421480809|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|6c29019c0cd6bd832cd8acfaee783ee2cefa316c -->",

At last year's US Open Murray's press conference after his semi-final victory over Tomas Berdych was interrupted when a merry Sir Alex Ferguson burst through the doors to congratulate his fellow Scot along with another compatriot, Sir Sean Connery. Now, as the Wimbledon champion recovers from back surgery in September, he has moved on to chats with José Mourinho.</p><p>It turns out there are some benefits to being injured, then. While the 26-year-old is unable to set a return date, saying he will not appear at the Australian Open unless he is fit enough to win the tournament, and will miss the season-ending ATP World Tour finals in London next week, the upside is that Chelsea have allowed Murray to do his rehab with them, a short drive away from his home in Oxshott.</p><p>\"I'm doing a lot of it at Chelsea's training ground,\" Murray said. \"I do Pilates with a teacher in Cobham as well. I can do some stuff at my house but most of the stuff I'm doing at Chelsea. The first day I was in, José Mourinho came down to say hi and chatted. He didn't give me any advice but it was just really interesting to speak to him. I love football. I had met him a couple of times before. It's nice to have him back managing here because it is very exciting to see what he is doing.\"</p><p>Murray is conscious of not causing Chelsea any disruption and tends to schedule his visits for the afternoon but he hopes to watch a training session next week, when he also plans to hit a few tennis balls for the first time since his operation. At Chelsea, he has mainly been using their swimming pool for anti-gravity running.</p><p>\"I've been doing some of that over the last 10 days,\" Murray said. \"I've been able to do some weights. I'm not doing any rotational stuff yet, so most of the stuff is just straight-line running in the pool. It's basically like an underwater treadmill, which has been a massive help for me, because there aren't many of them around. It's sped up the recovery a lot to be able to do that.\"</p><p>The sight of Murray clutching his lower back during matches had become a worryingly familiar one, causing him to withdraw from this year's French Open, and he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/05/andy-murray-us-open-wawrinka\" title=\"\">was underpowered in his US Open title defence this year, succumbing in straight sets to Stanislas Wawrinka in the last eight</a>.</p><p>The problem needed to be eradicated although Murray, who is expected to head to his annual training camp in Miami shortly before playing an exhibition tournament in the Dream Cup in Barbados at the end of November, denies that it was to do with a disc.</p><p>\"It wasn't a disc thing, no,\" he said at the Queen's Club in London where he helped unveil his new racquet, the Head Graphene Radical. \"What was reported in the media was nonsense. There were a few things going on in my back. It wasn't one thing in particular. It certainly wasn't a disc problem.</p><p>\"I don't want to go into my medical history, but there were a few issues going on with my back that were causing me quite a lot of pain. It started in December 2011, it got worse for a period of time and then kind of stayed the same. Then it started to be up and down. I just couldn't handle playing with that pain any longer.</p><p>\"All the things I like to do away from the court – playing football, go-karting, golf, other sports – I wasn't able to do any of that. I was having to adjust the way I was training. I just wanted to be able to do all the things that I used to do and hopefully this will have helped that.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421374092|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|120287390a31365848615ac6bbee1f4b193d2cdc -->",

He needs to reach the semi-final at least. Rafaael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, David Ferrer, Juan Martín del Potro and Tomas Berdych have already qualified.</p><p>The No7 seed Wawrinka, hoping to qualify for the finals for the first time, started the week in eighth place. His victory means the Spaniard Nicolás Almagro is ruled out of the race. Germany's Tommy Haas, who was beaten 6-2, 6-2 by a fellow German, Philipp Kohlschreiber, also dropped out.</p><p>Federer barely broke sweat to knock out Anderson. He broke in the first game and never looked back. Anderson's series of unforced errors made sure there would be no contest, even though the world No21 rallied from 4-1 down in the second set.</p><p>The world No1 Nadal saw off a fellow Spaniard, Marcel Granollers, 7-5, 7-5 to advance into the third round as he aims to bag one of the three Masters titles he has never won.</p><p>Nadal was never really troubled by Granollers and broke decisively in the 11th game of each set to tee up a meeting with last year's runner-up, Jerzy Janowicz of Poland, the No14 seed. \"All opponents are good here. There is no easy opponent on a surface like this one, in a tough tournament like this one,\" Nadal, the eight-times French Open champion, said. \"But hopefully for my opponents I'm not going to be good news, either.\"</p><p>Wawrinka was pushed harder but the Swiss served 19 aces against López and prevailed in under two hours, recovering quickly after a dip in concentration cost the 28-year-old the second set.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421325257|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|6b29d50cfdff786b24b0547e5d98feadf4495930 -->",

        "headline":"The celebrations of the 1980s: Botham, Ballesteros, Cash, Lillak and Tardelli",
        "body":"<p>Celebrate good times, come on. There is nothing like a great sporting celebration to get the blood pumping, as all the pressure that has been building inside is finally allowed to disperse, that brief period of time following something special where both athletes and fans experience an overwhelming feeling of elation. Here are five moments when competitors marked success in an unforgettable manner. A high five if you like.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=g5jVGL0g4Eo\" title=\"\">1) Seve Ballesteros: 1984 Open Championship</a></h2><p>Two all-time greats of golf were locked in battle as the conclusion of the 1984 Open Championship at St Andrews drew near. After 71 and 70 holes respectively, Seve Ballesteros and Tom Watson were inseparable at the top of the leaderboard, although the infamous Road Hole was about to put a dent in Watson's hopes of a sixth Open triumph. Ballesteros was in much better shape, standing over a 15-foot birdie putt on the last, a golden opportunity to place one hand on the Claret Jug.</p><p>The Spaniard sent the putt on its way, as the golfing world, including me as an eight-year-old watching my first major, looked on. The right-to-left putt looked good from the moment it left Ballesteros' putter, tracking beautifully at just the right pace and on the correct line. For a brief moment it appeared as if the ball and gravity were going to do the unthinkable and refuse to yield to the charismatic legend of European golf. And then it dropped those final important few inches. Barring a miracle, Seve had joined the likes of Bobby Jones, Sam Snead and Jack Nicklaus, as an Open winner at the home of golf.</p><p>The outpouring of emotion from Ballesteros manifested itself in one of the most memorable celebrations in golf history. Standing on the 18th green, decked in a navy Slazenger sweater, Seve thrust his right hand towards the ground, his face initially contort with ecstatic relief. A joyous expression spread across his face, the words &quot;la meti&quot; (&quot;I put it in&quot;) repeatedly leaving his mouth, which had developed into such a warm and endearing smile. And then came the fist pumps, originally at chest height, then in front of his face, finished off with a couple of arm-straightening punches towards the delighted galleries.</p><p>Such an iconic snapshot, so much so that the silhouette image of Seve's celebration is still widely used. From the image used for the Seve Foundation in support of cancer research, to the logo adorning the bags and sleeves of Europe's heroes at the Miracle of Medinah, the memories come flooding back at a mere glimpse of that outline of a figure who changed the complexion of European golf.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=rjSDvdgTOzg\" title=\"\">2) Ian Botham: 1981 Fourth Ashes Test</a></h2><p>When Ian Botham took Australia's sixth second-innings wicket on the final day of the fourth Test at Edgbaston, it looked like it might be too little too late. Australia still only needed 37 more runs to win the match and take a 2-1 series lead, the feelgood victory at Headingley looking more and more like a delicious one-off freak result.</p><p>Yet post-captaincy Beefy could do no wrong. The wickets of Rod Marsh, Ray Bright, Dennis Lillee and Martin Kent pushed the fragile Aussies close to the brink of another crushing defeat, as an inspired Botham, driven on by an atmosphere that still thrills, began his approach to the crease for the coup de grace.</p><p>Terry Alderman didn't stand a chance, becoming Botham's fifth wicket in 28 balls at the cost of just one run. You can only begin to imagine the adrenaline rush that Botham must have experienced at that precise moment, as he clean bowled Alderman and surged forward to grab a stump in celebration. Watching it still never fails to do funny things to the hairs on the back of my neck.</p><p>That Botham celebration encapsulated the turnaround of his summer, and the force of personality possessed by the great all-rounder, especially after he had returned to the ranks. Barrel-chested, waving a stump triumphantly, Botham looked every inch the heroic lead in a barely believable film. Cricket celebrations were often curtailed in the 1980s due to spectator participation, yet Beefy even managed to get over this small matter in that amazing summer of 1981.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo_Vu1ZenYU\" title=\"\">3) Pat Cash: 1987 Men's Wimbledon final</a></h2><p>Pat Cash had promised himself that if he won Wimbledon he would share the victory with his family and friends in the players' box. So after defeating Ivan Lendl in the 1987 final, he now had to stick to his personal contract. Cash soon realised that this was easier said than done.</p><p>After making a decisive move into the crowd, Cash started to doubt his plan, admitting he was stuck among the confused spectators in a potentially embarrassing situation. His dad and coach continued to provide encouragement, though it would take some divine inspiration to set Cash on his way.</p><p>A man beckoned Cash towards him, imploring the champion to use his shoulders as a stepping stone to the top of the commentary box. &quot;I looked at him, and it was a priest, he had the collar,&quot; Cash later recalled. How's that for providing a service on a Sunday?</p><p>Despite being concerned about the strength of the roof of the commentary box, Cash had now completed the hard yards. He reached the summit and embraced his dad, sister, uncle, girlfriend, coach and best mates, as the viewing public looked on in admiration at such a unique celebration.</p><p>He may have delayed the trophy ceremony, but no one minded in the slightest. Although it has been mimicked in subsequent years, the first time was easily better than any of the sequels, and provided the 1980s with yet another unforgettable sporting celebration.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo_Vu1ZenYU\" title=\"\">4) Tiina Lillak: 1983 Athletics World Championships</a></h2><p>Just one throw remained in the women's javelin at the inaugural World Championships in Helsinki. One person stood at the end of the runway, the only competitor left who could deny Britain's Fatima Whitbread the gold medal. Unfortunately, that woman was the current world record holder and a hometown favourite with the vast majority of the stadium behind her.</p><p>Tiina Lillak; the mere mention of her name must send shivers down the spine of Whitbread, as she is instantly transported back to her own personal nightmare. Whitbread's first round throw of 69.14m had been the benchmark throughout the final and now only Lillak remained. The problem was, the Finn had a winning throw in her locker, and everyone knew it.</p><p>Standing on the track, Lillak psyched herself up, gritted her teeth, before starting on her sprint to the throwing line. Whitbread prowled, trying not to watch but inevitably unable to avoid it. Lillak launched the javelin, the volume of the locals cranking up in direct relation to the length of time that the spear hung in the air. On and on it went, until it landed beyond 70m. And then pandemonium.</p><p>The realisation of what had just happened resonated around the Olympic Stadium, an explosion of noise erupting from the elated locals. As if propelled by this, Lillak tore off around the track, leaping on occasion, punching the air, and celebrating in a style reminiscent of Ian Rush or Alan Shearer. Finally she came to a stop, surrounded by photographers who had at last managed to catch some pictures of Finland's World Champion.</p><p>Of course for every happy story there is a sad element. Look very closely at the clip on YouTube and you can spot a figure in red put her hand to her head as she looks on from the track, seeing her hopes fly off into the distance. Whitbread immediately set off to find her mum, before breaking down in tears, a gold medal snatched away from her at the death. She would perform her own celebration four years later in Rome - her wiggle becoming a trademark - but before then Fatima Whitbread certainly had to experience the lows before enjoying that high.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UdgoeIevhY\" title=\"\">5) Marco Tardelli: 1982 World Cup final</a></h2><p>Every now and then you watch a sporting event that reaffirms your faith. A moment that contains all that is good in something you probably care a little too much about. Marco Tardelli's goal celebration in the 1982 World Cup final was one such demonstration of what playing sport should mean, and what following sport does mean to so many of us.</p><p>The weeks leading up to the final had not been kind to Tardelli and his team mates. One journalist even hinted that the Juventus midfielder was finished, the abuse suffered by Tardelli and the Italian squad reaching a peak during their spluttering first group stage. Somehow the Italians turned things around, beating Argentina and tournament favourites Brazil in their second round group, before beating Poland in the semi-finals to set up a meeting with West Germany.</p><p>Tardelli was a bundle of nerves the night before the final, hardly sleeping, and his state of mind did not improve on the deathly silent coach journey to the Bernabeu. All of these factors - the criticism, the nerves, the tension - combined to create an incredible example of sporting passion, as Marco Tardelli celebrated a goal which edged his team closer to World Cup glory.</p><p>&quot;What I was feeling was like if something was exploding in me .... a volcano inside me,&quot; Tardelli explained, as the world witnessed an emotional goal celebration that told us just what it meant to score for your country in a World Cup final. Wheeling away in delight, Tardelli seemed to enter a different world, as the weeks of hurt, frustration and anxiety flooded out, his scream – l'urlo di Tardelli – releasing all the pent up emotions in his body.</p><p>James Richardson summed up Tardelli's celebration neatly: &quot;If you're looking at football as a vehicle of human emotion and endeavour, it's the money shot&quot;. Quite simply, an exhilarating episode of sporting history, a clip you would use to emphasise why a lot of us spend so much time bothering about football in the first place.</p><p><strong>• This blog first appeared on </strong><a href=\"http://that1980ssportsblog.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>That 1980s Sports Blog</strong></a></p><p><strong>• Follow </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/1980sSportsBlog\" title=\"\"><strong>Steven Pye on Twitter</strong></a></p><p><strong>• Follow </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Sport on Facebook</strong></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421228060|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|d9209e9322e1dac9348b01f595c3b345e61512c3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Andy Murray has said the Wimbledon final on centre court was one of the toughest matches of his career but \"the best day of my life so far\".</p><p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Murray said his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jul/07/andy-murray-wimbledon-win-djokovic\" title=\"\">historic victory on Sunday</a> had finally sunk in, but admitted that he \"embraced\" rather than enjoyed crunch matches.</p><p>The tennis star, who on Sunday beat the world No 1, Novak Djokovic, in three sets to become the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years, said that around 45 minutes after he had won, he suddenly became \"so so tired\".</p><p>\"Yesterday was a long day, but the best day of my life so far.\"</p><p>Asked if he enjoyed playing the biggest matches of his career, Murray said: \"I'd say embrace rather than enjoy. It's tough to explain [...] if I had lost I wouldn't have enjoyed it, but I won.\"</p><p>He said the match against Djokovic \"was one of the most challenging matches I've played in my career&nbsp;… an unbelievable physical and mental challenge, so I don't know about enjoying it but you have to embrace that situation.\"</p><p>The Scot said he had raised his game and come back strong after losing against Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final last year. \"It was the hardest loss of my career. I was very emotional afterwards, but I just responded really well to it.\"</p><p>He said the pressure on him as Britain's No 1 was huge, which could make playing Wimbledon \"hard and stressful\", and added: \"We're programmed to hit tennis balls. That's the easy part.\"</p><p>\"One thing I can say is that I have always enjoyed the training aspect [...] working hard and trying to get better, but dealing with the pressure has been hard at times.\"</p><p>Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, denied \"photo-bombing\" David Cameron at the match when he raised a large Scottish flag behind the prime minister immediately after Murray's win.</p><p>Salmond told the programme he \"had no idea what the seating arrangements were\" and that since Murray was the first Scot to win Wimbledon since 1896 \"a few saltires hoisted does no harm at all\".</p><p>He insisted the All England Club did not have any problem with his celebration, and \"didn't mind a little bit of Scottish exuberance\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412365865|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|4a367ac03002736cffdd756e0a28ce78ad4fc998 -->",

        "headline":"Wimbledon 2013: new generation threaten to shake up women's game",
        "body":"<p>The days when precocious teens dominated the upper reaches of women's tennis looked to be gone for good, given the increased fitness of the top players and the more physical nature of the sport – plus new rules to reduce the risk of burnout.</p><p>But a new generation is now threatening to make its mark at this year's Wimbledon, with Britain's Laura Robson and the hotly tipped American hope Madison Keys leading the way. Where there were just two teenagers inside the top 100 at last year's Wimbledon, now there are 11.</p><p>The youngest of all, the 16-year-old Croatian Donna Vekic, has already been compared by some to Maria Sharapova, who won her first Wimbledon title at the age of 17 and was the last teenager to win at the All England Club in 2004. Vekic turned heads by reaching the final at the Aegon Classic in Birmingham earlier this month, although she fared less well on Monday, losing to Petra Cetkovska from the Czech Republic.</p><p>From Monica Seles to Martina Hingis and Maria Sharapova to Serena Williams, not forgetting Tracy Austin, Andrea Jaeger and Jennifer Capriati, youthful talents dominated women's tennis for decades – for many years you were nothing if you hadn't won a grand slam title by your 20th birthday.</p><p>Yet the flipside was a trail of stories of overbearing parents and coaches, psychological trauma and physical burnout.</p><p>For the past decade, the direction of travel has been in the opposite direction as the top 100 got steadily older. At 31, Serena Williams is the oldest No 1 player in the history of the game. But further down the ranks, there has been a clear shift.</p><p>\"I think we've had some reordering of the dominance in the past 12 to 18 months. The youth movement is coming,\" said Stacey Allaster, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) chief executive, of the changing of the guard.</p><p>Robson, now 19 and the highest ranked teenager on the WTA tour at 37, won a silver medal on Centre Court last year in the Olympics mixed doubles alongside Andy Murray and has claimed several big-name scalps in the past year.</p><p>But she has just changed coaches, linking up with Murray's former trainer Miles Maclagan on a temporary basis, and faces a tough draw in the shape of world No 10 Maria Kirilenko.</p><p>Keys, from Rock Island in Illinois, is already ranked 52 and is one of a crop of youngsters who the American public hope will assume the mantle of the Williams sisters. She plays British No 2 Heather Watson on Tuesday.</p><p>Robson's best friend, the 19-year-old Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, was among those to progress at Wimbledon on Monday.</p><p>And the most eye-catching victory was by a 19-year-old Puerto Rican, Mónica Puig, who defeated the Italian fifth seed Sara Errani in straight sets to provide the first shock of the fortnight on her senior Wimbledon debut.</p><p>The German Annika Beck, ranked 54, and the Spaniard Garbiñe Muguruza, ranked 59, are also highly rated.</p><p>Vekic has already reached two senior finals, most recently the Aegon Classic, and is ranked 64 in the world despite not turning 17 until Friday.</p><p>David Felgate, the coach who helped Tim Henman to four semi-finals at Wimbledon and has coached Vekic since she was 11, said: \"Her biggest attributes are her heart and her head. It's still harder than it was 10 years ago for the really young players to get to the top. But at the moment we've got a decent crop.\"</p><p>The last teens, male and female, to win a grand slam were Maria Sharapova and Rafael Nadal in 2006, who won the US Open and French Open respectively.</p><p>While there is little sign of anyone emerging in the men's game to change that statistic, in the women's game it is not impossible to imagine the old order being eventually challenged by the new.</p><p>Not that the likes of Serena Williams and Sharapova are likely to take the challenge lying down. Allaster said that while the number of teenagers had grown sharply in the past year, the number of players over 30 in the top 100 was also going up, showing the extent to which players were increasingly playing on beyond their 20s.</p><p>The WTA age restrictions, dubbed the \"Jennifer Capriati rules\", were put into place in the wake of problems the American notoriously faced after becoming a top 10 player at the age of just 14 in the early 90s, including an arrest for shoplifting.</p><p>Andrea Jaeger and Jelena Dokic were others who initially burned brightly but had to endure high-profile off-the-court issues in the glare of the public eye.</p><p>The restrictions limit the number of senior tournaments a young player can take part in and Felgate believes it is time they were reviewed.</p><p>\"It's a strange rule because the tour only allows so many tournaments but Donna could, if she wanted to, go and play a load more junior tournaments as well. I'd like to see the rule looked at so that if you get to a certain ranking, they could allow for a couple more tournaments,\" he said.</p><p>Restricting the number of tournaments can increase the pressure on young players because it ratchets up the pressure on them to perform, he said: \"All the intentions are in the right place, but it's worth looking at again.\"</p><p>It was widely assumed that rule changes introduced to protect younger players, combined with the way the game has changed and become more physically demanding, would mean it took longer than ever for young players to become established.</p><p>That has been the case in the men's game, where there is only one player under 20 in the top 100.</p><p>\"If people want to say good things then that's very nice,\" said Felgate of Vekic. \"None of it has changed what she has to improve and there are other very good young players out there, even younger than Donna, who haven't come to the fore yet.\"</p><p></p><h2>Teenagers in the WTA top 100</h2><p><strong>38 </strong>Laura Robson (GB), 19</p><p><strong>52 </strong>Madison Keys (US), 18</p><p><strong>54 </strong>Annika Beck (Germany), 19</p><p><strong>59 </strong>Garbiñe Muguruza (Spain), 19</p><p><strong>64 </strong>Donna Vekic (Croatia), 16</p><p><strong>65 </strong>Mónica Puig (Puerto Rico), 19</p><p><strong>66 </strong>Eugenie Bouchard (Canada), 19</p><p><strong>82 </strong>Elina Svitolina (Ukraine), 18</p><p><strong>85 </strong>Lauren Davis (US), 19</p><p><strong>90 </strong>Yulia Putintseva (Kazakhstan), 18</p><p><strong>100</strong> Caroline Garcia (France), 19</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411474284|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|5ec3c92ae9cf1334435590de85a9a3c025e7f360 -->",

The parties have now agreed terms to bring the matter to a close, which involves the payment of damages and legal costs.</p><p></p><p>\"However, Mr Castle would like to put the record straight and express again his personal apology to Mr Lloyd. He made his remarks, which were completely without substance, in the hurried exchanges of a live debate.</p><p></p><p>\"Mr Lloyd has accepted Mr Castle's apology and the payment of damages. Mr Lloyd and Mr Castle are pleased to have been able to resolve matters amicably and now consider the matter to be behind them.\"</p><p></p><p>Lloyd's brother, John, is a BBC tennis pundit and colleague of Castle's. The pair, both former No 1 British men's tennis players, are expected to feature in the corporation's coverage of Wimbledon, which started on Monday.</p><p></p><p>The BBC refused to say whether Castle personally paid damages to Lloyd or whether the bill was footed by licence fee payers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411460795|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|40f28ea9c5efef57ae25ea5d80b0e5a027baeae1 -->",

        "body":"<p>Andy Murray's mother has called for tennis's governing body to introduce more \"free courts\" around the country to widen the game beyond its \"middle-class and elitist\" base.</p><p>On the eve of Wimbledon, Judy Murray, Britain's Fed Cup captain, said she was worried about a dearth of new talent after it emerged that several schemes to improve free-to-use public courts in deprived urban areas had failed to materialise.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tennisforfree.com/\" title=\"\">the charity Tennis For Free (TFF)</a> agreed a partnership last year \"to improve the places where people play tennis and the programmes on offer to encourage takeup of the game\".</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/03/lta-funding-sport-england-tennis\" title=\"\">following cuts to the LTA budget</a>, seven new schemes in areas including Tower Hamlets in east London and Glasgow have not gone ahead, although one has been established at Devonport Park, Plymouth.</p><p>Murray, who is a patron of the charity, said: \"TFF gets into areas you don't associate with the game. We, as a country, have got to be prepared to get our hands dirty. TFF is a small charity trying to put tennis where it has never been before and to have attractive, affordable public courts is crucial.\" Britain has never had stars with origins like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2013/jun/15/venus-serena-williams-film\" title=\"\">those of the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, </a>who started playing on the public courts of Compton, Los Angeles. The pair have since gone on to win 23 grand slam singles titles.</p><p>Speaking at the recent Edgbaston women's tournament, where she was coaching Britain's under-12s team, Murray said: \"Places like <a href=\"http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/sport/sports-development/tennis/tenniscourts/kelvingrove-park/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow</a>, where TFF already operates, are incredibly busy and successful. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/dec/08/judy-murray-fed-cup-team-captain\" title=\"\">When I was appointed Britain's Fed Cup captain</a> it made me realise our talent pool has been very small because so few girls play. I realise it is very difficult to turn around a derelict area into a tennis site, but we need to deliver more.\"</p><p>The TFF website says there are 2,594 free UK public tennis courts and 16 free park coaching programmes.</p><p>Baroness Billingham, president of Oxford LTA and a member of the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/olympic-paralympic-legacy/\" title=\"\">House of Lords Olympic legacy committee</a>, said the partnership was a lost opportunity. \"It is a complete cop out by the LTA and absolutely wrong,\" she added. \"As far as the governing body is concerned, a few hundred thousand of new money is a drop in the ocean, as they get £60m a year in Wimbledon profits and public money.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.labourlords.org.uk/angela-billingham\" title=\"\">Billingham, a former Wimbledon player</a> who captains the parliamentary tennis team, said she was proud of a \"five-year campaign\" to remove LTA chief executive Roger Draper. \"I hope the new chief executive is at least someone who understands grassroots tennis and the LTA do have the opportunity to save hundreds of thousands on the salary,\" she said.</p><p>Murray said of her experience at TFF: \"What immediately struck me was how welcoming, sociable and fun it all was. Based on what I know of tennis in this country, that's not always the case. The game here is still very middle-class and elitist. I loved the fact that parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters were all joining in and helping. I left absolutely uplifted, thinking this is exactly what we need throughout the country.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/dec/17/sport-england-funding-olympic-cycle\" title=\"\">Sport England revealed last year that it was withholding £10.3m of funding</a> because it believed the LTA's plans to expand participation were inadequate.</p><p>An LTA spokesman said: \"We work with a range of partners across the public and commercial sector to deliver free and affordable tennis, and we recognise the valuable work that Tennis For Free do in making tennis more accessible.\"</p><p>The LTA is spending \"a few thousand\" in refurbishment work at courts at centres such as Brodie Park, Glasgow, and Christchurch Park, Ipswich. However, TFF trustee Patrick Hollwey said: \"We are not being given a grant by the LTA. In fact, we still have to pay for coaches and equipment ourselves.\"</p><p>The charity has lost patience with the LTA and wants to raise £750,000 from private sources to try to launch 50 venues over the next three years.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411362301|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|21362c61d3626b92fc6afe602c05b64bd8278086 -->",

We were athletes who wanted to compete – and along the way we made history, determined to win, not just for ourselves, but for women everywhere,\" says King in a WTA campaign to mark the milestone.</p><p>Against a febrile backdrop in the summer of 1973 King, who won the fifth of her six Wimbledon singles titles that year, called a meeting of her fellow players amid widespread and intense frustration at sexism and inequality in the sport.</p><p>Particularly angered by a tournament in Los Angeles where the women's champion earned a sixth of the prize money of the men, King became in 1970 one of a group of players – The Original Nine – who each signed nominal $1 contracts with World Tennis publisher Gladys Heldman to compete in a newly created Virginia Slims Series.</p><p>Three years later in London she got everyone in the room, told fellow player Betty Stove to lock the door and emerged clutching legal documents that were drawn up by Larry King, the tennis player's then husband.</p><p>\"If we hadn't had Billie, our sport wouldn't be where it is today. She was the catalyst, the dreamer, the person who said 'we will do this and we will be successful'. She is as active today in the WTA as she was in 1973,\" said Stacey Allaster, the WTA chief executive, recalling how the pioneering players of the 1970s would have to drum up publicity for their own tournaments in small towns across America.</p><p>Later in 1973, King would beat Bobby Riggs in an exhibition match in the US dubbed \"the battle of the sexes\".</p><p>King, the daughter of a firefighter from Long Beach, made her Grand Slam debut aged 15 in 1959 and two years later neighbours raised $2,000 so she could play at Wimbledon. There she won the women's doubles at her first attempt, the first of 39 Grand Slam titles that included 12 singles triumphs. She retired from competitive singles in 1983 having seen the sport transformed.</p><p>Amid a passionate debate about the amount of coverage and profile afforded women's sport, most recently reanimated here following London 2012, tennis is one of only a handful of sports in which women can genuinely claim equality of opportunity and potential financial reward.</p><p>Prior to the formation of the WTA in 1973, the annual prize money available to professional female tennis players was around $2m. Today it is $118m (£75m) across the WTA's 54 tournaments in 33 countries and the four Grand Slams.</p><p>Those original nine players will be present alongside most of the number ones of the past 40 years, from King to Serena Williams.</p><p>\"I was lucky enough to meet the original nine last year in Charleston. It's thanks to Billie Jean King that we have everything in professional sport that we have today. It's amazing,\" said Martina Hingis, who has won five Grand Slams and will also be present.</p><p>\"It was only the second or third time that they had all got together. Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova were there too. All these great tennis players, who did so much for the game, in one place.\"</p><p>Hingis, now a coach, said King was a \"real leader\", a \"trooper\".</p><p>Allaster said that without King and her colleagues, the riches and opportunities on offer today would not exist. \"They set the course. Today's players know the debt they owe Billie and the original nine and all the generations that have come before them to make tennis the number one sport in the world for women,\" she said.</p><p>\"Part of my job is to educate them. Every player's meeting we start with a photo of the original nine or a picture of Billie. I don't want anyone to ever forget their courage.\"</p><p>But although there is now equality of prize money at the four Grand Slams, which took until 2007 at Wimbledon, there are other tournaments where there is still a big gap, said Hingis.</p><p>\"It's 2013. But the men still generally make a lot more. At least there's equality at the Grand Slams but at all the other tournaments, there's still a gap.\"</p><p>King passed the baton of WTA president to Evert, whose rivalry with Navratilova took women's tennis to new heights.</p><p>Evert said the women's game \"started as a small intimate family and evolved into a big business\".</p><p>\"It started with one sponsor in Virginia Slims and turned into hundreds of sponsors vying for a position in sponsorships,\" she said. \"The prize money, exposure, the fan base, sponsorships, media and even the level of tennis greatly improved. Also the tour became more international.\"</p><p>The women's game has come under fire in recent years for, variously, not producing enough characters and dominant players to rival a golden period for the men's game or, conversely, becoming too predictable and dull.</p><p>Allaster argues that the balance is now about right, with a host of young players from around the world coming through to challenge the leading players including Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka and Agnieszka Radwanska.</p><p>\"We've got 11 teenagers in the top 100. We've got 12 players who are more than 30. We've got this nice mix of the current generation, the future stars and some dominance and rivalry at the top. When Serena and Venus were winning everything, people wanted more depth,\" she said.</p><p>\"Then we had the depth and people wanted the personalities and the rivalries. Now I feel we have both. To have Serena as the world number one, probably playing the best tennis of her life, is great.\"</p><p>She said the emerging markets in China, India and the Middle East offered huge opportunities for the sport, in terms of new talent and potential commercial return, but growth had to be carefully managed.</p><p>Radwanska, the Pole who reached the Wimbledon final last year, said the women's tour was getting \"better and better every year\".</p><p>\"We can see that a lot of things have changed in the last 10 or 20 years. I think it's great. I think we can really see that the women's game is bigger than before. We can see more matches on TV and people are more interested in women's tennis,\" she said.</p><p>Allaster said that while the sport had hugely evolved since the events of 1973, today's players still felt a kinship when it came to the big issues and insisted the future of the sport was secure. \"They are individual athletes but when the time comes for them to get together on an issue, they are committed to each other,\" she said.</p><p>\"I truly believe we have the best female athletes in the world. I'm blessed with the most marketable assets in the world. They're smart, they're super strong and they're fun. They engage well with their fans and that's a fantastic base for us to build on.\"</p><p>For Evert, King's hotel room revolution blew open the doors for those who followed, enabling a professional tennis career that provided \"the opportunity for a woman to compete at the highest level, to be proud of her physical and mental strength and to take advantage of the opportunity to be a positive role model\".</p><p>• This footnote was appended on 24 June 2013: A number of state and federal laws relating to equal opportunities were passed before 1975 in the USA; the particular equal opportunity law that was two years away when the WTA was formed was Article IX, which requires gender equity in educational programmes that receive federal funding; while Article IX itself was enacted in 1972, its implementing regulations - which covered, among other things, school and college athletics - were not signed into law until 1975.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411185264|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|309aca1805c62b861aab172cef3c9418f1a50ebb -->",
