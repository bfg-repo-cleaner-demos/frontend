        "body":"<p>The anti-racism group Kick It Out have deemed the furore surrounding Roy Hodgson's 'space monkey' joke to have been \"concluded\" following the Football Association's investigation into the comments made by the England manager.</p><p>Kick It Out had called on the FA to investigate the joke made by Hodgson despite the England winger Andros Townsend's attempts to play down the issue.</p><p>The England manager has apologised to anyone offended by the joke made at half-time during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/15/england-poland-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Poland at Wembley</a>, which was intended to convey the need for England to play the ball more regularly to Townsend. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/17/roy-hodgson-apologises-space-monkey-joke\" title=\"\">The Tottenham Hotspur player says no offence was meant or taken</a> and the FA has issued a statement backing Hodgson, with Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, describing him as a man of \"the highest integrity\". Kick It Out have subsequently deemed the matter over.</p><p>A statement read: \"Kick It Out, football's equality and inclusion campaign, is pleased that The Football Association (FA) has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately. If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded.\"</p><p>Townsend, whose father, Troy, works for Kick It Out as its mentoring manager, insists he was not offended and cannot understand why it has generated so much coverage, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andros_townsend/status/390770514849181696\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> the player said:  \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p>In a statement, Hodgson said: \"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p>The joke is one that became popular at Nasa, the US space agency, in the 1960s and 1970s after it sent monkeys into space before humans. One version of the joke is that the first time Nasa sends a man up into space a monkey goes with him and does all the skilled technical jobs inside the rocket. Finally the astronaut gets frustrated and radios Nasa to ask what he should do.</p><p>Nasa replies: \"Don't touch anything – just feed the monkey.\"</p><p>It is believed Hodgson was trying to illustrate the need for England's defenders to play the ball early to Townsend while he was in space on the flanks.</p><p>Piara Powar, executive director of the European anti-discrimination group Fare, said the England manager should be more careful. \"Hodgson used a very silly term within a diverse team environment. He should know better,\" said Power on Twitter.</p><p>Wayne Rooney insists Hodgson did \"nothing wrong\" and that the incident had been blown out of all proportion. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WayneRooney/status/390737351326306304\" title=\"\">The England striker tweeted</a>: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Stan Collymore said the row undermined efforts to tackle racism in football. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StanCollymore/status/390608021111726080\" title=\"\">The former England striker  tweeted</a>: \"Demeans every anti racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH who said NOTHING WRONG. Makes campaigners seem over PC &amp; petty. They're not.\"</p><p>The FA has been especially sensitive to any allegations of racism after John Terry was stripped of the England captaincy and later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/27/john-terry-verdict-chelsea-guilty\" title=\"\">banned for four matches</a> for racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand in a Chelsea match in October 2011.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246078|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|e28e1b89aa408463481b2e0ba5c308408cecaf4c -->",

Photograph: Scott Houston/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>That Banksy – what will he come up with next? He's the genius of the obvious. The Bristol-born artist is <a href=\"http://www.banksy.co.uk/\" title=\"\">currently \"in residence\" in New York</a>, and not a day passes without a story about his exploits in the Big Apple. The latest is that Banksy has carved a statue of Ronald McDonald, mascot of the renowned fast food chain, and is moving it from one McDonald's to another in the New York area together with a – living – boy giving the corporate clown a shoeshine.</p><p>Look, it's a bit pointless mocking American capitalism, Banksy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/us-shutdown-imf-christine-lagarde-appeals-stability\" title=\"\">Congress has already done that for you</a>. How the world laughed when Republican extremists brought the \"world's most powerful nation\" to the brink of debt default. How it shrugged when this lunatic crisis was resolved at the last minute. What's America going to do next to make itself a living joke?</p><p>By comparison, Banksy's stunts are light entertainment for complacent liberals and Leftists. Being a bit of both, I can totally get behind his tilt at McDonald's. I am pretty sure it stands for everything that is wrong with the world. I can't quite remember the details but yeah, McDonald's, it's got to be bad. Go for it.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-419901931\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/14/131014banksysells-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/14/131014banksysells_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/14/131014banksysells_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/14/131014banksysells/131014banksysells.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>This <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sting/englishmaninnewyork.html\" title=\"\">Englishman in New York</a> is clearly generating impressive interest and a lot of headlines.

Vandalise that ...</p><p>Yet all this reporting of Banksy's art and its fate reveals the massive intellectual lacunae in our current understanding of art. On the one hand, Banksy is a street artist, having a laugh defying the authorities. On the other hand, his works are now regarded as financially valuable so when they get defaced it is seen as an attack on some kind of cultural monument. It's just street art! Lighten up! It does not need to survive and people who pay big money for it are silly.</p><p>To his credit, Mr Banksy seems to know that. Hence the cheap art sale to those lucky tourists. They could sell the works at a huge profit, and have the blowout of a lifetime at McDonald's.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-419832428\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/13/131013BanksyAnimals-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/13/131013BanksyAnimals_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/13/131013BanksyAnimals/131013BanksyAnimals.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/13/131013BanksyAnimals_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420247469|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|d3b9d35502c3c93d2b1f2612781790bc1abb1127 -->",

So, I am going to be talking to you about reading. I'm going to tell you that libraries are important. I'm going to suggest that reading fiction, that reading for pleasure, is one of the most important things one can do. I'm going to make an impassioned plea for people to understand what libraries and librarians are, and to preserve both of these things.</p><p>And I am biased, obviously and enormously: I'm an author, often an author of fiction. I write for children and for adults. For about 30 years I have been earning  my living though my words, mostly by making things up and writing them down. It is obviously in my interest for people to read, for them to read fiction, for libraries and librarians to exist and help foster a love of reading and places in which reading can occur.</p><p>So I'm biased as a writer. But I am much, much more biased as a reader. And I am even more biased as a British citizen.</p><p>And I'm here giving this talk tonight, under the auspices of the Reading Agency: a charity whose mission is to give everyone an equal chance in life by helping people become confident and enthusiastic readers. Which supports literacy programs, and libraries and individuals and nakedly and wantonly encourages the act of reading. Because, they tell us, everything changes when we read.</p><p>And it's that change, and that act of reading that I'm here to talk about tonight. I want to talk about what reading does. What it's good for.</p><p>I was once in New York, and I listened to a talk about the building of private prisons – a huge growth industry in America. The prison industry needs to plan its future growth – how many cells are they going to need? How many prisoners are there going to be, 15 years from now? And they found they could  predict it very easily, using a pretty simple algorithm, based on asking what percentage of 10 and 11-year-olds couldn't read. And certainly couldn't read for pleasure.</p><p>It's not one to one: you can't say that a literate society has no criminality. But there are very real correlations.</p><p>And I think some of those correlations, the simplest, come from something very simple. Literate people read fiction.</p><p>Fiction has two uses. Firstly, it's a gateway drug to reading. The drive to know what happens next, to want to turn the page, the need to keep going, even if it's hard, because someone's in trouble and you have to know how it's all going to end … that's a very real drive. And it forces you to learn new words, to think new thoughts, to keep going. To discover that reading per se is pleasurable. Once you learn that, you're on the road to reading everything. And reading is key. There were noises made briefly, a few years ago, about the idea that we were living in a post-literate world, in which the ability to make sense out of written words was somehow redundant, but those days are gone: words are more important than they ever were: we navigate the world with words, and as the world slips onto the web, we need to follow, to communicate and to comprehend what we are reading. People who cannot understand each other cannot exchange ideas, cannot communicate, and translation programs only go so far.</p><p>The simplest way to make sure that we raise literate children is to teach them to read, and to show them that reading is a pleasurable activity. And that means, at its simplest, finding books that they enjoy, giving them access to those books, and letting them read them.</p><p>I don't think there is such a thing as a bad book for children. Every now and again it becomes fashionable among some adults to point at a subset of children's books, a genre, perhaps, or an author, and to declare them bad books, books that children should be stopped from reading. I've seen it happen over and over; Enid Blyton was declared a bad author, so was RL Stine, so were dozens of others. Comics have been decried as fostering illiteracy.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420122796'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/7/2/1341223882512/Enid-Blytons-Famous-Five--002.jpg' alt='Enid Blyton's Famous Five book Five Get Into a Fix' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>No such thing as a bad writer...

There are no bad authors for children, that children like and want to read and seek out,  because every child is different. They can find the stories they need to, and they bring themselves to stories. A hackneyed, worn-out idea isn't hackneyed and worn out to them. This is the first time the child has encountered it. Do not discourage children from reading because you feel they are reading the wrong thing. Fiction you do not like is a route to other books you may prefer. And not everyone has the same taste as you.</p><p>Well-meaning adults can easily destroy a child's love of reading: stop them reading what they enjoy, or give them worthy-but-dull books that you like, the 21st-century equivalents of Victorian \"improving\" literature. You'll wind up with a generation convinced that reading is uncool and worse, unpleasant.</p><p>We need our children to get onto the reading ladder: anything that they enjoy reading will move them up, rung by rung, into literacy. (Also, do not do what this author did when his 11-year-old daughter was into RL Stine, which is to go and get a copy of Stephen King's Carrie, saying if you liked those you'll love this! Holly read nothing but safe stories of settlers on prairies for the rest of her teenage years, and still glares at me when Stephen King's name is mentioned.)</p><p>And the second thing fiction does is to build empathy. When you watch TV or see a film, you are looking at things happening to other people. Prose fiction is something you build up from 26 letters and a handful of punctuation marks, and you, and you alone, using your imagination, create a world and people it and look out through other eyes. You get to feel things, visit places and worlds you would never otherwise know. You learn that everyone else out there is a me, as well. You're being someone else, and when you return to your own world, you're going to be slightly changed.</p><p>Empathy is a tool for building people into groups, for allowing us to function as more than self-obsessed individuals.</p><p>You're also finding out something as you read vitally important for making your way in the world. And it's this:</p><p>The world doesn't have to be like this. Things can be different.</p><p>I was in China in 2007, at the first party-approved science fiction and fantasy convention in Chinese history. And at one point I took a top official aside and asked him Why? SF had been disapproved of for a long time. What had changed?</p><p>It's simple, he told me. The Chinese were brilliant at making things if other people brought them the plans. But they did not innovate and they did not invent. They did not imagine. So they sent a delegation to the US, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Google, and they asked the people there who were inventing the future about themselves. And they found that all of them had read science fiction when they were boys or girls.</p><p>Fiction can show you a different world. It can take you somewhere you've never been. Once you've visited other worlds, like those who ate fairy fruit, you can never be entirely content with the world that you grew up in. Discontent is a good thing: discontented people can modify and improve their worlds, leave them better, leave them different.</p><p>And while we're on the subject, I'd like to say a few words about escapism. I hear the term bandied about as if it's a bad thing. As if \"escapist\" fiction is a cheap opiate used by the muddled and the foolish and the deluded, and the only fiction that is worthy, for adults or for children, is mimetic fiction, mirroring the worst of the world the reader finds herself in.</p><p>If you were trapped in an impossible situation, in an unpleasant place, with people who meant you ill, and someone offered you a temporary escape, why wouldn't you take it? And escapist fiction is just that: fiction that opens a door, shows the sunlight outside, gives you a place to go where you are in control, are with people you want to be with(and books are real places, make no mistake about that); and more importantly, during your  escape, books can also give you knowledge about the world and your predicament, give you weapons, give you armour: real things you can take back into your prison. Skills and knowledge and tools you can use to escape for real.</p><p>As JRR Tolkien reminded us, the only people who inveigh against escape are jailers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420122797'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348135542541/Tolkiens-illustration-of--002.jpg' alt='Tolkien's illustration of Bilbo Baggins's home' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tolkien's illustration of Bilbo's home, Bag End. Photograph: HarperCollins</figcaption></figure><p>Another way to destroy a child's love of reading, of course, is to make sure there are no books of any kind around. And to give them nowhere to read those books. I was lucky. I had an excellent local library growing up. I had the kind of parents who could be persuaded to drop me off in the library on their way to work in summer holidays, and the kind of librarians who did not mind a small, unaccompanied boy heading back into the children's library every morning and  working his way through the card catalogue, looking for books with ghosts or magic or rockets in them, looking for vampires or detectives or witches or wonders. And when I had finished reading the children's' library I began on the adult books.</p><p>They were good librarians. They liked books and they liked the books being read. They taught me how to order books from other libraries on inter-library loans. They had no snobbery about anything I read. They just seemed to like that there was this wide-eyed little boy who loved to read, and would talk to me about the books I was reading, they would find me other books in a series, they would help. They treated me as another reader – nothing less or more – which meant they treated me with respect. I was not used to being treated with respect as an eight-year-old.</p><p>But libraries are about freedom. Freedom to read, freedom of ideas, freedom of communication. They are about education (which is not a process that finishes the day we leave school or university), about entertainment, about making safe spaces, and about access to information.</p><p>I worry that here in the 21st century people misunderstand what libraries are and the purpose of them. If you perceive a library as a shelf of books, it may seem antiquated or outdated in a world in which most, but not all, books in print exist digitally. But that is to miss the point fundamentally.</p><p>I think it has to do with nature of information. Information has value, and the right information has enormous value. For all of human history, we have lived in a time of information scarcity, and having the needed information was always important, and always worth something: when to plant crops, where to find things, maps and histories and stories – they were always good for a meal and company. Information was a valuable thing, and those who had it or could obtain it could charge for that service.</p><p>In the last few years, we've moved from an information-scarce economy to one driven by an information glut. According to Eric Schmidt of Google, every two days now the human race creates as much information as we did from the dawn of civilisation until 2003. That's about five exobytes of data a day, for those of you keeping score. The challenge becomes, not finding that scarce plant growing in the desert, but finding a specific plant growing in a jungle. We are going to need help navigating that information to find the thing we actually need.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420122798'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348848437515/A-boy-reading-in-his-scho-004.jpg' alt='A boy reading in his school library' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Libraries are places that people go to for information. Books are only the tip of the information iceberg: they are there, and libraries can provide you freely and legally with books. More children are borrowing books from libraries than ever before – books of all kinds: paper and digital and audio. But libraries are also, for example, places that people, who may not have computers, who may not have internet connections, can go online without paying anything: hugely important when the way you find out about jobs,  apply for jobs or apply for benefits is increasingly migrating exclusively online.  Librarians can help these people navigate that world.</p><p>I do not believe that all books will or should migrate onto screens: as Douglas Adams once pointed out to me, more than 20 years before the Kindle turned up, a physical book is like a shark. Sharks are old: there were sharks in the ocean before the dinosaurs. And the reason there are still sharks around is that sharks are better at being sharks than anything else is. Physical books are tough, hard to destroy, bath-resistant, solar-operated,  feel good in your hand: they are good at being books, and there will always be a place for them. They belong in libraries, just as libraries have already become places you can go to get access to ebooks, and audiobooks and DVDs and web content.</p><p>A library is a place that is a repository of information and gives every citizen equal access to it. That includes health information. And mental health information. It's a community space. It's a place of safety, a haven from the world. It's a place with librarians in it. What the libraries of the future will be like is something we should be imagining now.</p><p>Literacy is more important than ever it was, in this world of text and email, a world of written information. We need to read and write, we need global citizens who can read comfortably, comprehend what they are reading, understand nuance, and make themselves understood.</p><p>Libraries really are the gates to the future. So it is unfortunate that, round the world, we observe local authorities seizing the opportunity to close libraries as an easy way to save money, without realising that they are stealing from the future to pay for today. They are closing the gates that should be open.</p><p>According to a recent study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, England is the \"only country where the oldest age group has higher proficiency in both literacy and numeracy than the youngest group, after other factors, such as gender, socio-economic backgrounds and type of occupations are taken into account\".</p><p>Or to put it another way, our children and our grandchildren are less literate and less numerate than we are. They are less able to navigate the world, to understand it to solve problems. They can be more easily lied to and misled, will be less able to change the world in which they find themselves, be less employable. All of these things. And as a country, England will fall behind other developed nations because it will lack a skilled workforce.</p><p>Books are the way that we communicate with the dead. The way that we learn lessons from those who are no longer with us, that humanity has built on itself, progressed, made knowledge incremental rather than something that has to be relearned, over and over. There are tales that are older than most countries, tales that have long outlasted the cultures and the buildings in which they were first told.</p><p>I think we have responsibilities to the future. Responsibilities and obligations to children, to the adults those children will become, to the world they will find themselves inhabiting. All of us – as readers, as writers, as citizens – have obligations. I thought I'd try and spell out some of these obligations here.</p><p>I believe we have an obligation to read for pleasure, in private and in public places. If we read for pleasure, if others see us reading, then we learn, we exercise our imaginations. We show others that reading is a good thing.</p><p>We have an obligation to support libraries. To use libraries, to encourage others to use libraries, to protest the closure of libraries. If you do not value libraries then you do not value information or culture or wisdom. You are silencing the voices of the past and you are damaging the future.</p><p>We have an obligation to read aloud to our children. To read them things they enjoy. To read to them stories we are already tired of. To do the voices, to make it interesting, and not to stop reading to them just because they learn to read to themselves. Use reading-aloud time as bonding time, as time when no phones are being checked, when the distractions of the world are put aside.</p><p>We have an obligation to use the language. To push ourselves: to find out what words mean and how to deploy them, to communicate clearly, to say what we mean.  We must not to attempt to freeze language, or to pretend it is a dead thing that must be revered, but we should use it as a living thing, that flows, that borrows words, that allows meanings and pronunciations to change with time.</p><p>We writers  – and especially writers for children, but all writers –  have an obligation to our readers: it's the obligation to write true things, especially important when we are creating tales of people who do not exist in places that never were – to understand that truth is not in what happens but what it tells us about who we are. Fiction is the lie that tells the truth, after all. We have an obligation not to bore our readers, but to make them need to turn the pages. One of the best cures for a reluctant reader, after all, is a tale they cannot stop themselves from reading. And while we must tell our readers true things and give them weapons and give them armour and pass on whatever wisdom we have gleaned from our short stay on this green world, we have an obligation not to preach, not to lecture, not to force predigested morals and messages down our readers' throats like adult birds feeding their babies pre-masticated maggots; and we have an obligation never, ever, under any circumstances, to write anything for children that we would not want to read ourselves.</p><p>We have an obligation to understand and to acknowledge that as writers for children we are doing important work, because if we mess it up and write dull books that turn children away from reading and from books, we 've lessened our own future and diminished theirs.</p><p>We all – adults and children, writers and readers – have an obligation to daydream. We have an obligation to imagine. It is easy to pretend that nobody can change anything, that we are in a world in which society is huge and the individual is less than nothing: an atom in a wall, a grain of rice in a rice field. But the truth is, individuals change their world over and over, individuals make the future, and they do it by imagining that things can be different.</p><p>Look around you: I mean it. Pause, for a moment and look around the room that you are in. I'm going to point out something so obvious that it tends to be forgotten. It's this: that everything you can see, including the walls, was, at some point, imagined. Someone decided it was easier to sit on a chair than on the ground and imagined the chair. Someone had to imagine a way that I could talk to you in London right now without us all getting rained on.This room and the things in it, and all the other things in this building, this city, exist because, over and over and over, people imagined things.</p><p>We have an obligation to make things beautiful. Not to leave the world uglier than we found it, not to empty the oceans, not to leave our problems for the next generation. We have an obligation to clean up after ourselves, and not leave our children with a world we've shortsightedly messed up, shortchanged, and crippled.</p><p>We have an obligation to tell our politicians what we want, to vote against politicians of whatever party who do not understand the value of reading in creating worthwhile citizens, who do not want to act to preserve and protect knowledge and encourage literacy. This is not a matter of party politics. This is a matter of common humanity.</p><p>Albert Einstein was asked once how we could make our children intelligent. His reply was both simple and wise. \"If you want your children to be intelligent,\" he said, \"read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.\" He understood the value of reading, and of imagining. I hope we can give our children a world in which they will read, and be read to, and imagine, and understand.</p><p>• This is an edited version of Neil Gaiman's lecture for <a href=\"http://readingagency.org.uk\" title=\"\">the Reading Agency</a>, delivered on Monday October 14  at the Barbican in London.

        "body":"<p>The US Congress passed legislation to rescue the country from the brink of a looming debt default on Wednesday night, bringing an end to the two-week crisis that has closed large portions of the government, revealed deep divisions in the Republican party and threatened a global financial crisis.</p> <p>A temporary fix that will last only through to the start of 2014, the bill passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement just hours earlier.</p> <p>But it was able to pass the Republican-dominated House shortly after 10pm only with the support of Democrats. It laid bare a rupture between moderate and more rightwing Republicans, who triggered the crisis by using their budgetary leverage in what turned out to be a futile effort to undermine Obama's signature healthcare reforms.</p> <p>Only 87 House Republicans voted for the bill. The party leadership was opposed by 144 members, including Paul Ryan, the former vice-presidential candidate and a key figure in Congress.</p> <p>President Barack Obama signed the spending measure into law at about 12.30 am ET on Thursday.&nbsp;In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would &quot;lift the cloud of uncertainty&quot; that had hung over the country in recent weeks.</p> <p>&quot;Once this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately,&quot; he said in a statement delivered at the White House. &quot;Hopefully next time it won't be in the 11th hour. We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.&quot;</p> <p>Minutes after the bill was passed, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said government employees &quot;should expect to return to work in the morning&quot;.</p> <p>On both sides of the Capitol building Republican lawmakers looked deflated after the votes, which capped a dramatic capitulation after weeks of brinkmanship with Democrats who refused to blink.</p> <p>When it came, the Republican surrender was swift. With just hours to go until the deadline set by the US Treasury for extending the debt limit, House Speaker John Boehner signalled he was ready to accept a Senate-drafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to the conservatives who had driven the country the precipice of a new financial crisis.</p> <p>&quot;We fought the good fight, but we just didn't win,&quot; Boehner told a local TV station in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio.</p> <p>The standoff ended just after midday when Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, announced the deal on the the floor of the Senate. Calling for all sides to work together, he said: &quot;Now is not the time for pointing the fingers of blame. Now is the time for reconciliation.&quot;</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, acknowledged the fight was over. &quot;This has been a long, challenging few weeks,&quot; McConnell said. &quot;This is far less than many of us had hoped for, but it is far better than some had sought.&quot;</p> <p>The deal, crafted by Reid and McConnell, will fund the government until 15 January and lift the debt ceiling until 7 February, setting the stage for a possible repeat of the showdown. Both sides also agreed to a formal budget conference in an attempt to reach a longer-term deal by 13 December.</p> <p>The only change to the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans had targeted when they precipitated the government shutdown, requires the Obama administration to carry out better checks on the incomes of people registering for insurance exchanges.</p> <p>The bill also ensures the 800,000 federal workers who were furloughed for at least part of the shutdown will receive back pay.</p> <p>By 3pm, Boehner hosted a short meeting with forlorn-looking Republicans in the House. Sources inside the meeting said he told his colleagues they had lost the fight, and was then given a tepid applause.</p> <p>Several conservative members leaving the meeting conceded that the hardline Republican tactics had left them empty-handed. &quot;We got nothing,&quot; said&nbsp;Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, who admitted his side had emerged with &quot;a goose egg&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet for the most part they rallied behind Boehner, who had sought to appease the restive conservative element until it was no longer feasible to do so.</p> <p>Recriminations among Republicans flew thick and fast, with moderates accusing House conservatives of trashing the party's reputation in pursuit of an impossible ambition to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.</p> <p>Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said the Democractic party had experienced the &quot;best two weeks&quot; in recent history. &quot;When we evaluate the last couple of weeks, it should be entitled the time of great lost opportunity,&quot; he said. &quot;If we had been focused on the rollout of Obamacare and its confusion, public support would have diminished. Instead, our numbers have gone down, Obamacare has mysteriously gone up, and other than that, this has been great.&quot;</p> <p>Graham was scathing about the influence of conservative advocacy groups such as Heritage Action, which torpedoed a deal on Tuesday when it threatened to withdraw support from Republicans who backed it. He also warned of the damage that the party had inflicted on itself.</p> <p>&quot;The way we are behaving and the path we have taken the last couple of weeks leads to a marginalised party in the eyes of the American people,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Ted Cruz, the first-term Republican senator from Texas who had led the rebellion against Obamacare with a marathon 21-hour speech last month, was unrepentant. The Tea Party-backed senator was one of 18 Republicans who rebelled against their leadership to vote against the bill in the Senate.</p> <p>Shortly before the Senate vote, Cruz took to the floor to urge his colleagues to vote against it. &quot;This is a terrible deal,&quot; he said. &quot;It embodies everything about the Washington establishment that frustrates the American people.&quot;</p> <p>However he did not attempt any tactics to delay or stall the vote.</p> <p>Underscoring the fault lines in the Republican party, Cruz blamed fellow senators for failing to go along with his strategy. &quot;Unfortunately the Senate chose not to follow the House and in particular we saw real division among Senate Republicans. Had Senate Republicans united and supported House Republicans the outcome of this would have been very, very different,&quot; he said.</p> <p>It was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans. None of their stated goals were achieved, and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis. By refusing to blink, Democrats pushed Republicans to show that they would not let the US default on its debts, making it hard for the GOP to repeat its tactic.</p> <p>A Louisiana Republican, Charles Boustany, said the Tea Party-backed members of the House of Representatives had put the GOP's position at risk. &quot;This could trigger a wave of discontent that could wash out our Republican majority in the House if we're not careful – it's getting to that level,&quot; he told the National Journal.</p> <p>Tim Huelskamp, a member of Tea Party congressional caucus, told the Guardian the divisive vote in the House would help identify the moderates in his party which he said had “given up the fight”.</p> <p>“People back at home realise not all Republicans are conservatives,” he said. “And some Republicans are anti-conservative.”</p> <p>Senator Mike Lee, a Republican ally of Cruz, struck a defiant tone on the floor, perhaps indicating more trouble ahead “The media keeps asking: was it worth it? My answer is it is always worth it to do the right thing,” he said, adding: “This is not over.”</p> <p>That view was not shared at the White House. As he left the lectern after his Wednesday night press briefing, the president was asked by a journalist whether the crisis would happen all over again in a few months. Speaking over his shoulder, Obama replied: “No.”</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420208941|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|c084749e4853af817c27be913feff021ce335dbf -->",

        "body":"<p>New DNA research may have finally solved the mystery of the yeti.</p><p>Tests on hair samples found a genetic match with an ancient polar bear, and scientists believe there could be a subspecies of brown bear in the high Himalayas that has been mistaken for the mythical beast.</p><p>The yeti, also known as the abominable snowman or bigfoot, has been recorded for centuries in the Himalayas. Local people and mountaineers claim to have come face-to-face with hairy, ape-like creatures.</p><p>Bryan Sykes, professor of human genetics at Oxford University, set out to collect and test \"yeti\" hair samples to find out which species they came from. In particular he analysed hairs from two unknown animals, one found in the western Himalayan region of Ladakh and the other from Bhutan, 800 miles to the east.</p><p>After subjecting the hairs to the most advanced DNA tests available and comparing the results to other animals' genomes stored on the GenBank database, Sykes found that he had a 100% match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Svalbard, Norway, that dates back at least 40,000 years and probably around 120,000 years – a time when the polar bear and closely related brown bear were separating as different species.</p><p>Sykes believes the most likely explanation is that the animals are hybrids – crosses between polar bears and brown bears. The species are closely related and are known to interbreed where their territories overlap.</p><p>The professor said: \"This is an exciting and completely unexpected result that gave us all a surprise. There's more work to be done on interpreting the results. I don't think it means there are ancient polar bears wandering around the Himalayas.</p><p>\"But we can speculate on what the possible explanation might be. It could mean there is a subspecies of brown bear in the high Himalayas descended from the bear that was the ancestor of the polar bear. Or it could mean there has been more recent hybridisation between the brown bear and the descendent of the ancient polar bear.\"</p><p>A photograph of a \"yeti\" footprint, taken by the British climber Eric Shipton at the base of Everest, sparked global mania after it was taken in 1951.</p><p>The legendary mountaineer Reinhold Messner, who became the first man to climb Everest without oxygen, has studied yetis since he had a terrifying encounter with a mysterious creature in Tibet in 1986.</p><p>His own research backs up Sykes's theory. He uncovered an image in a 300-year-old Tibetan manuscript of a \"chemo\" – another local name for the yeti – with text alongside it which was translated to read: \"The yeti is a variety of bear living in inhospitable mountainous areas.\"</p><p>Sykes added: \"Bigfootologists and other enthusiasts seem to think that they have been rejected by science. Science doesn't accept or reject anything. All it does is examine the evidence and that is what I'm doing.\"</p><p>His investigations feature in a three-part Channel 4 documentary series, Bigfoot Files, which starts on Sunday.</p><p>A book by Sykes about his research, The Yeti Enigma: A DNA Detective Story, is to be published next spring.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420253851|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|a528bb14ca10fbd48e7b8269a6fda86889fff0a5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Andros Townsend has defended Roy Hodgson after the England manager was forced into making an apology over a joke he made about a space monkey and the Tottenham Hotspur winger.</p><p>Hodgson has been embroiled in the bizarre race row after it was reported on Wednesday night that he told the joke at half-time during England's 2-0 win against Poland on Tuesday, in an attempt to encourage right-back Chris Smalling to pass more frequently to Townsend.</p><p>Hodgson has been mortified that the remark could be perceived as racist and issued a statement to apologise for any offence that had been caused. Townsend has since tweeted to say: \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p>\"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time,\" said Hodgson. \"There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room.</p><p>\"I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p>Hodgson gained further support on Thursday from Wayne Rooney, who insisted the manager had his players' full support, despite the Sun claiming that at least one player had been offended.</p><p>The Manchester United forward wrote on Twitter: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><p>The supposed joke is one that was popular at American space agency Nasa. It goes:</p><p><blockquote>\"Nasa decided they'd finally send a man up in a capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions. They fire the man and the monkey into space. The intercom crackles: 'Monkey, fire the retros.' A little later: 'Monkey, check the solid fuel supply.' Later still: 'Monkey, check the life support systems for the man.' The astronaut takes umbrage and radios Nasa: 'When do I get to do something?' Nasa replies: 'In 15 minutes – feed the monkey.'\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Stan Collymore, the former England striker, said it was ridiculous for anyone to complain about the joke. \"Someone leaked it and I bet 100 per cent confident that no player was offended, not one,\" Collymore wrote on Twitter. \"If they are, do explain why. Racism is hard enough to keep on the agenda as it is without making everyone think a legitimate space tale should be a cause for offence.\"</p><p>However, Piara Powar, the executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare) organisation, suggested Hodgson was wrong to use the term. He wrote on Twitter: \"Hodgson used very silly term within a diverse team environment. He should know better. Assume it wasn't a Freudian slip, no evidence to suggest it was. Some players will see it as reflection of the crude language still used by some coaches and attitudes that still prevail.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420230579|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|2e163e665ad691a0a5e86fbd5c8c5ac8b949e102 -->",

        "body":"<p>The shadow equalities minister, Gloria De Piero, has appealed to the press to \"call off the hunt\" for topless pictures that she posed for as a teenager after learning a news agency was offering thousands of pounds for them.</p><p>The former political journalist and television presenter tackled the issue of media intrusion directly by writing an article saying she must be allowed to get on with her job.</p><p></p><p>It came after De Piero gave an interview saying she understood why young girls posed naked for photoshoots because she had done the same aged just 15, thinking it was a way of improving her circumstances.</p><p>\"I've always said I don't blame the girls. I understand how they might think it would be a way out,\" she told the Times earlier this week.</p><p>After giving that interview, De Piero learned a news agency claiming to be acting on behalf of a national newspaper had offered several thousand pounds to obtain the pictures.</p><p>Writing on her website, De Piero said: \"The offer was made to the owner of a building in Bradford. I understand that he was offered money for access to the building and a further payment if the pictures were found.</p><p>\"I have talked about why I posed for these pictures in interviews before. I thought at the time it was a way of improving my circumstances. This is part of my story and part of who I am. I can't change it now but this happened over 20 years ago.</p><p>\"It is now time to call off the hunt for these pictures and let me get on with the job I was elected to do, representing the people of Ashfield and serving in the shadow cabinet.\"</p><p>The 40-year-old MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire argued that people of diverse backgrounds should be able to go into politics without fear of being haunted by things they had done in their teens.</p><p>\"I don't think anyone wants politics to be open only to those people who were planning their political careers in their teens,\" she said.</p><p>\"I would like to see a politics that represents our country, including many more women from all walks of life, and that is something I am passionately committed to help bring about.</p><p>\"No one should have to worry that something they did when they were young might prevent them from serving their community or getting involved in politics at a local or national level.\"</p><p>In her interview with the Times, De Piero said Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader, had been very supportive when the existence of the photographs was revealed.</p><p></p><p>She said Harman urged her not to change or get \"buttoned up\", saying: \"Don't worry, it's absolutely fine, Gloria, we wouldn't judge you for that.\"</p><p></p><p>The MP also revealed she decided to concentrate on her political career rather than having children several years ago.</p><p></p><p>\"I'm 40 now and I've always said I don't want kids, but that decision will be removed from me incredibly soon,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>\"Different rules seem to apply to women. When do you ever hear someone saying: 'Oh you might not want to employ a dad, he might have to take time off for the kids'?</p><p>\"The most important thing is being fulfilled and this job makes me very fulfilled.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246257|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|867420327cc7b2acf8e954aaaaadd3f6b10a91eb -->",

        "headline":"Ofsted report on Al-Madinah free school 'is devastating blow to Gove'",
        "body":"<p>Michael Gove has suffered a \"devastating blow\" to his flagship free schools policy after a new school in Derby was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/16/faith-school-dammed-by-ofsted-dysfunctional\" title=\"\">condemned as dysfunctional in a hard-hitting Ofsted report</a>, the shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has said.</p><p>Speaking in an emergency Commons debate after the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/interactive/2013/oct/16/oftsed-report-on-al-madinah-school-derby\" title=\"\">published a leaked copy of the report</a>, Hunt said Ofsted's findings into the Al-Madinah school in Derby showed that Gove's free schools programme was a dangerous ideological experiment.</p><p>The report declares that the Islamic school in Derby is in chaos and has \"not been adequately monitored or supported\". It says teachers at the faith school are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training.</p><p>The shadow education secretary told MPs: \"What today's Ofsted report exposes is that the government's free school programme has become a dangerous free-for-all – an out-of-control ideological experiment that has closed a school, leaving 400 children losing an entire week of learning. It is a devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy.</p><p>\"It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen.\"</p><p>Hunt was granted an urgent question by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, after the Guardian published a leaked copy of the Ofsted report, which shows that teachers were appointed without proper qualifications and that the school was not properly overseen.</p><p>Labour believes the report has significance across England because it has highlighted key flaws in Gove's free schools programme. These include the appointment of unqualified teachers and inadequate levels of supervision, because local education authorities have little role in monitoring schools.</p><p>Hunt told MPs: \"In a city where every child needs to be supported and educated to the highest possible level, the education secretary has sacrificed learning for ideology. It is not just Al-Madinah school which is dysfunctional. It is the education secretary's free schools policy.\"</p><p>The Ofsted inspection, which had been due to take place by the end of the year, was brought forward by two months on the recommendation of the education department after allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear headscarves and pupils were segregated. The school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, closed during the inspection.</p><p>The report says pupils are given the same work regardless of their different abilities and that the governing body is ineffective.</p><p>The Ofsted report also says boys and girls eat lunch in separate sittings, although it puts this down to the small size of the canteen. Older boys and girls are seated on either side of classrooms, although younger children sit together.</p><p>The report concludes: \"This school is dysfunctional. The basic systems and processes a school needs to operate well are not in place. The school is in chaos and reliant on the goodwill of an interim principal to prevent it totally collapsing.\"</p><p>David Laws, the education minister who stood in for Gove, who is abroad, told MPs that the government had taken action and had requested the Ofsted report after concerns were raised about the school in the summer. The school opened in September last year.</p><p>Laws told MPs: \"After a steady start by the school we became aware of potential breaches of the conditions in its funding agreement late this summer. At the end of July we began a wide-ranging investigation into the financial management and governance of the school.</p><p>\"Our investigations did indeed find significant and numerous breaches of the conditions in its funding agreement. Our concerns were such that we requested Ofsted to bring forward its planned inspection.\"</p><p>Laws added that his ministerial colleague Lord Nash had made clear to the school's trust that it would lose its funding unless it dealt with the concerns raised by the department and in the Ofsted report. \"We will not let any school, whether a free school, an academy school or a local authority school, languish in failure. The Ofsted report confirms we are taking the right actions. We are not prepared to allow a school to fail its parents, its children and its community. We said we will take swift action in these cases and that is exactly what we are doing.\"</p><p>Laws accused Hunt of inconsistency because he told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 on Sunday that he now favoured free schools. The shadow education secretary told the programme that he favoured parent-led academies that would be different from free schools in three respects: they could only open in areas where there was a shortage of schools places; teachers would have to be qualified; and there would be greater oversight.</p><p>Hunt illustrated his final point on Sunday by pointing to Al-Madinah school. He told the Andrew  Marr Show: \"You're going to have systems of financial accountability, transparency, because what is going on at the Al-Madinah School in Derby is a terrifying example of the mistakes of Michael Gove's education policy. You have had a system which allows essentially financial irregularities, allegations of extremist curriculum, teaching ideas contrary to British values, because there's no oversight there.</p><p>\"I'm in favour of parent-led academies, which are going to be good parent-led academies and we will keep the good free schools when we get into government. But have no doubt that what we have seen recently is an ideological experiment with our young people and as a result of that, four hundred kids in Derby have been sent home for the week. They have had no schooling because of an ideological experiment by Michael Gove, and that can't be right.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246731|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|c618d8772cbde26dca29bacbe27ddd94b59ada48 -->",

It's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding. It is likely that this spread is at least partly a response to a changing climate and as such we're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK.\"</p></blockquote><p>The reason we are seeing so many stories appearing now may simply be because spiders are moving indoors with the onset of colder weather following a particularly dry summer. Tweddle says:</p><blockquote><p>\"We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible. The males of some species – such as Tegenaria house spiders – are also actively moving around in the search for mates, so more likely to be spotted.\"</p></blockquote><p>So how deadly are these animals? According to Tweddle, the noble false widow spiders (<a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/biodiversity/alien-species/steatoda-nobilis/\" title=\"\"><em>Steatoda nobilis</em></a>) are not the rampant terror they have been made out to be.</p><p>The spiders are one of only around a dozen species capable of biting humans among the UK's 650 spider species, but bites are extremely rare – and are much less common than bee or wasp stings. He says:</p><blockquote><p>\"There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from <em>Steatoda nobilis</em>, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care – the smaller males are not known to cause bites. It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing.\"</p></blockquote><p>The false widow is much less dangerous than the black widow spider – whose venom is said to be 15 times stronger than a rattlesnake. However, even black widow bites are unlikely to cause serious damage or death.</p><p>Despite the admittedly small risk posed by the eight-legged creatures, the media frenzy around false widow spiders is causing people across the UK to panic, <a href=\"http://srs.britishspiders.org.uk/portal.php/p/False+Widow+Spiders\" title=\"\">according to the British Arachnological Society</a>. <a href=\"http://www.lawrencebee.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lawrence Bee</a>, the group's education and publicity officer, says:</p><blockquote><p>\"The media's reaction has definitely been over the top. We are quite a small society, and over the last few weeks we have been inundated with emails and phone calls from members of the public who have been really quite concerned about these reports. The problem is that they are seeing any spider as being a false widow spider.<br />\"We want to put some perspective on it. The false widow spider can bite, and if you are sensitive you can have a reaction to it – but no one has been killed by one in the UK. Some reports suggest we are in great danger.\"</p></blockquote><p>Bee even disputed that some of the scare stories were down to spiders at all. He says:</p><blockquote><p>\"The stories don't provide us with a clear picture. People think that because they have seen a spider just before they were bitten, it was the spider that bit them. One person said they had been bitten by a spider that had run across their foot. But why would a spider stop and bite someone if all it was doing was running across their foot? These things are not aggressive.\"</p></blockquote><p>In other words, we should all calm down – the spiders aren't coming to get us.</p><p>In fact, the experts' advice on what to do if you actually come across one is reassuringly straightforward. Tweddle says:</p><blockquote><p>\"If you are not keen on sharing your home with spiders, then it is best to catch and then release them away from your home. Try to avoid touching the spider – as well as the small risk of bite, spiders are easily damaged. A cup and piece of card is a simple way to catch, then transport the spider out of your home.\"</p></blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420242279|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|ad33737ea94c24f7c030d48e026e1af06a4f1e0b -->",

        "headline":"José Mourinho interview: I want players who are made in Chelsea",
        "body":"<p>Early Wednesday afternoon at Cobham and José Mourinho, having taken refuge from the chill of an incessant autumn drizzle, was impatient to crack on. The international window had rather dragged, a manager left with only a handful of first-team players to drill forced to break up the tedium by paying a fleeting visit to Belgrade to see Branislav Ivanovic and Serbia defeat Japan, and then an evening at Wembley watching England qualify for the World Cup.</p><p>In between there was an enjoyable weekend spent with his family, but the days still felt \"empty\" without league fixtures to demand his attention. \"I got bored,\" he said. \"I'm not the kind of person to tell my assistants to stay here and train the four or five guys we have in while I go on holiday. I don't do that. I can't do that. I was here at the training ground all the time, and that frustrated me because I like to work with the players and I could not. So I prepared, for Cardiff this weekend, for Schalke next week. I went to watch Ivanovic last Friday, England on Tuesday. I watched every match my players were in on television. But you always want to get back to it, for it all to start up again.\"</p><p>The two-times European Cup winner's enthusiasm and intensity are retained, with the latest early-season hiatus unwelcome. Mourinho, at 50 and back where he feels he belongs, is already consumed by the new kind of project he has accepted at Chelsea. Where his task first time around had been to establish this club's reputation as winners, breaking a league title drought that had extended for half a century, now the Portuguese is rising to another challenge. This team has claimed London's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/19/bayern-munich-chelsea-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">first European Cup</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/15/chelsea-benfica-europa-league-final-live\" title=\"\">Europa League </a>under interim managers over successive seasons, fine achievements given they have either felt like a squad in constant transition or a side too often reliant upon pragmatism to secure success against classier opposition. Mourinho must bring style and panache to the party.</p><p>He is aiming to ally work-rate with pizzazz, establishing an industrious flamboyance, and his players are buying into what is required, even if the likes of Juan Mata and Kevin De Bruyne have already been subjected to some tough love en route. That is all part of the process, with results on the pitch solid rather than spectacular to date. It would have been folly to expect anything else. The restored manager points regularly to a lack of key personnel at the peak of their powers, in an age bracket from 26 to 30. Instead he has inherited, or seen purchased, prospects with burgeoning reputations who are eager to prove their pedigree while an older generation work to maintain their own standards and help guide the youngsters through the clutter of an English calendar.</p><p>Figures such as Frank Lampard and John Terry were mainstays of Mourinho's initial Chelsea lineups in that glittering first spell at Stamford Bridge and, where they might otherwise have faded into the background, are restored to prominence now. The midfielder has featured in all matches bar a League Cup tie at Swindon this season. Terry has started each of the club's Barclays Premier League fixtures and should maintain that record against Cardiff City on Saturday. The older heads remain pivotal to the project.</p><p>Take Terry. The centre-half  has endured much since Mourinho departed back in 2007, the list of controversies, plenty of them self-inflicted – from twice losing the England captaincy to being banned over the Anton Ferdinand affair, to the nagging injuries and missing the Champions League final through suspension – trip off the tongue too easily. At times he felt like a bit-part player under Rafael Benítez's stewardship last season, and even the veteran club captain is not immune to self-doubt.</p><p>Now, though, he is revived. \"He's recovering his self-esteem,\" said Mourinho. \"In the last few years he was not playing a lot, he had problems on the pitch, he had problems outside the pitch, he had suspensions for different reasons, he had injuries, he had managers who didn't trust him enough. And it looked like, at a certain moment, his career was going in the wrong direction.</p><p>\"Even I was questioning, from far away, what was happening to this guy: physical problems, psychological problems, what is going on? I'm happy he's proving he's still a top player. He plays in a position where age doesn't make a huge difference. It's a position where players rely more on positioning, on reading the game, and being in the right place at the right time. Experience helps. Look at how many top teams have experienced players at centre-half: go to Barcelona and Carles Puyol is there; go to Manchester United and there's Rio Ferdinand; Jamie Carragher at Liverpool was playing until last season and was important for them. You go to many clubs and top clubs and central defenders are 30 to 34. John is proving his quality. With what he did at Chelsea in the last decade, I think he deserves to be back on track.\"</p><p>Then there is Lampard, the club's record goalscorer whose trademark box-to-box style, all late charges into the penalty area to catch opponents unawares, is being tweaked as time overtakes him. The onus these days is to transform a player capped 102 times by his country into an English Andrea Pirlo, a deep-lying distributor and an asset in possession. Personalised drills are aimed at coaxing different qualities from his game. \"Of course Frank can become that,\" said the manager. \"He has to adapt and learn every day how to play with this 'new body'. A player can still learn new skills at his age, for sure. I'm 50 and have been a manager since 2000, and I'm learning every day, every match, with every experience. You can always learn new skills, especially if the player has an open mind like he does.</p><p>\"He's a player who can keep the side's balance, a player who thinks about the game and can work with kids around him. For him, it was very good that I'm back because the trust is so big. He knows that every decision I make on him is for my team – because that's the most important thing – but also for him. So if, one day, I bring him off at 70 minutes, or if I leave him on the bench or give him a rest and don't select him, it's for his own good. He knows, without me speaking to him every day – which I don't do with my players – that I'm doing it for him, and that I might need him round the corner to play often. The trust and friendship is so big that he is happy, he's calm, he's cool. At this moment of his career, it was very important for him to have somebody like me around. For him, it's very good.\"</p><p>That pair, along with Ashley Cole, are out of contract next summer and yet, even now, the glowing praise for their early-season endeavours suggests the experienced English heartbeat in the midst of Mourinho's latest Chelsea lineup might be retained beyond this term.</p><p>\"I like that local core, not just in England but when I've worked in Portugal, Spain and Italy,\" said Mourinho. \"You owe some respect to the country and the national team, so to give some options for them is important. To keep the culture of the country in your own team's style is also very important, and you cannot lose characteristics of the local football. Sometimes people think: 'Ah, we want to play like this or like that team, like a Barça or a Bayern.' But, first of all, you have to play like the culture of the country you're in.</p><p>\"I like that loyalty. I also like the fact the foreign players arrive and find a spine in place, a nucleus of local players who can tell them and explain to them where they are, how things work here, the way they have to behave, and even the way they have to play in this league. They have to understand what they've joined. For example, an English player knows what it's like to play eight matches in three weeks at Christmas time. For a foreigner, that can come as a shock, so you need locals around who can explain what it means to people, why you can't complain and why you have to buy into it. Ideally it's not just about having British players either, but having players who are made in Chelsea. In three or four years' time, if we don't have other Englishmen to replace this nucleus of players – when Lamps is 39, John is 36 – I will be very sad. Every club needs that.</p><p>\"So we are working on that (new generation). We have some players on loan, like (Nathaniel) Chalobah, and we have some others working and growing in the under-21s. Their standard is improving. Before, these age groups in England did not have a good level of competition at that age, but now there is a national championship, an under-19s Champions League, and it's improving them. The conditions in our academy cannot be better – the facilities and coaches are amazing – but while the quality of the coaching and the philosophy can be excellent, you really need competition to develop the kids.\"</p><p>Such observations will presumably be noted in Mourinho's testimony to the Football Association's commission when Greg Dyke's nominees come calling. The Portuguese is ever eager to impart his opinion and, having worked successfully across Europe, his experience should be tapped.</p><p>Mourinho enjoys his role as an educator these days. The manager was speaking after a Barclays community event at the training ground where grassroots coaches had been given the chance to quiz him on his coaching philosophy as part of the sponsors' initiative to thank community heroes this season. Those coaches who had taken their seats temporarily in the media suite lapped up his anecdotes, whether he was addressing modern-day tactical trends or the highlights of his time spent as Sir Bobby Robson's interpreter in Portugal and Spain.</p><p>\"Hopefully, one day when I have finished my managerial career, I will have time just to do that, to tell those stories and help the next generation,\" said Mourinho. \"I've always been happy talking to coaches, and my office door is open. I like doing it, especially with kids who want to be something, or with people who might have other jobs but who are really just in love with the game. I understand their curiosity. They want to know details and to try and learn from your experience.\" Some of those in his audience at Cobham were clad in Chelsea kit. Others piped up expressing alternative allegiances, even if they still hung on his every word.</p><p>The Premier League has welcomed Mourinho back. His return has helped offset the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, providing Chelsea supporters with a hero to cleanse the discord from last term, and opposition fans with a pantomime villain to heckle. \"I don't think the Premier League, or the country, missed me,\" he said. \"The country is too strong in relation to football, and the Premier League is too strong to miss somebody. It's not a question of 'missing'. But it's certainly a question of me loving it here and people know that.</p><p>\"I enjoy playing at home, feeling the Chelsea fans' passion, that they are happy to have me on their side; but I also enjoy playing away and feeling the opponents support their own team, giving me that 'hostility'. It's a 'pure hostility'. It's not aggressive. If Chelsea fans at Norwich are singing: 'José Mourinho', and the other guys sing: 'Fuck off Mourinho', I don't think it's aggressive hostility. It's better than them ignoring me. If, one day, I was Norwich manager, they'd be singing my name too. It's pure. You go, for example, to countries like Spain and when they say: 'Hijo de puta Portugues' [Portuguese son of a bitch] you know it's a deep feeling. A real hatred. They mean it. Here, even the hostility is different. More tongue in cheek. When I'm not winning I'm 'not special any more'. I understand that and I like it.</p><p>\"It is good to be back. I feel as if I belong here. Take Tuesday, for example, at Wembley. I did not celebrate (England's qualification) by jumping up or drinking because that's not in my nature, but inside I was celebrating. I was happy. A World Cup without England is not a World Cup. They're one of the big football countries and, even if at any particular moment the national team is not at a high level, England has to be always in a World Cup. Of course, part of me was also happy that my players won't have the pressure of the play-offs in November and can play two friendly matches instead, rather than worrying if they would go to Brazil. They deserve to be there. The tournament will be better for having them there.\"</p><p>Yet, with that next international window a month away, Mourinho will plunge himself back into club matters with relish. His players returned from their national set-ups to discover the manager had armed himself with new statistical resources while they had been away. Fine-tuning is being taken to extremes. There really is no hiding from the analysis any more. \"This week we finished work with my staff comparing the way we defend when some players are in the team, and the way we defend when some are not playing. It was all trying to bring more of a scientific approach to everything. I wanted to see if my eyes were seeing exactly what the numbers suggest they should be.\" And are they? \"Yes. Oh yes.\" That was said with a smile and then, with a shake of the hand and work to be done, he was gone.</p><p><em>José Mourinho was speaking at a Barclays community event.

        "body":"<p>British Gas will raise energy prices by an average of 9.2% next month, piling further financial pressure on 7.8 million households and reigniting the political row over soaring gas and electricity prices.</p><p>Parent company Centrica became the second of the big six energy firms to announce a price rise after SSE raised prices last week. The average annual dual-fuel bill with British Gas will increase by £107 to £1,297.</p><p>Centrica blamed the above-inflation hike on higher costs for wholesale energy and delivering gas and electricity to homes, and government's \"social and environmental programmes\" which are paid for through customers' bills.</p><p>Electricity bills will rise by 10.4% and gas bills by 8.4% from 23 November. With usage and regional variations this equates to an average price rise of 9.2%, Centrica said.</p><p>The move escalated the row between energy providers and the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who accused SSE of \"ripping off\" customers after it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill\" title=\"\">announced an 8.2% price rise for its 7 million customers</a>.</p><p>Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, said the latest rise by British Gas showed \"clearer than ever\" why Miliband's proposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/sep/25/centrica-sse-labour-miliband-price-freeze\" title=\"\">20-month energy price freeze</a> was needed.</p><p>British Gas said on Thursday that although it recognised energy bills were a \"real worry for hard-pressed households\", the decision was down to rising costs \"that are not all directly under our control\".</p><p>Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas residential energy, said: \"I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes aren't keeping pace. We haven't taken this decision lightly.\"</p><p>He said the best way to keep bills down was by increased energy efficiency, and urged customers to check whether they were eligible for measures such as insulation.</p><p>Tom Lyon, an energy expert at uSwitch.com, said the rise would leave customers feeling \"betrayed\".</p><p>\"Today's price hike will be seen by many as a broken promise after the supplier suggested in May that it would use the extra profits it made last winter to hold off from any price hikes.</p><p>\"British Gas customers have had the rug pulled from under their feet and I suspect that many will be feeling let down and betrayed.\"</p><p>The company, however, insisted it was making \"fair profits\" for \"keeping homes warm and keeping the lights on\".</p><p>It said it was offering a new tariff which guarantees that prices will not go up until 30 November 2014. If standard prices fall, the fixed tariff will fall too, it said.</p><p>Clare Francis, editor-in-chief of Moneysupermarket.com, said other energy providers were likely to follow the move.</p><p>\"It won't stop there. We can expect the other four major providers – EDF, E.ON, npower and Scottish Power – to also announce price hikes over the coming weeks.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420240604|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|49400171837dbf3bdc182501e5b7d80bd1c36c14 -->",

        "headline":"South Dakota's cattle cataclysm: why isn't this horror news?",
        "body":"<p>If you aren't in the agriculture world, you most likely haven't heard about the <a href=\"http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/15725398-south-dakota-blizzard-leaves-around-20000-cattle-dead-photos\">devastating loss</a> that ranchers in western South Dakota are struggling with after being <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/news/weather-winter/south-dakota-ranchers-20131010\">hit by winter storm Atlas</a>.</p><p>For some reason the news stations aren't covering this story. I don't understand why they wouldn't. This story has heartbreak, tragedy and even a convenient tie into the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2013/10/14/233790772/s-d-ranchers-struggle-to-get-out-from-under-blizzard\">current government shutdown</a>. Isn't that what the news is all about these days?</p><p>But the news isn't covering this story. Instead, it is spreading around on social media, and bloggers are writing from their ranches in South Dakota. Bloggers are trying to explain how the horrible happened. And now I am going to join them to tell you the part of the story that I know, and I am going to ask you to help these people, because if you are here reading this, I know you give a crap about these people.</p><p>Last weekend western South Dakota and parts of the surrounding states got their butts handed to them by Mother Nature. A blizzard isn't unusual in South Dakota, the cattle are tough and can handle some snow. They have for hundreds of years.</p><p>Unlike on our dairy farm in Wisconsin, beef cattle don't live in climate controlled barns. Beef cows and calves spend the majority of their lives out on pasture. They graze the grass in the spring, summer and fall and eat baled hay in the winter.</p><p>In winter these cows and calves grow fuzzy jackets that keep them warm and protect them from the snow and cold. The cows and calves live in special pastures in the winter. These pastures are smaller and closer to the ranch, and they have windbreaks for the cows to hide behind. They have worked for cows for hundred of years.</p><p>So what's the big deal about this blizzard?</p><p>It's not really winter yet.</p><p>The cows don't have their warm jackets on. The cows are still out eating grass in the big pastures. Atlas wasn't just a snowstorm, it was the kind of storm that can destroy the ranchers that have been caring for these cattle for hundreds of years.</p><p>Last weekend Atlas hit. It started with rain. The rain soaked the cows and chilled them to the bone. Inches and inches of rain fell. The rain made horrible mud. Then the winds started – 80mph winds, hurricane force. When the wind started, the rain changed to snow. A lot of snow. The cows were wet, muddy and they didn't have their winter jackets when the wind and snow came. Wet snow. Heavy snow.</p><p>The cows tried to protect themselves. They hid in low spots away from the wind. The low spots where the rain had turned the ground to thick mud. Some got stuck in the mud. Some laid down to get away from the wind, to rest a little, they were tired from trying to get away from the weather when they were already so cold.</p><p>The snow came down so heavy and so fast the the low spots that the cattle were laying in filled with snow. Not a few inches of snow, not a foot of snow. Enough snow that the cows and their calves were covered in snow.</p><p>The cows and calves suffocated or froze to death.</p><p>The caretakers of these cattle had no power to save them. They had to stand by and take the lashings from Mother Nature. They had no options. When it was all over, they went out to discover what they had left.</p><p>Can you even imagine what that would feel like? Standing with your hands tied as your life's living, breathing and mooing work is destroyed. I can't imagine, I don't know how I would recover from a loss like that. This wasn't just one or two herds of cows. This wasn't just one or two families that lost animals. This wasn't just a few cows. Tens of thousands of cows are gone. Some ranchers lost their entire herds. All of their cows, gone.</p><p>In the fall, a cattle rancher sells their calves to someone who specializes in raising them for market. It's how a ranch generates income. Calves are the lifeblood of a cattle ranch. Most ranchers had not yet sold their calves when Atlas hit. Their calves are gone. The cows that made those calves were pregnant with with next year's calves. Those cows are gone, those calves are gone. </p><p>Meanwhile in Washington DC, the shutdown has doubly screwed the ranchers. The people that are supposed to try to help these people are unable to do their jobs. The farm bill is held up again. No one knows when, how or if help is going to come.</p><p>Insurance? Not likely.</p><p>When a flood comes and your corn is flooded out, you have some options. Insurance for cattle is expensive and it comes with hundreds of loopholes that make the gamble of farming without it the most practical choice for many.</p><p>There is no way around it, this storm has put some ranchers out of business. Time will tell just how many.</p><p>• This was originally posted on the author's blog, <a href=\"http://dairycarrie.com/2013/10/13/southdakotaatlas/\">The Adventures of Dairy Carrie</a>.

        "headline":"Morrissey: 10 things we learned from Autobiography",
        "body":"<h2>Morrissey was a teenage athlete</h2><p>Although his schooldays were deeply unhappy, the teenage Morrissey found himself an unlikely sportsman. \"By accident I am enlisted to represent the school in track events for the 100 metres and the 400 metres for which, unthinkably, I receive schoolboy medals.\" And so begins a period in which \"I am obliged to feel honoured and to dream of the 14-second dash, or the one-minute 400.\"</p><h2>Morrissey made his first TV appearance in a period drama</h2><p>Stumbling accidentally on to the Coronation Street set as a teenager, Morrissey found himself accosted by a woman bearing a bundle of scripts. On learning that he can, indeed, handle a bicycle well she issues an instruction: \"We need a boy for Saturday. It's a 7am start, no dialogue.\" And so Morrissey makes a brief appearance – \"even if you don't blink at all you will miss me\" – in The Stars Look Down, set in \"the frozen north of 1913\". He is but a spot on the horizon – \"a punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate\".</p><h2><br />Morrissey's first female crush was … a man</h2><p>\"Jerry Nolan on <a href=\"http://superradnow.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/new_york_dolls_-_1973_new_york_dolls.jpg\">the cover of the [New York] Dolls' debut album</a> is the first woman I ever fell in love with; the hussy-slut positioning of the legs is playmate call-girl, and the pink drum kit might be a rock'n'roll first.\"</p><h2>Morrissey and the soaps were made for each other</h2><p>Young and hardly gainfully employed, Morrissey wrote to Granada TV, suggesting he be employed as a writer on Corrie. \"I am invited to submit a script, and I whip off a word-slinger's delight wherein young take on old as a jukebox is tested in the Rovers' Return.\" Sadly, he is told his talents lie elsewhere. Many years later, however, the soaps come for him, when he is offered roles on Emmerdale and EastEnders, as Dot Cotton's \"so far unmentioned\" son. \"I would arrive unexpectedly in Albert Square and cause births, deaths and factory fires every time I opened my mouth\". As Morrissey observes: \"The most fascinating aspect of both offers is that somebody somewhere thought it a good idea.\" And that's without even considering the startling fact he was offered a cameo on Friends during a visit to filming of the sitcom.</p><h2>For all his anger at Mike Joyce, Morrissey praises the Smiths' rhythm section</h2><p>Though the lawsuit brought by Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke forever soured Morrissey's relationship with his former bandmates, he is effusive about their talents as the Smiths honed their craft. \"The Smiths' sound rockets with meteroic progression: bomb-burst drumming, explosive chords, combative basslines, and over it all I am as free as a hawk to paint the canvas as I wish. It is a gift from Jesus.\"</p><h2>Sandie Shaw may have been one Morrissey's idols, but that changed</h2><p> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bbZLll3Vdo\">Reading on mobile? Watch here</a></p><p>Morrissey was delighted when Sandie Shaw agreed to sing Hand in Glove, less delighted with subsequent events. \"Ugh,\" was his reaction when she told him: \"Twenty-seven in the charts might be great for you, but it's not good enough for me.\" And her failure to treat the band \"to dinner, or even a bottle of stale ale\" is regarded as poor recompense for taking 40% of the cut from her recording of the Smiths' debut single.</p><h2>Nick Kent asked to join the Smiths</h2><p>After Johnny Marr left the band, the remaining three considered recruiting another guitarist. And one who asked to be considered was the veteran rock writer. \"I am not a good self-salesman,\" he wrote to Morrissey, \"but I can confidently boast an encyclopaedic knowledge of the chord structures, dynamics etc of Johnny's contributions to date … Being musically associated with your very good self would signify the very apex of my crusade for immortality.\"</p><h2>After the release of Margaret on the Guillotine, Morrissey was questioned by the police</h2><p>Special Branch summoned Morrissey in the wake of his 1988 album Viva Hate, featuring <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsq3H_6XuFA\">Margaret on the Guillotine</a>, \"so that they might gauge whether or not I pose a security threat to Margaret Thatcher\". The meeting is civil, the singer's autograph is given, and after an hour he is sent away and the matter is ended.</p><h2>The Krays were persecuted</h2><p>Morrissey believes the East End gangster bosses were targeted by the authorities for being \"working class and far too formidable\". Their sin was not running a gangland empire, but that \"their empire promised no financial gain for the government\". They were, he states, \"unfairly locked away for the rest of their lives\".</p><h2>He was the victim of a kidnap attempt</h2><p>Morrissey believes Mexican kidnappers targeted him after a show in Tijuana in September 2007, when his driver veers from the highway down a dark road – 20 minutes after having promised they were four minutes from the US border. He and his security guard, fortunately, are able to leave the car, which leaves them in the middle of nowhere.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420211234|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|4561bbbca5a8c2e5a7cc4d6a9185799b0e7cae53 -->",

The Britain's Got Talent judge claims she was cornered by the unnamed comic at a public event, during a period when she was patching up her marriage to Les Dennis after an affair with Men Behaving Badly star Neil Morrissey. &quot;[Dennis and I] went to an event together,&quot; Holden writes, &quot;and on my way back from the loo, I was cornered by a famous comedian, who tried to kiss me and put his hands in places they shouldn't have been. I was scared and tried to push him away … but he wasn't put off … My body went limp, and I just stood there as he groped and nuzzled me.&quot; The attack, says Holden, former star of the hairdressing drama Cutting It, left her feeling &quot;cheap and worthless&quot;.</p><p>A series has been commissioned of <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-10-13/james-nesbitt-to-star-in-police-comedy-drama-babylon-from-peep-show-writers-and-danny-boyle\" title=\"\">the new Danny Boyle-directed comedy Babylon</a> – a sitcom about modern policing from the pens of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/peep-show\" title=\"\">Peep Show duo Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain</a>. Speaking at Radio Times event at the Cheltenham literature festival, Bain and Armstrong revealed that the six-part comedy-drama will be set in London, and will &quot;focus on police from all levels of the force and will feature documentary-style elements&quot;.</p><p>&quot;As soon as there's any incident [in real-life policing] now, there's 20 camera phones out,&quot; says Bain, &quot;and the cops are filming the public back, so it's quite a screen- and filming-rich environment out on the streets, and I think that interests [Boyle] to try and convey … We've been writing it for a few years since we had the first meeting. Mainly because of availability. Danny, last year, was doing something in the Olympic Park … he was quite busy.&quot;</p><p>The writers also revealed that the show's cast will <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Nesbitt\" title=\"\">include James Nesbitt</a>, Peep Show's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paterson_Joseph\" title=\"\">Paterson Joseph</a> and the standup (and star of Sky TV's Chickens) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jan/12/jonny-sweet-review\" title=\"\">Jonny Sweet</a>.</p><p>On the subject of Peep Show, the Independent speculates that the new BBC sitcom, Ambassadors, is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/can-new-mitchell--webb-comedy-help-the-foreign-office-improve-its-image-8866984.html\" title=\"\">being used by the Foreign Office to improve its image</a>. The show's writers – which include James Wood, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0178fhq\" title=\"\">the co-creator of Rev</a> – were given access to senior FO officials and spent time with the British ambassador to Kazakhastan. The former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray – who claims the show is based on his experiences – criticises Ambassadors as &quot;pro-government propaganda, a state-sponsored satire&quot;. Murray is critical of the series' sympathetic portrait of British government activity overseas. &quot;It is disgraceful and not based on anything the Foreign Office would do in real life,&quot; he claims. &quot;[In reality], human rights always have a very low priority compared to military considerations.&quot;</p><p>Elsewhere in comedy, <a href=\"http://www.beyondthejoke.co.uk/content/news-jo-brand-defends-lee-mack\" title=\"\">Jo Brand has defended Lee Mack</a> over &quot;unfair&quot; charges that he was dismissive of female comedians on his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/01/lee-mack-comedy-sexism-hello-ladies\" title=\"\">recent Desert Island Discs appearance</a>.

I was booked in to see Robin Ince and Josie Long last Friday night at Stratford Circus. Then my ticket was withdrawn, and I was told critics weren't welcome on this tour. <a href=\"https://robinince.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/i-am-my-own-worst-critic-i-often-walk-out-on-myself/\" title=\"\">Here – according to Ince himself – is why</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Worth a look</h2><p>Two items to catch the eye. The first is an article by Tom Crawshaw, author of a play about the Monty Python star Graham Chapman, <a href=\"http://www.thegayuk.com/#/magazine/4574334751/OPINION-Don%E2%80%99t-Take-It-The-Wrong-Way-Homosexuality-in-Comedy/6742443\" title=\"\">on how 21st-century comedy treats homosexuality</a>. &quot;Isn't laughing at a situation predicated on homosexuality saying, in some way, that to be gay is somehow slightly ridiculous – not wrong or evil – but somehow lesser, not ordinary, not completely sensible? There is a hint,&quot; writes Crawshaw, &quot;of macho culture at work, where the jokes of the playground are rejected but their underlying narrative is accepted and played on.&quot;</p><p>And here – for UK audiences curious to know what Simon Amstell is up to in the US – is the ex-Grandma's House star's <a href=\"http://splitsider.com/2013/10/simon-amstell-did-his-first-us-late-night-spot-on-letterman/\" title=\"\">debut standup set on The Late Show with David Letterman</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Best of our readers' comments</h2><p>Two of the world's most celebrated (and hated) comedians were under discussion this week. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/13/russell-brand-messiah-complex-review\" title=\"\">Stephanie Merritt's Observer review of Russell Brand's Messiah Complex show</a>, <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27901241\" title=\"\">Rickyee369</a> pays Brand a compliment with which it's hard to disagree:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>For a very naughty boy … Brand is very good. People may whine at his wankiness regarding meditation, Hinduism and general good love for fellow humanity, but I find him refreshing in an age where celebrity needs to remain empty to be constant. Much like the Beatles in the 60s, Brand is trying to find the light in a world of sleepwalking, passive night-dwelling insignificants … There is much to take with a shedful of salt, but much to admire in his attempts to educate those who first heard of him after he made an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/sachsgate\" title=\"\">ill-considered call to Manuel</a>.<br /><br />People wish this guy ill at their own risk … Do we really want vacuous and dire entertainers? Or is there room for someone who provokes thought, even if it is against some imagined grain?<br /><br />You'll lament the lanky toerag when he's gone …</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>And on Monday night I reviewed David Brent's debut stage show <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/15/ricky-gervais-david-brent-foregone-conclusion-review\" title=\"\">with his backing band, Foregone Conclusion</a> – and the comments below the line suggest Gervais will have to do better to win (back?) the hearts of Guardian readers. <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27952537\" title=\"\">Petsound</a> had this to say:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>Gervais still has Brent nailed perfectly, but it just isn't the same outside of the context of The Office. I used to really believe I was watching David Brent, whereas now I only see Gervais acting as David Brent. Maybe it's the fact that he's visibly aged, or the fact that at the end of The Office there was at least a glimmer of hope that Brent was evolving and changing, and now we're supposed to believe he's like this, 10 years later? He's not a living character any more, just an animated mummy. Either way, it's a bit like Paul McCartney writing songs that sound like the Beatles – on paper it ticks all the boxes, but it just lacks the magic that was there the first time around.<br /></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>And <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27946247\" title=\"\">Risibilis</a> followed up with this jab to Gervais's ribs:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote>Gervais' alter ego has always been a 'rock star'. After establishing a public profile via self-deprecating comic personas he's now relaunching his pop career. In doing this in the guise of it being a comedy turn he's given himself a safety net if the music isn't well-received. He's certainly brash – but brave? I think not so much or he'd not need to perform as a 'character'.</blockquote><p></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420038813|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|e89343c6a2d35dddd308abda1429ab606f17bb14 -->",

        "headline":"How to make the perfect nachos",
        "body":"<p>This crispy, cheesy snack has become a modern student classic. So, for today's lecture – what's the best way to make nachos?</p><p>A little titbit for the historians among you: although you won't find nachos on menus in Mexico, unlike the chimichanga they were at least created there. The story has it that, back in 1943, the ma&icirc;tre d' of a restaurant in Piedras Negras, faced with a lunch party of American wives from the army base at Eagle Pass and no chef, went into the kitchen and threw together an impromptu meal from what was to hand. The ladies were so impressed by his melange of tortilla chips, cheese and jalape&ntilde;o peppers that they took it home with them – &quot;nachos especiales&quot; features in a 1954 cookbook published by Eagle Pass's Church of the Redeemer, named after its creator, Ignacio &quot;Nacho&quot; Anaya.</p><p>Mexico can't be blamed for that orange slick of cheese sauce that soon replaced Anaya's Wisconsin cheddar, however – in the 70s, nachos became popular fare at sports games in the Lone Star state. To speed up the cooking process, a condensed cheese &quot;product&quot; (it doesn't meet the FDA qualifications for cheese) was developed that would remain obligingly warm and gooey for the duration of play. (A <a href=\"http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/food/2013/05/the-history-of-baseball-stadium-nachos/\" title=\"\">surprisingly fascinating history of its evolution is available here</a>.)</p><p>It was during my time at university that I first encountered this cheese sauce, at the cinema. Horrified fascination led to a purchase. Suffice to say, before I even begin, I can assure you these nachos will contain no cheese &quot;product&quot;. The other toppings, though, are definitely up for debate.</p><h2>The tortilla chips</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179425\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943287377/Rick-Baylesss-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Bayless\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Rick Bayless's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>I've decided not to use Doritos, mainly on the basis that I'd prefer the base of the dish to taste principally of toasted corn. Salt is acceptable; &quot;cool original&quot; flavour is a distraction.</p><p>Saveur magazine <a href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Nachos\" title=\"\">promises to whisk readers back to the &quot;joys of a simpler nacho</a>&quot; – as long as you don't mind frying your own chips. (Tortilla chips weren't widely available commercially until the nacho craze took off.) I cut corn tortillas, which can be found in the speciality food section of larger supermarkets, <a href=\"http://www.mexgrocer.co.uk/Salsa-Verde/\" title=\"\">as well as online</a>, into quarters and fry them in vegetable oil until golden and crisp. They taste pretty good, but despite draining and patting them dry, they're still greasier than the bought version. I must admit to preferring the packaged sort here.</p><p>Rick Bayless, <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2010-02-03/news/36841035_1_nachos-tortilla-chips-tostadas\" title=\"\">chef, restaurateur and author of a number of books on Mexican cooking</a>, suggests an alternative based on the tlayudas (chargrilled tortillas) of Oaxaca, using whole tortillas, brushed with chorizo fat and cooked over direct heat until crisp and slightly charred. They're delicious but unwieldy, and prone to collapsing during consumption: better as an individual snack than a sharing dish.</p><h2>The meat</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179428\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943237306/New-York-Timess-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"New York Times\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>The New York Times's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>Nachos certainly don't need meat – Ignacio's original version, which I suspect the Saveur recipe is based on, is still pretty tasty today, but most recipes more complex than emptying a jar of salsa on to some tortilla chips do seem to involve it.</p><p>At its most simple, in Bayless's dish, this is just fried fresh chorizo, crumbled on to the toasted tortillas, but I also try a quick chilli con carne with minced beef and beans, <a href=\"http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2013/05/loaded-nachos/\" title=\"\">as suggested by blogger turned Food Network star Ree Drummond, AKA the Pioneer Woman</a>; beer-braised <a href=\"http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/nachos-with-all-the-fixings\" title=\"\">pork carnitas from Bon Appetit magazine</a>; and spicy, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014510/short-rib-chili-nachos.html\" title=\"\">tomatoey beef short ribs from the New York Times</a>, slow-cooked until the meat falls from the bone and all over the tortilla chips.</p><p>I'd highly recommend trying the carnitas and ribs with rice or warm corn tortillas and salad, but I find these two wasted on the nachos. The ribs, in their cumin and coriander spiked sauce, are too intensely savoury with the salty chips (something I also find with the chorizo, which is good with Bayless's tortillas, but too much with chips), and too wet to boot. The tender strands of beery pulled pork, meanwhile, don't deserve to be dried out on a top of a load of crisps.</p><p>Best is the chilli: the smaller pieces of meat are easier to distribute on top of the chips and stand up to baking, remaining moist but not wet (you might want the bottom layer to soften a bit, but you don't want them to be soggy).</p><p>However, much as I'm loth to criticise an Oklahoma cowboy's wife on the subject of chilli, her recipe is a little bland for my taste – and I'd prefer to leave the tomato element for the salsa. That said, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/02/chilli-con-carne-recipe\" title=\"\">my own chilli recipe</a> (which obviously I consider perfect most of the time) is too smoky and wet for this particular dish, so I've made it dryer and slightly more subtle in flavour. I love the body and texture Drummond's beans give, though instead of pinto I've gone for smaller black beans, which are easier to keep on the chips.</p><h2>The sauces</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179426\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943124708/Ree-Drummonds-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"Ree Drummond\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Ree Drummond's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>The NYT suggests using a shop-bought salsa, preferably a tangy salsa verde (which can be easily ordered online, though I was surprised to spot it in my local Tesco), while Drummond and Bon Appetit make their own. I love Drummond's super-quick and wonderfully fresh-tasting pico de gallo, using fresh tomatoes, onion, jalape&ntilde;os, coriander and lime juice, though I'll be using spring onions rather than the yellow sort, which I find too harsh when raw. Once flavourful fresh tomatoes are a thing of the past, however, I'd suggest buying a good ready-made salsa, or giving a cooked tomato salsa, <a href=\"http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2010/01/restaurant-style-salsa/\" title=\"\">such as this recipe from Drummond herself</a>, a go.</p><p>Guacamole is also a popular accompaniment to nachos. I already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/aug/12/how-to-make-perfect-guacamole\" title=\"\">have a signature recipe</a>, but on this occasion, Bayless's version, thinned with water to give a drizzling consistency, proves more practical. I love the tart tomatillos he puts in too, but I have to concede these are even harder to get in the UK than a properly ripe avocado, so I've gone for the more traditional lime juice option – if you want to splash out on some online, however, do give his recipe a go.</p><h2>The cheese</h2><p>Obviously an important factor in any nacho recipe, but it's fairly tricky to get hold of the American cheese of choice, monterey jack, in this country. Frankly, I don't think it's worth the effort. Cheddar, as used by Ignacio himself, has a far better flavour and will melt almost as obligingly.</p><p>Bayless calls for queso fresco, a fresh, crumbly cheese, <a href=\"http://gringadairy.com\" title=\"\">now available online</a> and in London and Scotland, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/13/meet-the-producer-mexican-cheesemaker\" title=\"\">Kristen Schnepp of Peckham's Gringa Dairy</a>. It brings a nice, creamy lactic flavour to the dish. If you can't get it, feta, though saltier, has much the same texture. As neither cheese does much in the way of melting, I've decided to mix it into the guacamole – the flavour is excellent with the avocado, and this stops it tumbling off the chips.</p><h2>The toppings</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179427\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943205370/Bon-Appetits-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"Bon Appetit\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Bon Appetit's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>Saveur uses pickled jalape&ntilde;os in its recipe, which supply a pleasing tanginess, but even better is the crunch and subtle heat of Bon Appetit's sliced radishes. They also have the benefit of looking rather pink and pretty on a dish that has a tendency towards boring beigeness.</p><p>Many recipes also suggest topping the nachos with sour cream. I find the guacamole creamy enough, but if you'd really like &quot;nachos with all the fixings&quot;, as Bon Appetit describes their version, then by all means blob some on top (they suggest thinning it a little with water), along with some hot chilli sauce for good measure.</p><h2>The cooking method</h2><p>Drummond &quot;nukes&quot; the nachos in a microwave and the NYT grills them, but the best results, I find, come from baking, which heats the dish all the way through without making the base layer soft and chewy. Crisp and hot, cheesy and creamy, spicy and fresh, meaty yet full of beans – trust me, when your mum tearfully reminded you to eat a balanced diet while you were away at university, nachos are what she meant.</p><h2>The perfect nachos</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179429\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943369508/Felicity-Cloakes-perfect--010.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\" s=\"\" perfect=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>(Serves 4)</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>For the chile (or use 250g of your favourite recipe)</em></strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp oil</strong><br /><strong>1 onion, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; green pepper, finely diced</strong><br /><strong>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp flaked chipotle chilli or 1tsp smoked paprika</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp ground cumin</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp Mexican oregano (optional)</strong><br /><strong>250g beef mince</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp dark muscovado sugar</strong><br /><strong>200g cooked black or pinto beans</strong><br /><strong>70ml hot black coffee</strong></p><p><strong><em>For the salsa (or use a decent shop bought version, especially if ripe tomatoes aren't available)</em></strong><br /><strong>2-3 ripe tomatoes, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 spring onions, finely sliced</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; green jalape&ntilde;o chilli, seeded and finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>Small bunch of coriander, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>Juice of 1&frac12; limes</strong></p><p><strong><em>For the guacamole</em></strong><br /><strong>&frac12;-1 red chilli, deseeded (depending on heat)</strong><br /><strong>Small bunch of coriander</strong><br /><strong>1 large ripe avocado</strong><br /><strong>Juice of 1 lime</strong><br /><strong>Splash of water</strong><br /><strong>20g queso fresco or feta, crumbled</strong></p><p><strong><em>Plus</em></strong><br /><strong>200g salted corn tortilla chips</strong><br /><strong>100g cheddar, grated</strong><br /><strong>4-5 radishes or pickled jalape&ntilde;os, thinly sliced</strong></p><p>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and soften the chopped onion and pepper.

        "body":"<p>Dear Mister Cranston,</p><p>I've just finished a marathon of watching 'BREAKING BAD' – from episode one of the First Season – to the last eight episodes of the Sixth Season. A total of two weeks (addictive) viewing. I have never watched anything like it. Brilliant! Your performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen – ever.</p><p>I know there is so much smoke blowing and sickening bullshit in this business, and I've sort of lost belief in anything really. But this work of yours is spectacular – absolutely stunning. What is extraordinary, is the sheer power of everyone in the entire production. What was it? Five or six years in the making? How the producers (yourself being one of them), the writers, directors, cinematographers... every department – casting etc... managed to keep the discipline and control from beginning to the end is awesome.</p><p>From what started as a black comedy, descended into a labyrinth of blood, destruction and hell. It was like a great Jacobean, Shakespearian or Greek Tragedy.</p><p>If you ever get a chance to – would you pass on my admiration to everyone – Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Aaron Paul, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, Steven Michael Quezada – everyone – everyone gave master classes of performance... The list is endless.</p><p>Thank you. That kind of work/artistry is rare, and when, once in a while, it occurs, as in this epic work, it restores confidence. You and all the cast are the best actors I've ever seen. That may sound like a good lung full of smoke blowing. But it is not. It's almost midnight out here in Malibu, and I felt compelled to write this email.</p><p>Congratulations and my deepest respect. You are truly a great, great actor.</p><p>Best regards,<br />Tony Hopkins</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\">Breaking Bad: full coverage<br /></a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/23/anthony-hopkins-composing-music\">Anthony Hopkins interviewed last year</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420223164|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|4b4a133fecdfbe19fe1e8fa6345ca2f5b2e31c8d -->",

        "headline":"The fight against obesity starts in the head, not in the stomach",
        "body":"<p>Having your pot belly jiggled at any age isn't nice. The doctor (I remember your name, lady – I've not forgotten) who decided mine needed wobbling when I was 16 was rather misguided. No – actually she was tremendously insensitive. Her pinching of my belly fat combined with the question \"when are you going to get rid of this?\" sent me straight home to a packet of salt and vinegar Hula Hoops. After a horrible medical appointment, I indulged in a beautiful, fatty, carb jewellery fest that adorned every finger. I swallowed it fast in an act of fat teenage rebellion.</p><p>The talking-tough approach never worked with me. Over the years various medical professionals tried different techniques to tackle my obesity. There was the slip-it-in-at-the-end-of-the-appointment ploy: \"Have you considered losing a bit of weight?\" Nah, bye! There was the blaming-an-unrelated-medical-condition-on-your-weight tactic, in which you would go in with a sore throat and somehow your weight becomes the issue instead. On one occasion tonsillitis turned out to be a magnificent slimming technique until I discovered 99 flake cornets were quite soothing. However the subject of my weight was tackled by doctors, their manner was often rather aggressive, with a perceptible impatience and distaste.</p><p>The new National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/16/dont-blame-patients-overweight-doctors-told\" title=\"\">doctors must treat obese patients with respect</a> is therefore very welcome. I don't want anyone else to go through having their fat wobbled. Nice's realisation that programmes run by Weight Watchers and Slimming World are not a \"magic bullet\" is commendable too. A female relative has been alternating between both groups for more than a year because the NHS pays for it. Her weight loss from these sessions has been nil. As she says, though, it's a \"great little social club and good to get out\".</p><p>Our obesity problem has gone way beyond the remit of most GPs. As Nice has realised, the important issues in any weight-loss journey are the individual's desire to lose weight and the reason why they are obese in the first place. In my experience this often involves deep-rooted psychological factors, which mean food is an emotional panacea. In many cases you have to address what's going on in the person's head long before you can tackle what is happening to their body.</p><p>Every doctor should have an individual approach for each patient. This softly, softly approach won't work with everyone: a friend lost five stone after being told he would never see his son get married. That would have been way too harsh for many, but the medical profession is caught on the horns of a big fat problem: what will motivate others will send others straight to an entire tub of Häagen Dazs.</p><p>We have to stop seeing doctors as the solution to what happens on our scales and simply as people who can provide a range of services that we can take advantage of – and that for many has to include psychiatric intervention. For others it's as simple as stop making excuses, eat less and move more. As adults our weight is our personal responsibility. We have to work out what we need with the help of the medical profession and not expect them to have any silver bullet – delivered in a soft or more brutal way.</p><p>What partly worked for me was a Sri Lankan gynaecologist who very gently suggested that losing some weight may help me to resume a normal menstrual cycle. He asked me what exercise I enjoyed doing – I said walking with the personal stereo in fields pretending I was in pop videos – and he told me to do it more. At 41 I still do this and it still works. My weight goes up and down – but that's my problem. As it is yours.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420238775|2013-10-17T15:37:00Z|6886e1537fc635f65bc3b5dca2a4079c2de25f62 -->",
