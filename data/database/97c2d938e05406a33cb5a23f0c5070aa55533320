        "headline":"NFL Talkboard: Week Seven",
        "body":"<p>As if we did not do enough for you already here on the NFL Talkboard, this week we might just have found one lucky reader the job of their dreams. \"Have you played pro football? College ball? Highschool? Pee-wee? Have you played Madden before? Do you sort of kind of know some of the rules of football?\" If the answer to any of these questions is 'yes', or even perhaps 'no', then <a href=\"http://cleveland.craigslist.org/evg/4129126670.html\">according to this Craigslist post</a> you might be eligible to become the next quarterback of the Cleveland Browns.  </p><p>Failing that, you will just have to get your kicks right here with the rest of us, playing the Pick Six competition. Last week, <strong>FredS </strong>became the latest player to experience the joy of getting all six predictions correct. I trust you will all join me in offering hearty congratulations. </p><p>Before we get onto this week's picks, allow me to sidetrack you briefly by pointing out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/17/kansas-city-chiefs-undefeated-end\">this fine blog by my colleague Harry J Enten – who argues that we should not be fooled by the Chiefs' fast start to the season</a>. Be sure to check back again on Sunday, too, for our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/nfl-clockwatch-week-six-live\">NFL Clockwatch live blog</a> – providing live text updates on all the 1pm ET games – and then on Tuesday for our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/nfl-five-things-learned\">Five Things We Learned</a> look back over the weekend. </p><p>For now, though, time to get picking: </p><h2>Cincinnati Bengals @ Detroit Lions (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</h2><p>\"If there is an NFC equivalent to the Bengals,\" <a href=\"http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20131015/SPT02/310150152/Bengals-Lions-First-look?odyssey=mod%7Cnewswell%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE%7Cp\">wrote Cincinnati.com's Joe Reedy this week</a>, \"[then] it is the Lions.\" Both teams have a long and not-so-proud history of underachievement. Detroit have won just a single playoff game since 1957; the Bengals have done only marginally better, with five postseason victories since they were founded in 1968. But both teams boast 4-2 records going into this match-up, and Cincinnati sit top of the AFC North. The Bengals' defense is giving up a stingy 18.5 points per game, while their offense finally seemed to kick into gear last week, with Andy Dalton throwing for 337 yards and three touchdowns against Buffalo. But the Lions should have Calvin Johnson back at close to full speed. Even with him severely limited last Sunday, they still managed to put 31 points on a Browns defense that had surrendered just six when it faced Cincinnati. </p><p><strong>Lions to win</strong></p><h2>Chicago Bears @ Washington (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</h2><p>Not since 1998 have Washington lost all of their first three home games to start a season. Not since 2003 have they lost to the Chicago Bears. And yet, on paper, they look like the underdogs here - with just a single win to show for their season so far, compared to Chicago's four. Curiously, Washington have actually been quite productive on offense - their 399.2 yards per game ranking fourth in the league - but they consistently fail to convert such gains into points on the board. Chicago, by contrast, are putting up 28.7 points per game despite middle-of-the-pack offensive output. Their +7 turnover differential has been crucial, and I expect them to generate at least a couple of takeaways here.</p><p><strong>Bears to win</strong></p><h2>Dallas Cowboys @ Philadelphia Eagles (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</h2><p>At time of writing, it appears that Nick Foles will start at quarterback for Philadelphia again this Sunday. That worked out okay last weekend, when the backup threw for 296 yards and three touchdowns – as well as running in another – during his team's win over Tampa Bay. A further victory over division rivals Dallas might just be enough to win him the full-time starting role. Standing in Foles's favour is the fact that the Cowboys are likely to be without starting running back DeMarco Murray. Working against him is the fact that the Eagles have lost all of their last eight home games. Nevertheless, I'm taking Philly.</p><p><strong>Eagles to win</strong></p><h2>Baltimore Ravens @ Pittsburgh Steelers (Sunday 4.25pm ET/9.25pm BST)</h2><p>The Steelers are all about business these days, after head coach Mike Tomlin banned not only games in the locker room but also somersaults to celebrate a touchdown. The former story was, in truth, a little overblown – veteran players had already prohibited team-mates with less than four years' experience from partaking in table tennis, pool, and the rest, so Tomlin was really just acting to head off a potential rift between the two groups. The mood around his team was threatening to turn ugly, but can only have been helped by getting a first win of the season last weekend. Now Pittsburgh need a second if they are to keep their slim playoff hopes alive. Baltimore have been stuttering lately, with two defeats in their last three games and a running game that is producing just 2.8 yards per carry. Nevertheless, I think the Super Bowl champs remain the better team.</p><p><strong>Ravens to win</strong></p><h2>Denver Broncos @ Indianapolis Colts (Sunday 8.30pm ET/ Monday 1.30am BST)</h2><p>Peyton Manning returns to Indianapolis for the first time since he was released to make room for Andrew Luck. This was always going to be a fascinating confrontation between the past and future of a franchise, but it has been lent even more spice by the Colts owner Jim Irsay, who suggested on Tuesday that his team had underachieved by winning just a single Super Bowl with Manning under center. In truth his remarks were never really aimed at the quarterback so much as they were at the former general manager Bill Polian – a fact that Irsay <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JimIrsay/statuses/390496832625065984\">later clarified by tweeting</a>: \"My comments meant if we gave Peyton better SP Teams n Def, we would have won more than 1 Sup/Bowl, instead of asking Peyton 2 do too much\". The Colts intend to honour Manning on Sunday with a pre-game tribute, but they will hope that their fifth-ranked pass defense shows rather less deference.  Indianapolis have given up just 205.7 passing yards per game thus far, and Denver could be without both starting offensive tackles – Ryan Clady having been placed on injured reserve, while Orlando Franklin is doubtful due to a knee injury. Even so, I find it hard to pick against Manning et al. </p><p><strong>Broncos to win</strong></p><h2>Minnesota Vikings @ New York Giants (Monday 8.40pm ET/Tuesday 1.40am BST)</h2><p>Less than a fortnight after signing with the team, Josh Freeman has been named as the Vikings' starting quarterback to face New York. That comes as no great surprise after Matt Cassel's poor showing against Carolina, but you still have to wonder how much of the playbook Freeman can have properly digested in such a short space of time. Indeed, this has the makings of a pretty hideous quarterbacking match-up – the Giants' Eli Manning has thrown 15 interceptions so far this season, and has a passer rating of 64.0. Unsurprisingly, given that they have just one win between them, there is not a lot to like about either of these teams right now. But someone has to win … right? </p><p><strong>Giants to win</strong></p><h2>And the rest</h2><p>Here are the rest of this week's games. These are not included in the Pick Six, but feel free to post your winners for these as well. If you do so then please keep them separate from your Pick Six predictions, as it will make life a lot easier when tallying up your scores.</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong><br />1pm ET/6pm BST<br />Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Atlanta Falcons<br />Buffalo Bills @ Miami Dolphins<br />New England Patriots @ New York Jets<br />St Louis Rams @ Carolina Panthers<br />San Diego Chargers @ Jacksonville Jaguars<br />4.05pm ET/9.05pm BST <br />San Francisco 49ers @ Tennessee Titans<br />4.25pm ET/9.25pm BST<br />Cleveland Browns @ Green Bay Packers<br />Houston Texans @ Kansas City Chiefs</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420283848|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|201ceb936c4a13a61dc883791fe0e5fdb25990bf -->",

If we do nothing when we know there's a problem, then I could see that type of lawsuit occurring.</p><p>\"We know this is a problem and it's very clear that the information is not getting out correctly to coaches and particularly to kids when we have an obligation to inform them of the dangers.\"</p><p>The Rugby Football Union's head of medicine, Dr Simon Kemp, insists there is no proven association between head trauma and dementia but Grey disagrees.</p><p>\"Rubbish. We have very good evidence of the link between concussion and dementia,\" Dr Grey said. \"'Scientifically proven':  that was the phrase used to deny the link between cigarettes and cancer. It's an easy thing to say.</p><p>\"Have we scientifically proved it? There is very good evidence now that multiple concussions can lead to premature ageing and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. That danger is very real.\"</p><p>One of the reasons given why rugby will avoid the concussion-related problems suffered in American football and ice hockey is that helmeted sports lead to a different type of impact.</p><p>Grey, whose study will focus on second impact syndrome, views the distinction as irrelevant. \"The collisions are different but it doesn't take very much impact to shake the brain and cause a concussion. It doesn't take a huge hit,\" he said.</p><p>While Grey agrees with the RFU's position that children should be encouraged to play sport, including rugby, to combat the \"growing obesity epidemic in this country\", he cites an urgent need for greater education over concussion across all levels of the game.</p><p>Successive concussions have the potential to cause the greatest damage and his two-year study, which will examine athletes across a variety of sports, hopes to establish biomarkers to inform better when it is healthy to return to play.</p><p>\"Second-concussion syndrome is a concept where a player gets a concussion within a certain period of time when the brain is in a state of hyperactivity,\" Dr Grey said.</p><p>\"If the player gets another concussion while that activity is going on, the symptoms or result of that second concussion can be as severe as a very, very severe blow to the head and can lead to death.</p><p>\"We're not educating coaches well enough as to how much players are at risk if they play with a concussion.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420276506|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|9072a5ec79a073d317cab76e26e078a160f644dc -->",

        "headline":"Kansas City Chiefs are 6-0, but their luck is about to run out",
        "body":"<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are the biggest (positive) surprise of this still (relatively) young NFL season. Led by new head coach Andy Reid, the Arrowhead natives are 6-0 and have only won one game by less than two scores. They are almost certainly heading towards the playoffs on the strength of their defense. Yet, the Chiefs may end up packing their bags earlier than you might think. </p><p>Why?</p><h2>1. The Chiefs offense is a big ball of meh</h2><p>No team is going to be the best in every facet of the game. The Broncos defense leaves much to be desired. Yet, the Chiefs offense is really something else, which could come back to haunt them. </p><p>Quarterback Alex Smith ranks 22nd in the league for <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/passing/sort/quarterbackRating\">passer rating</a>. He is averaging 6.16 yards per attempt, which is worst in the league for starting quarterbacks. He's tied for eighth for the most sacks. </p><p>Running back Jamaal Charles is averaging only 4.2 yards <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/rushing/sort/yardsPerRushAttempt\">per rushing attempt</a>–good enough for only 20th in the league. Advanced NFL Stats says that Charles is 60th for all running backs in win probability added for every play he's directly involved in. </p><p>The Chiefs simply have no good or great receivers statistically speaking. The top pass catcher for the Chiefs, Donnie Avery, ranks 51st in <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/receiving/sort/receivingYards/qualified/false\">receiving yards</a> with only 310. No Chiefs receiver has more than two touchdown receptions. </p><p>Overall, Advanced NFL Stats rates the Chiefs offense as 30th in <a href=\"http://www.advancednflstats.com/2013/10/team-efficiency-rankings-week-6.html\">offensive efficiency</a>. </p><h2>2. The Chiefs haven't been playing tough opponents</h2><p>This is actually true of the Broncos and Seahawks as well, but look at who the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs have played</a>. They beat the Giants and Jaguars, who are terrible. The took down the Cowboys, Eagles, Raiders, and Titans, who are at best .500 teams. The only one of these going down in the record books is the Jaguars – and that is for awfulness. </p><p>Taking a more advanced statistical look, we can look at Football Outsiders' Defense-adjusted Over Average (DVOA). This breaks down every NFL play and compares teams against a league baseline average. By this measure, the Chiefs have the 31st <a href=\"http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff\">hardest schedule to this point</a>. </p><p>If they had a more even schedule, they'd probably have at least one loss already.</p><h2>3. The Chiefs will start playing tough opponents </h2><p>DVOA suggests that the Chiefs' luck may run out. They are expected to have the seventh most difficult schedule the rest of the season. They have to play the Broncos (more on that below) and a decent Chargers team twice, the Colts, and an underrated Bills team that plays pretty well at home. </p><p>The chance that the Chiefs can stay near perfect is pretty slim. Football Outsiders has them going only 6-4 the rest of the season. </p><h2>4. The Broncos and homefield</h2><p>There's room for more than one great team in the NFL. The problem is there really isn't room for two great teams in the same division. The Chiefs and Broncos both play in the AFC West. The Broncos, by most measures, including <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/standings\">point differential</a> and advanced stat team efficiency ratings from both <a href=\"http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff\">Football Outsiders</a> and <a href=\"http://www.advancednflstats.com/2013/10/team-efficiency-rankings-week-6.html\">Advanced NFL Stats</a>, look like the better team. </p><p>That's an issue for Chiefs, because they have to play the Broncos twice. The Broncos also have the easier remaining schedule. That would suggest that the Broncos are more likely to end up with the better record. </p><p>Thus, the Chiefs are probably going to end up with the fifth spot in the AFC's playoff brackets. That means they'll have to win three times on the road to make the Super Bowl. That's not impossible, though the odds are against it. </p><p>The home team has won a little more than <a href=\"http://www.fieldgulls.com/2013/1/4/3780668/nfl-playoffs-seahawks-vs-redskins-homefield-advantage\">60% of its games in the playoffs</a> since 2002. Three teams have won three road games to win the Super Bowl <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/visuals/post/_/id/10921/graphic-which-nfl-playoff-seeds-succeed\">over the past decade and none before that</a>. This suggests that the homefield advantage may be waning, but it still exists. </p><p>You can add <a href=\"http://www.twominutewarning.com/hfa.htm\">2-3 points to the home team's margin</a> than what would you expect on a neutral field. In a league where games are often won by a few points, this can make all the difference in the world. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Chiefs are a good football team. I'm not sure, however, they are good as their 6-0 record indicates. Their offense and strength of opponent has been weak. A tougher upcoming schedule and the looming Broncos in the same division argues for a team that will have a more difficult time moving forward.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420264962|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|56965a4021f8221d73105a167ec18535cf1bb302 -->",

        "headline":"Brady needs the Patriots to perform miracles and other things we learned",
        "body":"<h2>The Patriots simply find ways to win</h2><p>Tom Brady did what great quarterbacks do, leading his team down the field one last time<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/14/tom-brady-drive-patriots-saints\"> to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat</a>. His New England Patriots had trailed the unbeaten Saints 27-23 with 73 seconds remaining, when they got the ball back at their own 30-yard line. Despite having no time-outs at his disposal, Brady orchestrated an eight-play possession that culminated in a touchdown pass to Kenbrell Thomkins in the back corner of the end zone. </p><p>This was the 38th game-winning drive of the quarterback's career, and one that he will not forget in a hurry. <a href=\"http://mmqb.si.com/2013/10/14/tom-brady-patriots-saints-monday-morning-quarterback/\">Brady told Sports Illustrated's Peter King</a> that: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Last night was as memorable a regular-season game as I remember for our team.\"</p></blockquote><p>His use of the 't' word was surely no mistake. Brady went on to credit a number of his team-mates – noting everything from the precise route-running of the newly-acquired receiver Austin Collie to the contributions made by the injured tight end Rob Gronkowski as a scout team player during practice. He praised \"the mental toughness, the work ethic and discipline of all 53 guys on the roster.\"</p><p>And he was right to do so. Because reducing this victory to just another Brady miracle, as many media outlets did, would be to grossly miss the point. </p><p>This was a group effort first and foremost from a team that had been hit hard by injuries – deprived not only of Gronkowski, but also defensive linemen Vince Wilfork and Tommy Kelly. The Patriots would also lose starting cornerback Aqib Talib, receiver Danny Amendola, and linebacker Jerod Mayo before the end of Sunday's game.</p><p>And yet their replacements continued to get the job done. Talib had played brilliantly, shutting down the supposedly uncontainable Jimmy Graham, but even after the Patriots player left with a hip injury, the Saints tight end still never caught a pass. Collie, sent in after Amendola suffered a brutal blow to the head, caught two passes on the team's game-winning drive. </p><p>Brady, indeed, only got that last opportunity to win the game because New England's defense had kept the Saints without a first down on each of their final two possessions. Had they not done so, then this might have been remembered as a great choke act by the Patriots quarterback – who threw a bad interception with 2min 16sec left to play. On the previous drive he had slung three consecutive incompletions (albeit two were bad drops by his intended receivers) as New England turned the ball over on downs.</p><p>Such details do not detract from the brilliance of Brady, who has pulled out such wins enough times in his career to prove that this was no mere fluke. But they are still crucial to explaining how a team with so many apparent issues now sits level with the highly-touted Saints with a record of 5-1. </p><h2>Not much separates first from worst</h2><p>Every Sunday on NFL Network, the GameDay Morning crew – Rich Eisen, Marshall Faulk, Kurt Warner, Steve Mariucci, Warren Sapp and Michael Irvin – make their predictions for the upcoming games. To accompany their picks, a graphic is displayed for each match-up showing which team got the most backing among voters on NFL.com. </p><p>When the numbers popped up for the Denver-Jacksonville game this weekend, the whole studio erupted with laughter. A good 99% of voters had picked the Broncos to win, and yet the panel was incredulous that the figure had not been higher. Could even one per cent of people really believe that the winless Jags stood a chance against undefeated Denver?</p><p>The Las Vegas bookies certainly did not think so. They made the Jaguars a 28-point underdog on Sunday – affording them <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/sports/football/with-a-huge-line-to-cover-the-jaguars-can-still-hope.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0\">what is believed to have been the joint-biggest betting handicap in NFL history</a>. </p><p>Of course, the sceptics were right; Jacksonville did not win in Denver. But they certainly made life harder for the Broncos than most people had expected. At half-time the Jags trailed just 14-12, a scoreline that <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/hochman/ci_24307717/boos-by-broncos-fans-lead-albeit-small-at\">drew loud boos from a section of the home support at Mile High Stadium</a>.</p><p>The worst team in the NFL forced three turnovers from Peyton Manning, a man who some people consider to be the best quarterback of all-time. He insisted afterwards that the Jaguars' impressive effort had not caught him off guard. \"It's not that easy to win football games,\" said Manning. \"I learned early to never take winning for granted.\"</p><p>Indeed, reminders of the NFL's enduring parity were all around us this weekend, from the Cardinals putting up a ferocious fight in San Francisco through to St Louis – a nine-point underdog – humiliating the Texans 38-13 in their own back yard. \"WHAT THE HECK JUST HAPPENED?\" <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/bryan-burwell/burwell-fisher-gets-his-players-to-respond/article_95468f66-9f1c-5c4d-b636-15735d0c5327.htm\">demanded Bryan Burwell in his column on Monday for the St Louis Post-Dispatch</a>. </p><p>And then there are the Kansas City Chiefs, Denver's division rivals and the only other unbeaten team left in the NFL. Last season they went 2-14; this year they are already 6-0. On Sunday they ended a six-game home losing streak against the Oakland Raiders, notching a scarcely credible 10 sacks as they did so. </p><p>It is a mark of how quickly things can change in this league that such success no longer even comes as a surprise. </p><h2>A loud crowd is not always a good crowd</h2><p>Less than a month after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/17/seattle-seahawks-nfl-crowd-noise-record\">Seahawks fans at CenturyLink Field set a new world record for the loudest roar ever heard inside a sports stadium</a>, their title has been stolen away from them. A raucous crowd at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday combined to produce a volume of 137.5 decibels during the Chiefs' win over Oakland. That is 0.9 decibels more than Seattle's backers managed during their defeat of San Francisco in week two.</p><p>Curiously, the new record was set in the dying moments of Sunday's game, when the Chiefs' victory was no longer in doubt and the stadium was beginning to empty. \"I think the fans saw something on the [scoreboard] and ran over,\" <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/2013/10/13/4551801/loud-arrowhead-crowd-sets-record.html\">said the Guinness Book of Records' adjudicator, Philip Robertson</a>. \"[They] descended and began cheering and chanting, screaming. It was that high-pitched scream that pushed them over the edge.\" </p><p>Not every team, though, can count on such enthusiastic backing. The Broncos, as already mentioned, were booed despite leading Jacksonville at the half, while a sizeable portion of the crowd at Gillette Stadium had given up and left long before Brady and the Patriots rallied to pull off their comeback win over the Saints.</p><p>More distasteful was the behaviour of the vocal minority of Houston Texans fans who cheered when their starting quarterback, Matt Schaub, went down injured in the third quarter of their defeat to St Louis. Their behaviour was condemned as \"barbaric\" by linebacker Brian Cushing, while cornerback Johnathan Joseph went further, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulyGRadio/status/389492526022811648\">telling Houston's Sports Radio 610</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"They gonna do that, don't show the f*ck up\".</p></blockquote><p>Over in San Francisco, meanwhile, the 49ers' CEO Jed York was similarly unhappy with his team's fans for starting a wave while the Arizona defensive lineman Calais Campbell lay motionless on the field receiving treatment. </p><p><em></em></p><p>We have heard such things before, of course, and probably much worse besides. But it was certainly striking to pull up the league's own website on Monday and find a prominent story describing this as an <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000262854/article/an-embarrassing-day-for-nfl-fans\">\"embarrassing day for NFL fans\"</a>.  </p><h2>Fantasy Football Thoughts</h2><p>If the Jaguars were able to make life difficult for the Broncos on Sunday, it was in large part because of the return from suspension of wide receiver Justin Blackmon, who hauled in 14 passes for 190 yards. As much as I would like to take credit for advising you to pick Blackmon up off the waiver wire last week, I am quite aware that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/08/matt-schaub-eli-manning-nfl-interceptions\">I also suggested</a> that you take Alshon Jeffery (one reception, 27 yards) first if available. </p><p>Nevertheless, Blackmon's big week is a reminder that even this deep into a season, there are still Fantasy gems to be found. Here are three stand-out performers from week six, plus one player who might be worth adding to your roster pronto. </p><p><strong>Star performers</strong></p><p>1) Vernon Davis took a while to establish any kind of chemistry with Colin Kaepernick in San Francisco, his reception tally dropping off sharply last season after the quarterback replaced Alex Smith under center. But those two seem to be doing just fine these days, and the tight end enjoying a career day against Arizona as he reeled in eight catches for 180 yards plus two touchdowns. Davis has six scoring receptions on the season, and four in the last three weeks. </p><p>2) A week after giving up three interceptions during his team's defeat to Arizona, Cam Newton rebounded with three touchdown passes in a 35-10 rout of Minnesota. It was a near flawless performance from the Panthers quarterback, who completed 20 of 26 passes for 242 yards, and also rushed for 30 yards and a score. If it is tempting to ask why he doesn't play like this every week, then we must also acknowledge the complicity of a shabby Vikings secondary. </p><p>3) Davis was not the only tight end to stand out in week six. Detroit's Joseph Fauria stole the show with three scoring receptions in his team's defeat of the Browns, but <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000261685/Week-6-Joseph-Fauria-highlights\">even more so with the dance moves he showed off afterwards</a>. Fauria has seven receptions so far this season, and five of them have been for touchdowns. </p><p><strong>Worth picking up</strong></p><p>1) Chip Kelly said before the weekend that Michael Vick could lose his job as the Eagles' starting quarterback \"if someone comes in and puts on an unbelievable show\" while he is out injured. Nick Foles did just that on Sunday, completing 22 of 31 passes for 296 yards and three touchdowns, as well as running one in himself. Asked afterwards whether Foles had done enough to win the job outright, Kelly was evasive. But you have to imagine that he is at least in with a shot, and even if you do not need a quarterback yourself, the player could become a very valuable trading commodity if he were to take over full-time.  </p><h2>Quick outs</h2><p>• Also catching the eye with his dance moves this week: Patriots defensive end Chandler Jones – who <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/pee-wee-herman-congratulates-chandler-jones-sack-dance-180734495--nfl.html\">reprised Pee-wee Herman's 'Tequila' dance from the 1985 movie Pee-wee's big adventure</a>. He was rewarded with a message from the fictional character himself, with Herman (or, presumably, Paul Reubens, the actor who plays him), tweeting: </p><p><em></em> </p><p>• The NFL played host to another contest between coaching siblings on Monday night, when Chuck Pagano's Indianapolis Colts travelled to San Diego to face the Chargers – who employ his younger brother John as their defensive co-ordinator. A fascinating match-up it was, too, as John's defense stifled Andrew Luck and the rest of the Colts' offense en route to a 19-9 victory. As well as being held without a touchdown, the Colts were restricted to just 267 yards of total offense on the night.</p><p>• He might not have felt much like celebrating, but Colts wide receiver Reggie Wayne did make the 1,000th reception of his career against San Diego – a feat that only eight other players have ever achieved. </p><p>• Gif of the week: <a href=\"http://cdn.ksk.uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bradyfive.gif\">Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman leaves Tom Brady hanging</a>. </p><p>• Runner-up: <a href=\"http://d3j5vwomefv46c.cloudfront.net/photos/large/815021264.gif?1381707575\">Saints defensive co-ordinator Rob Ryan reacts to Brady's game-winning heroics</a>. </p><p>• NBC's Bob Costas has stirred up some powerful national debates with his pieces to camera during the half-time intervals of Sunday Night Football broadcasts in recent years – perhaps most notably when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/dec/03/jovan-belcher-killings-concussions-gun-control\">he broached the subject of gun control in the wake of the Jovan Belcher killings in Kansas City last year</a>. This weekend he broached another emotive topic – that of Washington's use of 'Redskins' for their team name.  You can read a full transcript of Costa's comments by following this link, but his closing remark went as follows: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It's an insult, a slur, no matter how benign the present-day intent. It is fair to say that for a long time now, and certainly in 2013, no offense has been intended. But, if you take a step back, isn't it clear to see how offense \"might\" legitimately be taken?</p></blockquote><p><br />• If concerns about the long-term impact of head trauma – heightened even further in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/09/pbs-league-of-denial-nfl-gladiators\">PBS's damning League of Denial documentary last week</a> – were not enough to be getting on with, the NFL must now also contend with growing anxiety over other kinds of injuries. The Green Bay wide receiver Randall Cobb is expected to miss at least the next six weeks after fracturing his leg during a tackle by Baltimore's Matt Elam, who was subsequently accused of making a dirty hit by Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Elam had struck his opponent in the knees, when Rodgers argued that the defender could easily have aimed for Cobb's chest or stomach. But is it really reasonable to ask defenders moving at full speed to avoid colliding with both an opponent's head and legs when making a tackle? Ravens head coach John Harbaugh thought not, noting that: \"To say that it could have been [more] artistically palatable is pretty hard for me to understand.\" But if the knee and leg issues start to stack up for high-profile and highly-paid offensive players, you can bet that this issue will receive plenty more attention in the weeks and months ahead. <br /> <br />• Adrian Peterson chose to play this Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/12/adrian-peterson-vikings-son-dies-child-abuse\">two days after the death of his two-year-old son</a>. A good deal of misinformation was published last week regarding the boy who had passed away, with several outlets mistakenly identifying him as another one of Peterson's children – who was in fact alive and well. The player himself spoke only very briefly on the subject, and seems understandably inclined to maintain his privacy on this issue. \"I don't ask people to understand my mindset and how I think,\" Peterson said after the Vikings' defeat. \"Anything that's bad, I try to take good from it. That's the way I approach life in all situations. I never thought about not playing. It was all about just going out there and having the strength to play and having the strength to get through and help my team. That was my focus.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419974626|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|d27d16a67e6875d6304c63d3785960389abaa987 -->",

Brady's 17-yard touchdown pass to Kenbrell Thompkins with five seconds left capped the 70-yard drive in which the Patriots marched downfield.

The Patriots (5-1) survived an interception by Keenan Lewis on their first snap after Garrett Hartley's 39-yard field goal made it 27-23.</p><p>Later at Arlington, Texas, Dwayne Harris returned a punt 86 yards for a touchdown and set up another score with a 90-yard kickoff return as the <strong>Dallas Cowboys</strong> handed Robert Griffin III his first loss in his home state with a 31-16 victory over <strong>Washington</strong>. Tony Romo had just 170 yards passing a week after getting 506 in a wild 51-48 loss to Denver.</p><p>Aaron Rodgers threw a 64-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson and Mason Crosby kicked four field goals as the <strong>Green Bay Packers</strong> held on to beat the <strong>Baltimore Ravens</strong> 19-17. Eddie Lacy rushed for 120 yards to fuel the Packers' first road win of the season. Green Bay (3-2) took a 16-3 lead into the fourth quarter and was up 19-10 with four minutes left, but the Ravens (3-3) kept coming back.</p><p>Peyton Manning threw for two scores and Knowshon Moreno ran for three to lead the <strong>Denver Broncos</strong> to a tougher-than-expected 35-19 victory over the winless <strong>Jacksonville Jaguars</strong>. Manning finished 28 for 42 for 295 yards, but lost two fumbles and threw a 59-yard interception return by Paul Posluszny that pulled the Jaguars (0-6) within 14-12 at halftime.</p><p>Jamaal Charles ran for two touchdowns and the <strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong> defense harassed the <strong>Oakland Raiders</strong> quarterback Terrelle Pryor into throwing three second-half interceptions as the Chiefs remained unbeaten with a 24-7 win. Ben Roethlisberger threw a 55-yard touchdown pass to Emmanuel Sanders and Shaun Suisham kicked four field goals as the <strong>Pittsburgh Steelers</strong> downed the <strong>New York Jets</strong> 19-6, while Cam Newton threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score in the <strong>Florida Panthers</strong>' 35-10 win over the <strong>Minnesota Vikings</strong>.</p><p>In other games, the <strong>San Francisco 49ers</strong> beat the <strong>Arizona Cardinals</strong> 32-20, the <strong>St Louis Rams</strong> downed the <strong>Houston Texans</strong> 38-13, the <strong>Seattle Seahawks</strong> defeated the <strong>Tennessee Titans</strong> 20-13, the <strong>Cincinnati Bengals</strong> edged the <strong>Buffalo Bills</strong> 27-24 in overtime, the <strong>Detroit Lions</strong> were 31-17 winners over the <strong>Cleveland Browns</strong> and the <strong>Philadelphia Eagles</strong> overcame the <strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong> 31-20.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419920234|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|fae75d39e0eb3ef93a81e05f090b420580bb5636 -->",

This team has a reliable running game , and on paper a very strong defense, too, so how are they contriving to lose all these games? Turnovers were a key factor once again, but this time it wasn’t Schaub causing them. At a certain point, you do have to question the coaching.</p> <p>- I’ve already mentioned it a couple of times in this blog, but Chip Kelly has some real questions to answer now when it comes to the identity of his starting quarterback. Nick Foles’s performance today made him hard to drop.</p> <p>- The Chiefs are 6-0 for the first time since 2003. Are we any closer to knowing whether this team is a contender? Perhaps not. The Raiders are not exactly an offensive juggernaut, and people will continue to ask how Alex Smith et al would cope in a shoot-out with a truly explosive offense. But the Raiders are not an awful team with Terrelle Pryor under center, and the Chiefs’ defense once again came up big. If nothing else, they have another monkey off their back after ending a run of six straight home defeats to the Raiders.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525b0452e4b00464758c063a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T21:36:51.371+01:00\">4.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fantasy update</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Who were the stars of those early games? Here are a few who stood out:</p> <p>- Cam Newton: 20 of 26 passes completed for 242 yards, 3 TDs; 9 carries for 30 yards, 1 TD</p> <p>- Nick Foles: 22 of 31 passes completed for 296 yards, 3 TDs; 3 carries for 2 yards, 1 TD</p> <p>- St Louis Rams defense/special teams: 2 TD, 2 INT, 2 fumbles recovered, 13 points allowed</p> <p>- Jamaal Charles: 22 carries for 78 yards, 2 TDs; 5 receptions for 50 yards</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525b024fe4b036d35b97e3d8\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T21:28:12.685+01:00\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final scores</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So, here’s how things finished in the 1pm ET kickoff games:</p> <p>Bengals 27-24 Bills (after OT)</p> <p>Lions 31-17 Browns</p> <p>Raiders 7-24 Chiefs</p> <p>Panthers 35-10 Vikings</p> <p>Steelers 19-6 Jets</p> <p>Eagles 31-20 Buccaneers</p> <p>Packers 19-17 Ravens</p> <p>Rams 38-13 Texans</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525b019ee4b0d9d00a7cb7d8\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T21:25:11.368+01:00\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal! Bengals beat Bills in OT – 27-24</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Mike Nugent converts from 43 yards to give Cincinnati the victory in Buffalo, denying Thad Lewis a victory in his first start, despite orchestrating a 14-point fourth quarter comeback to force overtime.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525b00dbe4b0d2382acc0668\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T21:21:55.552+01:00\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Lions 31-17 Browns</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A sad collapse for the Browns, who led 17-7 at half-time but gave up 24 unanswered points in the second half. Brandon Weeden played OK, but there will be plenty of fans pining for Brian Hoyer after this one.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525affece4b0d9d00a7cb7d7\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T21:17:56.040+01:00\">4.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Eagles 31-20 Buccaneers</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The quarterback controversy starts here. Nick Foles finishes with 296 yards passing and three touchdowns through the air – as well as one on the ground – as the Eagles win in Tampa Bay. Chip Kelly said that Foles could win the job outright if he played well enough, and that was a pretty good show.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525aff36e4b036d35b97e3d7\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T21:15:00.852+01:00\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">PICK SIX! Raiders 7-24 Chiefs</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Yeah, Oakland can kiss goodbye to that Arrowhead winning streak.

Lions 31-17 Browns</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Calvin Who? Detroit’s star receiver today has not been Megatron but instead the tight end Joseph Fauria, who pulls in his third touchdown of the day to surely put this game beyond Cleveland with just over two minutes left on the clock.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525afe30e4b036d35b97e3d5\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T21:10:36.315+01:00\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Packers 19-17 Ravens</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Green Bay leaves Baltimore with a win, Eddie Lacy turning the corner for a final first down before Aaron Rodgers kneels to end the game. This was not a great game for either offense, but the rookie running back’s 23 carries for 120 yards are a very encouraging sign for the Packers.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525afd67e4b0d2382acc0667\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T21:07:20.300+01:00\">4.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bengals and Bills going to overtime</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The score after four quarters is 24-24.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525afd3de4b036d35b97e3d4\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T21:06:30.796+01:00\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Steelers 19-6 Jets</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Steelers get their first turnovers of the season and, not coincidentally, also their first win.

Well, probably not. There is the Andy Reid factor in the big games, though he's been pretty good so far (only one appearance on 'Thank you for Not Coaching' at Grantland). There is also the KC choke in Arrowhead. The last times we put together a decent team we crashed out of the playoffs at home as better teams targeted our glaring weaknesses on defense- punished by the 2010 Ravens, outgunned by 2004 Manning.</p> <p>Perhaps more importantly, our offence needs to catch fire for us to do something in the post season. At the moment our defence is winning us games against mediocre teams, but to beat the best we'll need to put up some bigger numbers. At the moment we're losing to the Raiders having done nowt in possession, which will hopefully give everyone a reality check.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525aebd7e4b0d2382acc065a\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T19:52:15.525+01:00\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">TOUCHDOWN!

Officials, though, put two seconds back on the clock, and that turned out to be long enough for another Mason Crosby kick.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525ae92fe4b0d9d00a7cb7c1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T19:40:54.131+01:00\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fantasy update</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So, who have been the stand-out performers from that first half? More than one of them comes from that game in Tampa Bay:</p> <p>- Vincent Jackson: 4 receptions for 46 yards, 2 TDs</p> <p>- Nick Foles: 16 of 24 passes completed for 151 yards, 1 TD; also 1 TD rushing</p> <p>- AJ Green: 3 receptions for 80 yards, 1 TD</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525ae7d5e4b00464758c0621\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T19:35:10.172+01:00\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">At the half</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>OK, pretty much every game is now at the break.

Lions 7-17 Browns</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Billy Cundiff’s 40-yard kick gives the Browns what should be a nice lead at the half (there’s still eight seconds left to go before the break in Cleveland). But Mason Crosby just missed a chance to extend Green Bay’s advantage in Baltimore – where it remains Packers 3-0 Ravens. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525ae6bfe4b036d35b97e3c6\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T19:32:05.155+01:00\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">TOUCHDOWN! Eagles 14-17 Buccaneers</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Josh Freeman debacle might not have been handled well, but Tampa Bay’s rookie quarterback Mike Glennon is certainly vindicating Greg Schiano’s faith in him with a fine performance so far against the Eagles. He hooks up with Vincent Jackson in the end zone for the second time today, putting his team ahead at the break.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525ae603e4b00464758c0620\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T19:28:11.535+01:00\">2.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal!

Lions 7-14 Browns</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Brandon Weeden might have thrown an interception earlier, but he has otherwise done a pretty good job in resuming his role as starter for this team. He delivers a two-yard strike to Greg Little to put the Browns back in front just before the half in Cleveland. That’s 10 of 16 passes he has completed so far, for two touchdowns plus the one interception.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525ae342e4b0d2382acc0658\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T19:17:03.633+01:00\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goals!</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Houston once again fail to convert a long drive into a touchdown, but this time they do at least put points on the board with a 35-yard kick from Randy Bullock. <strong>Rams 17-6 Texans</strong>.

This is why the Chiefs still have a bit to go. I like the idea of Charles in the flat, but Smith is still a new guy under center doing what he can.”</p> <p>There’s an interesting debate here about whether defense really can still win championship in the ever-more high-schoring NFL. Personally I think it can still carry you a very long way, but of course you still need to do enough on offense too. The 49ers looked like a team that could have gone all the way with Smith under center last year, before Kaepernick took over, but his injury means we’ll never know.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525ae206e4b036d35b97e3c3\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T19:10:22.872+01:00\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">TOUCHDOWN!

They have lived in the shadow of division rivals Denver so far, so at what point do we start taking them seriously as contenders in their own right?</p> <p>&nbsp;2) Do those fans at Arrowhead have any chance of getting louder than the ones in Seattle?</p> <p>&nbsp;Send your answers to <a href=\"mailto:paolo.bandini.freelance@guardian.co.uk\">paolo.bandini.freelance@guardian.co.uk</a>, tweet them <a href=\"twitter.com/Paolo_Bandini\">@Paolo_Bandini</a> or post them in the comments section below.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525acfc9e4b036d35b97e3ba\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T17:53:18.691+01:00\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Peterson plays</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>We already knew that Adrian Peterson intended to play today despite the death of his two-year old son this week in horrific circumstances. The player is reported to have texted Laura Okmin of Fox Sports, explaining his decision thus: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My brother passed the night before the combine and I decided to go through with it. The same reason why I will play this week. You may ask why? God wants good to come from it ... We mourn and grieve but heaven had the baddest welcoming party for my son.

Here are a few key injury updates that may affect your team:</p> <p>- Rob Gronkowski is out again for New England, despite reports this week that he was close to a return. </p> <p>- Calvin Johnson is active for Detroit in Cleveland - although don't forget that he will be lining up against cornerback Joe Haden, who is having a pretty tremendous season shutting guys down so far. </p> <p>- Darren McFadden will play for Oakland in Kansas City. So will both of Rashad Jennings and Marcel Reece, however, meaning carries may be split between that trio. </p> <p>- Running back Zac Stacy is active for St Louis, and will presumably make his second consecutive start, thought it could be tough sledding for him and his team in Houston.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525aca93e4b036d35b97e3b9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T17:32:52.701+01:00\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pick Six competition</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Thirty minutes left to kickoff, and time for a quick reminder to anybody taking part in our Pick Six contest that you need to make your predictions for this week.

I had the very great pleasure of speaking to the team's linebacker Tamba Hali this week, talking to him about the team's perfect start but also a little bit about his own, remarkable story. Born in Liberia shortly before the country descended into civil war, he lived a fraught existence up to the age of 10, when he was whisked away to America. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/10/kansas-city-chiefs-linebacker-tamba-hali\">If you would like to know a little more about Hali's journey from there to NFL star, the interview is online right here</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525ac7bde4b036d35b97e3b7\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T17:19:23.523+01:00\">12.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Making noise</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Kansas City Chiefs will seek to maintain their perfect start to the season as they return home this afternoon. A win over Oakland would move them to 6-0 for the first time since 2003. Not even Andy Reid himself can have anticipated such a positive beginning for his new regime.</p> <p>But the Chiefs’ players aren’t the only ones with lofty goals on their minds at Arrowhead Stadium. Officials from the Guinness Book of World Records will also be present during today’s game, measuring sound levels to see if the team’s fans can break the record for the loudest roar ever generated by the crowd at a sports stadium.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/17/seattle-seahawks-nfl-crowd-noise-record\">existing record was set just four weeks ago by Seahawks fans at CenturyLink Field</a>. Can the folks in Kansas City really out-cheer the Twelfth Man in Seattle? I have my doubts –Arrowhead, after all, is an open bowl, lacking the noise reflecting benefits of their rivals’ stadium – but I don’t doubt that they will give it all they have got.</p> <p>What else is there to shout about today? Well, we have eight games in the 1pm ET time slot, including an intriguing match-up between Green Bay and the Super Bowl champion Ravens in Baltimore. Neither team has started quite as fast as they would have liked, and a potential shoot-out between Aaron Rodgers and Joe Flacco may have been dampened by heavy rain at M&amp;T Bank Stadium.</p> <p>Elsewhere, rookie quarterback Geno Smith seeks to engineer his fourth win for the Jets, while Matt Schaub does his level best not to throw a pick six, for once. Here’s the full list of today’s early games:</p> <p>Green Bay Packers @ Baltimore Ravens</p> <p>Cincinnati Bengals @ Buffalo Bills</p> <p>Detroit Lions @ Cleveland Browns</p> <p>St Louis Rams @ Houston Texans</p> <p>Oakland Raiders @ Kansas City Chiefs</p> <p>Carolina Panthers @ Minnesota Vikings</p> <p>Pittsburgh Steelers @ New York Jets</p> <p>Philadelphia Eagles @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-13T17:19:36.529+01:00\">at 12.19pm ET</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419836128|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|b2afd070ef5ced3503c03fa30b648d377030283d -->",

        "headline":"Kansas City Chiefs are 6-0, but their luck is about to run out",
        "body":"<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are the biggest (positive) surprise of this still (relatively) young NFL season. Led by new head coach Andy Reid, the Arrowhead natives are 6-0 and have only won one game by less than two scores. They are almost certainly heading towards the playoffs on the strength of their defense. Yet, the Chiefs may end up packing their bags earlier than you might think. </p><p>Why?</p><h2>1. The Chiefs offense is a big ball of meh</h2><p>No team is going to be the best in every facet of the game. The Broncos defense leaves much to be desired. Yet, the Chiefs offense is really something else, which could come back to haunt them. </p><p>Quarterback Alex Smith ranks 22nd in the league for <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/passing/sort/quarterbackRating\">passer rating</a>. He is averaging 6.16 yards per attempt, which is worst in the league for starting quarterbacks. He's tied for eighth for the most sacks. </p><p>Running back Jamaal Charles is averaging only 4.2 yards <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/rushing/sort/yardsPerRushAttempt\">per rushing attempt</a>–good enough for only 20th in the league. Advanced NFL Stats says that Charles is 60th for all running backs in win probability added for every play he's directly involved in. </p><p>The Chiefs simply have no good or great receivers statistically speaking. The top pass catcher for the Chiefs, Donnie Avery, ranks 51st in <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/receiving/sort/receivingYards/qualified/false\">receiving yards</a> with only 310. No Chiefs receiver has more than two touchdown receptions. </p><p>Overall, Advanced NFL Stats rates the Chiefs offense as 30th in <a href=\"http://www.advancednflstats.com/2013/10/team-efficiency-rankings-week-6.html\">offensive efficiency</a>. </p><h2>2. The Chiefs haven't been playing tough opponents</h2><p>This is actually true of the Broncos and Seahawks as well, but look at who the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs have played</a>. They beat the Giants and Jaguars, who are terrible. The took down the Cowboys, Eagles, Raiders, and Titans, who are at best .500 teams. The only one of these going down in the record books is the Jaguars – and that is for awfulness. </p><p>Taking a more advanced statistical look, we can look at Football Outsiders' Defense-adjusted Over Average (DVOA). This breaks down every NFL play and compares teams against a league baseline average. By this measure, the Chiefs have the 31st <a href=\"http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff\">hardest schedule to this point</a>. </p><p>If they had a more even schedule, they'd probably have at least one loss already.</p><h2>3. The Chiefs will start playing tough opponents </h2><p>DVOA suggests that the Chiefs' luck may run out. They are expected to have the seventh most difficult schedule the rest of the season. They have to play the Broncos (more on that below) and a decent Chargers team twice, the Colts, and an underrated Bills team that plays pretty well at home. </p><p>The chance that the Chiefs can stay near perfect is pretty slim. Football Outsiders has them going only 6-4 the rest of the season. </p><h2>4. The Broncos and homefield</h2><p>There's room for more than one great team in the NFL. The problem is there really isn't room for two great teams in the same division. The Chiefs and Broncos both play in the AFC West. The Broncos, by most measures, including <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/standings\">point differential</a> and advanced stat team efficiency ratings from both <a href=\"http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff\">Football Outsiders</a> and <a href=\"http://www.advancednflstats.com/2013/10/team-efficiency-rankings-week-6.html\">Advanced NFL Stats</a>, look like the better team. </p><p>That's an issue for Chiefs, because they have to play the Broncos twice. The Broncos also have the easier remaining schedule. That would suggest that the Broncos are more likely to end up with the better record. </p><p>Thus, the Chiefs are probably going to end up with the fifth spot in the AFC's playoff brackets. That means they'll have to win three times on the road to make the Super Bowl. That's not impossible, though the odds are against it. </p><p>The home team has won a little more than <a href=\"http://www.fieldgulls.com/2013/1/4/3780668/nfl-playoffs-seahawks-vs-redskins-homefield-advantage\">60% of its games in the playoffs</a> since 2002. Three teams have won three road games to win the Super Bowl <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/visuals/post/_/id/10921/graphic-which-nfl-playoff-seeds-succeed\">over the past decade and none before that</a>. This suggests that the homefield advantage may be waning, but it still exists. </p><p>You can add <a href=\"http://www.twominutewarning.com/hfa.htm\">2-3 points to the home team's margin</a> than what would you expect on a neutral field. In a league where games are often won by a few points, this can make all the difference in the world. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Chiefs are a good football team. I'm not sure, however, they are good as their 6-0 record indicates. Their offense and strength of opponent has been weak. A tougher upcoming schedule and the looming Broncos in the same division argues for a team that will have a more difficult time moving forward.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420264962|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|56965a4021f8221d73105a167ec18535cf1bb302 -->",

        "body":"<p>The 2013 NFL season is almost upon us: Following on from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/02/nfl-2013-preview-afc?CMP=twt_gu\">our preview of the NFL's American Football Conference</a> it's the turn of the National Football Conference. At the bottom of this article, you will also find our pick for Super Bowl XLVIII.</p><p><em>Teams listed in order of projected finish</em></p><h2>NFC East</h2><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Washington Redskins</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 10-6</p><p>This might be the toughest division to call in the whole league. Three of the four teams involved look capable of posting a winning record, yet none of them seems likely to be dominant. I could imagine the Cowboys, Giants and Redskins all going 9-7 more easily than any one of them going 12-4.</p><p>I'm taking Washington to win the division, but that pick comes with a pretty big asterisk. If Robert Griffin III were to reinjure his surgically-repaired left knee, then they could conceivably plummet to last place. Kirk Cousins is a perfectly serviceable NFL back-up, and performed well in relief last year, but he is not an equivalent player to RGIII.</p><p>The Redskins will hope for another strong year from running back Alfred Morris, whose 1,600 yards rushing as a rookie are too often forgotten amid the Griffin hype. Washington's defense will benefit from the return of Brian Orakpo, but concerns remain about a flaky secondary – despite the team's efforts to address that area in the draft. </p><p><strong>2) New York Giants</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 9-7</p><p>Expectations are modest for the Giants this year; under Tom Coughlin that is generally when they are at their most dangerous. The team's biggest move this offseason was signing Victor Cruz to a new five-year contract, thereby avoiding any training camp holdout by the receiver. If he and Hakeem Nicks stay healthy, Eli Manning should be able to do plenty of damage in the passing game. </p><p>Much like Washington, New York's biggest problems are on the other side of the ball. This team badly needs Jason Pierre-Paul to play at his best, upgrading the pass rush and helping to mask the team's problems in coverage. But the defensive end is coming off back surgery this summer, and might not be ready for week one.</p><p><strong>3) Dallas Cowboys</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 8-8</p><p>The Cowboys have enough talent on their roster to be a play-off team. Tony Romo is a good quarterback – even if perhaps not as good as <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000155364/article/tony-romo-signs-108m-contract-with-dallas-cowboys\">his new $108m contract might suggest</a>. He has excellent receivers to throw to in Dez Bryant and Miles Austin, and his team should be better on the other side of the ball, too, after replacing defensive co-ordinator Rob Ryan with Monte Kiffin.</p><p>And yet, how are we supposed to get behind a team whose owner spent the offseason <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/21599224\">pressuring his head coach into giving up play-calling duties</a>? These Cowboys are too dysfunctional to play up to their ability. Oh, and the offensive line is a mess, too.</p><p><strong>4) Philadelphia Eagles</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 4-12</p><p>If Garrett has been undermined by his owner, then the new Eagles head coach Chip Kelly seems to have fate itself working against his team. Philadelphia lost four players to torn anterior cruciate ligaments in preseason – including Jeremy Maclin, their top receiver from last season.</p><p>Michael Vick has been named as the starting quarterback once again, and it remains to be seen whether the Eagles can do a better job of protecting him. The defense may suffer some teething problems as it adjusts to a new 3-4 formation, but can't be a whole lot worse than it was the last time around.</p><h2>NFC North</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416454577'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/28/1354072114728/22434a47-7f2a-4fcd-af0f-42b9b681fad1-460.jpeg' alt='Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers reacts to a play during his team's loss to the New York Giants.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Photograph: Adam Hunger/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Green Bay Packers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong>  11-5</p><p>Life is going to keep getting tougher in the NFC North. Green Bay finished just one win ahead of Minnesota and Chicago last season, and both teams appear to have strengthened during the offseason. Detroit, meanwhile, are a better team than last year's 4-12 record would suggest.</p><p>The Packers, though, have Aaron Rodgers, and that fact alone will carry them a long way. Statistically the best starting quarterback in the league last year, he has steered his team to at least 10 wins in each of the past four seasons. There is no good reason to believe that he will fail to do so this time around.  His favourite target, Greg Jennings, might have departed, but Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and James Jones represent a solid set of fall-back options.</p><p>Green Bay's offense should in fact be more balanced, too, with second-round draft pick Eddie Lacy expected to provide immediate improvement at running back. The question, as so often, will be whether their defense is good enough to stop opponents from hanging on in a shoot-out. Having Clay Matthews available for all 16 games certainly wouldn't hurt.</p><p><strong>2) Chicago Bears</strong></p><p><strong>Last season: </strong> 10-6</p><p>This might be Jay Cutler's last shot in Chicago. The quarterback has been up and down for the Bears, and often in the most literal sense possible, since he has been sacked nearly three times per game over the past three seasons. This year the team has taken significant steps to address that issue, with four new starters across the offensive line, and new head coach Marc Trestman will be watching closely to see how the quarterback fares behind this new group.</p><p>The defense has lost its emotional leader in Brian Urlacher, but the linebacker had lost a step and no longer dominated a game as he once had. The man who was supposed to replace him, DJ Williams, has missed most of preseason with a calf injury, but this unit is still expected to be one of the best in the league. </p><p><strong>3) Minnesota Vikings</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 10-6</p><p>Adrian Peterson defied all reasonable logic last season, returning just nine months after a cruciate ligament tear and rushing for 2,097 yards. Only one player – Eric Dickerson – has ever rushed for more than 1,800 yards in consecutive seasons, and as special a player as AP is, you would have to expect some regression. </p><p>Have the Vikings strengthened sufficiently elsewhere to make up the difference? Right now it is not clear. Free agent wide receiver Greg Jennings and first-round draft pick Cordarrelle Patterson should together represent an upgrade over the departed Percy Harvin at the position, but it remains to be seen whether Christian Ponder can get the ball to them. On defense, the decision to release cornerback Antoine Winfield might come back to bite this team.</p><p><strong>4) Detroit Lions</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 4-12</p><p>Like AP, Calvin Johnson is likely to see his numbers fall somewhat after a record-breaking 2012. For the Lions, it will be good news if they do. That would mean that they have succeeded in diversifying an offense that was far too one-dimensional last year, with Stafford throwing a staggering 205 passes in the direction of his No1 receiver.</p><p>The acquisition of Reggie Bush – fresh from two strong years in Miami – should help towards that end. With Ziggy Ansah added to an already menacing defensive line, the Lions will win more games than they did last year, but might still finish up at the foot of a division where no team looks likely to be a pushover.</p><h2>NFC South</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416454578'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/14/1358122001617/d80e0054-99f0-4c24-a60d-769109d95b80-460.jpeg' alt='Atlanta Falcons kicker Matt Bryant vs Seattle Seahawks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Atlanta Falcons beat the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC divisional playoff game earlier this year.  Photograph: David Goldman/AP</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Atlanta Falcons</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 13-3</p><p>It is no secret that the Falcons believe they are ready for a Super Bowl run. They thought so last year, too, but the team's actions since the end of last season have been geared towards short-term success. First they persuaded tight end Tony Gonzalez to come back for one more year. Then they went out in free agency and signed running back Steven Jackson away from St Louis. He turned 30 in July, and it is a well-established fact that players at his position tend to deteriorate once they enter their fourth decade. Jackson, furthermore, is a physical back who has taken more hits than most. Nevertheless, he was extremely effective for the Rams in the latter part of last season – a result of head coach Jeff Fisher's smart decision to limit his touches earlier in the year. If the Falcons can manage Jackson's time on the field with similar effectiveness, he could be a difference-maker come playoff time.</p><p>And barring any injury to quarterback Matt Ryan, this team should certainly get back to the postseason. The receiving tandem of Julio Jones and Roddy White remains one of the best in the league, and on defense Osi Umenyiora could help upgrade the pass rush. A lot is being expected of rookie cornerbacks Desmond Trufant and Robert Alford, but defensive co-ordinator Mike Nolan has a good track record of keeping his units competitive. </p><p><strong>2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-9</p><p>What next for the Muscle Hamster? Tampa Bay's diminutive running back, also known as Doug Martin, had a sensational rookie season, rushing for 1,454 yards and 11 touchdowns, as well as catching 49 passes for a further 472 yards. If he can repeat those numbers, this team could be bound for the postseason. </p><p>Josh Freeman's 4,065 passing yards and 27 touchdowns last season represented new franchise records at his position, but he will hope to improve his accuracy now that he has a full year working with head coach Greg Schiano under his belt. A hideous passing defense, meanwhile, has been upgraded hugely by the addition of cornerback Darrelle Revis. </p><p><strong>3) New Orleans Saints</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-9</p><p>How much difference does a head coach make? The Saints had to do without Sean Payton last season as he served a one-year suspension as punishment for his alleged involvement in the team's bounty scandal. They duly missed out on the playoffs for the first time in four years, losing more games in one season than they had over the previous two combined.</p><p>Payton is now back, and his play-calling should galvanise the Saints' offense. That said, this team moved the ball OK even when he was absent. More important in determining New Orleans's fate might be the impact of new defensive co-ordinator Rob Ryan, who takes over a unit that gave up a league-worst 440.1 yards per game last year and has had only modest additions.</p><p><strong>4) Carolina Panthers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-9</p><p>I have the Panthers at last place in this division, yet they could easily finish as high as second. There is certainly plenty of confidence in Carolina after the team finished 2012 with five wins from its last six games. Seven of the Panthers' nine losses were by less than one touchdown.</p><p>Cam Newton is a talented quarterback who takes a few too many chances but can succeed if the other pieces are in place. Carolina might also have the best pass rush in the division, with first-round pick Star Lotulelei slotting in at defensive tackle alongside Dwan Edwards and the already prolific pairing of Charles Johnson and Greg Hardy at defensive end. There is some concern, however, that age might start to catch up to the running back rotation of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. </p><h2>NFC West</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416454579'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/3/1357235144261/a3e59bb8-2040-4611-b885-abba633de970-460.jpeg' alt='Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>How will Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson fare in his second season?  Photograph: George Holland/ZUMA Press/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Seattle Seahawks</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 11-5</p><p>The Seahawks' big offseason play to upgrade their offense, trading away a first-round pick to acquire Percy Harvin from Minnesota, backfired when the receiver injured his hip over the summer. He is expected to miss most of the season, and yet his team can still win this division.</p><p>A running game led by the indomitable Marshawn Lynch has been lent depth with the selection of Christine Michael in the second-round of this year's draft, and will continue to be the foundation of this team's offensive success. For all the excitement around quarterback Russell Wilson last year, the Seahawks still ran the ball a lot more often than they threw it. </p><p>Their greatest strength will continue to be the defense. Already exceptional at linebacker and in the secondary, the Seahawks have strengthened their supposed weak link, the defensive line, significantly with the capture of Cliff Avril and Michael Bennett in free agency. If Wilson continues to progress as expected, they will be Super Bowl contenders.</p><p><strong>2) San Francisco 49ers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 11-4-1</p><p>Nothing less than a Super Bowl will satisfy 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh, who steered his team to that stage last year after reaching the AFC Championship game in 2011-12. He has the pieces in place for another run, from a beastly front seven on defense through to an exceptional offensive line that can pave the way for another great year of Colin Kaepernick, Frank Gore and the read-option offense. </p><p>So why rank them below Seattle? My concerns relate to the state of the team's secondary, which lost safety Dashon Goldson in free agency, as well as the situation at wide receiver, where Michael Crabtree is out injured. But San Francisco are still going to be a very good team; my hunch is just that Seattle will be better.</p><p><strong>3) St Louis Rams</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-8-1</p><p>Nobody won more divisional games in the NFC West last year than St Louis, who went 4-1-1 against San Francisco, Seattle and Arizona. Unfortunately, they also went 3-7 against everybody else. They have lost their starting running back, Steven Jackson, and top wide receiver, Danny Amendola, since then, but still have reasons to believe that they will perform better.</p><p>Chief among those is the simple fact that quarterback Sam Bradford will be working under the same offensive co-ordinator, Brian Schottenheimer, for a second consecutive season – making this the first time in his career that he will get to work in the same system for two years running. If the former No1 overall pick can translate that consistency into the sort of improvement that people around the franchise expect, then this team – blessed with an underrated defense that features one of the best lines in the league – could grab a playoff berth.</p><p><strong>4) Arizona Cardinals</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 5-11</p><p>The Cardinals are another team that did not get enough credit for the quality of its defense last year, mostly because every time they forced a turnover their offense would give the ball straight back. A new coaching staff in Arizona will seek to preserve the good while eliminating some of the bad. </p><p>Carson Palmer represents an upgrade at quarterback (he could hardly do worse than Josh Skelton, Ryan Lindley et al) and has the right attributes to air the ball out in Bruce Arians' deep passing offense, as well as one of the best wide receivers in Larry Fitzgerald. But Palmer cannot throw passes lying down, and there is concern that the team's glaring weaknesses along the offensive line remain, especially after the team's first-round draft pick, guard Jonathan Cooper, broke his leg in preseason. </p><h2>Playoff permutations</h2><p><strong>Division winners:</strong> Washington Redskins, Green Bay Packers, Atlanta Falcons, Seattle Seahawks.</p><p><strong>NFC Wildcards:</strong> San Francisco 49ers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><p><strong>NFC Championship game:</strong> Seattle Seahawks over Atlanta Falcons</p><p><strong>Super Bowl XLVIII:</strong> Seattle Seahawks over Denver Broncos</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/02/nfl-2013-preview-afc\">AFC preview</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416363213|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|9d4f7a101b07119a49d39b73ed291cd0084931de -->",

        "headline":"RG3 says 'now is the window' for gay NFL players to come out",
        "body":"<p>The Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III has said that \"now is the window\" for any gay NFL players to come out. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/08/rg3-gq-cover-story-interview-outtakes.html\">Speaking to GQ magazine</a>, Griffin III – who is known to fans as RG3 – said: \"Yeah, man. I think there are [gay players] right now, and if they're looking for a window to just come out, I mean, now is the window. My view on it is, yes, I am a Christian, but to each his own. You do what you want to do. If some Christians want to look at being gay as a sin, then thinking about other women, committing adultery – or any of those other sins that are in the Bible – those are sins, too. And God looks at all of us the same way.\"</p><p>The quote was included in an \"outtakes\" post on GQ's website, rather than in the cover story itself.</p><p>The issue of whether gay professional sportsmen or women can or should come out has been keenly discussed since April, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/29/jason-collins-gay-sports-illustrated-wizards\">Jason Collins, an NBA center who has most recently played for the Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards</a>, became the first openly gay athlete still playing in the four major US professional sports leagues – the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL.</p><p>In early April, almost a month before Collins' announcement, the former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, an advocate of LGBT rights, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/05/four-nfl-players-coming-out-ayanbadejo\">said four NFL players were close to coming out</a>. \"I think it will happen sooner than you think,\" Ayanbadejo said, in an interview with the Baltimore Sun. \"We're in talks with a handful of players who are considering it. There are up to four players being talked to right now and they're trying to be organized so they can come out on the same day together. It would make a major splash and take the pressure off one guy. It would be a monumental day if a handful or a few guys come out.\" </p><p>No current NFL players have yet come out, although Ayanbadejo and the Oakland Raiders punter Chris Kluwe have continued to press the issue. In September 2012, Kluwe made headlines when he issued <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5941348/they-wont-magically-turn-you-into-a-lustful-cockmonster-chris-kluwe-explains-gay-marriage-to-the-politician-who-is-offended-by-an-nfl-player-supporting-it?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">a stinging public rebuke to Emmett C Burns Jr</a>, a Maryland state politician who had objected to Ayanbadejo's support for gay marriage. Kluwe's open letter to Burns Jr – which used colourful language, including an assurance to the politician that gay people getting married would not \"magically turn you into a lustful cockmonster\" – went viral.</p><p>In the NFL season that followed, controversy was stirred up by remarks made by players in response to questions about the likelihood of players coming out. In January, in the build-up to Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans, the San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver said: \"I don't do the gay guys man. I don't do that. No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do. Can't be with that sweet stuff. Nah … can't be … in the locker room man. Nah.\" </p><p>After the 49ers organisation disowned his remarks, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/31/chris-culliver-gay-apology-49ers-superbowl\">Culliver issued a statement of apology</a>: \"The derogatory comments I made yesterday were a reflection of thoughts in my head, but they are not how I feel. It has taken me seeing them in print to realize that they are hurtful and ugly. Those discriminating feelings are truly not in my heart. Further, I apologize to those who I have hurt and offended, and I pledge to learn and grow from this experience.\"</p><p>In March, <a href=\"http://www.towleroad.com/2013/03/seattle-seahawk-christopher-clemons-says-gay-player-coming-out-would-be-selfish-act-that-would-divid.html#ixzz2Pbc7fQ5d\">Christopher Clemons, a Seattle Seahawks defensive end</a>, called coming out \"a selfish act\" that would \"separate a lockerrom and divide a team\".</p><p>The approach of the 2014 Winter Olympics, which will be held in the Russian resort of Sochi, has also focused attention on gay rights in American sports. Given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/09/russia-gay-world-athletics-sochi\">Russia's recent passing of discriminatory laws</a>, calls have grown for the Games to be boycotted on human rights grounds. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/obama-press-conference-nsa-reforms-live\">President Obama last week rejected the idea, saying</a>: \"One of the things I'm really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we're seeing there.\"</p><p>The NHL, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/12/nhl-you-can-play-gay-homophobia\">which recently partnered with the LGBT rights organisation You Can Play</a>, will allow its players to compete at the Games.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-414959044'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/5/26/1369569685758/Robbie-Rogers-unveiled-as-011.jpg' alt='Robbie Rogers unveiled as new LA Galaxy signing - video' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Robbie Rogers now plays for the LA Galaxy, having come out – and retired – while playing in the UK.

The tight end was taken from his home in handcuffs on Wednesday morning, more than a week after Odin Lloyd, a Boston semi-pro football player, was found dead in an industrial park a mile from Hernandez's house. </p><p>Authorities say Lloyd was shot multiple times in the back and chest. They say Hernandez was upset with Lloyd after the two had a dispute at a nightclub a few days before.</p><p>Less than two hours after the arrest of Hernandez, <a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/news/article-1/Patriots-Release-Tight-End-Aaron-Hernandez/69fbee29-d53e-4f8d-88c6-de53da754e73\">the New England Patriots announced the player had been released from the team</a>.</p><p>The Patriots released a statement, which said: \"A young man was murdered last week and we extend our sympathies to the family and friends who mourn his loss. Words cannot express the disappointment we feel knowing that one of our players was arrested as a result of this investigation. We realize that law enforcement investigations into this matter are ongoing. We support their efforts and respect the process.

Officials ruled the death a homicide but did not say how Lloyd died. Lloyd's relatives said he was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée, that the two men were friends and that both men were out together on the last night of Lloyd's life.</p><p>Hernandez was taken into custody on Wednesday, before 9am, and put into the back of a police cruiser. He was wearing a white v-neck t-shirt, and his arms were inside the shirt and behind his back as he was led from his North Attleborough home. He casually spit into some bushes on his way to the car. </p><p>Hernandez was arrested on a state police warrant and was booked at the North Attleborough police station, state police said on the agency's Twitter account. State police said they would not discuss the charge against Hernandez until it was presented in Attleboro District Court. Hernandez was taken from the North Attleborough police station to his court hearing on Wednesday afternoon. About two dozen supporters cheered, some yelling \"We love you Aaron,\" as the car carrying him left the police station.</p><p>The Associated Press emailed a message to Hernandez's attorney, Michael Fee, who hasn't discussed the investigation beyond acknowledging media reports about it. A message also was left with the Bristol County district attorney's office.</p><p>Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, declined to comment at her Boston home Wednesday morning. \"Nothing to say, please. Thank you,\" she said, before shutting the door.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/23/aaron-hernandez-nfl-player-search\">State police have searched in and around Hernandez's sprawling home in North Attleborough several times</a>. At least three search warrants have been issued in connection with the investigation. Reporters have been camped for days outside the home on the Rhode Island line, not far from the stadium where the Patriots play. They reported on Tuesday that Hernandez had been visited by a Boston defense attorney, James Sultan.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411675953'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/21/1371825121875/New-England-Patriots-tigh-010.jpg' alt='New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Aaron Hernandez in action.

        "headline":"How the NFL Draft became the biggest non-sporting sports event",
        "body":"<p>It could be argued that the NFL Draft has become the world's most popular sporting event that doesn't contain any actual live sports. The league's annual selection meeting has been around since 1936, but it has increased in popularity in recent years at a rate that outpaces any other major event in the sporting world.</p><p>Just ask former Dallas Cowboys vice president of player personnel Gil Brandt, who has been scouting draft prospects for five and a half decades.</p><p>\"It has exceed expectations by about a million times,\" Brandt told me over the phone from Texas last week.  He remembers the media coverage the draft received in the 1950s and 1960s and can't fathom how much things have changed.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"If we had five or six national writers [covering the draft], that was unheard of. Guys had no idea they were drafted. 'Drafted? Into the Army?' Now, though, the interest in the draft is just totally unbelievable.\"</p></blockquote><p>Until 1980, the draft wasn't televised. Until 1995, it was held in hotel ballrooms in Chicago, Philadelphia or New York. It moved from Tuesday/Wednesday to Sunday/Monday in 1988, because, according to NFL.com, \"the Marriott Marquis [in New York] offered the NFL a better rate on those days for the ballroom space.\"</p><p>Now, 12,000-plus watch live at Radio City Music Hall, with more than 8 million tuning in to watch the first round alone on ESPN and NFL Network, to see which college players are chosen by which pro teams. To put that audience into perspective, two NBA playoff games played on the same night last year garnered a combined 1.8 million viewers. </p><p>The Draft routinely crushes the NBA now, as well as the Stanley Cup Finals and postseason baseball. In fact, the lowest-rated game of last year's World Series between the Giants and the Tigers edged out the opening round of the draft by only 2.4 million viewers.</p><p>The combined total viewership of the draft grew by nearly 100 percent from 2001 to 2010, according to ESPN's public-relations department. The Super Bowl, for the sake of comparison has only seen its viewership increase by 28 percent since '01 (84 million viewers for Super Bowl XXXV compared to 109 million for this year's game between the Ravens and the 49ers).</p><p>The increased interest has spawned a growing field of \"draft experts,\" who seem to appear alongside Punxsutawney Phil each February before disappearing again by the first of May. And it goes beyond the Mel Kipers and Todd McShays of the football world. A cottage industry has emerged, too, built mainly on mock drafts, draft rumors and in-depth scouting reports at websites that are becoming less obscure by the year.</p><p>Walter Cherepinsky, who runs <a href=\"http://walterfootball.com/\">WalterFootball.com</a>, says his site gets the vast majority of its readers because of its draft analysis. Cherepinsky writes a popular weekly picks column throughout the year and offers up plenty of fantasy football advice, but none of it holds a candle to the draft. WalterFootball.com received 36 million page views in April of 2012, which was double the viewership it garnered during December, the final month of the actual season.</p><p>\"The draft stuff just dwarfs everything,\" Cherepinsky told me last week. \"It combines the college football fans and the NFL fans. The college football fans are interested in knowing where their favorite players are gonna go and the NFL fans want to know which players are gonna make their team better.\"</p><p>Cherepinsky notes that the numbers grew each month from September on last year, not because of the approaching playoffs and the Super Bowl, but because there's more draft interest as the season progresses.</p><p>\"The fans know that they're out of playoff contention,\" he told me, \"so they look forward to the draft to see how their teams can get better.\"</p><p>Why has draft interest increased so much in the last 10-20 years specifically? There are several reasons, but the first—sadly—is that we've been taken advantage of by the league's mad men.</p><p>\"It's a product of armies of PR people who want to keep fans engaged throughout the offseason,\" said Michael Broder, a Philadelphia-based media psychologist and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Stage-Climbing-Shortest-Highest-Potential/dp/1889577391\">Stage Climbing: The Shortest Path to Your Highest Potential</a>. \"The media has really hyped it, and it's all about money.\"</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"What they've managed to do is make the season never-ending.\"</p></blockquote><p><br />Wait, are we that robotic? Are we victims of a PR machine? Did ESPN and the NFL decide that they needed to push for extra attention in the offseason, causing us to follow like sheep? If ESPN jumped off a bridge, would we join them?</p><p>\"It's incredibly depressing,\" said Arthur Raney, a professor of communication at Florida State University and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Handbook-Sports-Media-Arthur-Raney/dp/0805851887/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366590657&amp;sr=1-3\">The Handbook of Sports and Media</a>. </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"It is truly an extension of the NFL brand. There are marketing interests that are in play here that go well beyond the NFL. It's not only the NFL creating its next group of marketing faces, but it's also products in any number of industries that these faces are going to be attached to as well.\"</p></blockquote><p>Both Broder and Raney agreed when asked about a possible connection between the draft and reality television. The draft moved to prime time in 2010, but even before that, the nature of the early-round broadcasts gave it an American Idol feel.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-407653848'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/10/1305040248403/American-Idol-007.jpg' alt='American Idol' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Would you want these people to choose the next NFL star? Photograph: 20thC.Fox/Everett/Rex Features</figcaption></figure><p><em></em><br />\"It feels that way,\" said Raney. \"Spread out over three days, it's almost like a reality miniseries.\"</p><p>Forget three days. The draft process as a whole is spread out over three months. A ridiculous 7.25 million people tuned into NFL Network to watch the annual scouting combine this past February. During the entire 2012-13 NBA regular season, only two games drew more viewers than that.</p><p>And then there are thousands of hours of analysis crammed between the combine and the draft, including John Gruden's increasingly popular QB Camp, which features the former coach working with some of the draft's top prospects.</p><p>\"I never really thought that it would get this big,\" Gruden told me on a conference call. \"The draft has become a huge spectacle.\"</p><p>\"I think the commissioner and the NFL have done an excellent job keeping the game strong and interesting to fans,\" Gruden added. \"This is a big vehicle for teams to get better, obviously, the draft.  With the popularity of the game, people want to know who the players are that can help their team turn the corner.  I think that's what's made it so exciting and fun.  I've enjoyed being a part of it.\"</p><p>Teams certainly do turn that corner often. About five new teams make the playoffs each year, so one player could change everything. And parity is a big reason why draft interest has exploded in recent years.</p><p>\"I think it's about hope,\" said Cherepinsky. \"Football's the one sport in America where you can turn around in just one year. It's happened so many times. And teams build primarily through the draft.\"</p><p>Indeed they do. Free agency has lost its luster, with Super Bowl champions usually building through the draft.  Recent winners such as the Ravens, Giants, Packers and Steelers typically stayed away from free agents, and fans are catching on.</p><p>Of course, it's not as though that's a completely new trend. Even before free agency, teams that focused solely on the draft were more successful. Brandt notes that in Super Bowl X in 1976, 85 of the 86 active players were drafted in-house.</p><p>\"People copy success,\" said Brandt, who is now a senior analyst at NFL.com. \"I think that the teams realize and recognize how important the draft is and consequently are spending a lot more time on it, and I think that the people that are working for these teams are a lot better as far as what you're looking for and what it takes to be an NFL player than people did 25 years ago.\"</p><p>Maybe this is, to some degree, the result of something kick-started by Tex Schramm and those draft-savvy Cowboys teams from the 1960s and 1970s. Maybe it just took time for personnel and scouting departments league-wide to catch up, and for fans to then follow suit, with ESPN playing the catalyst role. The reality is that the fans' interests are going to align with the interests of their favorite teams, but that didn't happen overnight.</p><p>\"Scouting used to be a one-story motel out in the country,\" <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/nfl/news/20130331/carson-palmer-kevin-kolb-monday-morning-quarterback/\">Brandt told Sports Illustrated's Peter King earlier this year</a>. \"Now it's the Sears Tower. And growing.\"</p><p>It can't be a coincidence that teams and fans became increasingly obsessed with the draft in consecutive eras.</p><p>So we're not only brainwashed by what Raney calls \"the weight of the league's PR and marketing departments,\" but we're also influenced by what our teams are focusing on.</p><p>There is one thing, though, that everyone involved is invested in, at least to a degree—and that's hope. Any draft pick could be the next Tom Brady or RG3. For teams, that's reason enough to spend millions on scouts. For PR departments, that's reason enough to spend millions on hyping the draft. And for fans, that's reason enough to spend hours reading mock drafts and prospect profiles in the lead-up to the three-day event.  </p><p>\"There's all those mock drafts out there, and they're always wrong,\" said Raney, \"but it's the uncertainty of it.\"</p><p>I spoke to one Cowboys fan last week who said he wasn't even that into the draft, but he still completely understood the intrigue when it comes to that one-in-whatever chance that his team could land the next superstar.</p><p>\"It's exciting,\" Kris Barrie told me, \"and it endows every fan with a sense of hope that our next superstar is just a walk to the stage away from taking us to the next level.\"</p><p>You can't help but think of the lottery. Statistically, your team's chances of drafting a future Super Bowl MVP are much greater than your chances of winning the Powerball jackpot, but there's a one-in-some high number chance that either will happen. We're drawn to the drama, the mystery, the gamble, and that chance.</p><p>Thirty-one of the NFL's 32 teams fail to reach their ultimate goal every year, and those spoiled brats from the 32nd team will always tell you that winning has made them even more hungry.  And so everyone is desperate, and nobody can avoid thinking about what the draft might do for them.</p><p>Thus, it's no coincidence that the draft has become the second-biggest event on the NFL calendar, behind only the Super Bowl.</p><p>Said Broder:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"There's definitely a direct correlation between whatever happens in the draft and their team getting to the Super Bowl. You wonder where it's going to go next.\"</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport\">Guardian US sports</a> will have further NFL Draft coverage this week, including a liveblog of the main event on Thursday, 8pm ET</h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407634578|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|7dd6be8b57dde1e5e438e119de2b27855eb40966 -->",

        "headline":"Pat Summerall, star NFL broadcaster, dies aged 82",
        "body":"<p>Pat Summerall, the deep-voiced NFL player-turned-broadcaster who spent half of his four decades calling sports famously paired with John Madden, died Tuesday. He was 82.</p><p>Susie Wiles, Summerall's daughter, said her father died in Dallas.</p><p>\"He was an extraordinary man and a wonderful father,\" Wiles said. \"I know he will be greatly missed.\"</p><p>Summerall was part of network television broadcasts for 16 Super Bowls. His last championship game was for Fox on February 3, 2002, also his last game with long-time TV partner Madden. The popular duo worked together for 21 years, moving to Fox in 1994 after years as the lead team for CBS.</p><p>At the end of their final broadcast together, Madden described Summerall as \"a treasure\" and the \"spirit of the National Football League\" in a tribute to the partner that complemented the former coach so well.</p><p>\"You are what the NFL is all about, what pro football is all about, and more important, what a man is all about and what a gentleman is all about,\" Madden said.</p><p>As former teammate and broadcaster Frank Gifford put it in an accompanying video tribute: \"America is very comfortable with Pat Summerall.\"</p><p>Summerall played 10 NFL seasons with the Chicago Cardinals and the New York Giants between 1952 and 1961. He started doing NFL games for CBS in 1964, and became a play-by-play guy 10 years later. He was also part of CBS's coverage of the PGA Tour, and the US Open tennis tournament.</p><p>When CBS lost its NFL deal after the 1993 season, Summerall switched to Fox to keep calling NFL games with Madden. He had hoped to keep working with CBS for other events like the Masters, but network executives saw it otherwise. At the time, CBS Sports anchor Jim Nantz said he was \"very saddened\" that Summerall didn't get to leave CBS under his own terms.</p><p>A recovering alcoholic, Summerall had a liver transplant in April 2004.</p><p>After an intervention involving, among others, former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Summerall checked into the Betty Ford Clinic in April 1992.</p><p>Summerall received the liver of a 13-year-old junior high football player from Arkansas who died unexpectedly from an aneurysm. Summerall had an emotional meeting with the teenager's family the following year.</p><p>Born George Allen Summerall on May 10, 1930 in Lake City, Florida, he was an All-State prep football and basketball player there, and lettered in baseball and tennis. He played college football at Arkansas before going to the NFL.</p><p>After breaking his arm in the preseason as a rookie for Detroit, Summerall played five years for the Chicago Cardinals before four seasons with the Giants. While he was also a defensive back, Summerall was primarily a kicker, making 100 field goals and 256 of 265 extra points in his career.</p><p>Summerall was part of the NBC and CBS simulcast of the inaugural Super Bowl in Los Angeles on January 15 1967. After working the first half in the broadcast booth, he switched places with Gifford at half-time and was a sideline reporter during the second half.</p><p>\"To look at the Coliseum that day and see that there were like 40,000 empty seats and the most expensive ticket was $12, it's incredible to realize what was going on and what it's grown to over the years,\" he said during a 2009 AP interview. \"It's sort of staggering to me.\"</p><p>After his final game with Madden, Summerall remained a full-time broadcaster for Fox one more season, doing primarily Dallas Cowboys games during the 2002 season. He decided to step down the following year when he realized he would spend most of the season away from home.</p><p>Funeral arrangements were incomplete.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407325284|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|7258dca21166caab4c471ce078ae057acf0b7f75 -->",

Full standings will be posted below the line shortly, but I can tell you that it's a three-way tie at the top between <strong>Cameldancer</strong>, <strong>dominkh</strong> and <strong>saltlakecity</strong>.</p><h2>Super Bowl XLVII round-up</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-403042516'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/24/1359063902322/Anna-Welker-003.jpg' alt='Anna Welker' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Anna Welker. Photograph: Darren Mccollester/WireImage/BCH</figcaption></figure><p>• <strong>It seems the post-game rant by a New England Patriot's spouse is becoming an annual tradition.</strong> Last year we had Gisele, <a href=\"http://theinsider.etonline.com/gossip/49452_Gisele_Bashes_Tom_s_Teammates/index.html\">railing that her husband Tom Brady could not catch his own passes</a>, and this year it was the turn of <a href=\"http://www.thebiglead.com/index.php/2013/01/21/wes-welkers-wife-goes-to-facebook-to-share-her-thoughts-on-ray-lewis-after-the-patriots-lost/\">Wes Welker's wife, Anna</a>.</p><p>Mrs Welker, a former beauty queen, took to Facebook to share some thoughts on Baltimore's Ray Lewis:<br /><em></em><br /><em></em></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Proud of my husband and the Pats. By the way, if anyone is bored, please go to Ray Lewis' Wikipedia page. 6 kids 4 wives. Acquitted for murder. Paid a family off. Yay. What a hall of fame player! A true role model!\"</p></blockquote><p>She subsequently made another statement: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I'm deeply sorry for my recent post on Facebook. I let the competitiveness of the game and the comments people were making about a team I dearly love get the best of me. My actions were emotional and irrational and I sincerely apologize to Ray Lewis and anyone affected by my comment after yesterday's game.</p><p>\"It is such an accomplishment for any team to make it to the NFL playoffs, and the momentary frustration I felt should not overshadow the accomplishments of both of these amazing teams.\"</p></blockquote><p>• Speaking of <strong>Brady, he was fined $10,000 this week for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DomVUdZJIM\">his studs-up, knee-high slide into Ed Reed</a></strong>. As Yahoo's Shutdown Corner blog noted – that's <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/tom-brady-fined-10-000-kick-ed-reed-015540238--nfl.html;_ylt=Av6uyH_Eh0kGdZ3lVm8s5RBYYsp_;_ylu=X3oDMTE5anNoYXFyBG1pdANCbG9ncyBJbmRleARwb3MDMTIEc2VjA01lZGlhQmxvZ0luZGV4;_ylg=X3oDMTFpMm9iMzh1BGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdANibG9nBHB0A3NlY3Rpb25z;_ylv=3\">$500 less than Frank Gore was fined for wearing his socks too low</a>. Brady did, to his credit, <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/01/22/ed-reed-brady-apologized-for-slide/\">apologise to Reed for the incident</a>. </p><p>• Doing the rounds this week: <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/usatoday.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=bd4f28430a8b41d58becad00afae3a50\"><strong>footage of Ray Lewis's first NFL sack</strong></a>. Why so much attention? Because it just so happened to be on a certain Jim Harbaugh – now head coach of the Ravens' Super Bowl opponents, the San Francisco 49ers. </p><p>• <strong>Impressive words from 49ers quarterback Alex Smith on the subject of going into a Super Bowl as back-up to Colin Kaepernick</strong>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bittersweet. I want to be out there. Coming into the season, that was my mindset, my goal. But at the same time, this is a team sport. These are all my team-mates. We go through so much together.

Payton said he had \"no interest\" in speaking to his still-suspended former defensive co-ordinator Gregg Williams, and also rejected claims – published during the season – that he had<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4705114/sean-payton-there-was-no-way-i-was-going-to-another-team\"> considered leaving the Saints to join the Dallas Cowboys</a> upon his return. </p><p>• Another hot topic this week: <strong>did the then Oakland Raiders head coach Bill Callahan deliberately sabotage his team at Super Bowl XXXVII?</strong> That was the allegation that the former Raiders wide receiver Tim Brown seemed to make on Tuesday, when <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/01/21/tim-brown-suggests-sabotage-by-bill-callahan-in-super-bowl-xxxvi/\">he told SiriusXM NFL Radio the coach had completely changed his team's game-plan just 36 hours before kick-off</a> – switching away from a run-heavy offense towards a much greater focus on the pass. Oakland subsequently lost the game to Tampa Bay, 48-21.</p><p>There did not seem to be too much ambiguity about Brown's words Tuesday. \"We all called it sabotage . . . because Callahan and [Tampa Bay coach Jon] Gruden were good friends,\" Brown said. \"And Callahan had a big problem with the Raiders, you know, hated the Raiders.  You know, only came because Gruden made him come.  Literally walked off the field on us a couple of times during the season when he first got there, the first couple years.\" </p><p>But a day later, on the Dan Patrick show, Brown was keen to backtrack. \"I've never said [Callahan] sabotaged the game,\" Brown said. \"That's something that can never be proven. We can never go into the mind of Bill Callahan... I should have said we could have called it sabotage. It was a question, not a statement. You cannot prove it.\"</p><p>Confusing the matter further, Brown's former team-mate <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000129743/article/jerry-rice-agrees-bill-callahan-threw-super-bowl\">Jerry Rice suggested on Tuesday that he agreed with the initial allegation</a>.  </p><p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8871919/bill-callahan-former-oakland-raiders-coach-says-sabotage-allegations-ludicrous\">Callahan firmly rejected the claim</a>, saying: \"While I fully understand a competitive professional football player's disappointment when a game's outcome doesn't go his team's way, I am shocked, saddened and outraged by Tim Brown's allegations and Jerry Rice's support of those allegations made through various media outlets over the last 24 hours,\" Callahan said. \"To leave no doubt, I categorically and unequivocally deny the sum and substance of their allegations.\"</p><p>• <strong>The family of the late San Diego Chargers, Miami Dolphins and New England Patriots linebacker Junior Seau has opened a wrongful death lawsuit against the NFL</strong> - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jan/23/junior-seau-family-sues-nfl-cte?INTCMP=SRCH\">claiming that his suicide was the result of brain disease caused by the violent collisions he sustained while playing football</a>. </p><p>• We've got this far without acknowledging it, but yes – <strong>there is in fact a game of football happening this weekend. The Pro Bowl</strong>'s drift into complete irrelevance has been discussed at length elsewhere <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/jan/27/nfl-pro-bowl-superbowl\">(including by this blog at around this time last year</a>) but at least one man does still seem to care. <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000129920/article/peyton-manning-roasts-players-at-closed-pro-bowl-meeting\">Peyton Manning reportedly gave an impassioned speech imploring players from both rosters to try their hardest</a>. We'll see if it makes any difference on Sunday. If any of us actually remember to tune in, that is. </p><h2>Super Bowl XLVII on the Guardian</h2><p>Our coverage of the big game begins in earnest next week, with a series of blogs and features in the build-up to the main event – from me and the rest of the Guardian US Sports team. You can keep up with all the latest on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/nfl\">our special NFL page</a> and via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnUSsports\">@GdnUSsports</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/guardianussports\">Facebook</a>.</p><p>I will be in New Orleans from Tuesday, so <strong>if you have any questions for individual players post them below the line here</strong> and I will do my best to make them on your behalf at one of the various media availabilities. Please be aware that your chances of getting an answer are much better with an Anquan Boldin or Carlos Rogers than they might be with a Colin Kaepernick or Ray Lewis.</p><p>On Super Bowl Sunday we will have live coverage running through the day of the game until the final gun – plus reports, blogs and comment to follow. Here's hoping you'll join us for all of it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/402949422|2013-10-18T10:23:06Z|8930ff273494e623742cba60db45badea39a0288 -->",

        "headline":"Super Bowl lineup: Ray Lewis, Colin Kaepernick and the Harbowl",
        "body":"<h2>Jim Harbaugh was right to go with Colin Kaepernick</h2><p>Back in November, Jim Harbaugh told us that he planned to ride the \"hot hand\" at quarterback. Two months later, Colin Kaepernick's blistering right paw has slung the 49ers into the Super Bowl. In doing so he has vindicated his coach's greatest gamble.</p><p>In truth, the debates over Harbaugh's decision to promote Kaepernick above Alex Smith died down a little while ago. There may never be a quarterback less deserving of losing his job than Smith – who had done everything the coaching staff asked and was enjoying the best season of his career up until his week 10 concussion against St Louis. But when your replacement is playing as well as Kaepernick did in obliterating the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round, nobody is going to sit around mourning your absence.</p><p>Before this Sunday, though, it was still too soon to declare Harbaugh's switch a total triumph. Because as he deliberated and dwelled over his options at quarterback in November, the foremost question in the coach's mind will not have regarded which player was more talented or could put up the gaudiest numbers. The only thing that truly concerned Harbaugh was which player gave his team the better chance of playing in this year's Super Bowl.</p><p>Of course, Kaepernick possessed greater upside – three years younger and with more impressive physical tools – and on another team there might have been an argument for long-term thinking. But after last year's NFC title game defeat to the Giants, Harbaugh knew he had the rest of the pieces in place to make a run at a championship. In the NFL, those windows close quickly.</p><p>As unthinkable as it seems today, there was a strong case to be made for sticking with Smith. He had taken his team to the brink of an NFC title just one year previously – and although he came up short against New York last January, he seemed to have learned a few lessons since then. He was a safe pair of hands who could get the job done for a San Francisco team that was good enough not to need a superstar under center.</p><p>Except that on Sunday, they did need that superstar. The Falcons had burst out of the gates to a 17-0 lead, Matt Ryan and Julio Jones looking so perfectly in sync that you wondered how they would ever be contained. It takes strong nerves to come back from that sort of deficit in an environment as hostile as the Georgia Dome. It also takes a quarterback capable of winning games, not just managing them. Recovering from a 17-point deficit to win represented the third-largest comeback in NFL postseason history.</p><p>That is not to suggest Kaepernick carried his team alone, or carved up Atlanta single-handed. San Francisco battled back into the game with a combination of an effective ground game, smart defensive adjustments and improved blocking of both the run and pass. </p><p>But they also leaned on a quarterback who showed himself adept at exploiting the defense's weaknesses, whether that was through regular targeting of Vernon Davis – a player he had barely thrown to over the previous seven games – or knowing when to hand the ball off to Frank Gore in the read-option offense. His numbers – 16 of 23 for 233 yards and a score, plus two carries for 21 yards – are solid enough, but they do not speak to the poise, the decision-making and the calm he brought to his offense. </p><p>Perhaps the 49ers would have made the Super Bowl with Alex Smith at quarterback, too, and perhaps he was deserving of the chance to lead them there. But nobody will be dwelling on such hypotheticals in San Francisco this morning, because Colin Kaepernick did get them there. And that, when assessing Harbaugh's biggest call, is all that really matters.</p><h2>The other Harbaugh might know what he's doing too</h2><p>Brace yourselves for the HarBowl – as San Francisco head coach Jim Harbaugh takes on his older brother, the Baltimore Ravens coach John, at Super Bowl XLVII. Last season they became the first siblings ever to coach against one another in the NFL – during a Thanksgiving Day game in Baltimore, which the Ravens won 16-6. Now they will be the first to do so with the title on the line. </p><p>This match-up was so nearly a reality last year, when both brothers lost their respective conference title games by just three points. Asked last week if they had ever discussed the prospect of meeting in the Super Bowl, John replied: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Not that I'd ever admit to.\" </p></blockquote><p>The possibility must at least have been on the minds of two men who talk by phone every week. With each sending game film to their father Jack Harbaugh – formerly a successful college coach – on a regular basis, you have to wonder whether either has woken up this morning regretful over one too many trade secrets leaked at a family dinner somewhere down the line.</p><p>Jim has always carried the higher profile – the result, at least in part, of his more successful playing career. Exactly 15 months younger than his brother, Jim enjoyed 15 years as an NFL quarterback – split between six different teams. After retiring in 2001, he needed just three years to land his first head coaching job with the University of San Diego. </p><p>John, a former defensive back, never played beyond college and instead spent two decades climbing the coaching ladder before finally getting his first head coaching gig in Baltimore in 2008. At the time it was considered a surprise appointment, but a 62-30 record (including playoffs) since then has <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/nfl/news/20130118/nfl-game-plan-john-harbaugh/index.html\">more than vindicated the Ravens' decision</a>. Only one head coach has won more games over the same period – Bill Belichick, whose Patriots John defeated on Sunday. </p><p>And if Jim's gamble on Kaepernick was rewarded this weekend, then John can claim similar success with his boldest move. The Ravens head coach's decision to fire offensive co-ordinator Cam Cameron in mid-December raised more than a few eyebrows – read by many as a panic move from a team who had dropped back-to-back games and were threatening to lose their grip on the AFC North.</p><p>Instead, Jim Caldwell's elevation from quarterbacks coach to Cameron's replacement has worked out beautifully. Baltimore would lose the next game to Denver, 34-17, but since then they have averaged 28 points and 431 yards per game. Caldwell has encouraged quarterback Joe Flacco to both spend more time outside of the pocket and take regular shots downfield. The results have been breathtaking.</p><p>In three playoff games, Flacco has thrown for 853 yards, eight touchdowns and no interceptions. Amid blustery, frost-bitten conditions at Gillette Stadium in the AFC title game, Flacco thoroughly outperformed New England's Tom Brady – just as he had Peyton Manning in Denver two weeks previously.</p><p>That is a testament to the quarterback himself, as well as a remodeled offensive line which has done a great job in protection. But it is also to the credit of his coaching staff. </p><p>\"Hey Jim, congratulations – you did it, you're a great coach,\"<a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=68f2afec0d654a4ea1fa6928e42061a2\"> said John in a fleeting piece to camera for CBS</a> just before Baltimore's game in New England. Big brother is not looking too shabby himself. </p><h2>Bernard Pollard still haunts the Patriots</h2><p>The narrative around Baltimore's defense will focus once again on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ypzddbi_9KE\">Ray Lewis, who sobbed during the national anthem</a> and then went on to lead his team in tackles against New England. And so one of the greatest linebackers ever to play the game – <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/01/10/ray-lewis-baltimore-ravens-atlanta-murder-2000/1566198/\">and also perhaps the most controversial one</a> – will get to end his career at the Super Bowl, no doubt prefaced by one last pre-game shimmy as he makes his way out of the tunnel.</p><p>His team-mate Terrell Suggs stole some headlines, too, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=t_YsZbXYOx4\">commanding reporters to \"tell 'em [the Patriots] to have fun at the Pro Bowl\"</a> as he made his way back to the locker room after the game. \"These are the most arrogant pricks in the world starting with Belichick on down,\" he is reported to have added. \"That's funny, ever since SpyGate they haven't been able to win.\" He later tempered those comments, saying: \"All BS aside they are a hell of a ball club ... They have the right to be arrogant.\"</p><p><em></em></p><p>The single most critical defensive play of the game for Baltimore was not by Lewis or Suggs, though, but instead the safety Bernard Pollard. It is a name which recalls grim memories for New England fans. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/ravens/2013/01/21/bernard-pollard-baltimore-ravens/1850637/\">A man jokingly referred to as \"Patriot killer\" by his team-mates</a> has been involved in four significant New England injuries since 2008.</p><p>Tom Brady, in that year, was the first – blowing out his knee on  a tackle from Pollard, then a Kansas City Chief. One season later the same player, now with the Houston Texans, was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RK4qhQWIUo\">closing in on Wes Welker when the receiver tore his ACL while attempting to cut away</a>. Then, in last year's AFC title game, Pollard's tackle on Rob Gronkowski left the tight end with a high ankle sprain which would severely limit him in the Patriots' subsequent Super Bowl defeat.</p><p>The fourth incident arrived on Sunday, when <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=1b1b4da5f9744d63af4db7d3b0145830\">Pollard knocked Stevan Ridley briefly unconscious on a helmet-to-helmet collision</a> in the fourth quarter. The running back fumbled and Baltimore, leading 21-13 at the time, recovered at the New England 47. Their ensuing possession ended with a touchdown which extended the Ravens' lead to 15 points with just 10 minutes remaining – an advantage they would never relinquish.</p><p>There was nothing illegal about Pollard's hit – Ridley was running the ball and had himself lowered his head into the contact – but it is equally not the sort of play that the league wants to see celebrated at a time when the long-term damage caused by head injuries is at the top of the player safety agenda. </p><p>Afterwards, Pollard said: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"It's just a tackle. It's football. He broke a hole and we filled. That's fine. That's football. I hope he's okay. We're competitive in the moment. But when everything calms down you want that guy to be okay.\"</p></blockquote><p>Last week Pollard had struck a similar note, telling NFL.com he did not derive any joy from his reputation of doing damage to the Patriots' players: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Anything that I've done, I don't celebrate with that. I don't laugh when people come up to me and call me 'The Brady Killer'. I don't laugh at that. I'm looking at a man that I respect. I respect Tom Brady with everything that I have. I know his story, I respect him, first of all, because he's a man. I respect him because he's a player. Honestly, I don't get excited because of that. When it's all said and done, that man had to do the treatment, he had to do everything else to come back. Nothing is done maliciously.\"</p></blockquote><p>Ridley, encouragingly, walked off the field under his own power yesterday, though the long-term damage of a single hit like that may never be ascertained. What we do know is that once again a Bernard Pollard hit dealt New England devastating short-term damage.</p><h2>We have likely seen the last of Tony Gonzalez</h2><p>One of the most heart-breaking images of Sunday night was that of the Falcons tight end Tony Gonzalez – perhaps the greatest ever to play his position – slumped forwards on a small chair in front of his locker at the Georgia Dome. Once again Gonzalez had more than done his part, catching eight passes for 78 yards and a fine touchdown – for which he had timed his cut perfectly to move away from his defender before making a falling grab in the front of the end zone.</p><p>Gonzalez did not give firm confirmation of his retirement, but he did make it pretty clear that he is still leaning in that direction: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"It's probably the last time I'm going to wear that uniform. I didn't want to take it off, to tell you the truth. All good things come to an end and, like I said all season long, this is probably my last one. What an unbelievable ride.\"</p></blockquote><p>He insisted that he would have \"no regrets - not one\" if he did choose this moment to walk away, adding: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.\"</p></blockquote><p>The rest of us are instead left feeling sorry for ourselves at the thought of never again getting to watch a player who re-defined his position – blazing a trail for pass-catching tight ends. His 1,242 career receptions are second only to Jerry Rice. He leads the next-best tight end, Shannon Sharpe, by more than 400 catches. In this, his 16th season in the league, he reeled in 107 balls for 1,059 yards and 10 touchdowns (including the postseason).</p><p>Nobody doubts that Gonzalez could come back and play to a high level again next year, and the Falcons undoubtedly wish he would. But after finally recording the first playoff win of his career last week, the only thing that could bring Gonzalez back would be the desire to win a Super Bowl. Atlanta are well positioned to be a contender again, but even for a good team, it is a long, arduous road to get to that point. </p><p>It is his prerogative to decide that he has had enough, that the time has come to move on – to give his body a break and walk away. Even if the rest of us quietly wish that he wouldn't. </p><h2>Quick Hits</h2><p>• Picture of the weekend: <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5977451/colin-kaepernicks-parents-posed-in-front-of-a-statue-depicting-the-atlanta-falcons-giving-their-son-a-wedgie\">Colin Kaepernick's parents pose in front of a statue of him being given an enormous wedgie by an Atlanta Falcon</a>. </p><p>• <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/billboard-england-says-ray-lewis-retirement-party-coming-200250322--nfl.html;_ylt=AptQJqJloa231U78x_lPG.pYYsp_;_ylu=X3oDMTE5Y2NtNW8yBG1pdANCbG9ncyBJbmRleARwb3MDNDIEc2VjA01lZGlhQmxvZ0luZGV4;_ylg=X3oDMTFpMm9iMzh1BGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdANibG9nBHB0A3NlY3Rpb25z;_ylv=3\">Ray Lewis 1, Authors of this New England billboard 0</a>. </p><p>• The weekend's lowest note arrived in the hours after San Francisco's win at the Georgia Dome. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8863456/2013-nfl-playoffs-fan-stabbed-neck-georgia-dome-nfc-championship-game-san-francisco-49ers-atlanta-falcons-report\">An Atlanta Falcons fan was reported stabbed in the neck </a>after getting into an altercation with a 49ers fan near to the stadium, though he was later said to be in a stable condition. </p><p>• <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=ca90d95204804bd89783b5c958b6df88\">Tom Brady performs the sort of sliding tackle that would get you sent off in the other kind of football</a>. </p><p>• <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=7831fc26d00c4be7b136bdc2eec230c5\">Tantrum of the weekend belongs to Jim Harbaugh, whose toys finished up a long way from the pram</a> after officials upheld an admittedly highly questionable call stating that Harry Douglas had completed a catch on third down late in the fourth quarter. </p><p>• One enormous question for San Francisco to address over the next fortnight: how do you solve a problem like David Akers? The kicker had already missed more field goals this season than anybody else in the league, and on another day <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000128701/Akers-misses-Samuel-lets-him-hear-it\">his failure to convert from 38 yards midway through the third quarter</a> could have been the difference between winning and losing. Going into a Super Bowl with a kicker you cannot trust is not the sort of spot that anybody wants to be in – least of all a team who blew the NFC title game last year with the help of some critical special teams gaffes. </p><p>• All eight of the NFL's head coaching vacancies have now been filled, but <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000127869/article/no-africanamerican-nfl-head-coaches-hired-in-2013\">there is consternation around the league that none went to an African-American</a>. The Rooney Rule obliges all teams to interview at least one minority candidate, but of course all are free to hire as they see fit. The issue is an incredibly delicate one, with teams well within their rights to decide themselves which coach best suits their team's needs – but the league battling with a huge perception problem. Following the sackings of Romeo Crennel and Lovie Smith, there will be just three African-American head coaches in the NFL next year.</p><p><strong><em>Over the next two weeks we will have all the build up to the Super Bowl and extensive live coverage of the game itself.
