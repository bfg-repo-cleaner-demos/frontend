        "headline":"NFL inquiry: Miami Dolphins rookies allege racial and financial abuse",
        "body":"<p>The National Football League has launched an inquiry into alleged locker-room bullying at the Miami Dolphins, including claims that one junior player was racially abused and that lower-paid newcomers were expected to finance the expensive luxury lifestyles of multi-millionaire teammates.</p> <p>Club officials suspended Richie Incognito, a senior offensive guard, for “conduct detrimental to the team” after receiving a formal complaint from representatives of Jonathan Martin, a young player who walked out during a training session a week ago and who has not returned to Miami since.</p> <p>Incognito, a self-described “wild child” on his Twitter profile, is alleged to have sent Martin a series of threatening text messages and at least one voicemail in which he<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9926139/richie-incognito-miami-dolphins-used-slurs-messages-jonathan-martin\"> called Martin a &quot;half nigger&quot;, according to ESPN. </a>They added that the “intimidation” stretched back into the 2012 season.</p> <p>The wider inquiry by NFL officials is also expected to look into an alleged culture of bullying in the Dolphins locker room, especially charges that rookie players who are paid the league minimum salary of $390,000 were almost bankrupted by the financial burden imposed on them by veteran players.</p> <p>One of the reported claims against Incognito, which he has denied, is that he pressured Martin, a left tackle in his second year with the Dolphins, to pay $15,000 towards an unofficial players’ trip to Las Vegas that he did not attend.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another senior Dolphins player posted on Twitter a photograph of teammates enjoying a lavish seafood dinner with the caption: “Everything tastes better when rookies pay for it.”</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JaredOdrick98/statuses/396497315357523968\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Everything tastes better when rookies pay for it <a href=\"http://t.co/KGaisEfap2\">pic.twitter.com/KGaisEfap2</a></p>— Jared Odrick (@JaredOdrick98) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaredOdrick98/statuses/396497315357523968\">November 2, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>A colleague tweeted that he had seen a dinner bill for $30,000, which the junior players were expected to pay, prompting one anonymous participant to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/11/04/3729152/incognito-dolphins-push-back-against.html\">tell the Miami Herald&nbsp;</a>that several seniors on the team used their rookie colleagues as their “personal ATMs”.</p> <p>On Monday, a spokesman for the Dolphins referred media inquiries to the official club website, which contained a series of three statements released through the day on Sunday as events unfolded.</p> <p>In the first, the club’s tone appeared defiant. The statement did say that accusations of player misconduct were always taken seriously, but it denied that the NFL Players’ Association was investigating and included a line that said: “The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally.”</p> <p>Later, after Martin’s representatives filed his formal complaint, a second statement announced that an internal review would take place, and that the club had asked the NFL to “conduct an objective and thorough review.”</p> <p>“As an organisation, we are committed to a culture of team-first accountability and respect for one another,” it said.</p> <p>Finally, the club announced its indefinite suspension of Incognito, a decision it said it believed was: “in the best interest of the organisation at this time”.</p> <p>Incognito, 30, is in the final year of a three-year, $11m contract with the Dolphins. When the allegations against him were first aired on ESPN on Sunday, he ranted on Twitter against Adam Schefter, the journalist who reported them, and dismiss the claims as “lies”.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Stop slandering my name. You hide behind ‘sources’ who are not man enough to put their name behind the BS you report,” he wrote in one tweet. In another, he tells Schefter: “Enough is enough. If you or any of the agents you sound off for have a problem with me, you know where to find me.”</p> <p>In the last message posted before just before his suspension was announced, Incognito wrote: “I want my name CLEARED.” His account has been inactive since.</p> <p>On the field, Incognito’s suspension comes at a crucial time for the Dolphins, who beat Cincinnati in overtime on Halloween night to end a three-game losing streak and reach the halfway point of the season at 4–4, still with hopes of reaching the end-of-season play-offs.</p> <p>Martin has told friends he plans to take a few weeks away from the club to deal with “emotional issues,” according to Fox Sports. Joe Philbin, the Dolphins head coach, and several teammates have said he would be welcomed back “with open arms”.</p> <p>DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFL Players’ Association, said his organisation would “take a hard look, and stay on top of” Martin’s situation.</p> <p>An official statement from the NFL on Sunday said the league had been talking to the Dolphins since last Monday, when Martin, 24, left the club after an alleged lunchtime prank in which a group of players stood up and walked off as he joined their table with his tray of food.</p> <p>“We have been in contact with the team on this matter since last week and we will conduct a thorough review,” the statement said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647963|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|c28d1c9f669ff9778844a5e5cd8886f6709d5ac3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Houston Texans coach Gary Kubiak \"awake and coherent\" after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/03/houston-texans-coach-gary-kubiak-collapses-on-field\">collapsing on the field at half-time of game against Indianapolis Colts</a>.</p> <p>Kubiak&nbsp;hunched over and dropped to his knees at the 24-yard line and was immediately surrounded by medical personnel. He was lifted off the field on a stretcher and taken to an ambulance.</p> <p>\"We were all very worried,\" quarterback Case Keenum said. \"When we went back out they told us he was ... stable. We were all upset about that but trying to stay focused at the same time.\"</p> <p>The Texans didn't reveal what was wrong with&nbsp;Kubiak, but did say he didn't have a heart attack. The team said the 52-year-old coach, a former NFL quarterback who calls the team's plays, was conscious and was with his family as he was taken to the hospital.</p> <p>\"He had an episode; he was light-headed and dizzy,\" Houston general manager Rick Smith said. \"He was evaluated by a number of specialists ... he is awake and coherent.\"</p> <p>\"Hopefully, Gary will be back with us tomorrow.\"</p> <p>As the Houston Texans trickled into the locker room at halftime and learned that their coach&nbsp;had collapsed leaving the field, their excitement over a big first-half lead quickly disintegrated into dread.</p> <p>They were soon informed that he was in stable condition, but the rattled team unraveled in the second half as Indianapolis rallied for a 27-24 victory Sunday night.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of unknown,\" said defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who coached the team after halftime. \"Everything was unknown as to what was going on and what happened to Kube.\"</p> <p>Up 21-3 when&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;collapsed, the Texans struggled after halftime for their sixth straight loss.</p> <p>Kubiak's collapse came a day after Denver Broncos coach John Fox was hospitalized in North Carolina as he awaits aortic value replacement surgery. The 58-year-old Fox will have surgery in a few days and will miss several weeks while recuperating.&nbsp;Fox had been told earlier about his heart condition and was hoping to put off the operation until February.</p> <p>On Saturday, Fox became dizzy playing golf near his offseason home in Charlotte and was taken to a hospital, where tests revealed he couldn't wait any longer to have the surgery.</p> <p>Kubiak&nbsp;has long been known as a top offensive coach, mentoring quarterbacks in Denver under Mike Shanahan and now Matt Schaub and Case Keenum in Houston.&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;has had no known public health problems.</p> <p>Kubiak&nbsp;was hired in 2006, along with general manager Rick Smith, after the Texans finished with two wins from 16 games. Smith spent 10 years with&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;while the coach was offensive coordinator of the Broncos. Smith was Denver's defensive assistant for four seasons before moving into the front office for his last six years with the Broncos.&nbsp;The pair have transformed the Texans, who began to play in 2002, from league laughingstock to contender.</p> <p>His original contract was due to expire after the 2010 season, but owner Bob McNair has stepped up to keep&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;and defended him several times amid the bumps.&nbsp;Last year, the Texans announced contract extensions for both Smith and&nbsp;Kubiak, rewarding them for taking the team to the playoffs last year for the first time.&nbsp;Kubiak's three-year agreement has him under contract through 2014.</p> <p>Kubiak&nbsp;made his mark as Denver's offensive coordinator under Mike Shanahan, winning two Super Bowls. An eighth-round pick out of Texas A&amp;M, he spent nine years as John Elway's backup. He finished his career 4-1 as a starter, all in emergency relief of Elway.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421627352|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|3dc85f25b4f34d5f7c9ed08d7e7465472856c000 -->",

        "headline":"Nick Foles is seventh NFL quarterback to throw seven touchdown passes",
        "body":"<p>Nick Foles didn't know he had etched his name in NFL history until after he came out of Philadelphia's 49-20 win over the Raiders. That must have been because he was too busy shredding Oakland's defense to keep up with his impressive statistics.</p> <p>Foles equaled an NFL mark with seven touchdown passes and threw for 406 yards on Sunday to revitalize Philadelphia's struggling offense.</p> <p>\"A couple people came up to me and said that I tied the record with seven touchdowns,\" Foles said. \"It's a great honor. Hats off to our guys for doing a great job.\"</p> <p>The backup quarterback connected three times with Riley Cooper to become the seventh passer in NFL history with seven TD tosses in a game. Peyton Manning did it for Denver on opening night this season against Baltimore.</p> <p>Foles also threw scoring passes to Brent Celek, Zach Ertz, LeSean McCoy and DeSean Jackson and the Eagles, with four wins from nine games, looked nothing like the offense that failed to score a touchdown in each of the past two weeks.</p> <p>\"Every defense the past couple of weeks has been stopping us,\" McCoy said. \"So today we were kind of feeling bottled up and we released everything. It's tough when you're not winning and you're not putting points up.\"</p> <p>Among the other 10 NFL games on Sunday, the Seahawks produced the greatest comeback in the club's history to beat the Buccaneers 27-24 in overtime, the Chiefs extended their winning stretch to nine games equaling a club record to open the season with a 23-13 result against the Bills, and Nick Folk maintained his 100 percent accuracy for the season with four field goals in the Jets' 26-20 upset win over the New Orleans Saints.</p> <p>In the night game, the Colts rallied from an 18-point deficit to win 27-24 after&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/03/houston-texans-coach-gary-kubiak-collapses-on-field\">Texans&nbsp;coach Gary Kubiak collapsed leaving the field at half time and had to be taken by ambulance to hospital</a>.</p> <p>The&nbsp;Texans&nbsp;didn't reveal what was wrong with Kubiak, but did say he didn't have a heart attack. The team said the 52-year-old coach was conscious and was with his family as he was taken to the hospital.</p> <p>Andrew Luck got off to a slow start before throwing three second-half touchdowns to T.Y. Hilton as the AFC South-leading Colts secured their sixth win in eight games.&nbsp;Case Keenum threw for 350 yards and three touchdowns in his second career start, but had trouble moving the offense after halftime as the&nbsp;Texans, up 21-3 when Kubiak collapsed, lost their sixth straight game.</p> <p>At Oakland, Foles completed 22 of 28 passes as he frequently exploited mismatches and blown coverages, starting with a 42-yard quick pass to Cooper on the opening drive when the Raiders had two defenders trying to match up with three receivers.</p> <p>McCoy took a short pass and ran 25 yards untouched for his score in the third quarter and Jackson raced past Mike Jenkins on his 46-yard touchdown later in the third.</p> <p>Foles then tied the record with a 5-yard pass to Cooper with 4:28 remaining in the third quarter, matching the mark also held by Sid Luckman, Adrian Burk, George Blanda, Y.A. Tittle and Joe Kapp. Burk did it for the Eagles in 1954 against Washington.</p> <p>With more than a quarter to go to break the record, Foles was unable to get the Eagles back into the end zone on the next two drives before being replaced by Matt Barkley.</p> <p>\"I know what the record is,\" Kelly said. \"But this isn't about records, it's about going out and getting a win. If I put Nick out there to try to get a record and he gets hurt, that's being silly. Records are meant to broken when they're supposed to be broken.\"</p> <p>That was about all Foles couldn't do in his first game since being held to 80 yards on 29 passes before leaving with a concussion two weeks ago against Dallas.</p> <p>Foles only got another shot this week because regular starter Michael Vick reinjured his hamstring in a loss to the New York Giants last week. But now, it will be tough to take out Foles, who has 13 touchdown passes and no interceptions this season.</p> <p>\"Everybody started acting like his career was over after that Dallas game but they forgot that he had played some good football before that,\" center Jason Kelce said. \"A lot of that criticism will probably be halted for at least one week.\"</p> <p>At Seattle, Steven Hauschka kicked a 27-yard field goal with 8:11 left in overtime as the Seahawks overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Buccaneers.</p> <p>Trailing 21-0, Russell Wilson rallied Seattle (8-1). He threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin with 1:51 left in regulation to pull the Seahawks even. Wilson then led Seattle on a nine-play, 51-yard drive in overtime capped by Hauschka's winner.</p> <p>The Chiefs gave up a season-worst 470 yards to Buffalo, but had enough for a ninth straight win with Sean Smith returning an interception 100 yards for a touchdown and Tamba Hali scoring on an 11-yard fumble return.&nbsp;The Chiefs held an opponent to 17 points or fewer for the ninth straight time matching the NFL record set by the Atlanta Falcons in 1977.</p> <p>The Browns had a 24-18 win over the Ravens their first over Baltimore since 2007 with Jason Campbell throwing three touchdown passes, and the Patriots beat the Steelers 55-31 with Tom Brady throwing for season highs of 432 yards and four touchdowns.</p> <p>At Arlington, Tony Romo threw for 337 yards and two touchdowns, including the go-ahead score to Dwayne Harris with 35 seconds left, as the Cowboys beat the Vikings 27-23.</p> <p>The Panthers recorded their fourth straight win with a 34-109 victory over the Falcons, Washington edged the Charges 30-24 in overtime with Darrel Young scoring three times, and the Titans had a 28-21 win over Jeff Fisher's Rams.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421626346|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|d682103b7ca14ecdc3a1260d7c4af9e96a8cad01 -->",

        "body":"<p>Houston coach Gary&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;collapsed leaving the field at halftime of the Texans' game Sunday night against Indianapolis and was taken by ambulance to a hospital.</p> <p>As the&nbsp;52-year-old coach&nbsp;headed back to the locker room with his side leading at the half-time break, he collapsed forward by the 20-yard line at Reliant Stadium. He hunched over and dropped to his knees and was carried off the field on a stretcher.</p> <p>A statement from the Texans said: \"Coach&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;has been taken to a local hospital, he is conscious and his family is with him. The head coach was transported to a local hospital in an ambulance as a precaution.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>The Texans later said that Kubiak did not suffer a heart attack.</p> <p>The Texans led the Colts 21-3.&nbsp;The second half of the match continued, with Texans defensive co-ordinator Wade Phillips taking over&nbsp;Kubiak's duties.&nbsp;</p> <p>The game was televised by NBC, whose touchline reporter Michelle Tafoya was nearby when the incident happened and reported that&nbsp;Kubiak&nbsp;\"was speaking, but also looked to be in extraordinary pain\".&nbsp;</p> <p>Kubiak is the second NFL head coach to be hospitalized this weekend.&nbsp;</p> <p>Denver Broncos coach John Fox was taken to a hospital in the Charlotte North Carolina on Saturday after feeling light-headed while playing golf.&nbsp;After testing and further observation, it was determined Fox should undergo surgery for an aortic heart valve replacement early next week.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"He will take a leave of absence from coaching for at least the next several weeks,\" the Broncos said in a statement.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421589884|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|e0bcad0e48396b5536b6b59ceb8db0e2f9e8e99b -->",

Perhaps not, but it has certainly won games for the Chiefs this season, and today’s win over Buffalo might be the clearest case yet. The Bills looked poised to take a 17-3 lead early in the second half, but instead Sean Smith intercepted third-string quarterback Jeff Tuel and took the ball back 100 yards for a touchdown. Then Tamba Hali took a fumble back to the house, and that was all she wrote. Kansas City did not score an offensive touchdown, but they did not need to. The sceptics will remain, but one way or another this team is 9-0.</p> <p>- The Dallas Cowboys still look like the most likely team to win the NFC West, and at 5-4 they do at least have a winning record, unlike their division rivals. But does anyone really believe in this team? A more ruthless team than the Vikings would have punished that Romo interception late in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>- Adrian Peterson remains the best running back in the NFL. Probably one of the best to have ever lived. He might be playing on a bad team right now, but that 11-yard run to put his team on top in the fourth was just ridiculous. It is a privilege every time to watch that guy play. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276c212e4b01fc33230d593\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:37:35.825Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fantasy update</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So, who were the star performers from today’s early games?

Washington beat the Chargers: 30-24!</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Who else could it be but Darrel Young, the Washington fullback and today’s most unlikely hero? On third-and-inches from the four-yard line, he bulldozes his way over the right-hand side of the line and into the end zone to seal the overtime victory.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276bf5ce4b0ad7c52b6063d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:25:59.163Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Washington knocking on the door …</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>… very nice drive being constructed by the home team here, and Alfred Morris very nearly went in just now on a nine-yard run around left tackle. Second-and-one at the San Diego four-yard line.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276be13e4b0ad7c52b60639\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:20:28.835Z\">4.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">So …</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>… Just one of the early kickoff games still going: the one in Washington. It’s 24-24, we’re into overtime and Alfred Morris just ripped off a nice run to take the home team across halfway. This is the first possession of overtime, so bear in mind that if his team only kick a field goal, San Diego would get the chance to respond.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276bd73e4b01fc33230d58b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:17:44.108Z\">4.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Saints 20-26 Jets</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Rex wins the Ryan Bowl at at MetLife Stadium, leading his team to an upset victory over the heavily-favoured Saints. Rather than Rob’s New Orleans defense, it was the corresponding New York unit that stole the show, twice intercepting Drew Brees and limiting the Saints’ running backs to 50 yards on 11 carries. The Jets move to 5-4, and stay alive in the AFC East.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:17:59.974Z\">at 4.17pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5276bc70e4b0ad7c52b60634\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:13:25.680Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal! Chargers 24-24 Washington</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>San Diego thought they had a game-winning score – with Danny Woodhead initially awarded a touchdown after he was forced out of bounds right by the pylon with 29 seconds left in the game – but officials overturned that call on review, and the Chargers were unable to punch the ball into the end zone despite having three attempts from the one-yard line. Instead Nick Novak makes the 19-yard field goal, and this game is going to overtime. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276bbaae4b0ad7c52b60632\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:10:15.235Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Vikings 23-27 Cowboys</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Minnesota’s unlikely upset never comes to pass.

It wasn’t pretty, and at times it appeared they might lose to a Jeff Tuel-led Bills team, but when your defense can not only shut down opponents but also put up two scores in a game, you’re always in with a shout.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276babee4b01fc33230d585\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:06:11.624Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Falcons 10-34 Panthers</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A rout in the NFC South, as Carolina confirm their upward trajectory, and Atlanta’s spiral continues.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276ba50e4b01fc33230d583\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:04:51.737Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">TOUCHDOWN! Vikings 23-27 Cowboys</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>For a moment there it looked like the story of this game was going to be yet another Tony Romo choke job, after the Dallas quarterback threw an interception to leave his team three points down and out of possession deep in the fourth quarter, but he makes amends by orchestrating a 90-yard scoring drive here, capped with a seven-yard pass to Dwayne Harris. With just 35 seconds left in the game, the Cowboys have surely snatched victory here from the jaws of defeat.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b9a5e4b0ad7c52b60630\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:01:30.723Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Titans 28-21 St Louis</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Yup, that’s now official.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b978e4b01fc33230d582\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T21:00:48.332Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turnover on downs!

Chiefs 23-13 Bills</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Still no offensive touchdown for the Chiefs, and quarterback Alex Smith has thrown for just 124 yards, but they are closing in on a ninth consecutive victory to begin this season, after Ryan Succop converted his third kick of the day – this one from 39 yards.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b6bee4b0ad7c52b60629\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:49:07.407Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">TOUCHDOWN! Titans 28-21 Rams</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Yet another rushing score in St Louis. Chris Johnson had no rushing touchdowns coming into today, but he gets his second of the afternoon here, breaking free for a 19-yard score after the Titans set themselves up with a short field with a fumble recovery.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b614e4b01fc33230d57d\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:46:18.913Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">TOUCHDOWN! Chargers 21-24 Washington</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Just over four minutes left to play in Washington, but this one is not over yet. Philip Rivers picks out a wide open Keenan Allen streaking into the end zone by the left sideline for a 16-yard score.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b50ee4b01fc33230d57b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:42:00.589Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">PICK SIX! Falcons 10-31 Panthers</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Put a fork in the Falcons, they are done. Matt Ryan throws his third interception of the day, and this one is returned to the end zone by Drayton Florence for 38 yards down the left sideline.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b4aae4b01fc33230d579\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:40:16.577Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">TOUCHDOWN! Vikings 23-20 Cowboys</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>What? How?! But … no, really, how??? Adrian Peterson puts the Vikings up over the Cowboys with an utterly impossible 11-yard touchdown run, appearing to be tackled by two defenders at about the five-yard line, but somehow landing back on his feet without ever going to ground, before dragging said defenders with him into the end zone. That play, simply put, did not make any sense. But when Adrian Peterson is involved, these things often don’t.</p> <p>Oh, and then Blair Walsh misses the extra point! The TV producers were so sure that he was going to make it, they had already updated their graphic to show the Vikings as 24-20 ahead, but the kick actually sailed wide right.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:43:23.577Z\">at 3.43pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b3f2e4b01fc33230d578\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:37:11.116Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal!

Falcons 10-24 Panthers</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Atlanta refused to trade Tony Gonzalez before this week’s deadline, on the grounds that they did not yet believe that their season was done. The evidence, increasingly, suggests otherwise. The tight end has had a strong day in Carolina, catching five passes for 77 yards and a score, but his team trail by two touchdowns with nine minutes left in the game after Cam Newton runs it in himself from eight yards.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b2d6e4b0ad7c52b60621\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:32:30.563Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal!

Fantasy owners should be aware that Stacy is having a huge day – with 124 yards on the ground so far, as well as two touchdowns.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b184e4b01fc33230d573\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:26:54.512Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">TOUCHDOWN! Chiefs 20-13 Bills</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Kansas City have done very little on offense in this game, but when your defense is this good, you don’t really need to. Another defensive score here for the Chiefs, as Tamba Hali scoops up a TJ Graham fumble and runs it back into the end zone from the Bills’ 11-yard line. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276b0eee4b01fc33230d570\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T20:24:28.662Z\">3.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal!

For this reason he is unstoppable when protected - no matter his receivers - but not unstoppable if you break the line (ie Giants Superbowls). In this way I think he is like Montana.</p> <p>The Patriots have been one of the smartest teams too, in that they build a rounded team, never forgetting the lines and the use of veterans, and allowing rookies to quickly fill roles.</p> <p>Brady is getting a bit older, and his team is in flux. There are mistakes. yet he is on a 6-2 team. It is a slow decline, not a crisis. His stats reflect his age and the flux, but they are still winning.</p> <p>When Brady starts getting sacked 5+ times, then there will be a real problem.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p>A lot of valid points there, on all fronts. It’s always tricky when successful athletes start to age in team sports. In individual sports, you are simply good enough, or you are not, but in teams it is always hard to know how much is down to the player in question. And how long do you keep showing faith in someone just because he is ‘your guy’, and you know what he has done for you in the past?

Typically you expect a pick six to involve at least some element of a run-back, but Robert Griffin III is instead intercepted in his own end zone by San Diego’s Sean Lissemore, the quarterback having been backed up against his own goal-line by Mike Scifres’s excellent punt.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276976ce4b0020e1b719a2c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T18:38:43.700Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal!

Instead Matt Ryan dumps the ball off to Jacquizz Rodgers in the flats, and the back is wrapped up a long way short.

The Bills' third-string quarterback announces himself to the NFL by launching an exocet down the right sideline for Marquise Goodwin, who catches in stride and races away 59 yards for the score.

Namely: what is wrong with Tom Brady?</p> <p>So far this season, Brady is posting his worst-ever completion percentage (55.7%), yards per attempt (5.94), and passer rating (74.9) figures. Of course he has been working with a substantially weakened receiving corps - one that lost four of its top five receivers from last season (Wes Welker, Danny Woodhead, Brandon Lloyd and Aaron Hernandez) and has also had to do without the fifth, Rob Gronkowski until very recently due to injury. </p> <p>But at a certain point Brady does also have to take responsibility for some erratic performances. His former wide receiver Troy Brown even argued during the quarterback's first-half struggles against Miami last week that it might soon be time to pull Brady out of the game. That is certainly going too far for me, but it does not make it unreasonable to ask: do the Patriots have a Tom Brady problem? And if so, what is the solution?</p> <p>Let me know what you think on Twitter <a href=\"twitter.com/Paolo_Bandini\">@Paolo_Bandini</a>, by email at <a href=\"mailto:paolo.bandini.freelance@guardian.co.uk\">paolo.bandini.freelance@guardian.co.uk</a> or in the comments section below.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5276898ce4b0be3ac2bf4ba0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T17:44:20.658Z\">12.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">John Fox</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The other big story in the NFL right now relates to the health of Denver Broncos head coach John Fox, who will undergo aortic valve replacement surgery on Tuesday after being rushed to hospital over the weekend. The team has said that Fox will be out for &quot;several weeks&quot; but given that this is an open-heart procedure, even speculating about a return feels like putting the cart before the horse. This is very serious surgery, and one would hope that everyone's first priority will simply be to make sure that everything is done to ensure that Fox can eventually return to good health.</p> <p>We are in the middle of an NFL season, though, so contingencies must also be made for his team. The Broncos are yet to announced who will fill in as interim head coach, but defensive co-ordinator Jack Del Rio, who previously served as head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, is the current favourite. How it will affect the team remains to be seen. They are, at least, not in action this weekend, and so have a few more days to put together a plan. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52768613e4b0020e1b719a21\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T17:33:08.716Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Injury updates</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Some very interesting developments revealed by the injury reports submitted around the league this morning. Here are the biggest headlines:</p> <p>- Jeff Tuel will start at quarterback for the Buffalo Bills after Thad Lewis was unable to recover sufficiently from his rib injury in time to face the Chiefs. A lot of people had been predicting that this might be Kansas City's first defeat of the season, but can the Bills really win with a third-string signal caller taking the snaps?</p> <p>- Zac Stacy is active and will start at running back for the St Louis Rams, despite the ankle sprain he suffered on Monday against Seattle. His backup, Daryl Richardson, is inactive, meaning that rookie Bennie Cunningham should see some action in relief of Stacy.</p> <p>- Saints tight end Jimmy Graham missed practice time this week with a foot injury, but he is good to go against the Jets. Wide receiver Marques Colston, however, is out with a knee complaint.</p> <p>- Roddy White's gammy hamstring will keep him out of a third-straight game for the Falcons, who are pretty much into do-or-die mode already in this week's game against the Panthers. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52768562e4b0020e1b719a20\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T17:21:13.405Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pick Six contest</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Just about 40 minutes left to kickoff, and that is also the time you have left to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/01/nfl-talkboard-week-nine-chiefs-bills\">make your predictions for this week's games over on the NFL Talkboard</a>.

Already this season we’ve watched Peyton and Eli Manning go head-to-head in New York, and you only have to go back as far as February for the latest instalment of the Harbowl. Now it’s the turn of the Ryan boys, as the New York Jets head coach Rex seeks to unlock his twin brother Rob’s New Orleans Saints defense.</p> <p>The pair shared a handshake and warm pat on the back on the field a few moments ago, but affections will soon be put aside. In fact, the New York Daily News speculated this morning that <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/myers-rob-rock-rex-future-jets-article-1.1505015\">a strong performance from Rob’s unit today could even go a long way towards costing Rex his job</a>.</p> <p>The Jets have overperformed to this point, reaching the halfway stage at a respectable 4-4, when many had expected them to struggle in the wake of a tempestuous offseason. Instead they have alternated wins and losses since week one, and if the current pattern holds, they should emerge victorious this afternoon. Given the calibre of their opposition, it seems highly unlikely.</p> <p>That is not all we have to look forward to, of course, although a heavy round of byes this week mean that there are only six games in the 1pm ET time slot. Here is the full list:</p> <p>Kansas City Chiefs @ Buffalo Bills</p> <p>Atlanta Falcons @ Carolina Panthers</p> <p>Minnesota Vikings @ Dallas Cowboys</p> <p>New Orleans Saints @ New York Jets</p> <p>Tennessee Titans @ St Louis Rams</p> <p>San Diego Chargers @ Washington</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-03T17:15:39.495Z\">at 12.15pm ET</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421559722|2013-11-05T11:03:54Z|76d535b64fb57e16a79093a32623ed809981b4ca -->",

        "body":"<p>Thousands of people lined up on Saturday for the chance to take home a piece of the iconic, but dilapidated Houston Astrodome, once dubbed the \"eighth wonder of the world\".</p><p>The \"yard sale\" and auction got under way in the morning at the Reliant Centre, the convention centre adjacent to the now-closed stadium. More than 4,000 people were inside or waiting to get in by about 10am on Saturday, Reliant Park officials said, the line twisting through the centre and out the door.</p><p>For those looking for a cheap memento, a 12-inch by 12-inch piece of AstroTurf cost $20. Seats were going for $200 a pair, and larger items, including autographed lockers and dugout benches, were to be auctioned off. The first item up for auction — a set of 10 pretzel warmers from an old concession stand — went for $50.</p><p>Other items for sale included projectors, VCRs and turnstiles.</p><p>Marcos Escobar bought four squares of AstroTurf and two pairs of seats. He recalled fond memories of watching Houston Astros baseball games and Houston Oilers football games there with his father.</p><p>\"I wanted to come out here and get something before they tear it down,\" Escobar said.</p><p>Opened in 1965, the Astrodome was the world's first multipurpose domed stadium. It was home to the Astros and the Oilers. But no professional sports team has played there since 1999 and the stadium has been closed to all events since 2009.</p><p>Voters will decide on Tuesday whether to approve a referendum authorising up to $217m in bonds to turn the stadium into a giant convention centre and exhibition space. Houston-area leaders have said that if the referendum fails, the Astrodome will probably be razed.</p><p>A poll conducted in mid-September by Rice University in Houston found 45% of likely voters supported the referendum proposition, with 35% opposing it and nearly 20% still undecided.</p><p>With its fate still undecided, the Astrodome was awash with nostalgia on Saturday. Some people showed up in the Astros' famous orange-striped \"rainbow\" jerseys from the 1970s. Others wore old Oilers caps, commemorating a team that left Houston for Nashville in the late 1990s after failing to get a new stadium.</p><p>Lorenzo Fuentes recalled paying $4 for tickets to games as he finished buying four squares of turf. \"I have a lot of big memories of the Astrodome,\" Fuentes said. He added that his wife did not necessarily understand, and told him that anything he brought home from the stadium would have to stay in the garage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421519440|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|de0268310e2be6ce323758a9e8ef5fc60bdb93d0 -->",

        "body":"<p>We begin with an apology. Last week I made a great play of declaring that nobody had called all six games correctly in our Pick Six contest. I was wrong. Somehow in all the tallying up we had managed to miss out <strong>urban_adventurer</strong>, who defied the odds by becoming the only person to nail all six predictions in a week when 19 contestants failed to even get a single one right. Here&rsquo;s hoping you&rsquo;ll join me in a belated round of congratulations.</p> <p>But we must not forget to applaud our perfect pickers from week eight, too. Hats off to <strong>amwill</strong>, <strong>Applespider</strong>, <strong>benheinitz</strong>, <strong>bms355</strong>, <strong>fallonyou</strong> and <strong>iaing </strong>for adding your names to the select group of six-pickers so far in 2013. Virtual fist bumps all round.</p> <p>Before we get into this week&rsquo;s games, a quick reminder to join me for our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/27/nfl-clockwatch-49ers-jaguars-london-special-live\">NFL Clockwatch</a> on Sunday at 1pm ET/6pm GMT. And check back again on Tuesday for our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/nfl-five-things-learned\">Five Things We Learned</a> look back over the weekend&rsquo;s games.</p> <p>And with that, off we go:</p> <h2>Tennessee Titans @ St Louis Rams (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm GMT)</h2> <p>The Rams&rsquo; defense showed up in a big way on Monday night, restricting the heavily-favoured Seattle Seahawks to just 135 yards of total offense, with 80 of those coming on a single reception by Golden Tate. St Louis consistently cut Marshawn Lynch down at the line of scrimmage, and sacked Russell Wilson seven times. But they still lost the game, failing to punch the ball into the end zone despite generating nearly three times as many yards as their opponents. The issue is at quarterback, where Kellen Clemens &ndash; filling in as the team's starter after Sam Bradford suffered a season-ending cruciate ligament tear &ndash; quite simply lacks the accuracy to make good throws in tight spaces inside the red zone. This game will mean a lot to Rams head coach Jeff Fisher, who held the same position with the Titans (or the Oilers, as they were known when he first arrived) for more than 16 years. But Tennessee have a good defense of their own, and I expect it to exploit Clemens&rsquo;s flaws.</p> <p><strong>Titans to win</strong></p> <h2>Kansas City Chiefs @ Buffalo Bills (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm GMT)</h2> <p>This has &lsquo;trap game&rsquo; written all over it. The Chiefs are a better team than the Bills but after eight consecutive wins, there exists a very real danger that they start to believe their own hype. They are not so good that they can afford to take opponents lightly &ndash; as last week&rsquo;s narrow victory over the Browns, who had a chance to win the game on their final possession, demonstrated. Everyone is talking about Denver in week 11 as the first real test of Kansas City&rsquo;s mettle, but the Bills are no pushovers. As well as winning three games this season, Buffalo have played both New England and Cincinnati extremely close, forcing the Bengals to overtime. There is a reason why the Las Vegas bookies have Kansas City as only a three-point favourite. Even so, I will side with the unbeaten team until I have a compelling reason to do otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Chiefs to win</strong></p> <h2>San Diego Chargers @ Washington (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm GMT)</h2> <p>Washington are still alive in the NFC East, despite having lost five of their first seven games. Division leaders Dallas are not far ahead at 4-4, and the Cowboys&rsquo; capacity for shooting themselves in the foot remains undiminished. But it is hard to know what to make of this Washington team, which put up 45 points en route to beating Chicago two weeks ago, and then cobbled together just 21 against Denver&rsquo;s flimsy defense on Sunday. Robert Griffin III&rsquo;s mechanics have clearly been affected by his knee injury, but the team&rsquo;s play-calling has also left a lot to be desired. If this game was in San Diego then I would feel confident in picking the Chargers, who have been more reliable on both sides of the ball, but this is a long road trip compounded by having to play in the early time slot.</p> <p><strong>Washington to win</strong></p> <h2>Philadelphia Eagles @ Oakland Raiders (Sunday 4.05pm ET/9.05pm GMT)</h2> <p>The Eagles&rsquo; quarterback carousel takes another spin, with Nick Foles back under center after Michael Vick aggravated his hamstring injury. Oakland are coming off a good win over Pittsburgh, although it was a highly uneven performance - the Raiders giving up 15 unanswered points and nearly blowing it all in the second half after building a 21-3 lead in the first. Quarterback Terrelle Pryor caught the eye with a 93-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, but he also completed just 10 of 19 passes for 88 yards on the day, as well as giving up two interceptions. The Eagles have a lot more weapons than Pittsburgh did, but once again the impact of cross-country travel comes into play.</p> <p><strong>Raiders to win</strong></p> <h2>Baltimore Ravens @ Cleveland Browns (Sunday 4.25pm ET/9.25pm GMT)</h2> <p>The Browns were once again an NFL punch-line this week, as Deadspin published details of their botched efforts to make their practice facility a more inspiring place. As part of a $5m renovation during the offseason, Cleveland had covered the walls in powerful quotations from leading public figures and sports personalities. But as Deadspin soon established, <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/the-new-browns-facilitys-walls-are-full-of-fake-quotes-1453698071\">the majority were &ldquo;misattributed, incorrectly transcribed, or indeterminately fraudulent&rdquo;</a>. There is nothing false about the improvement in this team, however &ndash; despite a 3-5 record. The Browns are on to their third quarterback this season in Jason Campbell, but have remained competitive regardless of who is taking the snaps. They have a very real opportunity to beat division rivals Baltimore this weekend for the first time since 2007. I think that they will.</p> <p><strong>Browns to win</strong></p> <h2>Indianapolis Colts @ Houston Texans (Sunday 8.30pm ET/Monday 1.30am GMT)</h2> <p>Case Keenum makes his second start at quarterback for the Texans in what might be their last chance to rescue this season. Lose on Sunday and Houston would already be four games out of first place in the AFC South, and a very long shot for a wildcard berth at 2-6. Indianapolis have challenges of their own to overcome in this game &ndash; their first without wide receiver Reggie Wayne since 2002. And Houston&rsquo;s defense remains a potent one; although the Texans have given up 27.7 points per game, that statistic is heavily influenced by the seven touchdowns they have surrendered on offense and special teams. If Keenum can avoid turnovers, this has the potential to be a very close game, but you do have to wonder what state the home team&rsquo;s running game will be in, with Arian Foster and Ben Tate battling injury.</p> <p><strong>Colts to win</strong></p> <h2>And the rest</h2> <p>Here are the rest of this week's games. These are not included in the Pick Six, but feel free to post your winners for these as well. If you do so then please keep them separate from your Pick Six predictions, as it will make life a lot easier when tallying up your scores.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p>1pm ET/6pm GMT</p> <p>Minnesota Vikings @ Dallas Cowboys</p> <p>New Orleans Saints @ New York Jets</p> <p>Atlanta Falcons @ Carolina Panthers</p> <p>4.05pm ET/9.05pm GMT</p> <p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Seattle Seahawks</p> <p>4.25pm ET/9.25pm GMT</p> <p>Pittsburgh Steelers @ New England Patriots</p> <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>8.30pm ET/Tuesday 1.30am GMT</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421418838|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|c8b20ebc71bab7d22f565f651794893a16137cc0 -->",

        "headline":"NFL meets with Native American representatives over use of 'Redskins'",
        "body":"<p>Washington's NFL team appears no closer to changing its name after a meeting between league officials and Native American representatives.</p> <p>\"We were somewhat disappointed, to say it mildly, that they continue to defend the use of the slur,\" said Ray Halbritter, a representative of the Oneida Indian Nation, referring to the team's continued use of the disputed term \"Redskins\" in its title.&nbsp;</p> <p>Halbritter spoke to reporters in New York on Wednesday after a meeting with NFL officials that did not include commissioner Roger Goodell or team owner Dan Snyder.</p> <p>Halbritter said the meeting was historic because it showed the NFL is willing to listen. But he said the officials present continued to defend the name citing the support it had from fans and its history.</p> <p>\"Despite the ridiculous assertions to the contrary, the use of the R-word is not a unifying force, nor does it convey honor or respect,\" Halbritter said. \"Quite the opposite. Washington's team name is the very word our people, American Indians, heard when they were threatened at gunpoint off their land and onto reservations.\"</p> <p>Oneida Indian Nation representatives provided the officials with a 17-page document of Native American organizations, reporters and politicians who support changing the name or have stopped using it. It also gave officials a study it commissioned to examine the public health consequences of the mascot.</p> <p>\"The use of the Washington mascot is in fact damaging and should be stopped,\" said psychologist and study author Michael Friedman. He said the use of the mascot is \"textbook discrimination.\"</p> <p>The movement to change the name was emboldened earlier this month when President Obama suggested that Snyder should <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/05/barack-obama-washington-redskins-name-change\">consider changing the name</a>. \"If I were the owner of the team and I knew that the name of my team, even if they've had a storied history, was offending a sizeable group of people, I'd think about changing it,\" Obama said.</p> <p>Snyder defended the name<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/09/washington-redskins-nfl-dan-snyder-letter\"> in a letter to fans</a> days later:&nbsp;&ldquo;Washington Redskins is more than a name we have called our football team for over eight decades. It is a symbol of everything we stand for: strength, courage, pride and respect &ndash; the same values we know guide Native Americans and which are embedded throughout their rich history as the original Americans.&rdquo;</p> <p>The San Francisco chronicle stopped referring to the team as the Redskins <a href=\"%20http:/www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/227813/report-sf-chronicle-will-stop-using-the-term-redskins/\">on 25 October</a>, following similar decisions by other publications and sports columnists.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421326277|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|056590d31d2bf6b0064dcb917b44c7a711ef2cd3 -->",

        "trailText":"<strong>Paolo Bandini:</strong> Detroit Lions&rsquo; Calvin Johnson makes Dallas Cowboys' Dez Bryant eat his words; Kansas City Chiefs go 8-0; Jacksonville Jaguars could go 0-16; trade talk",
        "headline":"NFL: 5 things we learned in Week Eight",
        "body":"<h2>The Lions know their way out of a hole</h2> <p>Despite his best efforts to atone for perceived sins, Dez Bryant still found himself cast as the villain. The Dallas Cowboys wide receiver had made the unforgiveable mistake last week of showing faith in his own abilities, saying that &ldquo;I believe I can do whatever [Detroit&rsquo;s Calvin Johnson] can do&rdquo;. He subsequently backtracked, telling reporters that he had not wanted to draw comparisons and even calling his opponent to explain his comments, but the media narrative was set. Bryant was the fool who had poked the bear, calling out the best receiver in the league.</p> <p>Not even the writers of Dynasty could have come up with a better script for what happened next. Bryant backed up his talk by reeling in two touchdowns as Dallas pushed out to a 10-point fourth quarter lead. But he also lost his cool, engaging in a pair of stand-up arguments with his quarterback Tony Romo on the sidelines.</p> <p>And then, just when it seemed our villain might prevail, his team were undone by one of the most dramatic comebacks in recent memory. Johnson, of course was at the heart of it. On Sunday the Lions receiver caught an incredible 14 passes for 329 yards &ndash; just seven shy of the NFL record. Willie &lsquo;Flipper&rsquo; Anderson had 336 yards receiving for the Los Angeles Rams in a game against the New Orleans Saints back in 1989, but it should be noted that 40 of those came during overtime.</p> <p>If it made for a neat story to portray Johnson&rsquo;s feats as a calculated response to Bryant, then the reality was more prosaic. Receivers can only put up such numbers if the balls keep getting thrown their way, and on Sunday the Lions had left themselves with no choice but to keep taking shots downfield, after committing four turnovers in the first three quarters. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw two interceptions in the first half, while Johnson and Reggie Bush each gave up a fumble in the second.</p> <p>With Detroit&rsquo;s defense failing to record even a single takeaway, the odds against a Lions victory were enormous. Only one team in the history of the NFL had ever won a game in which it posted a -4 turnover differential.</p> <p>The Lions became the second thanks to Johnson, but also thanks to Stafford. After leading two fourth-quarter scoring drives to keep his team within touching distance, the quarterback took over on offense for the last time at his own 20-yard line with 62 seconds and no time-outs remaining. He then completed four consecutive passes &ndash; two of them to Johnson &ndash; to rush his team down to the one-yard line.</p> <p>There, with time winding down, he delivered the game&rsquo;s defining play, screaming &ldquo;Clock! Clock! Clock!&rdquo; at his team-mates, while gesturing furiously for them to get into position so he could snap the ball. Both they and, more importantly, also Dallas&rsquo;s defenders, believed he was going to just spike it to allow their team time to huddle up and discuss what might be their final play.</p> <p>Instead, Stafford decided at the last moment to exploit the confusion, reaching out across the goal-line for the score before most players on both sides even knew what was happening. It was enough, with the extra point that followed, to seal a 31-30 win.</p> <p>Afterwards Johnson insisted that Bryant&rsquo;s words had no impact on his performance, saying that he had not even heard about them until the Cowboys player reached out to him by phone. Dallas&rsquo;s great mistake was not to give the Lions bulletin board material, but simply failing to press home their advantage against a team that seems not to know when it is beaten &ndash; even when it has spent half a game defeating itself.</p> <h2>Jacksonville might not win a game all year</h2> <p>The Kansas City Chiefs remain undefeated at the midway stage, improving to 8-0 with a 23-17 win over the Cleveland Browns. It is easy to forget, week-by-week, quite how remarkable that is. This is a team that never even held the lead in regulation during any of its first eight games last year. The transformation wrought by Andy Reid has been stunning.</p> <p>At the far end of the spectrum are the Jacksonville Jaguars, who remain without a win to their name. Unlike Minnesota, whose only victory so far this season came at Wembley Stadium, Shahid Khan&rsquo;s team failed to obtain any kind of lift from their visit to London. They were thrashed by the 49ers and even when things did, briefly, go right, <a href=\"http://fansided.com/2013/10/27/london-welcomes-jacksonville-jaguras-uh-jaguars-gif/\">the team of flag-bearers sent out to lead the celebrations managed to spell the team&rsquo;s name incorrectly</a>.</p> <p>Whilst it is probably still a little early to consider the possibility of a perfect season for the Chiefs &ndash; many people are reserving judgement until after their first game against division rivals Denver on 17 November &ndash; it does not feel too soon to ask whether the Jaguars could go 0-16. Only one team, the 2008 Detroit Lions, have endured a winless season since the NFL schedule was extended to 16 games in 1978, but Jacksonville look eminently capable of following in their footsteps.</p> <p>The Jags -178 points-differential is the third-worst in league history for a team that is eight games into its season. Only Washington in 1954 (-192) and Atlanta in 1966 (-204) have ever been worse. To look at it another way, Jacksonville have lost by an average of 22.25 points per game; that 2008 Lions team lost by just 15.56 points per game.</p> <p>There are plenty more ways besides in which the Jags&rsquo; awfulness might be quantified. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Brad_Gagnon/status/394634313032925185\">As Bleacher Report&rsquo;s Brad Gagnon noted on Twitter</a>, the team&rsquo;s quarterbacks have combined for just four touchdowns all season. Washington defensive back DeAngelo Hall has three all on his own.&nbsp;</p> <p>It does not necessarily mean that they will go 0-16, of course. There are several modest opponents left on Jacksonville&rsquo;s schedule &ndash; including the Buffalo Bills and Cleveland Browns. But the Jags certainly seem far more likely candidates than the league&rsquo;s only other remaining winless team, Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers sit at 0-7 but have at least been competitive in most weeks &ndash; losing by a more modest average of nine points per game so far.</p> <h2>Trade-talk</h2> <p>The NFL&rsquo;s trade deadline hits at 4pm ET on Tuesday. More often than not, that turns out to be a colossally underwhelming experience, but there are enough valuable veterans on bad teams right now to believe that a significant deal could get done. We have, after all, already seen a handful of high-profile trades this season &ndash; most notably with the Colts acquiring running back Trent Richardson from Cleveland in return for a first-round pick. Of all the players receiving attention right now, here are three that merit particular attention:</p> <p>1) Minnesota Vikings defensive end <strong>Jared Allen </strong>has had a so-so start to this year, with 4.5 sacks in seven games, but he remains a top-tier pass rusher who has reached double-figures in all of his last six seasons. There are few teams who would not benefit from adding a player of his calibre, but Allen does not come cheap. His salary cap figure for the remainder of this year is $7.5m &ndash; and right now only 10 teams have that much space available. Of those, only the Green Bay Packers, Cincinnati Bengals and Carolina Panthers presently boast winning records. Others might be able to make room by restructuring existing deals, although with the player set to turn 32 in the spring, it would likely need to be a team with immediate Super Bowl aspirations.</p> <p>2) <strong>Tony Gonzalez</strong> said before the weekend that his only interest was in helping the Atlanta Falcons get back to the playoffs, but after a dispiriting defeat to Arizona that is beginning to look like a distant prospect indeed. The tight end only postponed his planned retirement this year in order to have one last shot at the Super Bowl, so might he reconsider his options if a true contender came along? On paper he would be a good fit back in Kansas City &ndash; where he previously played for 12 years without winning a single playoff game. Besides being 8-0, the Chiefs also have a quarterback in Alex Smith who likes to use his tight ends, and who previously enjoyed a highly productive relationship with Vernon Davis in San Francisco.</p> <p>3) A number of wide receivers have been linked with trades in the last few days, including Arizona&rsquo;s Larry Fitzgerald, Cleveland&rsquo;s Josh Gordon and Tennessee&rsquo;s Kenny Britt. But the most in-demand right now is <strong>Hakeem Nicks</strong> of the New York Giants. It&rsquo;s not hard to see why. The 2009 first-round draft pick is still just 25-years-old, has two 1,000-yard receiving seasons on his resume and might just be expendable in New York following the emergence of Rueben Randle. The New England Patriots, Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers all have need at the position, as they each eye a postseason run.</p> <h2>Fantasy Football Thoughts</h2> <p>Any such trades would, of course, also have a significant impact on the Fantasy landscape. Fitzgerald, for instance, could experience a sharp uptick in value if he had a quarterback capable of delivering him the ball on any consistent basis. Conversely, might a player like Josh Gordon even lose a few targets on a team like New England, compared to what he gets right now with the Browns? Rather than dwell on those hypotheticals, here are three more straightforward waiver wire pick-ups who could help your team:</p> <p>1) Bengals wide receiver <strong>Marvin Jones </strong>enjoyed a monster day against the Jets, hauling in eight passes for 122 yards and four touchdowns. Is he going to post those sorts of numbers every week? Of course not, but with opposing defenses focusing their energies on AJ Green, Jones does appear to be establishing himself as the clear No2 option for the increasingly confident Andy Dalton in Cincinnati. The receiver already had touchdowns in each of his last two games, and should see plenty more targets going forwards.</p> <p>2) A less safe bet than Jones, but depending on your depth, the Saints wide receiver <strong>Kenny Stills</strong> might also merit flex consideration. He had a big game against the Bills on Sunday, with three receptions for 129 yards and two scores, and has proven himself as a deep threat for Drew Brees. Stills&rsquo;s six receptions over the last two games, however, have come on just seven targets. He is a boom-or-bust option, capable of winning you a Fantasy game, but also of disappearing altogether on any given weekend in that crowded Saints offense.</p> <p>3) The Cleveland Browns have a new starting quarterback in <strong>Jason Campbell</strong>, and he got off to a pretty solid start this weekend &ndash; throwing for 293 yards and two touchdowns against a good Kansas City defense. That is still a very small sample size, and ideally you would have a more reliable option at the position, but with six NFL teams taking their bye in week nine, it may be slim pickings for some owners in deeper leagues. Jake Locker would be a better addition, where available, but he has already been picked up in many cases after his strong return in week seven.</p> <h2>Quick Outs</h2> <p>&bull;&nbsp;Having praised his receiver, Jones, in the Fantasy section above, I need to give some credit to Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton, as well. Cincinnati were favourites to beat the Jets this weekend, but not to hang 49 points on opponents who had defeated New England a week previously. Dalton threw for five touchdowns in total, while the defense contributed a further two scores. Cincinnati are looking like legitimate contenders in the AFC.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;Yet another home defeat for the Eagles, who have not won at the Linc since last September. Their only points against a bad New York Giants team came from recovering a muffed snap on a punt play. Michael Vick re-injured his hamstring and Matt Barkley continued to turn the ball over after replacing him. The Chip Kelly bandwagon has well and truly crashed. Time to find out if he knows how to right it.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;As great as Megatron was for Detroit this week, even he did not make any catches <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-hq-videos/0ap2000000270871/Pierre-Garcon-s-one-handed-catch\">as outrageous as this one from Washington&rsquo;s Pierre Garcon</a>.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24148847/pic-baby-dressed-up-as-andy-reid-is-adorable\">The best NFL-themed Halloween costume you will see this year</a> &hellip;</p> <p>&bull; &hellip; <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/two-saints-fans-dress-sean-payton-rob-ryan-220944477--nfl.html\">Although these ones were also pretty good</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;Coaches behaving badly dept: <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/oakland-raiders/0ap2000000270779/A-heated-Tarver\">Raiders defensive co-ordinator Jason Tarver flips officials the bird &ndash; twice &ndash; as he rages over a bad penalty against his team</a>, which was subsequently overturned. A fine will be coming the coach&rsquo;s way shortly, after the NFL&rsquo;s former vice-president of officiating, Mike Pereira, now a rules analyst from Fox, alerted the relevant league officials, <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/mike-pereira-oakland-raiders-assistant-coach-flips-bird-at-officials-102713\">before writing a somewhat sanctimonious blog informing the world that he had done so</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>&bull; For sports fans in St Louis, Monday night turned out to be a double disappointment. Most of the city will not even have tuned into Monday Night Football <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/28/boston-red-sox-st-louis-cardinals-live\">until after watching the city&rsquo;s Major League Baseball team, the Cardinals, drop Game Five of the World Series</a>, but those who did saw the Rams perform way above expectations &ndash; subduing the Seahawks on defense as well as running the ball effectively when they had possession. But with starting quarterback Sam Bradford sidelined by the torn cruciate ligament he suffered last week, St Louis simply could not finish their drives. Three times they settled for field goals inside the red zone &ndash; which still might have been enough if Greg Zuerlein had not missed his one long attempt, shading it just right from 50 yards. As it was, the Rams knew that they would need to punch the ball into the end zone on their final possession, but could not quite manage it &ndash; driving 96 yards only to turn the ball over on downs at the one-yard line. </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421161166|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|e0f35c82c373d2826762bd1d0ef1000cabeefd13 -->",

        "headline":"Kansas City Chiefs are 6-0, but their luck is about to run out",
        "body":"<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are the biggest (positive) surprise of this still (relatively) young NFL season. Led by new head coach Andy Reid, the Arrowhead natives are 6-0 and have only won one game by less than two scores. They are almost certainly heading towards the playoffs on the strength of their defense. Yet, the Chiefs may end up packing their bags earlier than you might think. </p><p>Why?</p><h2>1. The Chiefs offense is a big ball of meh</h2><p>No team is going to be the best in every facet of the game. The Broncos defense leaves much to be desired. Yet, the Chiefs offense is really something else, which could come back to haunt them. </p><p>Quarterback Alex Smith ranks 22nd in the league for <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/passing/sort/quarterbackRating\">passer rating</a>. He is averaging 6.16 yards per attempt, which is worst in the league for starting quarterbacks. He's tied for eighth for the most sacks. </p><p>Running back Jamaal Charles is averaging only 4.2 yards <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/rushing/sort/yardsPerRushAttempt\">per rushing attempt</a>–good enough for only 20th in the league. Advanced NFL Stats says that Charles is 60th for all running backs in win probability added for every play he's directly involved in. </p><p>The Chiefs simply have no good or great receivers statistically speaking. The top pass catcher for the Chiefs, Donnie Avery, ranks 51st in <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/receiving/sort/receivingYards/qualified/false\">receiving yards</a> with only 310. No Chiefs receiver has more than two touchdown receptions. </p><p>Overall, Advanced NFL Stats rates the Chiefs offense as 30th in <a href=\"http://www.advancednflstats.com/2013/10/team-efficiency-rankings-week-6.html\">offensive efficiency</a>. </p><h2>2. The Chiefs haven't been playing tough opponents</h2><p>This is actually true of the Broncos and Seahawks as well, but look at who the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Chiefs have played</a>. They beat the Giants and Jaguars, who are terrible. The took down the Cowboys, Eagles, Raiders, and Titans, who are at best .500 teams. The only one of these going down in the record books is the Jaguars – and that is for awfulness. </p><p>Taking a more advanced statistical look, we can look at Football Outsiders' Defense-adjusted Over Average (DVOA). This breaks down every NFL play and compares teams against a league baseline average. By this measure, the Chiefs have the 31st <a href=\"http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff\">hardest schedule to this point</a>. </p><p>If they had a more even schedule, they'd probably have at least one loss already.</p><h2>3. The Chiefs will start playing tough opponents </h2><p>DVOA suggests that the Chiefs' luck may run out. They are expected to have the seventh most difficult schedule the rest of the season. They have to play the Broncos (more on that below) and a decent Chargers team twice, the Colts, and an underrated Bills team that plays pretty well at home. </p><p>The chance that the Chiefs can stay near perfect is pretty slim. Football Outsiders has them going only 6-4 the rest of the season. </p><h2>4. The Broncos and homefield</h2><p>There's room for more than one great team in the NFL. The problem is there really isn't room for two great teams in the same division. The Chiefs and Broncos both play in the AFC West. The Broncos, by most measures, including <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/standings\">point differential</a> and advanced stat team efficiency ratings from both <a href=\"http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teameff\">Football Outsiders</a> and <a href=\"http://www.advancednflstats.com/2013/10/team-efficiency-rankings-week-6.html\">Advanced NFL Stats</a>, look like the better team. </p><p>That's an issue for Chiefs, because they have to play the Broncos twice. The Broncos also have the easier remaining schedule. That would suggest that the Broncos are more likely to end up with the better record. </p><p>Thus, the Chiefs are probably going to end up with the fifth spot in the AFC's playoff brackets. That means they'll have to win three times on the road to make the Super Bowl. That's not impossible, though the odds are against it. </p><p>The home team has won a little more than <a href=\"http://www.fieldgulls.com/2013/1/4/3780668/nfl-playoffs-seahawks-vs-redskins-homefield-advantage\">60% of its games in the playoffs</a> since 2002. Three teams have won three road games to win the Super Bowl <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/visuals/post/_/id/10921/graphic-which-nfl-playoff-seeds-succeed\">over the past decade and none before that</a>. This suggests that the homefield advantage may be waning, but it still exists. </p><p>You can add <a href=\"http://www.twominutewarning.com/hfa.htm\">2-3 points to the home team's margin</a> than what would you expect on a neutral field. In a league where games are often won by a few points, this can make all the difference in the world. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Chiefs are a good football team. I'm not sure, however, they are good as their 6-0 record indicates. Their offense and strength of opponent has been weak. A tougher upcoming schedule and the looming Broncos in the same division argues for a team that will have a more difficult time moving forward.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420264962|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|0a2ad6b410b611a7c52c1287214bc3f9d4792c44 -->",

        "headline":"NFC preview: Can RG3, Kaepernick and Wilson lead their teams to glory?",
        "body":"<p>The 2013 NFL season is almost upon us: Following on from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/02/nfl-2013-preview-afc?CMP=twt_gu\">our preview of the NFL's American Football Conference</a> it's the turn of the National Football Conference. At the bottom of this article, you will also find our pick for Super Bowl XLVIII.</p><p><em>Teams listed in order of projected finish</em></p><h2>NFC East</h2><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Washington Redskins</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 10-6</p><p>This might be the toughest division to call in the whole league. Three of the four teams involved look capable of posting a winning record, yet none of them seems likely to be dominant. I could imagine the Cowboys, Giants and Redskins all going 9-7 more easily than any one of them going 12-4.</p><p>I'm taking Washington to win the division, but that pick comes with a pretty big asterisk. If Robert Griffin III were to reinjure his surgically-repaired left knee, then they could conceivably plummet to last place. Kirk Cousins is a perfectly serviceable NFL back-up, and performed well in relief last year, but he is not an equivalent player to RGIII.</p><p>The Redskins will hope for another strong year from running back Alfred Morris, whose 1,600 yards rushing as a rookie are too often forgotten amid the Griffin hype. Washington's defense will benefit from the return of Brian Orakpo, but concerns remain about a flaky secondary – despite the team's efforts to address that area in the draft. </p><p><strong>2) New York Giants</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 9-7</p><p>Expectations are modest for the Giants this year; under Tom Coughlin that is generally when they are at their most dangerous. The team's biggest move this offseason was signing Victor Cruz to a new five-year contract, thereby avoiding any training camp holdout by the receiver. If he and Hakeem Nicks stay healthy, Eli Manning should be able to do plenty of damage in the passing game. </p><p>Much like Washington, New York's biggest problems are on the other side of the ball. This team badly needs Jason Pierre-Paul to play at his best, upgrading the pass rush and helping to mask the team's problems in coverage. But the defensive end is coming off back surgery this summer, and might not be ready for week one.</p><p><strong>3) Dallas Cowboys</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 8-8</p><p>The Cowboys have enough talent on their roster to be a play-off team. Tony Romo is a good quarterback – even if perhaps not as good as <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000155364/article/tony-romo-signs-108m-contract-with-dallas-cowboys\">his new $108m contract might suggest</a>. He has excellent receivers to throw to in Dez Bryant and Miles Austin, and his team should be better on the other side of the ball, too, after replacing defensive co-ordinator Rob Ryan with Monte Kiffin.</p><p>And yet, how are we supposed to get behind a team whose owner spent the offseason <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/21599224\">pressuring his head coach into giving up play-calling duties</a>? These Cowboys are too dysfunctional to play up to their ability. Oh, and the offensive line is a mess, too.</p><p><strong>4) Philadelphia Eagles</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 4-12</p><p>If Garrett has been undermined by his owner, then the new Eagles head coach Chip Kelly seems to have fate itself working against his team. Philadelphia lost four players to torn anterior cruciate ligaments in preseason – including Jeremy Maclin, their top receiver from last season.</p><p>Michael Vick has been named as the starting quarterback once again, and it remains to be seen whether the Eagles can do a better job of protecting him. The defense may suffer some teething problems as it adjusts to a new 3-4 formation, but can't be a whole lot worse than it was the last time around.</p><h2>NFC North</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416454577'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/28/1354072114728/22434a47-7f2a-4fcd-af0f-42b9b681fad1-460.jpeg' alt='Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers reacts to a play during his team's loss to the New York Giants.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Photograph: Adam Hunger/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Green Bay Packers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong>  11-5</p><p>Life is going to keep getting tougher in the NFC North. Green Bay finished just one win ahead of Minnesota and Chicago last season, and both teams appear to have strengthened during the offseason. Detroit, meanwhile, are a better team than last year's 4-12 record would suggest.</p><p>The Packers, though, have Aaron Rodgers, and that fact alone will carry them a long way. Statistically the best starting quarterback in the league last year, he has steered his team to at least 10 wins in each of the past four seasons. There is no good reason to believe that he will fail to do so this time around.  His favourite target, Greg Jennings, might have departed, but Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and James Jones represent a solid set of fall-back options.</p><p>Green Bay's offense should in fact be more balanced, too, with second-round draft pick Eddie Lacy expected to provide immediate improvement at running back. The question, as so often, will be whether their defense is good enough to stop opponents from hanging on in a shoot-out. Having Clay Matthews available for all 16 games certainly wouldn't hurt.</p><p><strong>2) Chicago Bears</strong></p><p><strong>Last season: </strong> 10-6</p><p>This might be Jay Cutler's last shot in Chicago. The quarterback has been up and down for the Bears, and often in the most literal sense possible, since he has been sacked nearly three times per game over the past three seasons. This year the team has taken significant steps to address that issue, with four new starters across the offensive line, and new head coach Marc Trestman will be watching closely to see how the quarterback fares behind this new group.</p><p>The defense has lost its emotional leader in Brian Urlacher, but the linebacker had lost a step and no longer dominated a game as he once had. The man who was supposed to replace him, DJ Williams, has missed most of preseason with a calf injury, but this unit is still expected to be one of the best in the league. </p><p><strong>3) Minnesota Vikings</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 10-6</p><p>Adrian Peterson defied all reasonable logic last season, returning just nine months after a cruciate ligament tear and rushing for 2,097 yards. Only one player – Eric Dickerson – has ever rushed for more than 1,800 yards in consecutive seasons, and as special a player as AP is, you would have to expect some regression. </p><p>Have the Vikings strengthened sufficiently elsewhere to make up the difference? Right now it is not clear. Free agent wide receiver Greg Jennings and first-round draft pick Cordarrelle Patterson should together represent an upgrade over the departed Percy Harvin at the position, but it remains to be seen whether Christian Ponder can get the ball to them. On defense, the decision to release cornerback Antoine Winfield might come back to bite this team.</p><p><strong>4) Detroit Lions</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 4-12</p><p>Like AP, Calvin Johnson is likely to see his numbers fall somewhat after a record-breaking 2012. For the Lions, it will be good news if they do. That would mean that they have succeeded in diversifying an offense that was far too one-dimensional last year, with Stafford throwing a staggering 205 passes in the direction of his No1 receiver.</p><p>The acquisition of Reggie Bush – fresh from two strong years in Miami – should help towards that end. With Ziggy Ansah added to an already menacing defensive line, the Lions will win more games than they did last year, but might still finish up at the foot of a division where no team looks likely to be a pushover.</p><h2>NFC South</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416454578'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/14/1358122001617/d80e0054-99f0-4c24-a60d-769109d95b80-460.jpeg' alt='Atlanta Falcons kicker Matt Bryant vs Seattle Seahawks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Atlanta Falcons beat the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC divisional playoff game earlier this year.  Photograph: David Goldman/AP</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Atlanta Falcons</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 13-3</p><p>It is no secret that the Falcons believe they are ready for a Super Bowl run. They thought so last year, too, but the team's actions since the end of last season have been geared towards short-term success. First they persuaded tight end Tony Gonzalez to come back for one more year. Then they went out in free agency and signed running back Steven Jackson away from St Louis. He turned 30 in July, and it is a well-established fact that players at his position tend to deteriorate once they enter their fourth decade. Jackson, furthermore, is a physical back who has taken more hits than most. Nevertheless, he was extremely effective for the Rams in the latter part of last season – a result of head coach Jeff Fisher's smart decision to limit his touches earlier in the year. If the Falcons can manage Jackson's time on the field with similar effectiveness, he could be a difference-maker come playoff time.</p><p>And barring any injury to quarterback Matt Ryan, this team should certainly get back to the postseason. The receiving tandem of Julio Jones and Roddy White remains one of the best in the league, and on defense Osi Umenyiora could help upgrade the pass rush. A lot is being expected of rookie cornerbacks Desmond Trufant and Robert Alford, but defensive co-ordinator Mike Nolan has a good track record of keeping his units competitive. </p><p><strong>2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-9</p><p>What next for the Muscle Hamster? Tampa Bay's diminutive running back, also known as Doug Martin, had a sensational rookie season, rushing for 1,454 yards and 11 touchdowns, as well as catching 49 passes for a further 472 yards. If he can repeat those numbers, this team could be bound for the postseason. </p><p>Josh Freeman's 4,065 passing yards and 27 touchdowns last season represented new franchise records at his position, but he will hope to improve his accuracy now that he has a full year working with head coach Greg Schiano under his belt. A hideous passing defense, meanwhile, has been upgraded hugely by the addition of cornerback Darrelle Revis. </p><p><strong>3) New Orleans Saints</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-9</p><p>How much difference does a head coach make? The Saints had to do without Sean Payton last season as he served a one-year suspension as punishment for his alleged involvement in the team's bounty scandal. They duly missed out on the playoffs for the first time in four years, losing more games in one season than they had over the previous two combined.</p><p>Payton is now back, and his play-calling should galvanise the Saints' offense. That said, this team moved the ball OK even when he was absent. More important in determining New Orleans's fate might be the impact of new defensive co-ordinator Rob Ryan, who takes over a unit that gave up a league-worst 440.1 yards per game last year and has had only modest additions.</p><p><strong>4) Carolina Panthers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-9</p><p>I have the Panthers at last place in this division, yet they could easily finish as high as second. There is certainly plenty of confidence in Carolina after the team finished 2012 with five wins from its last six games. Seven of the Panthers' nine losses were by less than one touchdown.</p><p>Cam Newton is a talented quarterback who takes a few too many chances but can succeed if the other pieces are in place. Carolina might also have the best pass rush in the division, with first-round pick Star Lotulelei slotting in at defensive tackle alongside Dwan Edwards and the already prolific pairing of Charles Johnson and Greg Hardy at defensive end. There is some concern, however, that age might start to catch up to the running back rotation of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. </p><h2>NFC West</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416454579'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/3/1357235144261/a3e59bb8-2040-4611-b885-abba633de970-460.jpeg' alt='Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>How will Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson fare in his second season?  Photograph: George Holland/ZUMA Press/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Seattle Seahawks</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 11-5</p><p>The Seahawks' big offseason play to upgrade their offense, trading away a first-round pick to acquire Percy Harvin from Minnesota, backfired when the receiver injured his hip over the summer. He is expected to miss most of the season, and yet his team can still win this division.</p><p>A running game led by the indomitable Marshawn Lynch has been lent depth with the selection of Christine Michael in the second-round of this year's draft, and will continue to be the foundation of this team's offensive success. For all the excitement around quarterback Russell Wilson last year, the Seahawks still ran the ball a lot more often than they threw it. </p><p>Their greatest strength will continue to be the defense. Already exceptional at linebacker and in the secondary, the Seahawks have strengthened their supposed weak link, the defensive line, significantly with the capture of Cliff Avril and Michael Bennett in free agency. If Wilson continues to progress as expected, they will be Super Bowl contenders.</p><p><strong>2) San Francisco 49ers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 11-4-1</p><p>Nothing less than a Super Bowl will satisfy 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh, who steered his team to that stage last year after reaching the AFC Championship game in 2011-12. He has the pieces in place for another run, from a beastly front seven on defense through to an exceptional offensive line that can pave the way for another great year of Colin Kaepernick, Frank Gore and the read-option offense. </p><p>So why rank them below Seattle? My concerns relate to the state of the team's secondary, which lost safety Dashon Goldson in free agency, as well as the situation at wide receiver, where Michael Crabtree is out injured. But San Francisco are still going to be a very good team; my hunch is just that Seattle will be better.</p><p><strong>3) St Louis Rams</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-8-1</p><p>Nobody won more divisional games in the NFC West last year than St Louis, who went 4-1-1 against San Francisco, Seattle and Arizona. Unfortunately, they also went 3-7 against everybody else. They have lost their starting running back, Steven Jackson, and top wide receiver, Danny Amendola, since then, but still have reasons to believe that they will perform better.</p><p>Chief among those is the simple fact that quarterback Sam Bradford will be working under the same offensive co-ordinator, Brian Schottenheimer, for a second consecutive season – making this the first time in his career that he will get to work in the same system for two years running. If the former No1 overall pick can translate that consistency into the sort of improvement that people around the franchise expect, then this team – blessed with an underrated defense that features one of the best lines in the league – could grab a playoff berth.</p><p><strong>4) Arizona Cardinals</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 5-11</p><p>The Cardinals are another team that did not get enough credit for the quality of its defense last year, mostly because every time they forced a turnover their offense would give the ball straight back. A new coaching staff in Arizona will seek to preserve the good while eliminating some of the bad. </p><p>Carson Palmer represents an upgrade at quarterback (he could hardly do worse than Josh Skelton, Ryan Lindley et al) and has the right attributes to air the ball out in Bruce Arians' deep passing offense, as well as one of the best wide receivers in Larry Fitzgerald. But Palmer cannot throw passes lying down, and there is concern that the team's glaring weaknesses along the offensive line remain, especially after the team's first-round draft pick, guard Jonathan Cooper, broke his leg in preseason. </p><h2>Playoff permutations</h2><p><strong>Division winners:</strong> Washington Redskins, Green Bay Packers, Atlanta Falcons, Seattle Seahawks.</p><p><strong>NFC Wildcards:</strong> San Francisco 49ers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><p><strong>NFC Championship game:</strong> Seattle Seahawks over Atlanta Falcons</p><p><strong>Super Bowl XLVIII:</strong> Seattle Seahawks over Denver Broncos</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/02/nfl-2013-preview-afc\">AFC preview</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416363213|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|3a13399e8212be4404c645edd67939f5656cfa77 -->",

        "headline":"RG3 says 'now is the window' for gay NFL players to come out",
        "body":"<p>The Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III has said that \"now is the window\" for any gay NFL players to come out. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/08/rg3-gq-cover-story-interview-outtakes.html\">Speaking to GQ magazine</a>, Griffin III – who is known to fans as RG3 – said: \"Yeah, man. I think there are [gay players] right now, and if they're looking for a window to just come out, I mean, now is the window. My view on it is, yes, I am a Christian, but to each his own. You do what you want to do. If some Christians want to look at being gay as a sin, then thinking about other women, committing adultery – or any of those other sins that are in the Bible – those are sins, too. And God looks at all of us the same way.\"</p><p>The quote was included in an \"outtakes\" post on GQ's website, rather than in the cover story itself.</p><p>The issue of whether gay professional sportsmen or women can or should come out has been keenly discussed since April, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/29/jason-collins-gay-sports-illustrated-wizards\">Jason Collins, an NBA center who has most recently played for the Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards</a>, became the first openly gay athlete still playing in the four major US professional sports leagues – the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL.</p><p>In early April, almost a month before Collins' announcement, the former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, an advocate of LGBT rights, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/05/four-nfl-players-coming-out-ayanbadejo\">said four NFL players were close to coming out</a>. \"I think it will happen sooner than you think,\" Ayanbadejo said, in an interview with the Baltimore Sun. \"We're in talks with a handful of players who are considering it. There are up to four players being talked to right now and they're trying to be organized so they can come out on the same day together. It would make a major splash and take the pressure off one guy. It would be a monumental day if a handful or a few guys come out.\" </p><p>No current NFL players have yet come out, although Ayanbadejo and the Oakland Raiders punter Chris Kluwe have continued to press the issue. In September 2012, Kluwe made headlines when he issued <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5941348/they-wont-magically-turn-you-into-a-lustful-cockmonster-chris-kluwe-explains-gay-marriage-to-the-politician-who-is-offended-by-an-nfl-player-supporting-it?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">a stinging public rebuke to Emmett C Burns Jr</a>, a Maryland state politician who had objected to Ayanbadejo's support for gay marriage. Kluwe's open letter to Burns Jr – which used colourful language, including an assurance to the politician that gay people getting married would not \"magically turn you into a lustful cockmonster\" – went viral.</p><p>In the NFL season that followed, controversy was stirred up by remarks made by players in response to questions about the likelihood of players coming out. In January, in the build-up to Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans, the San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver said: \"I don't do the gay guys man. I don't do that. No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do. Can't be with that sweet stuff. Nah … can't be … in the locker room man. Nah.\" </p><p>After the 49ers organisation disowned his remarks, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/31/chris-culliver-gay-apology-49ers-superbowl\">Culliver issued a statement of apology</a>: \"The derogatory comments I made yesterday were a reflection of thoughts in my head, but they are not how I feel.

        "body":"<p>The NFL star Aaron Hernandez has been charged with murder and weapons counts in connection with the killing of a semi-pro football player. The tight end was taken from his home in handcuffs on Wednesday morning, more than a week after Odin Lloyd, a Boston semi-pro football player, was found dead in an industrial park a mile from Hernandez's house. </p><p>Authorities say Lloyd was shot multiple times in the back and chest. They say Hernandez was upset with Lloyd after the two had a dispute at a nightclub a few days before.</p><p>Less than two hours after the arrest of Hernandez, <a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/news/article-1/Patriots-Release-Tight-End-Aaron-Hernandez/69fbee29-d53e-4f8d-88c6-de53da754e73\">the New England Patriots announced the player had been released from the team</a>.</p><p>The Patriots released a statement, which said: \"A young man was murdered last week and we extend our sympathies to the family and friends who mourn his loss. Words cannot express the disappointment we feel knowing that one of our players was arrested as a result of this investigation. We realize that law enforcement investigations into this matter are ongoing. We support their efforts and respect the process. At this time, we believe this transaction is simply the right thing to do.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000214854/article/aaron-hernandez-ex-patriots-te-charged-with-murder\">An NFL statement said</a>: \"The involvement of an NFL player in a case of this nature is deeply troubling. The Patriots have released Aaron Hernandez, who will have his day in court. At the same time, we should not forget the young man who was the victim in this case and take this opportunity to extend our deepest sympathy to Odin Lloyd's family and friends.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411675952'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/26/1372265034968/Arrest-Of-New-England-Pat-008.jpg' alt='Arrest Of New England Patriots Player Aaron Hernandez' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez is arrested and led out of his home in handcuffs.

Officials ruled the death a homicide but did not say how Lloyd died. Lloyd's relatives said he was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée, that the two men were friends and that both men were out together on the last night of Lloyd's life.</p><p>Hernandez was taken into custody on Wednesday, before 9am, and put into the back of a police cruiser. He was wearing a white v-neck t-shirt, and his arms were inside the shirt and behind his back as he was led from his North Attleborough home. He casually spit into some bushes on his way to the car. </p><p>Hernandez was arrested on a state police warrant and was booked at the North Attleborough police station, state police said on the agency's Twitter account. State police said they would not discuss the charge against Hernandez until it was presented in Attleboro District Court. Hernandez was taken from the North Attleborough police station to his court hearing on Wednesday afternoon. About two dozen supporters cheered, some yelling \"We love you Aaron,\" as the car carrying him left the police station.</p><p>The Associated Press emailed a message to Hernandez's attorney, Michael Fee, who hasn't discussed the investigation beyond acknowledging media reports about it. A message also was left with the Bristol County district attorney's office.</p><p>Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, declined to comment at her Boston home Wednesday morning. \"Nothing to say, please. Thank you,\" she said, before shutting the door.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/23/aaron-hernandez-nfl-player-search\">State police have searched in and around Hernandez's sprawling home in North Attleborough several times</a>. At least three search warrants have been issued in connection with the investigation. Reporters have been camped for days outside the home on the Rhode Island line, not far from the stadium where the Patriots play. They reported on Tuesday that Hernandez had been visited by a Boston defense attorney, James Sultan.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411675953'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/21/1371825121875/New-England-Patriots-tigh-010.jpg' alt='New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Aaron Hernandez in action.

        "headline":"How the NFL Draft became the biggest non-sporting sports event",
        "body":"<p>It could be argued that the NFL Draft has become the world's most popular sporting event that doesn't contain any actual live sports. The league's annual selection meeting has been around since 1936, but it has increased in popularity in recent years at a rate that outpaces any other major event in the sporting world.</p><p>Just ask former Dallas Cowboys vice president of player personnel Gil Brandt, who has been scouting draft prospects for five and a half decades.</p><p>\"It has exceed expectations by about a million times,\" Brandt told me over the phone from Texas last week.  He remembers the media coverage the draft received in the 1950s and 1960s and can't fathom how much things have changed.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"If we had five or six national writers [covering the draft], that was unheard of. Guys had no idea they were drafted. 'Drafted? Into the Army?' Now, though, the interest in the draft is just totally unbelievable.\"</p></blockquote><p>Until 1980, the draft wasn't televised. Until 1995, it was held in hotel ballrooms in Chicago, Philadelphia or New York. It moved from Tuesday/Wednesday to Sunday/Monday in 1988, because, according to NFL.com, \"the Marriott Marquis [in New York] offered the NFL a better rate on those days for the ballroom space.\"</p><p>Now, 12,000-plus watch live at Radio City Music Hall, with more than 8 million tuning in to watch the first round alone on ESPN and NFL Network, to see which college players are chosen by which pro teams. To put that audience into perspective, two NBA playoff games played on the same night last year garnered a combined 1.8 million viewers. </p><p>The Draft routinely crushes the NBA now, as well as the Stanley Cup Finals and postseason baseball. In fact, the lowest-rated game of last year's World Series between the Giants and the Tigers edged out the opening round of the draft by only 2.4 million viewers.</p><p>The combined total viewership of the draft grew by nearly 100 percent from 2001 to 2010, according to ESPN's public-relations department. The Super Bowl, for the sake of comparison has only seen its viewership increase by 28 percent since '01 (84 million viewers for Super Bowl XXXV compared to 109 million for this year's game between the Ravens and the 49ers).</p><p>The increased interest has spawned a growing field of \"draft experts,\" who seem to appear alongside Punxsutawney Phil each February before disappearing again by the first of May. And it goes beyond the Mel Kipers and Todd McShays of the football world. A cottage industry has emerged, too, built mainly on mock drafts, draft rumors and in-depth scouting reports at websites that are becoming less obscure by the year.</p><p>Walter Cherepinsky, who runs <a href=\"http://walterfootball.com/\">WalterFootball.com</a>, says his site gets the vast majority of its readers because of its draft analysis. Cherepinsky writes a popular weekly picks column throughout the year and offers up plenty of fantasy football advice, but none of it holds a candle to the draft. WalterFootball.com received 36 million page views in April of 2012, which was double the viewership it garnered during December, the final month of the actual season.</p><p>\"The draft stuff just dwarfs everything,\" Cherepinsky told me last week. \"It combines the college football fans and the NFL fans. The college football fans are interested in knowing where their favorite players are gonna go and the NFL fans want to know which players are gonna make their team better.\"</p><p>Cherepinsky notes that the numbers grew each month from September on last year, not because of the approaching playoffs and the Super Bowl, but because there's more draft interest as the season progresses.</p><p>\"The fans know that they're out of playoff contention,\" he told me, \"so they look forward to the draft to see how their teams can get better.\"</p><p>Why has draft interest increased so much in the last 10-20 years specifically? There are several reasons, but the first—sadly—is that we've been taken advantage of by the league's mad men.</p><p>\"It's a product of armies of PR people who want to keep fans engaged throughout the offseason,\" said Michael Broder, a Philadelphia-based media psychologist and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Stage-Climbing-Shortest-Highest-Potential/dp/1889577391\">Stage Climbing: The Shortest Path to Your Highest Potential</a>. \"The media has really hyped it, and it's all about money.\"</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"What they've managed to do is make the season never-ending.\"</p></blockquote><p><br />Wait, are we that robotic? Are we victims of a PR machine? Did ESPN and the NFL decide that they needed to push for extra attention in the offseason, causing us to follow like sheep? If ESPN jumped off a bridge, would we join them?</p><p>\"It's incredibly depressing,\" said Arthur Raney, a professor of communication at Florida State University and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Handbook-Sports-Media-Arthur-Raney/dp/0805851887/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366590657&amp;sr=1-3\">The Handbook of Sports and Media</a>. </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"It is truly an extension of the NFL brand. There are marketing interests that are in play here that go well beyond the NFL. It's not only the NFL creating its next group of marketing faces, but it's also products in any number of industries that these faces are going to be attached to as well.\"</p></blockquote><p>Both Broder and Raney agreed when asked about a possible connection between the draft and reality television. The draft moved to prime time in 2010, but even before that, the nature of the early-round broadcasts gave it an American Idol feel.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-407653848'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/10/1305040248403/American-Idol-007.jpg' alt='American Idol' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Would you want these people to choose the next NFL star? Photograph: 20thC.Fox/Everett/Rex Features</figcaption></figure><p><em></em><br />\"It feels that way,\" said Raney. \"Spread out over three days, it's almost like a reality miniseries.\"</p><p>Forget three days. The draft process as a whole is spread out over three months. A ridiculous 7.25 million people tuned into NFL Network to watch the annual scouting combine this past February. During the entire 2012-13 NBA regular season, only two games drew more viewers than that.</p><p>And then there are thousands of hours of analysis crammed between the combine and the draft, including John Gruden's increasingly popular QB Camp, which features the former coach working with some of the draft's top prospects.</p><p>\"I never really thought that it would get this big,\" Gruden told me on a conference call. \"The draft has become a huge spectacle.\"</p><p>\"I think the commissioner and the NFL have done an excellent job keeping the game strong and interesting to fans,\" Gruden added. \"This is a big vehicle for teams to get better, obviously, the draft.  With the popularity of the game, people want to know who the players are that can help their team turn the corner.  I think that's what's made it so exciting and fun.  I've enjoyed being a part of it.\"</p><p>Teams certainly do turn that corner often. About five new teams make the playoffs each year, so one player could change everything. And parity is a big reason why draft interest has exploded in recent years.</p><p>\"I think it's about hope,\" said Cherepinsky. \"Football's the one sport in America where you can turn around in just one year. It's happened so many times. And teams build primarily through the draft.\"</p><p>Indeed they do. Free agency has lost its luster, with Super Bowl champions usually building through the draft.  Recent winners such as the Ravens, Giants, Packers and Steelers typically stayed away from free agents, and fans are catching on.</p><p>Of course, it's not as though that's a completely new trend. Even before free agency, teams that focused solely on the draft were more successful. Brandt notes that in Super Bowl X in 1976, 85 of the 86 active players were drafted in-house.</p><p>\"People copy success,\" said Brandt, who is now a senior analyst at NFL.com. \"I think that the teams realize and recognize how important the draft is and consequently are spending a lot more time on it, and I think that the people that are working for these teams are a lot better as far as what you're looking for and what it takes to be an NFL player than people did 25 years ago.\"</p><p>Maybe this is, to some degree, the result of something kick-started by Tex Schramm and those draft-savvy Cowboys teams from the 1960s and 1970s. Maybe it just took time for personnel and scouting departments league-wide to catch up, and for fans to then follow suit, with ESPN playing the catalyst role. The reality is that the fans' interests are going to align with the interests of their favorite teams, but that didn't happen overnight.</p><p>\"Scouting used to be a one-story motel out in the country,\" <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/nfl/news/20130331/carson-palmer-kevin-kolb-monday-morning-quarterback/\">Brandt told Sports Illustrated's Peter King earlier this year</a>. \"Now it's the Sears Tower. And growing.\"</p><p>It can't be a coincidence that teams and fans became increasingly obsessed with the draft in consecutive eras.</p><p>So we're not only brainwashed by what Raney calls \"the weight of the league's PR and marketing departments,\" but we're also influenced by what our teams are focusing on.</p><p>There is one thing, though, that everyone involved is invested in, at least to a degree—and that's hope. Any draft pick could be the next Tom Brady or RG3. For teams, that's reason enough to spend millions on scouts. For PR departments, that's reason enough to spend millions on hyping the draft. And for fans, that's reason enough to spend hours reading mock drafts and prospect profiles in the lead-up to the three-day event.  </p><p>\"There's all those mock drafts out there, and they're always wrong,\" said Raney, \"but it's the uncertainty of it.\"</p><p>I spoke to one Cowboys fan last week who said he wasn't even that into the draft, but he still completely understood the intrigue when it comes to that one-in-whatever chance that his team could land the next superstar.</p><p>\"It's exciting,\" Kris Barrie told me, \"and it endows every fan with a sense of hope that our next superstar is just a walk to the stage away from taking us to the next level.\"</p><p>You can't help but think of the lottery. Statistically, your team's chances of drafting a future Super Bowl MVP are much greater than your chances of winning the Powerball jackpot, but there's a one-in-some high number chance that either will happen. We're drawn to the drama, the mystery, the gamble, and that chance.</p><p>Thirty-one of the NFL's 32 teams fail to reach their ultimate goal every year, and those spoiled brats from the 32nd team will always tell you that winning has made them even more hungry.  And so everyone is desperate, and nobody can avoid thinking about what the draft might do for them.</p><p>Thus, it's no coincidence that the draft has become the second-biggest event on the NFL calendar, behind only the Super Bowl.</p><p>Said Broder:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"There's definitely a direct correlation between whatever happens in the draft and their team getting to the Super Bowl. You wonder where it's going to go next.\"</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport\">Guardian US sports</a> will have further NFL Draft coverage this week, including a liveblog of the main event on Thursday, 8pm ET</h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407634578|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d01846306f05cf3d2b2844c2f0f5bc8e7331630d -->",

        "body":"<p>Pat Summerall, the deep-voiced NFL player-turned-broadcaster who spent half of his four decades calling sports famously paired with John Madden, died Tuesday. He was 82.</p><p>Susie Wiles, Summerall's daughter, said her father died in Dallas.</p><p>\"He was an extraordinary man and a wonderful father,\" Wiles said. \"I know he will be greatly missed.\"</p><p>Summerall was part of network television broadcasts for 16 Super Bowls. His last championship game was for Fox on February 3, 2002, also his last game with long-time TV partner Madden. The popular duo worked together for 21 years, moving to Fox in 1994 after years as the lead team for CBS.</p><p>At the end of their final broadcast together, Madden described Summerall as \"a treasure\" and the \"spirit of the National Football League\" in a tribute to the partner that complemented the former coach so well.</p><p>\"You are what the NFL is all about, what pro football is all about, and more important, what a man is all about and what a gentleman is all about,\" Madden said.</p><p>As former teammate and broadcaster Frank Gifford put it in an accompanying video tribute: \"America is very comfortable with Pat Summerall.\"</p><p>Summerall played 10 NFL seasons with the Chicago Cardinals and the New York Giants between 1952 and 1961. He started doing NFL games for CBS in 1964, and became a play-by-play guy 10 years later. He was also part of CBS's coverage of the PGA Tour, and the US Open tennis tournament.</p><p>When CBS lost its NFL deal after the 1993 season, Summerall switched to Fox to keep calling NFL games with Madden. He had hoped to keep working with CBS for other events like the Masters, but network executives saw it otherwise. At the time, CBS Sports anchor Jim Nantz said he was \"very saddened\" that Summerall didn't get to leave CBS under his own terms.</p><p>A recovering alcoholic, Summerall had a liver transplant in April 2004.</p><p>After an intervention involving, among others, former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Summerall checked into the Betty Ford Clinic in April 1992.</p><p>Summerall received the liver of a 13-year-old junior high football player from Arkansas who died unexpectedly from an aneurysm. Summerall had an emotional meeting with the teenager's family the following year.</p><p>Born George Allen Summerall on May 10, 1930 in Lake City, Florida, he was an All-State prep football and basketball player there, and lettered in baseball and tennis. He played college football at Arkansas before going to the NFL.</p><p>After breaking his arm in the preseason as a rookie for Detroit, Summerall played five years for the Chicago Cardinals before four seasons with the Giants. While he was also a defensive back, Summerall was primarily a kicker, making 100 field goals and 256 of 265 extra points in his career.</p><p>Summerall was part of the NBC and CBS simulcast of the inaugural Super Bowl in Los Angeles on January 15 1967. After working the first half in the broadcast booth, he switched places with Gifford at half-time and was a sideline reporter during the second half.</p><p>\"To look at the Coliseum that day and see that there were like 40,000 empty seats and the most expensive ticket was $12, it's incredible to realize what was going on and what it's grown to over the years,\" he said during a 2009 AP interview. \"It's sort of staggering to me.\"</p><p>After his final game with Madden, Summerall remained a full-time broadcaster for Fox one more season, doing primarily Dallas Cowboys games during the 2002 season. He decided to step down the following year when he realized he would spend most of the season away from home.</p><p>Funeral arrangements were incomplete.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407325284|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|28f077ac5b99ae9bd129242e2b5f7a7657134b2d -->",

Full standings will be posted below the line shortly, but I can tell you that it's a three-way tie at the top between <strong>Cameldancer</strong>, <strong>dominkh</strong> and <strong>saltlakecity</strong>.</p><h2>Super Bowl XLVII round-up</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-403042516'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/24/1359063902322/Anna-Welker-003.jpg' alt='Anna Welker' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Anna Welker. Photograph: Darren Mccollester/WireImage/BCH</figcaption></figure><p>• <strong>It seems the post-game rant by a New England Patriot's spouse is becoming an annual tradition.</strong> Last year we had Gisele, <a href=\"http://theinsider.etonline.com/gossip/49452_Gisele_Bashes_Tom_s_Teammates/index.html\">railing that her husband Tom Brady could not catch his own passes</a>, and this year it was the turn of <a href=\"http://www.thebiglead.com/index.php/2013/01/21/wes-welkers-wife-goes-to-facebook-to-share-her-thoughts-on-ray-lewis-after-the-patriots-lost/\">Wes Welker's wife, Anna</a>.</p><p>Mrs Welker, a former beauty queen, took to Facebook to share some thoughts on Baltimore's Ray Lewis:<br /><em></em><br /><em></em></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Proud of my husband and the Pats. By the way, if anyone is bored, please go to Ray Lewis' Wikipedia page. 6 kids 4 wives. Acquitted for murder. Paid a family off. Yay. What a hall of fame player! A true role model!\"</p></blockquote><p>She subsequently made another statement: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I'm deeply sorry for my recent post on Facebook. I let the competitiveness of the game and the comments people were making about a team I dearly love get the best of me. My actions were emotional and irrational and I sincerely apologize to Ray Lewis and anyone affected by my comment after yesterday's game.</p><p>\"It is such an accomplishment for any team to make it to the NFL playoffs, and the momentary frustration I felt should not overshadow the accomplishments of both of these amazing teams.\"</p></blockquote><p>• Speaking of <strong>Brady, he was fined $10,000 this week for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DomVUdZJIM\">his studs-up, knee-high slide into Ed Reed</a></strong>. As Yahoo's Shutdown Corner blog noted – that's <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/tom-brady-fined-10-000-kick-ed-reed-015540238--nfl.html;_ylt=Av6uyH_Eh0kGdZ3lVm8s5RBYYsp_;_ylu=X3oDMTE5anNoYXFyBG1pdANCbG9ncyBJbmRleARwb3MDMTIEc2VjA01lZGlhQmxvZ0luZGV4;_ylg=X3oDMTFpMm9iMzh1BGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdANibG9nBHB0A3NlY3Rpb25z;_ylv=3\">$500 less than Frank Gore was fined for wearing his socks too low</a>. Brady did, to his credit, <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/01/22/ed-reed-brady-apologized-for-slide/\">apologise to Reed for the incident</a>. </p><p>• Doing the rounds this week: <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/usatoday.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=bd4f28430a8b41d58becad00afae3a50\"><strong>footage of Ray Lewis's first NFL sack</strong></a>. Why so much attention? Because it just so happened to be on a certain Jim Harbaugh – now head coach of the Ravens' Super Bowl opponents, the San Francisco 49ers. </p><p>• <strong>Impressive words from 49ers quarterback Alex Smith on the subject of going into a Super Bowl as back-up to Colin Kaepernick</strong>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bittersweet. I want to be out there. Coming into the season, that was my mindset, my goal. But at the same time, this is a team sport. These are all my team-mates. We go through so much together. If you can't be happy for them, there's something wrong with you.\"</p></blockquote><p>• Most curious, but also charming story of the week? <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/01/23/jim-irsay-8500-twitter-reward/1859557/\">Colts owner Jim Irsay sending £8,500 – as promised – to a Twitter follower who correctly predicted the Ravens-Patriots outcome</a> to within a point. </p><p>• And here's some serious insight into the HarBowl - from the Harbaugh parents:</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-403017450\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2013/1/25/130125Parents-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/1/25/130125Parents_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/1/25/130125Parents_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/1/25/130125Parents-720.mp4\"></source>\n      </video><p><em></em></p><h2>Around the NFL</h2><p>• <strong>The New Orleans Saints head coach, Sean Payton, was reinstated this week following the completion of his year-long suspension.</strong> He got straight down to work, attending Senior Bowl practice on Wednesday and inevitably spending a good bit of time fielding questions from the media. Payton said he had \"no interest\" in speaking to his still-suspended former defensive co-ordinator Gregg Williams, and also rejected claims – published during the season – that he had<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4705114/sean-payton-there-was-no-way-i-was-going-to-another-team\"> considered leaving the Saints to join the Dallas Cowboys</a> upon his return. </p><p>• Another hot topic this week: <strong>did the then Oakland Raiders head coach Bill Callahan deliberately sabotage his team at Super Bowl XXXVII?</strong> That was the allegation that the former Raiders wide receiver Tim Brown seemed to make on Tuesday, when <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/01/21/tim-brown-suggests-sabotage-by-bill-callahan-in-super-bowl-xxxvi/\">he told SiriusXM NFL Radio the coach had completely changed his team's game-plan just 36 hours before kick-off</a> – switching away from a run-heavy offense towards a much greater focus on the pass. Oakland subsequently lost the game to Tampa Bay, 48-21.</p><p>There did not seem to be too much ambiguity about Brown's words Tuesday. \"We all called it sabotage . . . because Callahan and [Tampa Bay coach Jon] Gruden were good friends,\" Brown said. \"And Callahan had a big problem with the Raiders, you know, hated the Raiders.  You know, only came because Gruden made him come.  Literally walked off the field on us a couple of times during the season when he first got there, the first couple years.\" </p><p>But a day later, on the Dan Patrick show, Brown was keen to backtrack. \"I've never said [Callahan] sabotaged the game,\" Brown said. \"That's something that can never be proven. We can never go into the mind of Bill Callahan... I should have said we could have called it sabotage. It was a question, not a statement. You cannot prove it.\"</p><p>Confusing the matter further, Brown's former team-mate <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000129743/article/jerry-rice-agrees-bill-callahan-threw-super-bowl\">Jerry Rice suggested on Tuesday that he agreed with the initial allegation</a>.  </p><p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8871919/bill-callahan-former-oakland-raiders-coach-says-sabotage-allegations-ludicrous\">Callahan firmly rejected the claim</a>, saying: \"While I fully understand a competitive professional football player's disappointment when a game's outcome doesn't go his team's way, I am shocked, saddened and outraged by Tim Brown's allegations and Jerry Rice's support of those allegations made through various media outlets over the last 24 hours,\" Callahan said. \"To leave no doubt, I categorically and unequivocally deny the sum and substance of their allegations.\"</p><p>• <strong>The family of the late San Diego Chargers, Miami Dolphins and New England Patriots linebacker Junior Seau has opened a wrongful death lawsuit against the NFL</strong> - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jan/23/junior-seau-family-sues-nfl-cte?INTCMP=SRCH\">claiming that his suicide was the result of brain disease caused by the violent collisions he sustained while playing football</a>. </p><p>• We've got this far without acknowledging it, but yes – <strong>there is in fact a game of football happening this weekend. The Pro Bowl</strong>'s drift into complete irrelevance has been discussed at length elsewhere <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/jan/27/nfl-pro-bowl-superbowl\">(including by this blog at around this time last year</a>) but at least one man does still seem to care. <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000129920/article/peyton-manning-roasts-players-at-closed-pro-bowl-meeting\">Peyton Manning reportedly gave an impassioned speech imploring players from both rosters to try their hardest</a>. We'll see if it makes any difference on Sunday. If any of us actually remember to tune in, that is. </p><h2>Super Bowl XLVII on the Guardian</h2><p>Our coverage of the big game begins in earnest next week, with a series of blogs and features in the build-up to the main event – from me and the rest of the Guardian US Sports team. You can keep up with all the latest on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/nfl\">our special NFL page</a> and via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnUSsports\">@GdnUSsports</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/guardianussports\">Facebook</a>.</p><p>I will be in New Orleans from Tuesday, so <strong>if you have any questions for individual players post them below the line here</strong> and I will do my best to make them on your behalf at one of the various media availabilities. Please be aware that your chances of getting an answer are much better with an Anquan Boldin or Carlos Rogers than they might be with a Colin Kaepernick or Ray Lewis.</p><p>On Super Bowl Sunday we will have live coverage running through the day of the game until the final gun – plus reports, blogs and comment to follow. Here's hoping you'll join us for all of it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/402949422|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|77d75e5152e9ca423695c3f4a5dfd77cb94bf4e2 -->",

        "headline":"Super Bowl lineup: Ray Lewis, Colin Kaepernick and the Harbowl",
        "body":"<h2>Jim Harbaugh was right to go with Colin Kaepernick</h2><p>Back in November, Jim Harbaugh told us that he planned to ride the \"hot hand\" at quarterback. Two months later, Colin Kaepernick's blistering right paw has slung the 49ers into the Super Bowl. In doing so he has vindicated his coach's greatest gamble.</p><p>In truth, the debates over Harbaugh's decision to promote Kaepernick above Alex Smith died down a little while ago. There may never be a quarterback less deserving of losing his job than Smith – who had done everything the coaching staff asked and was enjoying the best season of his career up until his week 10 concussion against St Louis. But when your replacement is playing as well as Kaepernick did in obliterating the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round, nobody is going to sit around mourning your absence.</p><p>Before this Sunday, though, it was still too soon to declare Harbaugh's switch a total triumph. Because as he deliberated and dwelled over his options at quarterback in November, the foremost question in the coach's mind will not have regarded which player was more talented or could put up the gaudiest numbers. The only thing that truly concerned Harbaugh was which player gave his team the better chance of playing in this year's Super Bowl.</p><p>Of course, Kaepernick possessed greater upside – three years younger and with more impressive physical tools – and on another team there might have been an argument for long-term thinking. But after last year's NFC title game defeat to the Giants, Harbaugh knew he had the rest of the pieces in place to make a run at a championship. In the NFL, those windows close quickly.</p><p>As unthinkable as it seems today, there was a strong case to be made for sticking with Smith. He had taken his team to the brink of an NFC title just one year previously – and although he came up short against New York last January, he seemed to have learned a few lessons since then. He was a safe pair of hands who could get the job done for a San Francisco team that was good enough not to need a superstar under center.</p><p>Except that on Sunday, they did need that superstar. The Falcons had burst out of the gates to a 17-0 lead, Matt Ryan and Julio Jones looking so perfectly in sync that you wondered how they would ever be contained. It takes strong nerves to come back from that sort of deficit in an environment as hostile as the Georgia Dome. It also takes a quarterback capable of winning games, not just managing them. Recovering from a 17-point deficit to win represented the third-largest comeback in NFL postseason history.</p><p>That is not to suggest Kaepernick carried his team alone, or carved up Atlanta single-handed. San Francisco battled back into the game with a combination of an effective ground game, smart defensive adjustments and improved blocking of both the run and pass. </p><p>But they also leaned on a quarterback who showed himself adept at exploiting the defense's weaknesses, whether that was through regular targeting of Vernon Davis – a player he had barely thrown to over the previous seven games – or knowing when to hand the ball off to Frank Gore in the read-option offense. His numbers – 16 of 23 for 233 yards and a score, plus two carries for 21 yards – are solid enough, but they do not speak to the poise, the decision-making and the calm he brought to his offense. </p><p>Perhaps the 49ers would have made the Super Bowl with Alex Smith at quarterback, too, and perhaps he was deserving of the chance to lead them there. But nobody will be dwelling on such hypotheticals in San Francisco this morning, because Colin Kaepernick did get them there. And that, when assessing Harbaugh's biggest call, is all that really matters.</p><h2>The other Harbaugh might know what he's doing too</h2><p>Brace yourselves for the HarBowl – as San Francisco head coach Jim Harbaugh takes on his older brother, the Baltimore Ravens coach John, at Super Bowl XLVII. Last season they became the first siblings ever to coach against one another in the NFL – during a Thanksgiving Day game in Baltimore, which the Ravens won 16-6. Now they will be the first to do so with the title on the line. </p><p>This match-up was so nearly a reality last year, when both brothers lost their respective conference title games by just three points. Asked last week if they had ever discussed the prospect of meeting in the Super Bowl, John replied: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Not that I'd ever admit to.\" </p></blockquote><p>The possibility must at least have been on the minds of two men who talk by phone every week. With each sending game film to their father Jack Harbaugh – formerly a successful college coach – on a regular basis, you have to wonder whether either has woken up this morning regretful over one too many trade secrets leaked at a family dinner somewhere down the line.</p><p>Jim has always carried the higher profile – the result, at least in part, of his more successful playing career. Exactly 15 months younger than his brother, Jim enjoyed 15 years as an NFL quarterback – split between six different teams. After retiring in 2001, he needed just three years to land his first head coaching job with the University of San Diego. </p><p>John, a former defensive back, never played beyond college and instead spent two decades climbing the coaching ladder before finally getting his first head coaching gig in Baltimore in 2008. At the time it was considered a surprise appointment, but a 62-30 record (including playoffs) since then has <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/nfl/news/20130118/nfl-game-plan-john-harbaugh/index.html\">more than vindicated the Ravens' decision</a>. Only one head coach has won more games over the same period – Bill Belichick, whose Patriots John defeated on Sunday. </p><p>And if Jim's gamble on Kaepernick was rewarded this weekend, then John can claim similar success with his boldest move. The Ravens head coach's decision to fire offensive co-ordinator Cam Cameron in mid-December raised more than a few eyebrows – read by many as a panic move from a team who had dropped back-to-back games and were threatening to lose their grip on the AFC North.</p><p>Instead, Jim Caldwell's elevation from quarterbacks coach to Cameron's replacement has worked out beautifully. Baltimore would lose the next game to Denver, 34-17, but since then they have averaged 28 points and 431 yards per game. Caldwell has encouraged quarterback Joe Flacco to both spend more time outside of the pocket and take regular shots downfield. The results have been breathtaking.</p><p>In three playoff games, Flacco has thrown for 853 yards, eight touchdowns and no interceptions. Amid blustery, frost-bitten conditions at Gillette Stadium in the AFC title game, Flacco thoroughly outperformed New England's Tom Brady – just as he had Peyton Manning in Denver two weeks previously.</p><p>That is a testament to the quarterback himself, as well as a remodeled offensive line which has done a great job in protection. But it is also to the credit of his coaching staff. </p><p>\"Hey Jim, congratulations – you did it, you're a great coach,\"<a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=68f2afec0d654a4ea1fa6928e42061a2\"> said John in a fleeting piece to camera for CBS</a> just before Baltimore's game in New England. Big brother is not looking too shabby himself. </p><h2>Bernard Pollard still haunts the Patriots</h2><p>The narrative around Baltimore's defense will focus once again on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ypzddbi_9KE\">Ray Lewis, who sobbed during the national anthem</a> and then went on to lead his team in tackles against New England. And so one of the greatest linebackers ever to play the game – <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/01/10/ray-lewis-baltimore-ravens-atlanta-murder-2000/1566198/\">and also perhaps the most controversial one</a> – will get to end his career at the Super Bowl, no doubt prefaced by one last pre-game shimmy as he makes his way out of the tunnel.</p><p>His team-mate Terrell Suggs stole some headlines, too, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=t_YsZbXYOx4\">commanding reporters to \"tell 'em [the Patriots] to have fun at the Pro Bowl\"</a> as he made his way back to the locker room after the game. \"These are the most arrogant pricks in the world starting with Belichick on down,\" he is reported to have added. \"That's funny, ever since SpyGate they haven't been able to win.\" He later tempered those comments, saying: \"All BS aside they are a hell of a ball club ... They have the right to be arrogant.\"</p><p><em></em></p><p>The single most critical defensive play of the game for Baltimore was not by Lewis or Suggs, though, but instead the safety Bernard Pollard. It is a name which recalls grim memories for New England fans. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/ravens/2013/01/21/bernard-pollard-baltimore-ravens/1850637/\">A man jokingly referred to as \"Patriot killer\" by his team-mates</a> has been involved in four significant New England injuries since 2008.</p><p>Tom Brady, in that year, was the first – blowing out his knee on  a tackle from Pollard, then a Kansas City Chief. One season later the same player, now with the Houston Texans, was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RK4qhQWIUo\">closing in on Wes Welker when the receiver tore his ACL while attempting to cut away</a>. Then, in last year's AFC title game, Pollard's tackle on Rob Gronkowski left the tight end with a high ankle sprain which would severely limit him in the Patriots' subsequent Super Bowl defeat.</p><p>The fourth incident arrived on Sunday, when <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=1b1b4da5f9744d63af4db7d3b0145830\">Pollard knocked Stevan Ridley briefly unconscious on a helmet-to-helmet collision</a> in the fourth quarter. The running back fumbled and Baltimore, leading 21-13 at the time, recovered at the New England 47. Their ensuing possession ended with a touchdown which extended the Ravens' lead to 15 points with just 10 minutes remaining – an advantage they would never relinquish.</p><p>There was nothing illegal about Pollard's hit – Ridley was running the ball and had himself lowered his head into the contact – but it is equally not the sort of play that the league wants to see celebrated at a time when the long-term damage caused by head injuries is at the top of the player safety agenda. </p><p>Afterwards, Pollard said: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"It's just a tackle. It's football. He broke a hole and we filled. That's fine. That's football. I hope he's okay. We're competitive in the moment. But when everything calms down you want that guy to be okay.\"</p></blockquote><p>Last week Pollard had struck a similar note, telling NFL.com he did not derive any joy from his reputation of doing damage to the Patriots' players: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Anything that I've done, I don't celebrate with that. I don't laugh when people come up to me and call me 'The Brady Killer'. I don't laugh at that. I'm looking at a man that I respect. I respect Tom Brady with everything that I have. I know his story, I respect him, first of all, because he's a man. I respect him because he's a player. Honestly, I don't get excited because of that. When it's all said and done, that man had to do the treatment, he had to do everything else to come back. Nothing is done maliciously.\"</p></blockquote><p>Ridley, encouragingly, walked off the field under his own power yesterday, though the long-term damage of a single hit like that may never be ascertained. What we do know is that once again a Bernard Pollard hit dealt New England devastating short-term damage.</p><h2>We have likely seen the last of Tony Gonzalez</h2><p>One of the most heart-breaking images of Sunday night was that of the Falcons tight end Tony Gonzalez – perhaps the greatest ever to play his position – slumped forwards on a small chair in front of his locker at the Georgia Dome. Once again Gonzalez had more than done his part, catching eight passes for 78 yards and a fine touchdown – for which he had timed his cut perfectly to move away from his defender before making a falling grab in the front of the end zone.</p><p>Gonzalez did not give firm confirmation of his retirement, but he did make it pretty clear that he is still leaning in that direction: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"It's probably the last time I'm going to wear that uniform. I didn't want to take it off, to tell you the truth. All good things come to an end and, like I said all season long, this is probably my last one. What an unbelievable ride.\"</p></blockquote><p>He insisted that he would have \"no regrets - not one\" if he did choose this moment to walk away, adding: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.\"</p></blockquote><p>The rest of us are instead left feeling sorry for ourselves at the thought of never again getting to watch a player who re-defined his position – blazing a trail for pass-catching tight ends. His 1,242 career receptions are second only to Jerry Rice. He leads the next-best tight end, Shannon Sharpe, by more than 400 catches. In this, his 16th season in the league, he reeled in 107 balls for 1,059 yards and 10 touchdowns (including the postseason).</p><p>Nobody doubts that Gonzalez could come back and play to a high level again next year, and the Falcons undoubtedly wish he would. But after finally recording the first playoff win of his career last week, the only thing that could bring Gonzalez back would be the desire to win a Super Bowl. Atlanta are well positioned to be a contender again, but even for a good team, it is a long, arduous road to get to that point. </p><p>It is his prerogative to decide that he has had enough, that the time has come to move on – to give his body a break and walk away. Even if the rest of us quietly wish that he wouldn't. </p><h2>Quick Hits</h2><p>• Picture of the weekend: <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5977451/colin-kaepernicks-parents-posed-in-front-of-a-statue-depicting-the-atlanta-falcons-giving-their-son-a-wedgie\">Colin Kaepernick's parents pose in front of a statue of him being given an enormous wedgie by an Atlanta Falcon</a>. </p><p>• <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/billboard-england-says-ray-lewis-retirement-party-coming-200250322--nfl.html;_ylt=AptQJqJloa231U78x_lPG.pYYsp_;_ylu=X3oDMTE5Y2NtNW8yBG1pdANCbG9ncyBJbmRleARwb3MDNDIEc2VjA01lZGlhQmxvZ0luZGV4;_ylg=X3oDMTFpMm9iMzh1BGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdANibG9nBHB0A3NlY3Rpb25z;_ylv=3\">Ray Lewis 1, Authors of this New England billboard 0</a>. </p><p>• The weekend's lowest note arrived in the hours after San Francisco's win at the Georgia Dome. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8863456/2013-nfl-playoffs-fan-stabbed-neck-georgia-dome-nfc-championship-game-san-francisco-49ers-atlanta-falcons-report\">An Atlanta Falcons fan was reported stabbed in the neck </a>after getting into an altercation with a 49ers fan near to the stadium, though he was later said to be in a stable condition. </p><p>• <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=ca90d95204804bd89783b5c958b6df88\">Tom Brady performs the sort of sliding tackle that would get you sent off in the other kind of football</a>. </p><p>• <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=7831fc26d00c4be7b136bdc2eec230c5\">Tantrum of the weekend belongs to Jim Harbaugh, whose toys finished up a long way from the pram</a> after officials upheld an admittedly highly questionable call stating that Harry Douglas had completed a catch on third down late in the fourth quarter. </p><p>• One enormous question for San Francisco to address over the next fortnight: how do you solve a problem like David Akers? The kicker had already missed more field goals this season than anybody else in the league, and on another day <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000128701/Akers-misses-Samuel-lets-him-hear-it\">his failure to convert from 38 yards midway through the third quarter</a> could have been the difference between winning and losing. Going into a Super Bowl with a kicker you cannot trust is not the sort of spot that anybody wants to be in – least of all a team who blew the NFC title game last year with the help of some critical special teams gaffes. </p><p>• All eight of the NFL's head coaching vacancies have now been filled, but <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000127869/article/no-africanamerican-nfl-head-coaches-hired-in-2013\">there is consternation around the league that none went to an African-American</a>. The Rooney Rule obliges all teams to interview at least one minority candidate, but of course all are free to hire as they see fit. The issue is an incredibly delicate one, with teams well within their rights to decide themselves which coach best suits their team's needs – but the league battling with a huge perception problem. Following the sackings of Romeo Crennel and Lovie Smith, there will be just three African-American head coaches in the NFL next year.</p><p><strong><em>Over the next two weeks we will have all the build up to the Super Bowl and extensive live coverage of the game itself.
