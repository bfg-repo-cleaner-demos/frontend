        "body":"<p>With Ed Miliband's recent call for energy prices to be frozen - followed shortly by huge hikes by leading companies SSE and British Gas - analysts at Liberum have taken a look at companies most exposed to changes in government policy.</p><p>They said:</p><p><blockquote>The tentacles of government are growing – price fixing at utilities muted by Miliband, interference about speed of payment at the constructors, growing politics surrounding outsourcing, pressure on Royal Bank of Scotland, risk of increased transport regulation. We highlight stocks with the largest exposure to government 'meddling'.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Liberum split them into sectors, starting with support services which is already under pressure after investigations into government contracts run by G4S and Serco:</p><p><blockquote>The current stasis in outsourcing looks likely to extend into a prolonged pre/post election hiatus. The implications of the ongoing investigation (and the likelihood of negative headlines) spread beyond Serco (hold) and result in our cautious sector stance – Mitie  (sell), Babcock (hold).<br /></blockquote></p><p>In the construction sector, Liberum said government initiatives to support small suppliers are putting pressure on cash flows, although a recovery in volumes and alternative funding could provide an offset.</p><p>Possible measures to cool the London housing market - Liberum suggests a tax on foreigner buyers if not primary home, 50% of new build schemes must be UK buyers - could hit Capital &amp; Counties Properties.</p><p>Utilities of course face the threat of price caps, while the media awaits the final outcome of the Leveson enquiry. In aerospace and defence, Liberum said:</p><p><blockquote>Government attempts to boost UK exports to £1tr by 2020 are highly relevant given the defence industry's export potential. However, there is risk of negative meddling surrounding big ticket platforms, such as the new aircraft carriers built by BAE Systems and Babcock.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>On transport, Liberum said FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach are all exposed to the tougher regulation proposed by Labour.</p><p>Finally Royal Bank of Scotland could be forced to split into a good and bad bank.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420342030|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|9b7c0ecb690224f04fd122c6b017cc60bf69ae11 -->",

        "body":"<p>Payday lender Wonga has continued its global expansion with the purchase of German payment firm BillPay.</p><p></p><p>The controversial online lender, which charges an annual interest rate on UK loans of more than 5,000%, said the deal \"significantly accelerates our development into a broad-based, digital finance group\".</p><p></p><p>The German firm lets people pay for items bought online with a range of different payment methods, including instalment credit. Founded in 2009, it has around 2 million users and more than 3,500 online partners in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands.</p><p></p><p>Wonga has a similar PayLater service which allows customers to spread the cost of items up to £1,000 over three monthly payments in return for an upfront fee, although it only has around 20 retailers on board so far.</p><p></p><p>It said the purchase of BillPay would help the development of this service, and help its development internationally.</p><p></p><p>Wonga's chief executive, Errol Damelin, said: \"The combined Wonga and BillPay business will consolidate our position as a pioneer in the financial revolution, offering customers a range of bold new payment and credit solutions for the modern world.</p><p></p><p>\"As well as giving Wonga a presence in Europe's second largest online retail market, this deal continues our ongoing transformation into a fully international, digital finance business with operations across three continents and more than 3 million customers.\"</p><p></p><p>The founder of BillPay, Nelson Holzner, will remain with the group. He said:\"All of us at BillPay are delighted we are joining forces with such a large and innovative group as Wonga. We feel our services and ethos are entirely complementary and we look forward to working with them.\"</p><p></p><p>Wnga has already expanded into several markets around the world and now offers short-term high cost credit in South Africa, Poland and Canada. Earlier this year it also bought a Spanish payday lender, Credito Pocket, and a stake in an Indian firm, Nahar Credits Private.</p><p></p><p>It recently quietly rebranded its Wonga for Business offer in the UK to Everline.com.</p><p></p><p>However, the bulk of its lending is still made to UK consumers; in 2012 they accounted for 3.8m of its 4m loans over the year, amounting to a total of £1.2bn.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420338805|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|b23ec3b4baf1488e3826bfd59523783f626b0a7f -->",

Private equity firm Sun European Partners, which also owns women's fashion chain Jacques Vert and bedding retailer Dreams, bought the business  from the Peacock Group in a deal that allowed them to close more than 100 unprofitable Bonmarché stores.</p><p>Under its chief executive, Beth Butterwick, the tills have been ringing again, with 13% sales growth in the six months to the end of September, compared to the same period last year. Bonmarché claims to have 1.8 million active members, and 6.5 million people, registered on its Bonus Club reward scheme. As well as re-fitting some of its 264 shops, the group is now scouting for new locations and plans to open stores in garden centres, as part of a tie-up with the Garden Centre Group.</p><p>Since Sun European Partners took over, the company has earned £9.1m on an income measure that counts earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Butterwick said: \"We are confident that our competitive position and loyal customer base means that we are well placed to capitalise on this attractive and fast growing niche of the retail sector.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420334990|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|a3ba745bcf21dbc8719560eddc1f31990417555d -->",

        "body":"<p>Unions at Grangemouth oil refinery would \"happily\" agree not to strike until the end of this year, in return for employers reopening talks about future conditions for workers, the Scottish secretary of the Unite union said on Friday.</p><p>Pat Rafferty's comments came after Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, called for a \"truce deal\" between unions and operator Ineos, which has shut down the plant on safety grounds in the face of threatened industrial action.</p><p>Ineos director Tom Crotty said the company would be ready to reopen the complex on the Firth of Forth if it received formal assurances from Unite that there would be no strike between now and the end of December. The union has called off a 48-hour strike planned for Sunday.</p><p>Rafferty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We would happily sign up to having no more strikes until the end of the year.</p><p>\"We will enter happily into an agreement right now that will take us to Christmas, where we will have no industrial action and no ballots. In return for that, all we ask the company to do is sit down with us at the negotiating table over the next 45 days and look to try and seek agreement.</p><p>\"We are willing to say no strikes until the end of December and we welcome the first minister's input. What we are saying is, in return for that , the company should sit down with us over the next 45 days. The plant should be turned on. There's no reason right now why that plant shouldn't be turned on, because there's no industrial action.\"</p><p>Rafferty said the no-strike offer until the end of 2013 was on the table at recent talks at conciliation service Acas, but he said Ineos \"walked away\" from those talks and moved to impose \"detrimental terms and conditions\" on workers.</p><p>Asked whether Ineos could reopen Grangemouth in response to the Unite offer, Crotty told Today: \"Of course we can. If we get the assurance, we will switch the plant on. If we get that formally, then that's great.\"</p><p>He added: \"What we are trying to do right now is talk to our employees about the urgent changes we need to make to this site.</p><p>\"We have a business that's losing £10m every month. We've put £1bn into that business. We need to put another £300m into it to get it sorted out, to build a new terminal that will allow us to bring new sources of gas in, because the gas in the North Sea is running out.</p><p>\"If we don't do that, that site will close. By 2017, it will not exist. That's a disaster for Scotland that we are desperately trying to avoid. We're working to save this site. To do that we need our employees to help. That's what we are talking to our employees about right now.\"</p><p>Ineos released a statement later on Friday confirming it would restart the Grangemouth site if it received a guarantee that there will be no further industrial action during the 60 day consultation period on the Ineos Survival Plan for the site.</p><p>Calum Maclean, Grangemouth's chairman said: \"We have been very clear that for compelling safety reasons, we cannot restart the site until we know that the risk of further industrial action has been removed. We can confirm that we would restart if there was a clear guarantee that there would be no further action during the next 60 days. This would allow us to complete a full consultation process with our employees on the changes that the site so urgently needs.\"</p><p>Ineos has previously said it is keeping the plant shut while workers are consulted about proposed changes to issues such as pensions.</p><p>Letters have been sent to the homes of Grangemouth workers detailing changes to their terms and conditions, including ending their final salary pension scheme, freezing pay and bonuses, reducing shift allowances and new agreements with unions including having part-time conveners.</p><p>The letter said: \"We expect to seek individual employee agreement to the final changes, and, where agreement is not forthcoming, to implement the changes in due course by issuing notices of termination and offering new contracts of employment to those employees which incorporate the new terms.\"</p><p>Unite said staff have been told to accept the new terms and conditions by 6pm on Monday, which amounts to a \"sign or be sacked\" ultimatum, and that it is considering legal action.</p><p>Ineos said it is going directly to the employees rather than deal with their union, amid fresh clashes over the company's finances and its decision to close the plant.</p><p>The Grangemouth refining and chemicals complex has been shut down twice in the last 40 years – during a previous strike in 2008 and again in preparation for the latest walkout, according to Ineos.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420331385|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|3b9939f8357ee40642d1f8e5f00975954300c931 -->",

        "headline":"China's economy grows by 7.8%",
        "body":"<p>China's economy grew 7.8% in the third quarter, its fastest pace this year and in line with expectations, as firmer foreign and domestic demand lifted factory production and retail sales.</p> <p>Yet any optimism from the government figures released on Friday could fade quickly as global demand remains volatile, which was underlined by a surprise fall in exports in September. Efforts at home to engineer slower but more sustainable growth will also weigh on the economy in coming quarters, analysts say.</p> <p>\"The Q3 GDP figure is in line with market expectations but the uncertainty is whether the current recovery is sustainable,\" said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong.</p> <p>\"We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market.\"</p> <p>After three decades of blistering expansion fuelled by exports and investment, Beijing is trying to shift the economic mix so that activity is geared much more to consumption. That means a slowdown from the double-digit growth of previous years.</p> <p>Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the world's second-largest economy to grow 7.8% in the third quarter from a year earlier, picking up from 7.5% in the second quarter and compared with 7.7% in the first. The latest expansion was the strongest since 7.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The data showed that the economy grew 2.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis from the previous quarter.</p> <p>The GDP readings keep China on track to achieve the government's 2013 growth target of 7.5%, stronger than other major economies but still the worst performance for the country in 23 years.</p> <p>Growth in the first nine months of the year was 7.7%, the data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.</p> <p>\"We have confidence in fulfilling the targets set out for economic and social development in 2013,\" Premier Li Keqiang said this month.</p> <p>In other figures released on Friday, factory output in September rose 10.2% from a year earlier, slightly above expectations of 10.1% and slowing down from August's annual pace of 10.4%.</p> <p>Retail sales rose 13.3% from a year earlier, slightly below expectations for an increase of 13.5%.</p> <p>Fixed asset investment, a crucial growth driver, rose in the first nine months of 2013 by 20.2% compared with a year earlier. Analysts had expected a rise of 20.3%.</p> <p>Real estate investment increased 19.7% in the first nine months of the year compared with a year earlier, picking up slightly from 19.3% in the first eight months.</p> <p>The fragility of China's economic revival was underscored last week when data showed September's exports fell 0.3% from a year earlier, in stark contrast to expectations for a 6% rise.</p> <p>Weaker demand in south-east Asia had driven the surprise drop in exports, as fears of possible US monetary policy tightening led investors to retreat from emerging markets, bruising consumer confidence and demand for Chinese goods.</p> <p>With China's economic pick-up so shaky, most economists believe Chinese authorities are likely to stand still on monetary policy in the next year and a half. But at the same time, few believe Beijing would dramatically loosen policy to aid growth, barring a sharp downturn.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420318542|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|63f1430dbeda78aad74290f15390f802eda4bade -->",

        "body":"<p>Warrnambool Cheese and Butter Factory's second-largest shareholder has launched a $420m bid for the Australian dairy company on Friday, trumping two previous offers and fanning speculation of an even higher bid.</p> <p>Murray Goulburn Co-operative, which owns about 17% of WCB, is offering $7.50 per share in cash, more than the $7 per share bid from Canada's Saputo.</p> <p>Australian company Bega Cheese, WBC's largest shareholder with almost 18%, had kicked off the bidding war with an initial cash and share offer worth $5.78 per share in September.</p> <p>\"The question now is what Saputo does from here,\" said Mark Topy, senior industrials analyst at Canaccord Genuity. \"Bega is an outside chance to bid higher but Saputo, they're a big global company, they've got the pockets to bid higher.\"</p> <p>Shares in WCB jumped 6% to a record high of $7.90, having traded at around $4.50 per share before Bega's September offer.</p> <p>Bega could also find itself in Saputo's sights, Topy added.</p> <p>\"They could bid for Bega Cheese and then put their foot on Warrnambool Holdings as well, so the market is pretty hot at the moment.\"</p> <p>Australian dairy farmers have been grappling with a supermarket price war that slashed domestic wholesale prices, a strong Australian dollar that crimped exports and a drought that sent cattle feed costs soaring. But growing demand from Asia for dairy products and other sources of protein have attracted international buyers to the sector.</p> <p>Murray Goulburn also agreed to match the Saputo proposal regarding the payment of a fully-franked special dividend, meaning the total gross proceeds of the takeover was $8.00 per share, according to Rivkin Securities.</p> <p>\"This is a historic opportunity for Murray Goulburn and WCB suppliers and shareholders to create a larger-scale, globally competitive Australian dairy food company, owned and controlled by Australian dairy farmers,\" Murray Goulburn chairman Philip Tracy said.</p> <p>\"Importantly, it will retain the primary objectives of a co-operative in maximising farm gate returns for farmer owners.\"</p> <p>Murray Goulburn said it had secured financing for the deal, which it said would create one of the top-20 dairy companies in the world and protect the interests of Australian dairy farmers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420318151|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|db28ab39c07716176524b0b08552abcee32af5e3 -->",

        "body":"<p>There were three noteworthy things in the retail sales figures. The first is that Britons have got their appetite for shopping back, and that means stronger growth. Sales volumes in the third quarter of 2013 were 1.5% up on the second quarter, enough to add 0.2%-0.3% to gross domestic product. We are set for a chunky GDP number from the ONS next Friday. Growth is likely to be at least 0.8%.</p><p>The second thing to note is that September's 0.6% was mainly, but not entirely, the result of spending on household goods.</p><p>Increased activity in the housing market is having an impact, but consumers are also feeling more confident, which is why clothing and footwear stores also did good business last month.</p><p>The final thing to note is that the high street is witnessing a battle of two opposing forces. On the one hand there is the boost from rising employment, stronger consumer confidence and higher house prices. On the other there is the drag from squeezed disposable incomes, which British Gas has just intensified.</p><p>On balance, retail sales will continue to grow but further quarterly increases of 1.5% are unlikely and would suggest consumers are becoming financially stretched.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420304499|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|4ab3bef88b58e2593c5770773ba79cb888416dbf -->",

        "body":"<p>The EU's financial services chief has defended the right to cap City bankers' lavish bonuses in the face of a legal challenge from Britain over new pay rules.</p><p>Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for internal markets, said he understood the UK's desire to protect its \"golden goose\" but insisted the limit is legal. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/25/osborne-bankers-bonuses-eu-cap\" title=\"\">Since the Treasury announced last month it would test the EU's new bonus rules at the European court of justice,</a> George Osborne has been criticised for being too quick to defend the Tory party's allies in the City.</p><p>Speaking at the London School of Economics on Thursday, Barnier said: \"The UK is not a special case in wanting to protect its golden goose. But neither is it in Europe's interest for the City of London to lose its place as one of the world's top financial centres. And it's not our intention.\"</p><p>Speaking to reporters afterwards, he said: \"I know the rules of the game: all the rules which are agreed at EU level can be brought to the court of justice of the EU.\" Barnier added: \"We continue to believe the legal basis which was chosen [for the bonus cap] was correct.\"</p><p>He said rules to limit bankers' bonuses were the only area where the UK had found itself isolated since the financial crisis, suggesting it was \"perhaps not the best example\" to have chosen.</p><p>The cap, which will come into force in January, restricts bonuses to 100% of bankers' base salaries, or up to 200% with explicit shareholder approval.</p><p>The Treasury argues that the new regime was rushed through without adequate evidence and could even make banks riskier if boards respond by increasing employees' base salaries, which cannot be clawed back later if the future of the bank is under threat.</p><p>A Treasury spokesman said: \"Britain has been at the forefront of global reforms to make banking more responsible, including big reductions in upfront cash bonuses and linking rewards to long-term success. These latest EU rules on bonuses, rushed through without any assessment of their impact, will undermine all of this by pushing bankers' fixed pay up rather than down, which will make banks themselves riskier rather than safer.\"</p><p>Barnier was also keen to play down the risks of a damaging rift between eurozone member countries over the best way of preventing future banking crises.</p><p>He said a deal on a controversial proposed rescue scheme for banks – the single resolution mechanism, which is a key part of the EU's planned banking union – was \"difficult, and possible\" by the end of the year. However, he conceded it would not be up and running in time to deal with the legacy of underfunded banks.</p><p>The European Central Bank is shortly due to start combing through European banks' balance sheets in an asset quality review before subjecting them to stress tests to ascertain whether any should be required to shore up their finances.</p><p>But with no agreement yet on who would step in if a struggling bank's home state cannot afford to support it, analysts have warned that the stress tests could rattle markets and reignite the eurozone financial crisis.</p><p>Analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note on Thursday that the asset quality review \"could prove to be the defining policy issue for the euro area next year\", warning: \"Ineffective and incompetent execution – an unfortunate feature of many political responses during the crisis – could bring about a resumption of financial turbulence and relapse back into recession.\"</p><p>Barnier conceded that there would need to be \"backstops\" if the review identified funding gaps that could not be filled by shareholders or governments.\"These exercises may throw up certain funding gaps. That is the point. We are shining a light into the dark corners,\" he said. \"If banks are not able to raise capital in the markets – which could still be the case for a few – we will have a clear framework in place, with bail-in, and national and if necessary European backstops.\"</p><p>But asked whether that meant using the eurozone bailout fund, the European stability mechanism, to rescue banks – an idea that is anathema to Germany – he said: \"There's a whole discussion whichministers are having right now between themselves. The commission doesn't sit around that table: the ESM is an intergovernmental project.\"</p><h2>Goldman Sachs cuts wages bill</h2><p>Goldman Sachs slashed its wage bill by 35% in the third quarter as bond-trading revenue plunged, an unusual step that signals the bank's concern about performance for the rest of the year. Revenue from trading fixed-income, currency and commodity products for clients, one of the bank's biggest businesses, tumbled 44% in the quarter, Goldman reported  on Thursday.</p><p>Excluding an accounting adjustment, the drop was 47%, a much sharper decline than those posted by rivals. \"Goldman showed that they are also mortal,\" said Michael Holland, founder of Holland &amp; Co, which owns financial stocks but does not own Goldman shares.</p><p>Goldman responded to the weaker revenue by setting aside less money to pay employees during the quarter - $2.4bn, compared with $3.7bn in the same quarter last year. That amounted to 35% of its revenue in the quarter, while the bank's target is usually closer to 43%.</p><p>The firm sometimes cuts the money it sets aside for pay in a quarter, but it usually does so in the fourth quarter, when there is no hope of earning extra revenue for the year. Doing so in the third quarter signals that it does not expect a big rebound in the fourth quarter. <strong>Reuters</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420291409|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|3ecc9159e2fde822b641b4f5a42b564265d76604 -->",

        "headline":"China's economy grows by 7.8%",
        "body":"<p>China's economy grew 7.8% in the third quarter, its fastest pace this year and in line with expectations, as firmer foreign and domestic demand lifted factory production and retail sales.</p> <p>Yet any optimism from the government figures released on Friday could fade quickly as global demand remains volatile, which was underlined by a surprise fall in exports in September. Efforts at home to engineer slower but more sustainable growth will also weigh on the economy in coming quarters, analysts say.</p> <p>\"The Q3 GDP figure is in line with market expectations but the uncertainty is whether the current recovery is sustainable,\" said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong.</p> <p>\"We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market.\"</p> <p>After three decades of blistering expansion fuelled by exports and investment, Beijing is trying to shift the economic mix so that activity is geared much more to consumption. That means a slowdown from the double-digit growth of previous years.</p> <p>Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the world's second-largest economy to grow 7.8% in the third quarter from a year earlier, picking up from 7.5% in the second quarter and compared with 7.7% in the first. The latest expansion was the strongest since 7.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The data showed that the economy grew 2.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis from the previous quarter.</p> <p>The GDP readings keep China on track to achieve the government's 2013 growth target of 7.5%, stronger than other major economies but still the worst performance for the country in 23 years.</p> <p>Growth in the first nine months of the year was 7.7%, the data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.</p> <p>\"We have confidence in fulfilling the targets set out for economic and social development in 2013,\" Premier Li Keqiang said this month.</p> <p>In other figures released on Friday, factory output in September rose 10.2% from a year earlier, slightly above expectations of 10.1% and slowing down from August's annual pace of 10.4%.</p> <p>Retail sales rose 13.3% from a year earlier, slightly below expectations for an increase of 13.5%.</p> <p>Fixed asset investment, a crucial growth driver, rose in the first nine months of 2013 by 20.2% compared with a year earlier. Analysts had expected a rise of 20.3%.</p> <p>Real estate investment increased 19.7% in the first nine months of the year compared with a year earlier, picking up slightly from 19.3% in the first eight months.</p> <p>The fragility of China's economic revival was underscored last week when data showed September's exports fell 0.3% from a year earlier, in stark contrast to expectations for a 6% rise.</p> <p>Weaker demand in south-east Asia had driven the surprise drop in exports, as fears of possible US monetary policy tightening led investors to retreat from emerging markets, bruising consumer confidence and demand for Chinese goods.</p> <p>With China's economic pick-up so shaky, most economists believe Chinese authorities are likely to stand still on monetary policy in the next year and a half. But at the same time, few believe Beijing would dramatically loosen policy to aid growth, barring a sharp downturn.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420318542|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|63f1430dbeda78aad74290f15390f802eda4bade -->",

        "body":"<p>The New Look and Hugo Boss owner, Permira, is set to step into Dr Martens, the privately owned boot maker loved by pop starlet Miley Cyrus and Harry Potter actor Emma Watson, in a £300m deal.</p><p>The Griggs family, who founded every student's favourite footwear brand more than 50 years ago, are understood to be have been in talks with Permira, a British private equity firm, for several months. An offer for a majority stake in the company is expected to be announced in the next few weeks.</p><p>If the deal is confirmed, Permira would take control of Dr Martens' parent company R Griggs Group but may only acquire a licence to use the Dr Martens name, with the family retaining outright ownership of the brand.</p><p>The buyout firm is likely to try to expand Dr Martens' online and store presence into new international markets after a revival in its fortunes in recent years. It has just 30 wholly owned stores and another 70 partner, franchise or concession outlets across 63 countries at present.</p><p>The Northampton-based Griggs family began as shoemakers in 1901. In the late 1950s Bill Griggs saw an advert by a German duo – Dr Klaus Märtens and his university friend Dr Herbert Funck – looking for overseas partners. Their revolutionary new air-cushioned sole was originally made with abandoned rubber from Luftwaffe airfields. Griggs got in touch, the German name was anglicised and the first pair of boots rolled off the production line in Northamptonshire in April 1960.</p><p>The brand first became a fashion icon when early skinheads wanted to mimic the dress of working-class men. Other fashion tribes from mods to 1990s Britpop kids have taken a shine to the boots over the years.</p><p>A decade ago Dr Martens was struggling for survival as its clumpy boots went out of fashion. In 2000 production was moved from the UK to China and Thailand.</p><p>But R Griggs reopened the brand's original factory at Wollaston, Northamptonshire, in 2007 to produce vintage styles.</p><p>Dr Martens' star has risen again in the past few years as the boots have found favour with a new generation of fans.</p><p>The model Agyness Deyn designs a range for the brand, which has expanded into clothing and accessories as well as the famous boots which are worn by schoolgirls and aging skinheads alike.</p><p>Under managing director David Suddens, who is expected to remain with the company, sales rose 27% in the year to March 2013 to £126m on top of a 14% rise the previous year.

        "headline":"British Gas: energy bills price hike turns into PR disaster",
        "body":"<p>British Gas has turned a consumer and political backlash over a 10% increase in energy bills into a public relations disaster after trying to head off criticism of the price hike by using social media.</p><p>Nearly 16,000 Twitter comments – most of them vitriolic – rained down on Britain's biggest power provider in a few hours after it invited questions from customers. One online expert described the company's attempt to ease public anger over the new tariffs as one of the biggest PR own goals he had ever seen.</p><p>The energy price increases – three times the level of inflation – will affect 16 million customers and came in for particular condemnation because the parent group, Centrica, had pledged earlier in the year to use windfall profits from last winter to keep prices down.</p><p>David Cameron, who appointed the company's &pound;4m-a-year boss Sam Laidlaw to his business advisory group in 2010, said the rise was very disappointing and urged customers to switch providers. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, said some of British Gas's numbers &quot;just don't add up&quot;.</p><p>But there were more venomous comments, spliced with the darkest humour, after the energy supplier invited users of Twitter to raise questions with its customer services director.</p><p>&quot;My Nan's just been on the phone (no twitter) Should she burn the garden table or the chairs first to keep warm?&quot; wrote one Twitter user. &quot;Have you started an affiliate scheme with a funeral directors?&quot; said another with reference to the number of elderly people who die in cold winters.</p><p>The hashtag &quot;AskBG&quot; was the top trend on UK Twitter within an hour of British Gas launching its chat; scores of tweets contained the words &quot;greed&quot; and &quot;death&quot;.</p><p>Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy, defended his decision to use social media to engage with customers and the wider decision to raise bills. &quot;I would not describe this as a PR disaster. We have made a commitment to be open and transparent. These are tough decisions we have had to take in tough times and it would not be right of us to hide away and not explain ourselves.&quot;</p><p>British Gas had taken to Twitter after unveiling a 10.4% rise in electricity prices and an 8.4% increase in the gas tariff from 23 November. The increase was announced a week after slightly smaller moves by SSE, another of the &quot;big six&quot; power companies. Some customers face bills of &pound;1,500 a year although fixed-price tariffs have also been introduced together with special help for those in need.</p><p>Peters said the decision to raise prices had not been taken lightly, but had been forced on the company by soaring costs despite promises to keep prices down after benefiting from larger-than-expected demand at the turn of this year.</p><p>He blamed the price rises on higher wholesale gas costs, charges for transport and distribution and the cost of government policies such as the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) to help insulate homes. The ECO element alone will add &pound;40 to average dual fuel bills in 2014, according to British Gas. However, this calculation was challenged by the energy secretary, who had also described the wider bill increases as disappointing.</p><p>Davey said: &quot;I recently wrote to energy companies asking them to publish their costs of delivering the Energy Company Obligation. Today's announcement shows why that is necessary, because British Gas ECO numbers just don't add up when you look at what other energy companies are saying about their costs.&quot;</p><p>Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, said the British Gas move reinforced Labour's determination to introduce a price freeze if it returns to government in 2015. &quot;This is the company that, with Centrica, has passed on the highest share of its profits to its shareholders while at the same time making the least amount of investment into what we need to ensure our energy security in the future.&quot;</p><p>Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, said the price rise increased the number of households where people would need to choose between &quot;heating and eating&quot;. He added: &quot;This price hike is big, and is nasty. It also means that two of the big six sheep have bleated, the rest are likely to follow within the next six weeks.&quot;</p><p>The Federation of Small Businesses said 40% of its members used British Gas and the &quot;disgraceful&quot; price increases would make life even harder for many struggling firms.</p><p>Twitter users seized on British Gas's attempt to explain its decision, particularly when its PR customer services director offered &quot;advice and tips&quot; on how to save money and blamed the price rise on the &quot;general wholesale energy trend&quot;.</p><p>One reply said: &quot;@BritishGas have you found a way to channel angry customer feedback into electricity?&quot; A British Gas advert for a social media senior manager, a job that comes with a salary of up to &pound;60,000, also attracted attention. The successful candidate, the advert says, will have a detailed understanding of Twitter and Facebook and &quot;implement social media best practice and innovation&quot;.</p><p>Matt Owen, head of social at Econsultancy, said it was one of the worst PR disasters on social media he had ever seen. &quot;It is a rotten PR fail … It is just ridiculous that they had set this up on the day of this huge price hike. They should have been prepared for vitriol and a backlash, but to exacerbate it by holding an 'ask me anything' session is ridiculous.&quot;</p><p>British Gas had made the situation even worse by failing to answer customers' Twitter questions, he added. &quot;They needed to be transparent and at least have some kind of [web] landing page on why [the price increases are] happening. As it was there were just vague mutterings about 'wholesale prices' and that sort of thing, which isn't going to stop the shouting.&quot;</p><p>The social media firestorm that engulfed British Gas may be the worst since Starbucks invited its customers to &quot;spread the cheer&quot; on Twitter screens at a London museum last Christmas, prompting a storm of angry tweets over its failure to pay UK corporation tax.</p><p>Waitrose provoked more gentle mockery of its posh image when it invited Twitter users to say why they shopped at the store, while Tesco was the laughing stock of the internet when – at the height of the horse-meat scandal – its customer services team signed off with the tweet: &quot;We're off to hit the hay&quot;.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420298241|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|f7519a2d1c746cc5827957ac1d85346da2ea53de -->",

        "body":"<p>Unions at Grangemouth oil refinery would \"happily\" agree not to strike until the end of this year, in return for employers reopening talks about future conditions for workers, the Scottish secretary of the Unite union said on Friday.</p><p>Pat Rafferty's comments came after Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, called for a \"truce deal\" between unions and operator Ineos, which has shut down the plant on safety grounds in the face of threatened industrial action.</p><p>Ineos director Tom Crotty said the company would be ready to reopen the complex on the Firth of Forth if it received formal assurances from Unite that there would be no strike between now and the end of December. The union has called off a 48-hour strike planned for Sunday.</p><p>Rafferty told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We would happily sign up to having no more strikes until the end of the year.</p><p>\"We will enter happily into an agreement right now that will take us to Christmas, where we will have no industrial action and no ballots. In return for that, all we ask the company to do is sit down with us at the negotiating table over the next 45 days and look to try and seek agreement.</p><p>\"We are willing to say no strikes until the end of December and we welcome the first minister's input. What we are saying is, in return for that , the company should sit down with us over the next 45 days. The plant should be turned on. There's no reason right now why that plant shouldn't be turned on, because there's no industrial action.\"</p><p>Rafferty said the no-strike offer until the end of 2013 was on the table at recent talks at conciliation service Acas, but he said Ineos \"walked away\" from those talks and moved to impose \"detrimental terms and conditions\" on workers.</p><p>Asked whether Ineos could reopen Grangemouth in response to the Unite offer, Crotty told Today: \"Of course we can. If we get the assurance, we will switch the plant on. If we get that formally, then that's great.\"</p><p>He added: \"What we are trying to do right now is talk to our employees about the urgent changes we need to make to this site.</p><p>\"We have a business that's losing £10m every month. We've put £1bn into that business. We need to put another £300m into it to get it sorted out, to build a new terminal that will allow us to bring new sources of gas in, because the gas in the North Sea is running out.</p><p>\"If we don't do that, that site will close. By 2017, it will not exist. That's a disaster for Scotland that we are desperately trying to avoid. We're working to save this site. To do that we need our employees to help. That's what we are talking to our employees about right now.\"</p><p>Ineos released a statement later on Friday confirming it would restart the Grangemouth site if it received a guarantee that there will be no further industrial action during the 60 day consultation period on the Ineos Survival Plan for the site.</p><p>Calum Maclean, Grangemouth's chairman said: \"We have been very clear that for compelling safety reasons, we cannot restart the site until we know that the risk of further industrial action has been removed. We can confirm that we would restart if there was a clear guarantee that there would be no further action during the next 60 days. This would allow us to complete a full consultation process with our employees on the changes that the site so urgently needs.\"</p><p>Ineos has previously said it is keeping the plant shut while workers are consulted about proposed changes to issues such as pensions.</p><p>Letters have been sent to the homes of Grangemouth workers detailing changes to their terms and conditions, including ending their final salary pension scheme, freezing pay and bonuses, reducing shift allowances and new agreements with unions including having part-time conveners.</p><p>The letter said: \"We expect to seek individual employee agreement to the final changes, and, where agreement is not forthcoming, to implement the changes in due course by issuing notices of termination and offering new contracts of employment to those employees which incorporate the new terms.\"</p><p>Unite said staff have been told to accept the new terms and conditions by 6pm on Monday, which amounts to a \"sign or be sacked\" ultimatum, and that it is considering legal action.</p><p>Ineos said it is going directly to the employees rather than deal with their union, amid fresh clashes over the company's finances and its decision to close the plant.</p><p>The Grangemouth refining and chemicals complex has been shut down twice in the last 40 years – during a previous strike in 2008 and again in preparation for the latest walkout, according to Ineos.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420331385|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|3b9939f8357ee40642d1f8e5f00975954300c931 -->",

        "body":"<p>Bonmarché, the fashion chain aimed at women over 50, is preparing to float on the London stock exchange in November, in a further sign of surging activity on equity markets.</p><p>The retailer, best known for its plus-size ranges, announced on Friday that it plans to sell shares on the Alternative Investment Market next month, telling investors that it was poised for growth as the number of older women is set to rise.</p><p>Bonmarché is only the latest high-retailer to eye the stock market, with House of Fraser and furniture store DFS rumoured to be seeking a listing, while entrepreneur Clive Coombes is bidding to revive the Comet brand and float the chain of electrical goods shops on Aim, a junior market on the London Stock Exchange. As well as the privatisation of Royal Mail this month, estate agent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/20/foxtons-share-price-stock-market-debut\" title=\"\">Foxtons made its stock market debut recently</a>, while property website <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/08/zoopla-weighs-stock-market-flotation\" title=\"\">Zoopla is also mulling going public</a>.</p><p>The Bonmarché listing would represent a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for the Wakefield-based company, after it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/23/bonmarche-sale-1400-jobs\" title=\"\">sold with the loss of 1,400 jobs</a> at the start of last year, as it became another victim of fierce competition on the high street.  Private equity firm Sun European Partners, which also owns women's fashion chain Jacques Vert and bedding retailer Dreams, bought the business  from the Peacock Group in a deal that allowed them to close more than 100 unprofitable Bonmarché stores.</p><p>Under its chief executive, Beth Butterwick, the tills have been ringing again, with 13% sales growth in the six months to the end of September, compared to the same period last year. Bonmarché claims to have 1.8 million active members, and 6.5 million people, registered on its Bonus Club reward scheme. As well as re-fitting some of its 264 shops, the group is now scouting for new locations and plans to open stores in garden centres, as part of a tie-up with the Garden Centre Group.</p><p>Since Sun European Partners took over, the company has earned £9.1m on an income measure that counts earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Butterwick said: \"We are confident that our competitive position and loyal customer base means that we are well placed to capitalise on this attractive and fast growing niche of the retail sector.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420334990|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|a3ba745bcf21dbc8719560eddc1f31990417555d -->",

        "headline":"Budget airline to start flights from Gatwick to New York next summer",
        "body":"<p>The promise of low-cost air travel from Britain to the US that died with Laker Airways in the 1980s has been revived with Scandinavian carrier Norwegian starting budget services from Gatwick airport to New York next summer.</p><p>Gatwick claimed it was a \"game-changing\" development in the lucrative transatlantic market. A one-way ticket from London to the Big Apple will start at £149. Norwegian's services will use the new Boeing Dreamliner which, despite its teething problems with incinerating batteries, is highly valued by airlines for its fuel savings.</p><p>Norwegian's low-cost services will have a degree more comfort than the model pioneered by Ryanair. US-bound passengers will have seat-back entertainment included in their ticket price but will have to pay a further £30 for an extra package that includes meals, a baggage allowance and reserved seating.</p><p>Alongside the three services a week to New York starting in July, the airline will start twice-weekly flights to Fort Lauderdale in Florida and to Los Angeles, also for under £200.</p><p>The venture recalls the pioneering efforts of the doomed Laker Airways, which briefly blew open the transatlantic aviation market with its low-fares model before going bust in 1982. So far its no-frills emulators have resisted moving into long-haul. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has frequently expressed interest but claimed that the economics currently rule out longer low-cost flights.</p><p>However, Norwegian's chief executive, Bjørn Kjos, said that his airline was uniquely placed to succeed through the combination of having already operated a no-frills short-haul model and acquiring the Dreamliner, which should cut fuel bills by at least 20%. Kjos said: \"There's great demand for high-quality flights at a low fare between the UK and the US, particularly to and from London Gatwick, where no other airline currently offers these routes.\"</p><p>Both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have dropped New York flights from Gatwick after deeming them economically unviable, although the airlines fly to other US leisure destinations from the Sussex airport.</p><p>Gatwick, though, believes that the \"hub-busting\" Boeing 787, a plane that can reach distant destinations despite being smaller than the A380 superjumbo, can transform its role in the long-haul market.</p><p>The airport's chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: \"This is one of the most exciting route developments since Gatwick's change of ownership four years ago and shows the benefits to passengers of Gatwick competing with Heathrow on routes, price and service.</p><p>\"Norwegian's decision to re-establish London Gatwick's links to strategic destinations in North America gives passengers, once again, real choice about how to get there and, importantly, provide options for affordable travel to popular business and leisure destinations.\"</p><p>Wingate said it was a \"significant industry game-changer\" that should shape the thinking of Sir Howard Davies's airports commission, which is considering where to build extra runways in south-east England. He said: \"It points to a future in which more and more long-haul routes will be served by Gatwick.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420277208|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|57db64ed536b905031abc71c53a40d665d028d6e -->",

        "body":"<p>The Financial Conduct Authority is ready to review new allegations about potential Libor-rigging by Barclays, the bank it fined &pound;290m last year for manipulating the key interest rate.</p><p>The City regulator will decide after its informal analysis of evidence presented in the court of appeal on Thursday whether it should launch a formal investigation into the bank's involvement in the Libor market. It may decide not to do so.</p><p></p><p>A long-running case between Barclays and private health care provider Guardian Care Homes has led to allegations being raised in legal papers at the appeal court as part of the health company's attempt to have two interest rate swaps invalidated. &quot;The FCA will look at the documents, as would be expected,&quot; the regulator said.</p><p>Guardian Care Homes had loans worth &pound;70m from Barclays and alleges the bank mis-sold it interest rate swaps based on Libor that ended up costing it millions as interest rates fell. Barclays denies mis-selling and says the Libor-rigging allegations are irrelevant to the dispute.</p><p>In legal papers filed to the court, Guardian Care Homes cites a letter from Barclays' lawyers to the Singapore regulator containing details of an internal investigation by the bank between January 2006 and April 2010 into Libor.</p><p>According to Guardian Care Homes, the inquiry found that ex-Barclays employee Quan Hui Lee, now working at an investment fund run by Barclays called Ricardo Master Fund, had asked bank staff to manipulate the rate to boost the fund's returns. &quot;Go get Libor down,&quot; Lee was cited as saying.</p><p>In another email, Lee was quoted as saying: &quot;LOWER! Go for 3 percent ... I want yr end 3mL (three-month Libor) to be 2.8 percent or at worst 2.88 percent.&quot;</p><p>Citing the contents of the letter from Barclays lawyers to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, dated May 9, 2013, Guardian Care Homes said: &quot;The purpose of the fraud was to make profit or avoid losses on 'Ricardo Master Fund'&quot;.</p><p>Barclays is trying to have the Libor-related elements of the case thrown out by the appeal court, which is hearing the case in conjunction with a similar dispute between Deutsche Bank and Indian real estate developer Unitech.</p><p>&quot;[The case] is not concerned with the extent to which Barclays manipulated Libor or the regulators' reports,&quot; the bank's lead counsel Robin Dicker told the court. &quot;It is concerned with a much narrower issue, whether Guardian Care Homes can rely on such conduct to avoid or reduce its obligations.&quot;</p><p>The three court of appeal judges are due to give their ruling later this year.</p><p>A spokesman for Barclays said: &quot;The bank has chosen not to object to the introduction of new evidence to the court of appeal hearing, however the bank does not consider any of the new evidence to be relevant to the issues in front of the court of appeal.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420300215|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|ced69343d3fee2ddc8e4edfea3311c73a0b6450e -->",

        "headline":"EU commissioner defends cap on bank bonuses in face of British challenge",
        "body":"<p>The EU's financial services chief has defended the right to cap City bankers' lavish bonuses in the face of a legal challenge from Britain over new pay rules.</p><p>Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for internal markets, said he understood the UK's desire to protect its \"golden goose\" but insisted the limit is legal. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/25/osborne-bankers-bonuses-eu-cap\" title=\"\">Since the Treasury announced last month it would test the EU's new bonus rules at the European court of justice,</a> George Osborne has been criticised for being too quick to defend the Tory party's allies in the City.</p><p>Speaking at the London School of Economics on Thursday, Barnier said: \"The UK is not a special case in wanting to protect its golden goose. But neither is it in Europe's interest for the City of London to lose its place as one of the world's top financial centres. And it's not our intention.\"</p><p>Speaking to reporters afterwards, he said: \"I know the rules of the game: all the rules which are agreed at EU level can be brought to the court of justice of the EU.\" Barnier added: \"We continue to believe the legal basis which was chosen [for the bonus cap] was correct.\"</p><p>He said rules to limit bankers' bonuses were the only area where the UK had found itself isolated since the financial crisis, suggesting it was \"perhaps not the best example\" to have chosen.</p><p>The cap, which will come into force in January, restricts bonuses to 100% of bankers' base salaries, or up to 200% with explicit shareholder approval.</p><p>The Treasury argues that the new regime was rushed through without adequate evidence and could even make banks riskier if boards respond by increasing employees' base salaries, which cannot be clawed back later if the future of the bank is under threat.</p><p>A Treasury spokesman said: \"Britain has been at the forefront of global reforms to make banking more responsible, including big reductions in upfront cash bonuses and linking rewards to long-term success. These latest EU rules on bonuses, rushed through without any assessment of their impact, will undermine all of this by pushing bankers' fixed pay up rather than down, which will make banks themselves riskier rather than safer.\"</p><p>Barnier was also keen to play down the risks of a damaging rift between eurozone member countries over the best way of preventing future banking crises.</p><p>He said a deal on a controversial proposed rescue scheme for banks – the single resolution mechanism, which is a key part of the EU's planned banking union – was \"difficult, and possible\" by the end of the year. However, he conceded it would not be up and running in time to deal with the legacy of underfunded banks.</p><p>The European Central Bank is shortly due to start combing through European banks' balance sheets in an asset quality review before subjecting them to stress tests to ascertain whether any should be required to shore up their finances.</p><p>But with no agreement yet on who would step in if a struggling bank's home state cannot afford to support it, analysts have warned that the stress tests could rattle markets and reignite the eurozone financial crisis.</p><p>Analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note on Thursday that the asset quality review \"could prove to be the defining policy issue for the euro area next year\", warning: \"Ineffective and incompetent execution – an unfortunate feature of many political responses during the crisis – could bring about a resumption of financial turbulence and relapse back into recession.\"</p><p>Barnier conceded that there would need to be \"backstops\" if the review identified funding gaps that could not be filled by shareholders or governments.\"These exercises may throw up certain funding gaps. That is the point. We are shining a light into the dark corners,\" he said. \"If banks are not able to raise capital in the markets – which could still be the case for a few – we will have a clear framework in place, with bail-in, and national and if necessary European backstops.\"</p><p>But asked whether that meant using the eurozone bailout fund, the European stability mechanism, to rescue banks – an idea that is anathema to Germany – he said: \"There's a whole discussion whichministers are having right now between themselves. The commission doesn't sit around that table: the ESM is an intergovernmental project.\"</p><h2>Goldman Sachs cuts wages bill</h2><p>Goldman Sachs slashed its wage bill by 35% in the third quarter as bond-trading revenue plunged, an unusual step that signals the bank's concern about performance for the rest of the year. Revenue from trading fixed-income, currency and commodity products for clients, one of the bank's biggest businesses, tumbled 44% in the quarter, Goldman reported  on Thursday.</p><p>Excluding an accounting adjustment, the drop was 47%, a much sharper decline than those posted by rivals. \"Goldman showed that they are also mortal,\" said Michael Holland, founder of Holland &amp; Co, which owns financial stocks but does not own Goldman shares.</p><p>Goldman responded to the weaker revenue by setting aside less money to pay employees during the quarter - $2.4bn, compared with $3.7bn in the same quarter last year. That amounted to 35% of its revenue in the quarter, while the bank's target is usually closer to 43%.</p><p>The firm sometimes cuts the money it sets aside for pay in a quarter, but it usually does so in the fourth quarter, when there is no hope of earning extra revenue for the year. Doing so in the third quarter signals that it does not expect a big rebound in the fourth quarter. <strong>Reuters</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420291409|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|3ecc9159e2fde822b641b4f5a42b564265d76604 -->",

        "body":"<p>Vince Cable is pressing on with plans to open a British business bank to end the \"agony\" caused by the lack of credit supplied by traditional high-street players by appointing an ex-banker to chair the organisation.</p><p>Ron Emerson, who has worked at a number of banks, most recently Standard Chartered, is becoming chairman of the business bank, which was first announced a year ago.</p><p>But none of the £1bn promised by the chancellor in last year's autumn statement has yet been lent out.</p><p>Cable, who hopes the bank can offer as much as £10bn of loans, said it was needed as a result of the credit crunch which led to funds drying up for small businesses.</p><p>\"We know that agony continues,\" said Cable. \"The UK is coming out of the worse recession since the 1930s with a damaged banking system.\"</p><p>The bank will not set up on the high street but will provide credit to lenders which can then be passed on to small businesses. More than 50 potential lenders – including peer-to-peer lenders – have signed up.</p><p>Sixty staff are already working at the business bank and the headcount is expected to rise to 100 by the time the EU grants state aid permissions next year, when the bank is expected to operate as a standalone institution owned by the government.</p><p>The bank works by offering guarantees on loans, and inherited £1.3bn of existing schemes. The first £300m of the £1bn promised by George Osborne in last year's autumn statement is expected to be lent out soon.</p><p>Emerson said that putting the existing schemes into the business bank had bolstered lending by 58%.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420260240|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|1670295a88b3d3954d1cff714e8ff76720e513a7 -->",

The retailer has a total of 237 UK stores, with 191 Mothercare shops and 46 Early Learning Centres.</p><p>The international business performed better, with sales up 12.4% during the quarter, but it was not enough to offset the weakness in the UK and total group sales fell by 0.5%. The company's shares were up nearly 4% in lunchtime trading to 408p as the retailer beat market expectations for a sharper slowdown in the UK market.</p><p>Simon Calver, the chief executive, said: \"We are continuing to make fundamental improvements to our business in the UK, which will allow us to compete effectively in a changing marketplace.</p><p>\"However, the UK market in home and travel remained highly promotional and autumn/winter clothing faced the same warm-weather challenges as the rest of the sector but is gaining market share.\"</p><p>He added that next-day click-and-collect services would be extended to all UK Early Learning Centre stores in time for Christmas trading.</p><p>Data published by the Office for National Statistics showed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/17/online-sales-surge-uk-retailers\" title=\"\">UK retail sales returned to growth in September</a>, rising by 0.7% on a monthly basis compared with a 2.1% fall in August.</p><p>Sales were driven higher by strong demand for home furnishings.</p><p>Meanwhile growth in online retail sales between August and September was the strongest on record, according to a report by IMRG Capgemini.</p><p>The e-retail sales index rose by 13% on a monthly basis, the highest for that period since the survey began 13 years ago.</p><p>Sales increased by 20% on an annual basis, boosted by the increasing use of mobile devices for transactions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420253422|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|c8df157a405d0415353a3de30f0b431f169e8398 -->",

If the customer wants it, eventually they are going to have to provide it.\"</p><p>M&amp;S is due to update the City on its plans for its food business next week, but is not expected to reveal any plans to significantly expand its online food service, which only allows shoppers to order party food for delivery into shops.</p><p>The retailer has fought shy of food home delivery as its shoppers generally don't spend enough on each visit to make such a service profitable.</p><p>However, M&amp;S started to sell Christmas party food a few years ago and in recent weeks has launched an online butchery and fishmonger service, offering unusual cuts of meat, steak trimmed to order or unusual varieties of seafood for delivery into stores.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420179758|2013-10-18T10:47:30Z|3c5c091a159ddcac293a5e501eaff3ce8bc8624c -->",
