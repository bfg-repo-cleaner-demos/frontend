with lung disease and heart disease to closely monitor their symptoms. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Already smoke from bushfires burning in the Blue Mountains region and Muswellbrook areas has been blown east to Sydney city and coastal suburbs.&nbsp;Particle levels are likely to be higher outdoors than indoors, so people sensitive to fine particles should limit the time they spend outside.</p> <p>Bushfires can result in a large amount of smoke particles in the air, even great distances from the fires.&nbsp;The best way to avoid breathing in the smoke is to remain inside with the windows and doors closed, preferably in an air-conditioned building.</p> </blockquote> <p>NSW Health says the particles can&nbsp;cause a variety of health problems, such as itchy or burning eyes, throat irritation or runny nose and aggravate existing illnesses including bronchitis, emphysema and asthma.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525fb0ece4b0010b6627a928\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T10:42:06.111+01:00\">8.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ndrewg/statuses/390769526935003136\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The view North from Newcastle this evening.

The FFDI combines temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and the \"drought factor\", which represents the effect of recent temperatures and rainfall on fuel availability. It's used to determine<a href=\"http://www.bushfirecrc.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/KeyImage-565/pix/fire-danger-sign.jpg\"> those bushfire danger ratings you see on the side of the road</a>. </p><p>The study found that the annual, cumulative FFDI (the sum of all daily FFDI values over five-year intervals) had significantly increased at 16 out of 38 locations, and no locations had decreased. There was a particularly large increase in south-east Australia, which is visible when the values are plotted:</p><p>The research also looked at seasonal increases, this time analysing the seasonal median FFDI. The largest changes happened in spring, with big increases again seen in south-east Australia:</p><p>The authors interpret this as a lengthening of the fire season across southern Australia, though they are careful to point out that the increases in FFDI may not necessarily always equate to an increased chance of bushfires.</p><p>They also considered whether the trend was related to climate change – that is, is climate change driving the increase in fire danger weather. Previous studies have <a href=\"http://climatecommission.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/ExtremeWeatherReport_web.pdf\">indicated climate change can increase the likelihood of extreme weather events</a>, including the conditions likely to result in bushfires. </p><p>While the study points out that the trend is consistent with climate change, they are unable to separate climate change from other long-term weather variations without additional work.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418412013|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|1897cb729d04dbff437a9de6b9d563743a0f4b9a -->",

        "body":"<p>The NSW rural fire service has insisted there is no restriction on conducting fire hazard reduction burns after the mayor of Port Stephens claimed houses had been lost due to the supposed anti-burning stance of the \"fire service, the politicians and the greenies\".<br /> <br />Mayor Bruce MacKenzie said a bushfire in the NSW region, which firefighters think was started by sparking power lines, was exacerbated by residents' inability to safely burn materials that could fuel the flames.<br /> <br />\"I believe several houses have been lost, which is a disaster as far as I'm concerned,\" MacKenzie told ABC radio. \"The rural fire service, the politicians and the greenies have a lot to bloody answer for.\"</p><p>The fire tore through 50 hectares in the Port Stephens area on Sunday, resulting in six homes being lost. A separate fire nearby burned through 177 hectares.<br /> <br />A NSW rural fire service spokesman told Guardian Australia residents could carry out fire hazard reduction burns on their property as long as they had a certificate.<br /> <br />\"[MacKenzie] is out of the loop a bit. Hazard reductions in the area are far above the state average,\" he said. \"The fire service has done really good work out there and there is no impediment on them reducing risks on public land. The only impediment is the weather itself.\"<br /> <br />Jamie Kirkpatrick, a professor of geography and environmental studies at the University of Tasmania, who has studied the effectiveness of fire hazard reduction, said the tactic could work in certain circumstances.<br /> <br />\"Obviously it reduces fuel, which means there is a lesser chance of a dwelling burning down if there is a low amount of fuel around it,\" he told Guardian Australia.<br /> <br />\"But just burning bits of bush doesn't have any effect whatsoever. In severe conditions the fire will just leap over substantial obstacles in a single bound, like Superman. There are burning sparks that can fly 20km ahead of the main fire front.<br /> <br />\"Whenever we have a big fire people want to blame someone or something. After the bushfires in Victoria in 2009 people even blamed the trees and cut them down.\"</p><p>The then Fairfax columnist Miranda Devine said green activists should be <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/environment/green-ideas-must-take-blame-for-deaths-20090211-84mk.html\">'hanging from lamp-posts'</a> for allegedly prevening hazard reduction burns before the <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/innovation/blacksaturday/#/stories/mosaic\">2009 Victorian bushfires</a>, which killed 173 people. The <a href=\"http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/finaldocuments/summary/pf/vbrc_summary_pf.pdf\">Royal Commission</a> into the bushfires recommended the amount of prescribed burning to reduce fuel load should be increased.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419971269|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|1e80e8c2dbcd45bb89f3a475629706e05e108a79 -->",

        "body":"<p>An inquiry into the bushfires that ravaged much of eastern Tasmania in January has highlighted numerous failures in the emergency services&rsquo; handling of the blazes.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/divisions/osem/2013_tasmanian_bushfires_inquiry_report%20\">independent inquiry</a>, which was led by former South Australian police commissioner Mal Hyde, has made 103 recommendations on how to improve fire, police, traffic management and evacuation procedures.</p> <p>The report is critical of the fire service for failing to respond to computer simulations that indicated the town of Dunalley would be ravaged by fire. It also highlights confusion over the chain of command for the emergency, an inadequate strategy for road closures and the lack of any sort of plan for evacuations.</p> <p>The fires destroyed more than 400 properties, including nearly 200 homes, causing more than $100m in damage. No lives were lost, although more than 10,000 cattle died.</p> <p>According to the report, 3,000 firefighters fought 34 fires in catastrophic conditions on 4 January. It details how the fire storm jumped a canal to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family\">engulf Dunalley</a>, causing hundreds of people to evacuate and seek shelter.</p> <p>&ldquo;The fact that no person was killed should not simply be taken as an indication that the emergency management arrangements worked well,&rdquo; the report states. &ldquo;It is highly likely the preparedness of many people in the community and emergency warnings contributed to this outcome. In a number of respects the emergency management arrangements worked well. However, in a number of ways they did not.&rdquo;</p> <p>The report said there should be a state plan for relocating people during an emergency and said advice to flee at the last moment was contrary to standard firefighting practice, which recommends people leave their houses early, if at all.</p> <p>A more integrated approach between the various emergency response agencies, with a clear chain of command and responsibility, was needed ahead of future bushfire seasons, the report stated.</p> <p>It added that the sheer number of bushfire warnings in January &ndash; 179 in total &ndash; overwhelmed local media, making it difficult for people to become aware of fire threats.</p> <p>Lara Giddings, the Tasmanian premier, said the state government had accepted all the recommendations in principle and would be fast-tracking 31 of them. She told parliament it was &ldquo;critical we respond quickly now that weaknesses have been identified&rdquo;.</p> <p>Giddings said a new website called AlertTas would be created to provide information on fire threats. Tasmanian police will develop a plan on evacuations while computer modelling will be improved ahead of the 2014 bushfire season, she added.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419972316|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|85ebc37319b4415751cdb329253f2a45e09fbce9 -->",

        "body":"<p>Fire services have issued four emergency warnings in New South Wales as serious fires burn in Lithgow, Nowra, Heatherbrae in the Hunter and at Yanderra in the Southern Highlands.</p> <p>A fourth bushfire emergency has been declared for a grass fire in South Nowra in the Shoalhaven. A previous emergency warning for Mount Victoria has been revised to a &ldquo;watch and act&rdquo; advisory.</p> <p>Not far from Mount Victoria, an <a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21488&amp;CAT_ID=684\">out of control fire near Lithgow</a> in the Blue Mountains has been burning since Wednesday.</p> <p>The Lithgow fire is threatening homes and residents have been urged to seek shelter as conditions are &ldquo;deteriorating&rdquo; according to the rural fire service (RFS). Hot and gusty winds are worsening conditions and residents have been warned to watch out for flying embers and advised to put out spot fires on their properties.</p> <p>Roads, highways and at least one school have been closed.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21494&amp;CAT_ID=684\">fire near Heatherbrae</a> in the Hunter region has breached containment lines, fuelled by wind gusts of up to 70-80km/h. Thick smoke is visible from Newcastle CBD and the city&rsquo;s airport has been closed.</p> <p>The hot, dry and windy weather is expected to continue for another five or six hours at least, RFS spokesman Joel Kursawe told ABCNews.</p> <p>The RFS advises residents near the Heatherbrae fire to evacuate now if they are planning to leave or are not prepared, but only if the way is clear. The same advice has been issued to residents of Yanderra in the Southern Highlands where a fire is burning near the village, and neighbouring Balmoral. Yanderra residents have been sent an emergency telephone message.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21493&amp;CAT_ID=684\">watch and act advisory</a> has also been issued over a fire east of Singleton, also in the Hunter region.</p> <p>Near Wiseman&rsquo;s Ferry in the Hawkesbury region, more than 30 firefighters and two aircraft are <a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21474&amp;CAT_ID=684\">battling a fire</a> which has only been partially contained.</p> <p>The bureau of meteorology (BOM) <a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/warnings/severe.shtml\">earlier issued severe wind and weather warnings</a> for the Hunter, Sydney, Illawarra, Central Tablelands, Southern Tablelands, ACT and Snowy Mountains regions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420209285|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|f4ed0ca9add278e2410e77f34078a7317d571214 -->",

Hot and gusty winds are worsening conditions and residents have been warned to take care of flying embers and advised to put out spot fires on their properties.</p> <p>Roads, highways and at least one school have been closed.</p> <p><strong>A <a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21494&amp;CAT_ID=684\">fire near Heatherbrae</a></strong> in the Hunter region has breached containment lines, fueled by gusts of up to 7-80kmh. Thick smoke is visible from Newcastle CBD and the city’s airport has been closed.</p> <p>The hot dry and windy weather is expected to continue for another five or six hours at least, rural fire service (RFS) spokesman Joel Kursawe told ABC News.</p> <p>The RFS advises residents near the Heatherbrae fire to evacuate now if they are planning to leave or are not prepared, but only if the way is clear.</p> <p>The same advice has been issued to residents of <strong>Yanderra in the Southern Highlands</strong> where a fire is burning near the village and neighbouring Balmoral. Yanderra residents have been sent an emergency telephone message.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21493&amp;CAT_ID=684\">watch and act advisory</a> has also been issued over <strong>a fire east of Singleton</strong>, also in the Hunter region.</p> <p><strong>Near Wiseman’s Ferry in the Hawkesbury region</strong>, more than 30 firefighters and two aircraft are <a href=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_more_info.cfm?CON_ID=21474&amp;CAT_ID=684\">battling a fire</a> which has only been partially contained.</p> <p>The bureau of meteorology (BOM) <a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/warnings/severe.shtml\">earlier issued severe wind and weather warnings</a> for the Hunter, Sydney, Illawarra, Central Tablelands, Southern Tablelands, ACT and Snowy Mountains regions.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420208459|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|e9fd3d3ddedef3cc07ab4cc8609d6a40d9468a24 -->",
