Humans have identified somewhere in the region of 1.2m to 1.3m. So we probably know less than one fifth of the planet's life.&nbsp;</p> <p>But nature's diversity is matched only by the number of ways to name it. This enquiry has opened an&nbsp;epistemological can of (unidentified) worms. We cannot know how many species we live with until we have solid definitions and systems for identifying them. But nature's complexity confounds our sterling efforts to put it into neat boxes.</p> <p>Estimations are fraught with assumption and generalisation, which makes it difficult to imagine we will ever come close to certainty.&nbsp;But the exercise is far from quixotic. The search for new species leads to the discovery of new medicines and other useful chemicals. It can further our knowledge and efficiency in agriculture and aquaculture.&nbsp;Maybe most importantly, the closer we get to measuring global biodiversity, the better we can understand our impact on it.</p> <p>Possibly 90% of the species on the planet live on without our knowledge of them. Many of these species are intimately related to us. They&nbsp;fertilise&nbsp;the soil of our backyard, or oxygenate the air we breathe and bury the carbon we create. But we will never know anything about them.</p> <p>I'm grateful for the fantastic contributions and good discussion today.

This is evidently a matter of deep conjecture. He says DNA evidence had uncovered a raft of new species and had also made many disappear - the processes known in the taxonomy world as lumping and splitting.</p> <p>Lumping is when some species that were thought to be different, or were described by different scientists at different times, are found to be genetically the same. Splitting is the reverse.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;Both of those things can happen and they do happen as techniques improve and knowledge improves particularly through the use of DNA techniques,&quot; says Roy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sina Adl from the&nbsp;University of Saskatchewan was one of the authors of the 2011 <a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127#pbio-1001127-g002\">Mora et al. paper</a>, which estimated 8.7 million species inhabit the planet. He wrote to me this evening.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our paper “how many species are there?” we showed a new way of estimating the number of species. What our approach indicated was that for many groups of organisms, we seem to have found most of them, although not by any means all of them. For example, even if there are families to discover, or under-described families or genera of organisms among the Plants and Animals, most are now known. What most people forget is that most of the eukaryotic diversity is microscopic, and in the Protists. It is clear that we do not have enough information at this time to estimate how many species of protist there are, as only a fraction are described. Therefore the estimate in the manuscript is a gross under-estimate. As for bacteria, the eukaryotic “species” concepts do not seem to work well, and it is harder to come up with something to count.</p> </blockquote> <p>Geoff Boxshall is a Researcher at the <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/\">National History Museum</a>. He says the study of marine biodiversity often gets swept away by our fascination with our terrestrial habitat. While the biodiversity of the ocean at a species level is lower than on land - the ocean covers 70% of the planet but only seems to account for around a quarter of the species - on the the upper taxonomical levels the ocean contains many more phyla that survive on land. So on this measure of diversity, the ocean leads.</p> <p>Boxshall says we need to understand how many species there are in order to protect them.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;In order to live sustainably on the planet, which we are not managing to do very well, we are going to have to be able to model how biodiversity is generated, how biodiversity is maintained and how biodiversity is lost.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>He says having rigorous science is vital to convincing policy makers to take action - much like with climate change.</p> <p>He agrees that the numbers found by Mora et al. are fairly consistent with current scientific thinking.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;Over the past couple of decades we've had wildly varying estimates, 30 million, 100 million. But I think there is a consensus now that the number is between five and ten million globally.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Although he says studies of parasites have showed that it might be necessary to rethink these numbers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;There's a rough estimate for every multi-celled animal species in the ocean, there's at least one species of parasite that is specialised upon that host. So if you are thinking about the diversity of parasites, it might actually be necessary to double the diversity estimates.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>He says terrestrial parasite studies have shown their abundance could be the same on land.</p> <p>As to where we might discover new species, Boxshall says it will be mostly in places we haven't looked. The major factors in this are either difficulty of access, or a low level of past exploration. He says a museum colleague found 300 new species in shallow water off Kuwait - simply because the area was histoprically poorly studied.</p> <p>Joe Walston, executive director at the <a href=\"http://www.wcs.org/\">Wildlife Conservation Society</a> Asia program tells me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The problem with identifying species numbers is less a question of the ration of discovered:undiscovered and more to do with how we (a) define ‘species' and (b) how we define ‘discovered'. On the first issue, 50 years ago physical taxonomy and/or the ability to produce fertile offspring was pretty much it.&nbsp;Now we have a whole range of new criteria, not all of which are consistent. For example, there is much debate and literature out there on the various merits of the biological species concept (reproductive isolation) vs. the phylogenetic species concept (monophyly: populations share common ancestor) vs. morphospecies concept (morphological distinctiveness). To grossly simplify, until you classify your set I can’t tell you how many representatives there are in your set.</p> <p>As Darwin said:&nbsp;&quot;I was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties”. Currently, there’s a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534706001649\">lot of literature</a> on the failure of modern species concepts.</p> <p>The second problem is ‘discover’. Taxonomists, conservation NGOs and people like me are often a little weak in distinguishing between a true discovery of something that had not been seen and recorded by science before (e.g. the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saola\">Saola</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Coelacanth) and something that had been often seen, recorded and even studied but new approaches to systematics or further investigations shows that the species is actually more than one species (or vice versa). Two examples are:</p> <p>1) Song/calls. The physically similar&nbsp;common and soprano pipistrelle were only ‘identified’ as separate species in the 1990’s after echolocation technology found their calls to be at different frequencies.&nbsp;Western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta)&nbsp;and Eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) look the same but also have different calls.</p> <p>2) DNA. A common species of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bryanlstuart.com/site/Publications_files/Inger%20et%20al.%202009.pdf\">frog</a>&nbsp;found to be at least seven species due to molecular analysis.&nbsp;</p> <p>This group are technically ‘new species’ but the rate of discovery is often defined by the improving technologies rather than overturning new stones. This doesn’t relegate the importance of these discoveries but it does make answering your question much more difficult.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T19:19:15.646Z\">at 7.19pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52711cc5e4b0ffc73763b6ea\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T16:29:36.413Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">What is a species?</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A number of commenters have pointed out a key element to this debate.

In many organisms, the way to pinpoint a species is to apply the biological species concept. According to this definition, a species is made up of all the organisms that are able to mate with each other and produce fertile offspring. For example, lions produce offspring with other lions, and tigers with other tigers; if lions and tigers are brought together in captivity they can occasionally produce a hybrid called a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/10506464/overview\">liger or tigon</a>, but these hybrids are not themselves able to reproduce. It then follows that lions and tigers are separate species. (Another term used for the inability to interbreed is reproductive isolation.)</p> <p>Morphological species concept</p> <p>Another way that organisms can be classified is on the basis of morphology, or physical features. This definition is also often useful: sometimes it is not possible to observe whether two organisms interbreed (e.g., different types of whales in the wild) but examining their physical features can help determine how closely they’re related. In general, if carefully chosen, morphological features can indeed be an indicator of organisms having the same common ancestor.</p> <p>There are many problems with this approach: <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1228387/overview\">domestic dogs</a>, for example, can look very different but are actually all one species capable of interbreeding, whereas&nbsp;<a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/39321/overview\">mouse lemurs</a>&nbsp;look very similar to each other but are actually at least 18 distinct species.</p> <p>Genetic species concept</p> <p>For organisms that have neither sexual reproduction nor many distinctive morphological features in common—for example, bacteria—species are often defined as clusters of genetically similar organisms (with “similar” somewhat arbitrarily defined). Using genetic markers as traits defining species is also the principle behind DNA barcoding.</p> </blockquote> <p>For a more detailed look at how species can be defined Judith Winston's <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fxa.yimg.com%2Fkq%2Fgroups%2F19746901%2F1099617650%2Fname%2FD%2Be%2Bs%2Bc%2Br%2Bi%2Bb%2Bi%2Bn%2Bg%2BS%2Bp%2Be%2Bc%2Bi%2Be%2Bs.pdf&amp;ei=Hi9xUqL9FeqM7Qbsj4HIBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEossyh4CVHB9sdh_g4toIz8AuoIA&amp;sig2=00clLDIJaSmlb-dWC1FuNw&amp;bvm=bv.55617003,d.ZGU\">Describing Species</a> is very helpful.</p> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28436507\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4311896\" title=\"View SteB1’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/10/04/SteB1/2ef11f83-d0ee-4f51-bef7-9080ce072940/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for SteB1\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4311896\" title=\"View SteB1’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">SteB1</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28436507\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">30 October 2013 6:46pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I think one thing we need to bear in mind is that our grasp of what species occur on even well studied sites is tenuous.

What is more the unrecorded species can be quite numerous.</p> <p>There has been some discussion about what constitutes a species, and is accurately pointed out there is not satisfactory definition for a species. Within many species groups is much variation. General descriptions of species, their physical characteristics, behavioural traits and life-cycles are often very sketchy with a great deal being unknown.</p> <p>The actual number of species is an interesting academic question. However, the elelphant in the room being missed is the evidence that we haven't got a very good handle on the distribution and presence of many species we know about. The reason is because it's a Cinderella subject and very few resources are directed to mapping out our biodiversity. We are living in the dark, ignorance about our biodiversity is profound.

How many more species there are left to discover is a question that has hovered like a cloud over the heads of taxonomists for two centuries.</p> <p>“It’s astounding that we don’t know the most basic thing about life,” said Boris Worm, a marine biologist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia.</p> </blockquote> <p>He described the method Mora et al. used more eloquently and in more depth than I managed in my earlier post.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They charted the discovery of new classes of animals since 1750. The total number climbed steeply for the first 150 years and then began to crest — a sign that we’re getting close to finding all the classes of animal. They found that the discovery rate of other high-level groups has also been slowing down. The scientists built a taxonomic pyramid to estimate the total number of species in well-studied groups, like mammals and birds. They consistently made good predictions.</p> </blockquote> <p>However he noted that the number, like the many that had come before it, was the subject of conjecture.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Institution, thinks there’s a big flaw in the study. There’s no reason to assume that the diversity in little-studied groups will follow the rules of well-studied ones. “They’re measuring human activity, not biodiversity,” he said.</p> <p>David Pollock, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Colorado who studies fungi — a particularly understudied group — agrees. “This appears to be an incredibly ill-founded approach,” he said.

For example slugs you can find sites talking about how there are 25 species but only descriptions or pictures of 14.</p> <p>Bumblebees, there are a couple of reasonable websites but then you get the &quot;colouration can differ dramatically within the species&quot;. Anyone who is familiar with bees knows some of them are very similar looking to begin with. </p> <p>This makes it very easy for a species to hide amongst other species and there will be many small creatures in the UK unknown to science. </p> <p>The internet can start to make you think it is more likely that you were hallucinating than find a new species on occasion. Wikipedia often makes it seem more authoritative than it is on animals. I'm pretty sure the massive moth I saw in Syon Butterfly house was known to science for example but would be too big according to wikipedia.</p> <p>As my dreamscapes often include imaginary creatures it perhaps doesn't make me the most reliable witness but here is one that I struggle the most with.</p> <p>An insect about 3 inches in length with a very long thin tail looking a bit like a sting. I can't remember for sure the configuration of the wings but it had very clearly defined body sections and legs. Most distinctive was that it came in a bright orange and black version.</p> <p>I had a dragonfly / damsel fly sighting I won't go into again as it seems that it shouldn't exist.</p> <p>A spider I once saw that was the same colour as metallic blue flower pot that we had in the garden. Presumably it developed a method to eat some of the pot to develop its <br />colour. </p> <p>then you see hundreds of different colours in snails, etc... </p> <p>The real problem with insects is that you can see them locally in the hundreds but they can be very rare. When living in a flat next to a park used to get some very large green gnat type insects which are probably amongst the parks 100+ rare/scarce insects, you'd never guess when looking at them when you had a light on.</p> <p>Some species are very fleeting a puffball fungus just appeared almost out of the blue in my garden once. Nature is remarkable and some of it has remarkably long cycles.</p> <p>What I think we need is the naturalists equivalent to the Victoria County History.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/petewilton/statuses/395573337360842752\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen\">@KarlMathiesen</a> 'author inflation' could be warping our view of the race to describe Earth's species <a href=\"http://t.co/OhKHGUYGdJ\">http://t.co/OhKHGUYGdJ</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ecoaudit&amp;src=hash\">#ecoaudit</a></p>— Pete Wilton (@petewilton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/petewilton/statuses/395573337360842752\">October 30, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/irenecdejong/statuses/395566043533705216\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Hoeveel soorten kunnen we nog ontdekken? <a href=\"http://t.co/Y9YuCHqmku\">http://t.co/Y9YuCHqmku</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ecoaudit&amp;src=hash\">#ecoaudit</a></p>— Irene de Jong (@irenecdejong) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/irenecdejong/statuses/395566043533705216\">October 30, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bluestarfish/statuses/395564158369816576\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Oh!

These are the species we know about for sure.</p> <p>In 2011, PLOS Biology published a study <a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127\">&quot;How Many Species Are There on Earth and in the Ocean?&quot;</a>&nbsp;that estimated the total number of species on earth to be 8.7m. The Guardian's <strong>Damian Carrington&nbsp;</strong>called it a &quot;landmark moment&quot;:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/aug/23/species-earth-estimate-scientists\">number, say the scientists, is 8.7m</a>&nbsp;and I believe it too deserves iconic status. Why? We humans are evolutionary latecomers in the extreme, having stalked the planet for only the most recent fleeting moments of its 4bn-year history. The biosphere we have colonised so successfully was created by myriad interactions between creatures, rocks and weather.</p> </blockquote> <p>The study's abstract reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The diversity of life is one of the most striking aspects of our planet; hence knowing how many species inhabit Earth is among the most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts ~8.7 million (&plusmn;1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which ~2.2 million (&plusmn;0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was a statistical study, rather than observational science. The team discovered that as you go further down the taxonomic tree, from phylum to family to species, the variation increases in a predictable way. This enabled them to extrapolate how many species might occur. The results show that there could be something like 5.6m land&nbsp;species undiscovered and another 1.98 in the ocean.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen/statuses/395550112681693185\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>How do you estimate the number of species on Earth? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ecoaudit&amp;src=hash\">#ecoaudit</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PLOSBiology&amp;src=hash\">#PLOSBiology</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/KWLemR10Tm\">pic.twitter.com/KWLemR10Tm</a></p>— Karl Mathiesen (@KarlMathiesen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen/statuses/395550112681693185\">October 30, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T14:01:35.882Z\">at 2.01pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52710e3de4b0ded76c0a9177\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T13:50:47.864Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Have you found a new species in your backyard?</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>I've just recieved this email from Matt Sutton, who runs an <a href=\"http://wyndrushwild.co.uk/matt-sutton-ecology/\">ecological farm consultancy</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Karl,</p> <p>I started looking at fungi on my <a href=\"http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/index.cfm\">SSSI</a> in west Wales this year.

It lives on trees, using the round discs on its fingers and toes to climb.</p><p>Among the other new finds were a ruby-coloured lilliputian beetle (<em>Canthidium cf minimum</em>), named after its tiny dimensions that make it possibly the second smallest dung beetle known in south American.</p><p>The remote nature of the area saw the team travel first by plane, then helicopter and then by boat and on foot, with help from 30 men from indigenous communities. At one point \"relentless\" rain saw the team forced to move after their campsite was flooded.</p><p>In total, they found 1,378 different species, and <a href=\"http://www.conservation.org/Documents/RAP_Reports/RAP67_SE-Suriname_March-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">their report</a> concluded \"there are very few places left on Earth that are as pristine and untouched as this region.\"</p><p>But despite the relatively pristine environment, it was not entirely free of human fingerprints – water samples showed mercury above levels safe for human consumption even though there is no upstream mining. The scientists concluded that the mercury was blown in on the wind.</p><p>\"This demonstrates that even the most isolated and pristine parts of the world are not entirely sheltered from human impacts — all systems are interconnected,\" said Larsen.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419099901'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380902511619/Surinam_map_041013.png' alt='Suriname map ' width='460' height='285' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Suriname map </figcaption></figure><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418942217|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|7b1f835af7a051b8f47354fc142e5167a0cf3133 -->",

        "body":"<p>A purring monkey, a vegetarian piranha and a flame-patterned lizard are among more than 400 new species of animals and plants that have been discovered in the past four years in the Amazon rainforest, conservationists say.</p><p>Discovered through hundreds of scientific expeditions between 2010 to 2013, the total of 441 new species – all new to science – includes 258 plants, 84 fish, 58 amphibians, 22 reptiles, 18 birds and one mammal. This tally does not include discoveries of insects and other invertebrates.</p><p>\"The more scientists look, the more they find,\" said Damian Fleming, head of programmes for Brazil and the Amazon at WWF-UK, which compiled the list. \"With an average of two new species identified every week for the past four years, it's clear that the extraordinary Amazon remains one of the most important centres of global biodiversity.\"</p><p>Among the new species discovered is a \"purring\" Caqueta titi monkey (<em>Callicebus caquetensis</em>)  of the Colombian Amazon, whose babies have an endearing trait: \"All of the babies purr like cats,\" said scientist Thomas Defler, who helped discover the species. \"When they feel very content they purr towards each other, and the ones we raised would purr to us.\"</p><p>A \"warpainted lizard\" (<em>Gonatodes timidus</em>) was discovered in the part of the Amazon that extends into Guyana. Despite its extraordinary colouring, this lizard is very shy and has a tendency to avoid being seen by humans.</p><p>Some species may be lost just as they have been discovered, scientists warned. The thumbnail-sized \"thimble frog\" has been given a Latin name (<em>Allobates amissibilis</em>) meaning \"that may be lost\", because it thrives in an area of Guyana that could soon be opened up to tourism.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420715669'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/10/22/1382439732199/Amazon-species-The-strict-008.jpg' alt='Amazon species: The strictly herbivorous 'vegetarian piranha' (<em>Tometes camunani</em>)' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The strictly herbivorous 'vegetarian piranha' (<em>Tometes camunani</em>). Photograph: Tommaso Giarrizzo</figcaption></figure><p>Other species are under threat from development. The strictly herbivorous \"vegetarian piranha\" (<em>Tometes camunani</em>)<em>,</em> inhabits rocky rapids in the Brazilian Amason where its main source of food, Podostemaceae aquatic herbs, is found. However, dam projects and mining activity in Pará state are threatening the health and flow of its river habitat.</p><p>Many of the recently discovered plants and animals have very restricted ranges and are thought to be endemic to small parts of the Amazon. For example, a new fish species (<em>Apistogramma cinilabra</em>) that has adapted to low-oxygen water is unique to one small lake in the Loreto region of Peru and found nowhere else in the world – making it and other species even more vulnerable.</p><p>\"The richness of the Amazon's forests and freshwater habitats continues to amaze the world,\" added Fleming. \"But these same habitats are also under growing threat. The discovery of these new species reaffirms the importance of stepping-up commitments to conserve and sustainably manage the unique biodiversity and also the goods and services provided by the rainforests to the people and businesses of the region.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420715670'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/10/22/1382439402328/The-thumbnail-sized-thimb-008.jpg' alt='Amazon species: The thumbnail-sized 'thimble frog' (<em>Allobates amissibilis</em>)' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The thumbnail-sized 'thimble frog' has been given a Latin name (<em>Allobates amissibilis</em>) meaning 'that may be lost', because it thrives in an area that could soon be opened up to tourism.

        "body":"<p>A leaf-tail gecko, a golden-coloured skink and a boulder-dwelling frog are three new species discovered in a \"lost world\" in northern Queensland, Australia.</p><p><a href=\"http://www-public.jcu.edu.au/news/JCU_130192\" title=\"\">Scientists from James Cook University</a> and National Geographic were dropped by helicopter in March this year into a remote mountain range on Cape Melville, to explore a pristine rainforest strewn with huge black granite boulders.</p><p>Within days the team had discovered three highly distinct new vertebrate species – believed to have been isolated for millions of years – as well as a host of other species that may also be new to science.</p><p>\"Finding three new, obviously distinct vertebrates would be surprising enough in somewhere poorly explored like New Guinea, let alone in Australia, a country we think we've explored pretty well,\" said Dr Conrad Hoskin of James Cook University, who led the expedition together with Dr Tim Laman from Harvard University. \"The top of Cape Melville is a lost world. Finding these new species up there is the discovery of a lifetime – I'm still amazed and buzzing from it.\"</p><p>Surveys had previously been conducted in the boulder fields around the base of Cape Melville, among \"millions of giant, piled up boulders the size of houses and cars\" but the plateau had remained largely unexplored, fortressed by a \"monstrous wall\" of boulders accessible only by helicopter.</p><p>The \"primitive-looking\" Cape Melville leaf-tailed gecko (<em>Saltuarius eximius</em>) measures 20cm and is believed to be a relic from a time when rainforest was more widespread in Australia. The species name translates as \"exceptional\", \"extraordinary\" or \"exquisite\", in reference to its unusual form and distinctiveness.</p><p>\"The second I saw the gecko I knew it was a new species. Everything about it was obviously distinct,\" said Hoskin.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421132268'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/28/1382964191911/Leaf-tailed-gecko-008.jpg' alt='Leaf-tailed gecko' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Herpetologist Dr Conrad Hoskin holds the Cape Melville leaf-tailed gecko, (<i>Saltuarius eximius</i>.) Photograph: Tim Laman </figcaption></figure><p>This gecko hides in the boulders in the day and emerges at night to hunt on rocks and trees. Highly camouflaged, its huge eyes and incredibly long and slender body and limbs are thought to be adaptations to life in the dimly lit boulder fields.</p><p>Patrick Couper, curator of reptiles and frogs at the Queensland Museum, and collaborator on the gecko's description, said: \"The Cape Melville leaf-tailed gecko is the strangest new species to come across my desk in 26 years working as a professional herpetologist. I doubt that another new reptile of this size and distinctiveness will be found in a hurry, if ever again, in Australia.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421132270'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/28/1382964478948/New-shade-skink-008.jpg' alt='New shade skink' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The beautiful golden-coloured Cape Melville shade skink (<em>Saproscincus saltus</em>). Photograph: Conrad Hoskin</figcaption></figure><p>The beautiful golden-coloured Cape Melville shade skink (<em>Saproscincus saltus</em>) is also restricted to moist rocky rainforest on the plateau. It is also long-limbed, but unlike the gecko is active by day, running and jumping across the mossy boulders – the species name \"saltus\" means \"leaping\". This species is highly distinct from its relatives found in rainforests to the south.</p><p>Also discovered was the \"fascinating\" blotched boulder-frog (<em>Cophixalus petrophilus</em>). Its species name means \"rock-loving\" as it lives deep in the labyrinth of the boulder field where conditions are dark, cool and moist during the dry season. In the summer wet season, the frog emerges on the surface rocks to feed and breed in the rain.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421132271'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/28/1382964361216/Boulder-frog-001.jpg' alt='Boulder frog' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The blotched boulder-frog (<i>Cophixalus petrophilus</i>) was among the three new vertebrate species discovered in Cape Melville, Australia. Photograph: Tim Laman</figcaption></figure><p>The frog has adapted to living in a boulder field with no water by laying eggs in moist rock cracks. \"The tadpoles develop within the eggs, guarded by the male, until fully formed froglets hatch out,\" explained Hoskin.</p><p>The three new species have been named by Hoskin and described in the journal <a href=\"http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/\" title=\"\">Zootaxa</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421124100|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|2a74fc10b89fb2e26f4918d31e5f1214f6a13f38 -->",

Humans have identified somewhere in the region of 1.2m to 1.3m. So we probably know less than one fifth of the planet's life.&nbsp;</p> <p>But nature's diversity is matched only by the number of ways to name it. This enquiry has opened an&nbsp;epistemological can of (unidentified) worms. We cannot know how many species we live with until we have solid definitions and systems for identifying them. But nature's complexity confounds our sterling efforts to put it into neat boxes.</p> <p>Estimations are fraught with assumption and generalisation, which makes it difficult to imagine we will ever come close to certainty.&nbsp;But the exercise is far from quixotic. The search for new species leads to the discovery of new medicines and other useful chemicals. It can further our knowledge and efficiency in agriculture and aquaculture.&nbsp;Maybe most importantly, the closer we get to measuring global biodiversity, the better we can understand our impact on it.</p> <p>Possibly 90% of the species on the planet live on without our knowledge of them. Many of these species are intimately related to us. They&nbsp;fertilise&nbsp;the soil of our backyard, or oxygenate the air we breathe and bury the carbon we create. But we will never know anything about them.</p> <p>I'm grateful for the fantastic contributions and good discussion today. I'll be back with another eco audit next week.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T19:12:52.313Z\">at 7.12pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-527140a8e4b0cdcad3c03f9f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T17:23:55.195Z\">5.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen/statuses/395601795302424576\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Don't forget the plants.

This is evidently a matter of deep conjecture. He says DNA evidence had uncovered a raft of new species and had also made many disappear - the processes known in the taxonomy world as lumping and splitting.</p> <p>Lumping is when some species that were thought to be different, or were described by different scientists at different times, are found to be genetically the same. Splitting is the reverse.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;Both of those things can happen and they do happen as techniques improve and knowledge improves particularly through the use of DNA techniques,&quot; says Roy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sina Adl from the&nbsp;University of Saskatchewan was one of the authors of the 2011 <a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127#pbio-1001127-g002\">Mora et al. paper</a>, which estimated 8.7 million species inhabit the planet. He wrote to me this evening.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our paper “how many species are there?” we showed a new way of estimating the number of species. What our approach indicated was that for many groups of organisms, we seem to have found most of them, although not by any means all of them. For example, even if there are families to discover, or under-described families or genera of organisms among the Plants and Animals, most are now known. What most people forget is that most of the eukaryotic diversity is microscopic, and in the Protists. It is clear that we do not have enough information at this time to estimate how many species of protist there are, as only a fraction are described. Therefore the estimate in the manuscript is a gross under-estimate. As for bacteria, the eukaryotic “species” concepts do not seem to work well, and it is harder to come up with something to count.</p> </blockquote> <p>Geoff Boxshall is a Researcher at the <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/\">National History Museum</a>. He says the study of marine biodiversity often gets swept away by our fascination with our terrestrial habitat. While the biodiversity of the ocean at a species level is lower than on land - the ocean covers 70% of the planet but only seems to account for around a quarter of the species - on the the upper taxonomical levels the ocean contains many more phyla that survive on land. So on this measure of diversity, the ocean leads.</p> <p>Boxshall says we need to understand how many species there are in order to protect them.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;In order to live sustainably on the planet, which we are not managing to do very well, we are going to have to be able to model how biodiversity is generated, how biodiversity is maintained and how biodiversity is lost.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>He says having rigorous science is vital to convincing policy makers to take action - much like with climate change.</p> <p>He agrees that the numbers found by Mora et al. are fairly consistent with current scientific thinking.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;Over the past couple of decades we've had wildly varying estimates, 30 million, 100 million. But I think there is a consensus now that the number is between five and ten million globally.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Although he says studies of parasites have showed that it might be necessary to rethink these numbers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;There's a rough estimate for every multi-celled animal species in the ocean, there's at least one species of parasite that is specialised upon that host. So if you are thinking about the diversity of parasites, it might actually be necessary to double the diversity estimates.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>He says terrestrial parasite studies have shown their abundance could be the same on land.</p> <p>As to where we might discover new species, Boxshall says it will be mostly in places we haven't looked. The major factors in this are either difficulty of access, or a low level of past exploration. He says a museum colleague found 300 new species in shallow water off Kuwait - simply because the area was histoprically poorly studied.</p> <p>Joe Walston, executive director at the <a href=\"http://www.wcs.org/\">Wildlife Conservation Society</a> Asia program tells me:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The problem with identifying species numbers is less a question of the ration of discovered:undiscovered and more to do with how we (a) define ‘species' and (b) how we define ‘discovered'. On the first issue, 50 years ago physical taxonomy and/or the ability to produce fertile offspring was pretty much it.&nbsp;Now we have a whole range of new criteria, not all of which are consistent. For example, there is much debate and literature out there on the various merits of the biological species concept (reproductive isolation) vs. the phylogenetic species concept (monophyly: populations share common ancestor) vs. morphospecies concept (morphological distinctiveness). To grossly simplify, until you classify your set I can’t tell you how many representatives there are in your set.</p> <p>As Darwin said:&nbsp;&quot;I was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties”. Currently, there’s a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534706001649\">lot of literature</a> on the failure of modern species concepts.</p> <p>The second problem is ‘discover’. Taxonomists, conservation NGOs and people like me are often a little weak in distinguishing between a true discovery of something that had not been seen and recorded by science before (e.g. the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saola\">Saola</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Coelacanth) and something that had been often seen, recorded and even studied but new approaches to systematics or further investigations shows that the species is actually more than one species (or vice versa). Two examples are:</p> <p>1) Song/calls. The physically similar&nbsp;common and soprano pipistrelle were only ‘identified’ as separate species in the 1990’s after echolocation technology found their calls to be at different frequencies.&nbsp;Western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta)&nbsp;and Eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) look the same but also have different calls.</p> <p>2) DNA. A common species of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bryanlstuart.com/site/Publications_files/Inger%20et%20al.%202009.pdf\">frog</a>&nbsp;found to be at least seven species due to molecular analysis.&nbsp;</p> <p>This group are technically ‘new species’ but the rate of discovery is often defined by the improving technologies rather than overturning new stones. This doesn’t relegate the importance of these discoveries but it does make answering your question much more difficult.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T19:19:15.646Z\">at 7.19pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52711cc5e4b0ffc73763b6ea\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T16:29:36.413Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">What is a species?</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A number of commenters have pointed out a key element to this debate.

In many organisms, the way to pinpoint a species is to apply the biological species concept. According to this definition, a species is made up of all the organisms that are able to mate with each other and produce fertile offspring. For example, lions produce offspring with other lions, and tigers with other tigers; if lions and tigers are brought together in captivity they can occasionally produce a hybrid called a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/10506464/overview\">liger or tigon</a>, but these hybrids are not themselves able to reproduce. It then follows that lions and tigers are separate species. (Another term used for the inability to interbreed is reproductive isolation.)</p> <p>Morphological species concept</p> <p>Another way that organisms can be classified is on the basis of morphology, or physical features. This definition is also often useful: sometimes it is not possible to observe whether two organisms interbreed (e.g., different types of whales in the wild) but examining their physical features can help determine how closely they’re related. In general, if carefully chosen, morphological features can indeed be an indicator of organisms having the same common ancestor.</p> <p>There are many problems with this approach: <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/1228387/overview\">domestic dogs</a>, for example, can look very different but are actually all one species capable of interbreeding, whereas&nbsp;<a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/39321/overview\">mouse lemurs</a>&nbsp;look very similar to each other but are actually at least 18 distinct species.</p> <p>Genetic species concept</p> <p>For organisms that have neither sexual reproduction nor many distinctive morphological features in common—for example, bacteria—species are often defined as clusters of genetically similar organisms (with “similar” somewhat arbitrarily defined). Using genetic markers as traits defining species is also the principle behind DNA barcoding.</p> </blockquote> <p>For a more detailed look at how species can be defined Judith Winston's <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fxa.yimg.com%2Fkq%2Fgroups%2F19746901%2F1099617650%2Fname%2FD%2Be%2Bs%2Bc%2Br%2Bi%2Bb%2Bi%2Bn%2Bg%2BS%2Bp%2Be%2Bc%2Bi%2Be%2Bs.pdf&amp;ei=Hi9xUqL9FeqM7Qbsj4HIBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEossyh4CVHB9sdh_g4toIz8AuoIA&amp;sig2=00clLDIJaSmlb-dWC1FuNw&amp;bvm=bv.55617003,d.ZGU\">Describing Species</a> is very helpful.</p> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28436507\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4311896\" title=\"View SteB1’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/10/04/SteB1/2ef11f83-d0ee-4f51-bef7-9080ce072940/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for SteB1\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4311896\" title=\"View SteB1’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">SteB1</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28436507\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">30 October 2013 6:46pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I think one thing we need to bear in mind is that our grasp of what species occur on even well studied sites is tenuous. I used to say I could visit any well studied site in the UK and without too much difficulty find species which had never been recorded there before. In fact I've done it on many occassions. What is more the unrecorded species can be quite numerous.</p> <p>There has been some discussion about what constitutes a species, and is accurately pointed out there is not satisfactory definition for a species. Within many species groups is much variation. General descriptions of species, their physical characteristics, behavioural traits and life-cycles are often very sketchy with a great deal being unknown.</p> <p>The actual number of species is an interesting academic question. However, the elelphant in the room being missed is the evidence that we haven't got a very good handle on the distribution and presence of many species we know about. The reason is because it's a Cinderella subject and very few resources are directed to mapping out our biodiversity. We are living in the dark, ignorance about our biodiversity is profound.

For example slugs you can find sites talking about how there are 25 species but only descriptions or pictures of 14.</p> <p>Bumblebees, there are a couple of reasonable websites but then you get the &quot;colouration can differ dramatically within the species&quot;. Anyone who is familiar with bees knows some of them are very similar looking to begin with. </p> <p>This makes it very easy for a species to hide amongst other species and there will be many small creatures in the UK unknown to science. </p> <p>The internet can start to make you think it is more likely that you were hallucinating than find a new species on occasion. Wikipedia often makes it seem more authoritative than it is on animals. I'm pretty sure the massive moth I saw in Syon Butterfly house was known to science for example but would be too big according to wikipedia.</p> <p>As my dreamscapes often include imaginary creatures it perhaps doesn't make me the most reliable witness but here is one that I struggle the most with.</p> <p>An insect about 3 inches in length with a very long thin tail looking a bit like a sting. I can't remember for sure the configuration of the wings but it had very clearly defined body sections and legs. Most distinctive was that it came in a bright orange and black version.</p> <p>I had a dragonfly / damsel fly sighting I won't go into again as it seems that it shouldn't exist.</p> <p>A spider I once saw that was the same colour as metallic blue flower pot that we had in the garden. Presumably it developed a method to eat some of the pot to develop its <br />colour. </p> <p>then you see hundreds of different colours in snails, etc... </p> <p>The real problem with insects is that you can see them locally in the hundreds but they can be very rare. When living in a flat next to a park used to get some very large green gnat type insects which are probably amongst the parks 100+ rare/scarce insects, you'd never guess when looking at them when you had a light on.</p> <p>Some species are very fleeting a puffball fungus just appeared almost out of the blue in my garden once. Nature is remarkable and some of it has remarkably long cycles.</p> <p>What I think we need is the naturalists equivalent to the Victoria County History.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/petewilton/statuses/395573337360842752\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen\">@KarlMathiesen</a> 'author inflation' could be warping our view of the race to describe Earth's species <a href=\"http://t.co/OhKHGUYGdJ\">http://t.co/OhKHGUYGdJ</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ecoaudit&amp;src=hash\">#ecoaudit</a></p>— Pete Wilton (@petewilton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/petewilton/statuses/395573337360842752\">October 30, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/irenecdejong/statuses/395566043533705216\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Hoeveel soorten kunnen we nog ontdekken? <a href=\"http://t.co/Y9YuCHqmku\">http://t.co/Y9YuCHqmku</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ecoaudit&amp;src=hash\">#ecoaudit</a></p>— Irene de Jong (@irenecdejong) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/irenecdejong/statuses/395566043533705216\">October 30, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bluestarfish/statuses/395564158369816576\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Oh!

It was striking to me that we could know so little about such close relatives of wildly important economic species.</p> <p>I have recently begun work on another group of potato relatives and it is looking like there will be three or more new species in this group as well, including the one described <a href=\"http://homepages.uc.edu/~tepeej/EricTepe/Publications_files/Tepe%20et%20al%202012.pdf\">here</a>.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T21:53:22.118Z\">at 9.53pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-527102bae4b0ffc73763b6d3\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T14:00:30.275Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Estimates of species diversity</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.gbif.org/\">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a> is a wonderful collation of life from across the globe. It is open source, free to all and brings together four million records. It stores the occurrences of <a href=\"http://www.gbif.org/species\">1,426,888 species</a> with another 1,070,226 awaiting confirmation. These are the species we know about for sure.</p> <p>In 2011, PLOS Biology published a study <a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127\">&quot;How Many Species Are There on Earth and in the Ocean?&quot;</a>&nbsp;that estimated the total number of species on earth to be 8.7m. The Guardian's <strong>Damian Carrington&nbsp;</strong>called it a &quot;landmark moment&quot;:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/aug/23/species-earth-estimate-scientists\">number, say the scientists, is 8.7m</a>&nbsp;and I believe it too deserves iconic status. Why? We humans are evolutionary latecomers in the extreme, having stalked the planet for only the most recent fleeting moments of its 4bn-year history. The biosphere we have colonised so successfully was created by myriad interactions between creatures, rocks and weather.</p> </blockquote> <p>The study's abstract reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The diversity of life is one of the most striking aspects of our planet; hence knowing how many species inhabit Earth is among the most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts ~8.7 million (&plusmn;1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which ~2.2 million (&plusmn;0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86% of existing species on Earth and 91% of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was a statistical study, rather than observational science. The team discovered that as you go further down the taxonomic tree, from phylum to family to species, the variation increases in a predictable way. This enabled them to extrapolate how many species might occur. The results show that there could be something like 5.6m land&nbsp;species undiscovered and another 1.98 in the ocean.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen/statuses/395550112681693185\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>How do you estimate the number of species on Earth? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ecoaudit&amp;src=hash\">#ecoaudit</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PLOSBiology&amp;src=hash\">#PLOSBiology</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/KWLemR10Tm\">pic.twitter.com/KWLemR10Tm</a></p>— Karl Mathiesen (@KarlMathiesen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen/statuses/395550112681693185\">October 30, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T14:01:35.882Z\">at 2.01pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52710e3de4b0ded76c0a9177\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T13:50:47.864Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Have you found a new species in your backyard?</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>I've just recieved this email from Matt Sutton, who runs an <a href=\"http://wyndrushwild.co.uk/matt-sutton-ecology/\">ecological farm consultancy</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Karl,</p> <p>I started looking at fungi on my <a href=\"http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/index.cfm\">SSSI</a> in west Wales this year.
