        "body":"<p>Parenting today, as we parents know, is one tough task. Our parents, like everyone's parents, had it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/17/nurseries-culture-mums-mothers-choices-failures\" title=\"\">laughably easy compared to what we have to cope with now</a>. The initial production process remains pretty similar, admittedly, but subsequent stages have radically diverged into far deeper and uncomfortable complexities.</p><p>Previously, pre-school was a matter of a couple of toys, the odd stick, a cardboard box and someone loosely related to share the burden. Now? Well, I don't have to tell you, and you wouldn't have the time between the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_method\" title=\"\">Suzuki lesson</a>, infant pilates, basic iPhone familiarisation and vetting upcoming arrangements for other permanent and passing forms of care.</p><p>And it just gets worse. Our parents were far more relaxed about schooling, because they understood this key but now disregarded educational truth: whatever choice you make, it will be the wrong one. And they had the equally unfashionable but consoling belief that hard times forge the aspirational, the self-sufficient, the highly motivated and the successful: what you might term <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnycash/aboynamedsue.html\" title=\"\">the Boy-Named-Sue approach</a>, after the robust choice of the caring if admittedly hands-off dad in the Johnny Cash song.</p><p>All right, hold your hands up if you like: but how many idyllic, sun-touched, darkness-immune childhoods feature in the lives of the great and the driven? But that is not the way today: we want it all for them, and us; and, driven on by equal measures of competitive love and guilt, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/15/amy-chua-tiger-mother-interview\" title=\"\">in our tigerish way</a> we provide all imaginable affordable extras.</p><p>I was going to say that nothing is left to chance. But chance is now contemplated, considered and factored. You might be aware of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24555555\" title=\"\">Peter Edwards of Denbighshire</a>, who proudly watched his grandson, Harry Wilson, come on to play for Wales against Belgium in the 87th minute on Tuesday night, thereby winning Edwards £125,000 on the £50 bet he placed when Harry was 18 months old. Finely romantic; old-fashioned, almost. But there are other, increasingly popular parental bets that are more calculating, principally betting on children to do well at A-levels or university.</p><p>Graham Sharpe, of William Hill, who paid out on Wilson, says it is now taking around a dozen or so bets like these every week. Ladbrokes says hundreds of parents have bet with it. Algorithms are involved. Odds, for example, on a student with three Bs at A-level getting a first in media studies at Leeds University are 5-1. Be warned, though: Sharpe will want to know some history, following the first bet he ever took, when the boy's headmaster rang up the next day and asked if could put a bet on, too.</p><p>Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools, has been quoted as describing such betting as \"a jolly piece of fun\", that is \"not likely to add to the moral decline of the nation\". Others are not so convinced, arguing that it places extra and unfair pressure on the wagered offspring. Those of the old school – and, my, what a hard place that was! – will recall the late Keith Miller, legendary Australian fast bowler and wartime fighter pilot, giving his view that pressure is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Miller\" title=\"\">Messerschmitt up your arse</a>.</p><p>And, besides, as we are all agreed that parenting is really tough, surely just a bit of alleviating fun and light relief should be allowed?</p><p>With this in mind, I have a few suggestions for some other bets on your children: date of first party without tears and displaced jelly. School report without note of quiet despair at exam prospects. Police report on disturbance at your house after Facebook party invitation goes viral. Date of child's first at-fault car accident in your car. Date of first time your child says to you, \"are you all right for money?\". Date of first time your child tells his or her child, \"because I say so\".</p><p>• The sub heading of this article was corrected at 10.40am on Friday 18 October. It said Harry Wilson was a rugby player, rather than a footballer.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420278058|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|98558e4b1783468d543fa6a779e1f88f25e19c76 -->",

        "headline":"If Britain's charities are gagged, who will stop this lobbying bill?",
        "body":"<p>Long ago charities were seduced by David Cameron's \"big society\", lending it their support, full of expectations. Asked to deliver better than the big state was doing, they trotted into the fox's lair, greeted in Downing Street to lend their good names to big society events. Then came deep national and local cuts to their funds. Many were \"bid candy\" for work programme and other contracts, but found more Big Serco than big society winners. These were disappointments, but in their innocence they never expected an onslaught on their character and reputation.</p><p>Charities are trusted beyond the wildest hopes of any political party, yet the coalition is charging at them full tilt. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shawcross\" title=\"\">William Shawcross</a>, appointed as a partisan chair of the Charity Commission, has accused them of aiding terrorism abroad, amid accusations of \"political\" campaigning at home. Oliver Letwin, speaking to the <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk\" title=\"\">National Council for Voluntary Organisations</a> (NCVO), complained that \"so much effort in some parts of the voluntary sector is devoted to campaigning\". Iain Duncan Smith let fly at a children's charity that was given leave for a judicial review of his benefit policies – and judicial reviews are to be curtailed. The <a href=\"http://www.trusselltrust.org\" title=\"\">Trussell Trust</a> got a dusty Tory response this week to its <a href=\"http://www.trusselltrust.org/foodbank-numbers-triple\" title=\"\">shocking report on the rising need for food banks</a>. The rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs' report attacking charities called them political \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_(Internet)\" title=\"\">sockpuppets</a>\" with \"an illusion of grassroots support\". Well, that public support is about to be tested, as untrusted politicians go head to head with a much-trusted sector.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/transparencyoflobbyingnonpartycampaigningandtradeunionadministration.html\" title=\"\">lobbying bill</a> arrives in the Lords on Tuesday, crafted to barely touch the professional lobbying trade, which Cameron once called \"the next great scandal waiting to happen\". Only 1% of lobbying is caught, not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/14/lynton-crosby-tobacco-meeting-labour\" title=\"\">Lynton Crosby's tobacco and alcohol lobbying firm</a> right in the heart of government nor any in-house lobbying by companies; scores of meetings with energy firms go unrecorded.</p><p>Part two of the bill will curb charities and others campaigning for a full year before elections by limiting what they can spend, counting all their overheads. Going about their ordinary business risks turning charities criminal if they fail to register with the <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk\" title=\"\">Electoral Commission</a>, which is itself highly critical of the bill. Trustees will never know how far they can go on climate change, child poverty, hunting, housing, badgers or any other advocacy. The bill being rush through is to ensure a year of silence can be imposed by next May.</p><p>The Lords all-party constitution committee today suggests the bill undermines \"the fundamental constitutional right to freedom of political expression\", silencing third-party campaigners while failing to curb lobbyists. So far this has stayed under the public radar, but will the coalition get away with it, or will the&nbsp;Lords rebel?</p><p>The coalition has a natural Lords majority. Lib Dems used to oppose threats to civil liberties but no longer: Nick Clegg instigated this bill. Afraid of a backlash from the National Union of Students over fees, anti-frackers and myriad single-issue groups who were once allies, he pressed for this gagging act to protect his candidates in election year. The Lords is jam-packed with trustees and patrons, so charities are calling on them to speak up on Tuesday – and that means staying until the vote. The government delays awkward votes, knowing how many Lords make fine speeches but slip away to supper before voting. No vote, no daily allowance should be the rule.</p><p>The government is set against a formidable foe. In just three weeks Richard Harries, the former Bishop of Oxford, has set up a <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk\" title=\"\">Commission on Civil Society</a>, which has already held emergency hearings on the bill all round the UK, backed by Christian Aid, Women's Institutes, the Countryside Alliance, <a href=\"http://www.38degrees.org.uk\" title=\"\">38 Degrees</a>, Oxfam, vegans, Quakers, the British Legion and scores more. Even the TaxPayers' Alliance is protesting, with the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies calling it \"an extraordinary attack on free speech that must be scrapped\".</p><p>Government amendments to the bill have not assuaged the fears of the third sector. Their legal opinion says the bill still restricts organisations' ability to engage in campaigns or policy debates and \"will insulate the executive\" from \"external criticism\". The charities were outraged when William Shawcross asserted they were now \"happy\" with the bill. But noise from the press and the BBC has been notably lacking, so perhaps yet again the government can rely on its supportive media to let it do whatever it wants. That's a lesson in brazenness for Labour – next time, just do it.</p><p>Charities are valued for their status as thorns in the side of the establishment, free to speak out about their own concerns – from plain cigarette packets to village greens, from animals to the state of the poor, sick or old. But they are easily cowed. A Charity Commission bent on too heavily policing them for \"political\" campaigning will seal their lips. A bill designed to stop them saying anything in election year is already chilling some. Several I spoke to were strongly opposed but afraid to have their organisation mentioned, relying on trenchant advocacy from NCVO and charity leaders' network Acevo, whose head, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Bubb\" title=\"\">Stephen Bubb</a>, says, \"They're scared, the general atmosphere has made the political terrain too tough,\" noting a threatening article by Chris Grayling in the Mail about political campaigning. \"Who else but these organisations has the real life experience to tell truth to power about the effects of benefit changes on mentally ill or disabled people? Who else sees what the bedroom tax is doing?\"</p><p>In the halcyon days before the election, Francis Maude told Bubb to \"make sure you keep our feet to the fire\"&nbsp;on supporting charities. But that was then. Now, says Bubb, \"they've put&nbsp;our feet in the fire instead\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420294037|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|4706f5986e537ee332efaffac93d87aad3eaf870 -->",

        "body":"<p>The ABC TV Lateline interview with Kurt Campbell, former US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2013/s3717042.htm\">cordial, even reverential</a>. It was conducted in the middle of March this year, more than a month after Campbell had left the state department.</p> <p>Interviewer Emma Alberici asked Campbell about the transformation of Burma and the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. He gushed that it was remarkable, and gave some folksy anecdotes about a &ldquo;better future&rdquo; for the Burmese. The interview then swiftly moved on to focus on the prospects of Hillary Clinton running for president in 2016.&nbsp;There were no questions about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/us-seeks-expanded-military-ties-indonesia\">Campbell&rsquo;s push for greater ties</a>&nbsp;with the Indonesian military&nbsp;despite its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/human-rights-indonesia\">shocking record of abuse in West Papua</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>There were also no questions about Campbell&rsquo;s Washington and Singapore-based investment organisation, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheAsiaGroup\">the Asia Group</a>, and its efforts to win lucrative contracts across the Asia-Pacific region. After all, his company had been launched before this interview took place and surely warranted some questions about the appropriateness of setting up a company so soon after leaving government.</p> <p>It might be considered an example of the unwillingness of the mainstream media to challenge potential conflicts of interest when it comes to the murky melding of business and politics. With the announcement in August by the Lowy Institute that Campbell was its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lowyinstitute.org/news-and-media/press-releases/lowy-institute-announces-appointment-kurt-campbell-its-2013-distinguished-international-fellow\">2013 distinguished international fellow</a>, it&rsquo;s vital to question the ways in which our media has drunk the thinktank kool-aid.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Lowy Institute sees itself as Australia&rsquo;s leading foreign affairs thinktank. Its fellows and staff routinely appear in the media&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lowyinstitute.org/news-and-media/news\">pontificating about global affairs</a>, including a push for greater defence spending&nbsp;<a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-10/09/c_132782314.htm\">that would allow countless contractors</a>&nbsp;to earn billions of dollars.&nbsp;Its head Michael Fullilove, who's also a non-resident senior fellow in foreign affairs at the Brookings Institution,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.lowyinstitute.org/files/pubfiles/Fullilove,_Why_Kissinger_should_support_Obama.pdf\">writes longingly</a>&nbsp;about former US national security advisor Henry Kissinger as a &ldquo;realist&rdquo;, despite there being questions over Kissinger's record of foreign policy. Kissinger endorsed Fullilove&rsquo;s recent book, a love letter to Franklin D Roosevelt.&nbsp;Fullilove has also been an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/the-news-of-the-wikileaks-both-share-a-dangerous-rationale/243153/\">outspoken critic</a>&nbsp;of the release of the Wikileaks cables.</p> <p>When former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard recently announced that she had been made a senior fellow at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/julia-gillard-explains-misogyny-speech\">Brookings Institution</a>, I could find no local news story that explained what the thinktank was. Glenn Greenwald has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/15/drones-brookings-media\">pithily written</a>&nbsp;that \"Brookings is a classic example of that sprawling strain of Washington thinktank culture that exist for little reason other than to serve and justify government power.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>The US-based Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting group&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/who-pays-for-think-tanks/\">investigated&nbsp;</a>the influence of corporate and foundation money on thinktanks and their spokepeople, and urged an examination of their fundings in the areas of climate change, war, arms manufacturing and energy policy. Frustratingly, interviewers rarely get past the bland soundbite from their guests.&nbsp;As an example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://public-accountability.org/\">Public Accountability Initiative</a>&nbsp;released a report this month that found a number many of the expert voices calling for military action against Syria in the US were linked to the weapons industry and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://public-accountability.org/2013/10/conflicts-of-interest-in-the-syria-debate/\">would financially benefit from a US strike</a>. However, in the vast bulk of media appearances, outlets failed to disclose these business interests.</p> <p>In Australia, the questions around the independence of thinktanks started with the establishment of Sydney University&rsquo;s United States Studies Centre in 2006. At its launch dinner, Rupert Murdoch said that &ldquo;Australians must resist and reject the facile, reflexive, unthinking anti-Americanism that has gripped much of Europe&rdquo;. The media today&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ussc.edu.au/news-room/in-the-news\">laps up its views</a>,&nbsp;despite questions around the Centre Sydney University allowing itself to be&nbsp;funded by <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/sinister-role-seen-in-uni-studies-centre-20100921-15le1.html\">politically friendly parties</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US Studies Centre is supported by a range of corporate interests, including the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ussc.edu.au/about/partners-supporters-collaborators\">Dow Chemical Company Foundation</a>,&nbsp;&ldquo;to support a three-year research program on sustainability.&rdquo; A key aim of Dow is to push genetically modified foods, and to oppose complete&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/10/24/influence-explored-big-ag-lobbies-against-prop-37-in-california/\">labelling of GM foods in the US</a>.&nbsp;People should take these connections into account when evaluating any US Studies Centre face that appears in our media to talk dispassionately about the environment.</p> <p>But back to Kurt Campbell. In May 2013, his company the Asia Group was one of the bidders on Yangon International Airport, a $1bn project. In July 2012, Campbell had successfully convinced the Obama administration while he was still in government&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/07/11/obama_breaks_with_aung_san_suu_kyi_lifts_burmese_investment_ban\">to lift an investment ban on Burma</a>, allowing US firms to make a fortune in the country.</p> <p>This led to Foreign Policy&rsquo;s The Cable wondering whether The Asia Group had some&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/05/20/white_house_likely_to_promote_us_investment_group_in_meeting_with_president_thein_s\">conflict of interest questions to answer</a>, leading company COO Nirav Patel to claim that Campbell&rsquo;s activities in the country had been &ldquo;extremely consistent&rdquo; for years. &ldquo;This is intrinsically about supporting reform,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can't get to supporting reform without people taking [investment] risks. That's something we're very passionate about.&rdquo; In the end, a Korean consortium, Incheon,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.irrawaddy.org/latest-news/koreas-incheon-wins-tender-for-hanthawaddy-airport.html\">won the airport tender</a>.</p> <p>There are no suggestions of illegal behaviour by Campbell or his company. But questions can be asked over the appropriateness of setting up a consulting firm shortly after leaving government, and then potentially making money from relationships established during his time as a public servant. My many requests for comment from Campbell and the Asia Group went unanswered.</p> <p>I asked the Lowy Institute a range of questions about Campbell&rsquo;s possible conflicts of interest. They sent me a statement that ignored these issues:</p> <blockquote> <p>Dr Campbell has long been one of the United States' foremost policymakers on Asia. As assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, he played a leading role on issues such at the US \"rebalance\" towards Asia, US-China relations, and efforts to promote democratic change in Burma. This fellowship will provide the international policy community in Australia with an opportunity to draw upon Dr Campbell's experience and insights on the defining political, economic and strategic issues in Asia at a time of great change in the region. It will also be an opportunity to expose Dr Campbell to Australian perspectives on these issues.</p> </blockquote> <p>Business and politics rarely mix without controversy; the media needs to be careful not to be seduced by smooth thinktank talkers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420318545|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|24f4fccfaf4af0bc847a54e174aefc18be7af997 -->",

        "headline":"Disability – a fate worse than death?",
        "body":"<p>Two and a half months ago, my grandfather died. He was 84. He was not unwell in any specific way. He had no cancer and had only spent short periods of time in hospital. He was just old, worn out and over it.</p> <p>During his last week or so, he expressed a wish to die many times. He once asked his doctor, with no small amount of distress, how it was possible for a person's body to be dying but not their mind. He had reached a point where dying was what he wanted, and we wanted that for him too.</p> <p>None of us, including his doctor, could do anything to assist him with his wishes because neither euthanasia nor assisted suicide are legal in Australia. With the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/bills/pdf/61_of_2013.pdf\">voluntary assisted dying bill</a> <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-17/voluntary-euthanasia-law-defeated-by-one-vote/5029876\">voted down</a> by Tasmanian parliament this week, it doesn't look like that will change any time soon.</p> <p>For many years now, I have been opposed to legalising assisted death in any form. My recent experience with my dear pa Jack has not changed my mind.</p> <p>As a disabled person, I'm accustomed to conversations about quality of life and dignity. Specifically, I'm accustomed to assuring people that my life is worth living. I'm short statured, a wheelchair user, and I frequently have bone fractures. All the visual cues that make me \"the other\" are front and centre. People make all sorts of assumptions about the quality of my life and my levels of independence. They're almost always wrong.</p> <p>I've lost count of the number of times I've been told, \"I just don't think I could live like you,\" or \"I wouldn't have the courage in your situation,\" or, my favourite one to overhear (and I've overheard it more than once), \"You'd just bloody top yourself, wouldn't you?\".</p> <p>What we as a society think we know about what it means to live as a disabled person comes from cultural representations of disability seen through a non-disabled lens. And we, as people with disability, rarely get to tell our own stories.</p> <p>Also, social attitudes towards disabled people come from a medical profession that takes a deficit view of disability. This is my major concern with legalising assisted death; that it will give doctors more control over our lives.</p> <p>As a disabled person who has had a lot to do with the medical profession, I can tell you that this is the space in which I've experienced some of the very worst disability prejudice and discrimination. Doctors might know about our biology, but it doesn't mean they know about our lives.</p> <p>Media reports on assisted dying feed these misconceptions. ABC News reported this week on the case of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-16/disabled-qld-woman-considers-moving-to-tas-for-euthanasia/5027008\">Barbara Harling</a>, a Queensland woman with motor neurone disease who said that she would consider moving to Tasmania if the voluntary assisted dying Bill had passed. Harling is quoted as saying: \"Well, let's put it this way. I can use my left hand, my right hand is just about useless. If I can't use my left hand to wipe my bottom, then I can do nothing else for myself. That means someone has to do everything for me. I couldn't bear to live like that.\"</p> <p>The thing is, a lot of people do live like that. I know many, many people who depend on personal assistants for all of their daily living tasks, some of them requiring 24 hour care. Having to rely on someone else to wipe your bum may not be something anyone aspires to, but I'm quite sure it's never killed anyone. Perhaps our discomfort with this kind of thing is why we don't hear the counter view in reports about assisted dying.</p> <p>Often we hear supporters of euthanasia and assisted suicide talk about wanting to avoid the pain and suffering that often comes with imminent death. But more often, we hear stories like Barbara Harling's, which are more about wanting to avoid a loss of autonomy and independence. Indeed, in the final few years of my grandfather's life it became very apparent that he was not a man who was afraid of dying. He was, however, deathly afraid of disability.</p> <p>In a two-part audio <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p014dkr1\">documentary</a> for the BBC World Service, disability campaigner Liz Carr travelled through Europe and the United States where various forms of assisted death are legal. In the US State of Oregon, where voluntary euthanasia has been practiced legally for over a decade, a recent <a href=\"http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Documents/year15.pdf\">report</a> on the <a href=\"http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/Evaluationresearch/deathwithdignityact/Pages/index.aspx\">death with dignity act</a> confirmed that the majority of people using the act do so not because of concerns about pain, or pain control, but instead about losing autonomy and dignity. Carr reasons, \"these concerns have as much to do with disability as they do terminal illness, which perhaps is why disabled people like me see assisted death as relevant to them.\"</p> <p>Marilyn Golden from US campaign group <a href=\"http://www.notdeadyet.org/\">Not Dead Yet</a> thinks we are asking the wrong questions when it comes to assisted death: \"We have to ask, do people with disabilities have true choice and self determination, in terms of living outside of nursing homes? In terms of housing that is truly affordable and accessible? In terms of the kind of services that really allow them to lead meaningful lives? In many cases, no.\"</p> <p>Perhaps what we should be asking is, if these services and supports were guaranteed, and we could be assured that we wouldn't become dependent on our family members for assistance, would people still see disability as a fate worse than death?</p> <p>As an opponent of legalising assisted death, watching my grandfather wanting to die and being unable to give him the release he desperately wanted was heartbreaking. And yet I still believe we need more robust conversation if we are to pass a law that truly balances the wishes of those who want to die with adequate safeguards for those who don't. Before we can talk about death with dignity, we need to ensure that all people, regardless of age or disability, can live with dignity. We're not there yet.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/rampup/articles/2013/10/18/3872088.htm\">This piece was originally posted by ABC Ramp Up</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420319508|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|aeebd6ffbb29521b1cd6242d1d3aa056dfa2a8d0 -->",

        "body":"<p>One stifling summer day in a far-too-hot-to-be-safe metal building at Winmalee High, the teacher asked us to write down what was best thing to do in our hometown. The most popular response was: leave Winmalee.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-18/bushfires3a-in-their-own-words/5030034\">Winmalee</a> has a population of 7,000, nestled amongst the vast bushland in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. It's beautiful and serene, yet still developed enough to be considered suburban. But its appeal is also what makes it so very dangerous.</p> <p>I was nine the first time a bushfire forced us to flee Winmalee. Information back then was scarce &ndash; no Twitter, no News 24, no Instagram. Word from the firefighters, the radio, or neighbours told us that the fire was going to hit our area early that day. Dad stayed to fight the fire, and Mum packed myself, my brother, our cat and the photos &ndash; back when we printed them &ndash; in a car and drove to our aunt and uncle's house in Penrith, about half an hour away.</p> <p>We didn't hear much that night about the fire. Perhaps a story about a neighbour's roof catching fire, a big explosion at the end of the street, a park burnt to the ground. But we had no real way of confirming it.&nbsp;</p> <p>The next day we heard that it was all over and we were clear to go home. Although the fire burnt down homes at the end of my street, mine was spared.</p> <p>I finally left Winmalee to go to university. Now I'm in in the inner west of Sydney I am far from the increasingly frequent danger of bushfires, but I still have cousins, aunts and uncles, and grandparents up there.</p> <p>For that reason alone, I couldn't be more thankful for social media. But 16,000 kilometres away in New York, the first I heard about the fires again ravaging my home town wasn't from family or former school friends, but from people in the inner city of Sydney <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/fliYpgoRVy/\">Instagramming the haze of smoke</a> and the red sun. <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/flPgs3iiiF/\">Apply an appropriate filter</a>, mention the zombie apocalypse, laugh and forget about it.</p> <p>It was only later, when I checked Facebook and Twitter that I realised that the smoke came from bush and homes burning on the very street I grew up on.</p> <p>I would say I was appalled by it, but it's not unexpected that a good portion of Sydney is so insular and insensitive. The dangers of bush fires are not a reality that many of them have ever faced.</p> <p>Then there was the point-scoring: the <a href=\"https:/twitter.com/AdamBandt/status/390719983786811392\">Greens MP Adam Bandt seeking to make the bush fires all about the politics of the carbon tax</a>; and some Twitter users<a href=\"https://twitter.com/timrobinson10/status/390727309554360320\"> abusing communications minister Malcolm Turnbull </a>for his fibre-to-the-node NBN policy, claiming that a full fibre connection would be better in bushfire situations.</p> <p>That time to make jokes about the inconvenient smoke, or try to win over a point about your pet topic to the politician you don't like, is not the time when houses are burning down and lives are at risk.</p> <p>But thankfully such posts were the minority. Twitter kept me updated on the latest news on the locations of the fires, what had been lost, and connected me to everything I needed to know about Winmalee even though I'm on the other side of the planet. Facebook provided relief with the knowledge that my friends and family were safe.&nbsp;</p> <p>The immediacy of social media means that it is learning on its feet, and often in these situations it is clumsy at best. You often see both the best and worst of humanity in emergency situations, and it's no different on the internet.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420315354|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|7a8d77aab4f001aefe8c71885fa3f192833330f2 -->",

        "body":"<p>If you had to guess the percentage of homeless people in Australia who have a job, would the number you guessed be a low one? You could have reasoned that homelessness is probably linked to not having an income. And that this is Australia – and people in Australia with a job earn enough money to pay for shelter, food and basic life necessities.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that’s no longer the case. The Centre for Policy Development is about to release its latest book, <a href=\"http://cpd.org.au/category/election-2013-2/pushing-our-luck/\">Pushing our Luck</a>, which reports that today in Australia 40% of homeless people have a job. Our working homeless are part of a rising class of insecure workers. They are suffering the consequences of work without any guaranteed hours or income, any access to paid or sick leave and fewer workplace rights than the rest of Australia’s permanent workforce. One agency casual worker wrote to us at the Union, describing his life caring for his disabled daughter while attempting to make ends meet. He told us that there are times “I have not bought food so I can pay my mortgage”. He hasn’t had a holiday in 16 years. His experiences, however, are far from unique.</p> <p>Insecure work has been growing in Australia for the past 20 years, to the point that today just 60% of Australian workers have a permanent job. The rest of our workforce now consists of casual, labour hire casual or contract workers. The consequence of this growing army of insecure workers is that many will struggle to pay their bills, their rent or mortgage. They will be vulnerable to severe financial stress – and in some cases homelessness – if they become ill or suffer a hardship. Over the last few months, members and volunteers at the National Union of Workers have been <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/XC2FPZX.\">surveying their family, friends and neighbours about their experiences with insecure work</a>. They’ve collected over 1,500 surveys that have provided plenty of alarming information on insecure work in Australia. Of the casual, agency and contract workers who have taken part in our survey, 60% said they had experienced difficulty in meeting their rental or mortgage payments because of irregular hours at work. This indicates that there is a huge number of Australians who are living with high levels of financial pressure.</p> <p>When you’re living constantly with this sort of stress, when each week you worry about being able to pay your rent and bills, life becomes a matter of surviving from shift-to-shift, and week-to-week. The future becomes more remote. Tomorrow's problems can wait until you've received a text message telling you whether today you have a shift or not. One survey respondent described his situation vividly. “Because there is no security in this type of employment you actually end up in a state of captivity: not wanting to take holidays in case you lose your position, not wanting to take time off in case work has dried up when you return, making yourself available for every shift because shift lengths are short and there is a need to maximise hours in case of illness, lack of work, or simply the chance that you might not be rostered on for shifts that week.”</p> <p>&nbsp;This economic reality also has social and political consequences. Fifty-six per cent of casual, agency and contract workers indicated their job had caused them difficulty in meeting a commitment to a sporting club or other voluntary association. But the effects don't end at the doorway to the local cricket club either, especially when insecure workers consistently told us in the survey they felt like second-class citizens. One survey respondent told us casual workers at their work call themselves Kleenexes after the tissue brand because &quot;they use us for the dirty jobs then throw us out&quot;.</p> <p>And what we are only just starting to understand is how this huge divide between permanent workers and insecure workers is affecting our politics. Our survey results show a marked contrast; 50% of permanent workers identified with a major political party compared with 45% of insecure workers. The Conservatives don't lose from this disengagement. It's the broad, progressive side of politics – which draws its strength from people having hope that a different world is possible – that is disadvantaged. Support for Labor was 13% lower amongst insecure workers as compared to permanent workers. This indicates that the Labor Party is not currently giving insecure workers any hope that it can help provide solutions to their problems.</p> <p>It’s why the NUW has been running a campaign, called Jobs You Can Count On, for the past two years to advocate for the rights of insecure workers and demand a better deal for them. The NUW started this campaign in the workplaces of our members, but this issue is one for communities, for all of us to face because it affects us all. That's why this morning in Melbourne NUW members and a broad coalition of other unions, community and faith groups, musicians and parliamentarians came together for the <a href=\"http://www.nuw.org.au/campaigns/jobs-you-can-count-on\">Fluro-Fightback</a> as part of Anti-Poverty week. We believe an Australia in which every worker counts is possible – but only if we reach for it.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-25d27ddd-cff8-4bd7-8c3c-bb6c56e0be9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/18/1382056386859/The-crowd-watches-the-pai-008.jpg\" alt=\"The crowd watches the painters and dockers and the Flybyz perform together at Fluro Fightback\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The crowd watches the painters and dockers and the Flybyz perform together at Fluro Fightback Photograph: Taylor Battista</figcaption> </figure><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420214881|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|d490aa05c636f0c93a754e61e96966382c8ab6f7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Each week, a new guest hosts the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IndigenousX\">@IndigenousX</a> twitter account to discuss topics of interest as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. In partnership with IndigenousX, we're inviting its weekly host to tell us about who they are, what issues they're passionate about, and what they have in store for us during their upcoming week.</p> <h2>Tell us about yourself. Who are you, where are you from, what do you do?</h2> <p>My name is Blake Tatafu. I am a 21 year old living on the Central Coast and in Western Sydney. I am an Aboriginal man; Wiradjuri and Dhungutti with my family hailing from Trangie and Kempsey on my mother&rsquo;s side. I am also Tongan and Hawaiian on my father&rsquo;s side, so I have been raised with lots of beautiful culture. I am currently in my last semester at University of Western Sydney, studying Community and Social Development.</p> <p>I am proud to be a part of a number of youth representation boards and committees that either advocate or promote mental health, wellbeing, healing and education. I am currently a part of the <a href=\"http://healingfoundation.org.au/youth-reference-group/\">Healing Foundation&rsquo;s youth reference group</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.fya.org.au/initiatives/niyla/\">National Indigenous Youth Leadership Academy</a>&rsquo;s facilitation group, <a href=\"http://www.yawcrc.org.au/\">Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.yawcrc.org.au/news/article/252\">Youth Brains Trust</a> and most recently I have been appointed as a youth reference group member for <a href=\"http://www.headspace.org.au/\">headspace</a>.</p> <h2>What do you plan to talk about on @IndigenousX this week?</h2> <p>This will be my second and a half time as host of IndigenousX, which is such an honour. It is such a great platform to promote many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who may not otherwise have their excellence recognised. During my week as IndigenousX, I will be in Melbourne attending my appointment as a youth reference group member with headspace, which is exciting. I will definitely live-tweet what we get up to. I seem to tweet a fair bit about music, which plays a big part in my life and just the general things that make up my day as a 21-year-old university student. I also usually like to tweet quotes or links that encourage positivity and inspiration, which I like to read on a daily basis. Sharing them as IndigenousX could change someone&rsquo;s mood.</p> <h2>What issue are you most passionate about?</h2> <p>For a number of years now, I have been passionate about mental health and wellbeing.</p> <p>Even early on in high school, I would ask so many questions about why we feel happy or sad or why people get \"sick\" from how they feel. It completely fascinated me. As I got older, I started to understand why this was and yearned to be a part of the amazing legion of people who work with people with mental health adversities and other illnesses.</p> <p>Poor mental health can be a silent killer. I think that a lot of Australians do not feel able to grasp their own self-determination and find out more about mental health due to the stigma around it. I want to promote, assist and advocate for people with mental health adversities, working in particular with my fellow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who unfortunately still suffer heavily from the infinite amount of trauma which began with British invasion back in the 1700s, and continues to this day.</p> <h2>Who are your role models, and why?</h2> <p>&nbsp;I have always been inspired by people in my everyday life. My family, and in particular my Nan, have been amazing role models. From my Nan, I have learnt integrity, tenacity, respect and of course, resilience. She&rsquo;s possibly the strongest person I know and despite all of the trauma, pain and despair my family has been through, my Nan has always been the one to elevate our spirits with her generous, warm, strong heart. It&rsquo;s everyday people like my Nan who really can change lives.</p> <h2>What are your hopes for the future?</h2> <p>Life is unpredictable but so amazing at the moment. For myself, I hope to be working as a psychologist or community health officer in mental health services, specialising in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander healing. Speaking more broadly, I hope that the standard of living across health, wellbeing, education and welfare improves for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, ultimately resulting in more positive communities that are self-determined and self-governed. In order for that to begin the whole of Australia needs to understand Aboriginal history and work with us to achieve this intergenerational struggle.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420309942|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|395faf97961bd11b08b4909a67cbd8a5e8acbc83 -->",

In theory, we could go through the cycle of <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2013/10/21/131021taco_talk_hertzberg?utm_source=tny&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=weeklyemail&amp;mbid=nl_Weekly%20(13)\" title=\"\">mendacity, demagoguery and obstructionism</a> all over again. Will that happen? The deal includes an agreement to appoint a bipartisan group of members of Congress to negotiate future spending levels, but we have seen what happened to them in the past. The next round of this soap opera, which the house speaker John Boehner called fighting the good fight, will take place much closer to the mid-term elections.</p><p>This should matter but, there again, it may not. Let us not forget that we are dealing with a group of people who don't accept that they lost the last election, in November 2012. In a poll fought largely on the issue of healthcare, Barack Obama had five million more popular votes than his challenger, Democrats in the Senate had 10 million more votes, and in the House of Representatives one-and-a-half million more than the Republicans. No matter, the Republicans thought they won. In the house, they won a majority largely because of a deeply flawed system which allows states, dominated by one party or another, to gerrymander the seats by districting and redistricting. The independent order of the political map should become the norm, rather than – as now – the exception.</p><p>As things stand – cocooned in constituencies with an artificial concentration of conservative voters, more focused on primaries than the general election – many Republicans who should be drawing the obvious humbling lessons from a knockout defeat of this nature may do no such thing. The counter argument is that gerrymandered districts are not that safe for the Tea Party wing, because according to <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-14/tea-partys-house-seats-might-not-be-all-that-safe\" title=\"\">one analysis</a> the Republicans lost twice as much support over the government shutdown in gerrymandered districts than in those whose boundaries were not politically redrawn. If this is true, the Tea Party will be drained of its self-righteous populism by the popular vote itself. In the end, the biggest Republican mistake was not in opposing Obamacare or greater government spending. Rightly or wrongly, those causes are popular. Their mistake was to shut down government, making normal life and people's jobs the hostage of political demands. In doing that, they overreached themselves. Mr Obama is, as a result of this battle, a much steelier character, so are the Democrats in Congress. Together they have been fashioned by this conflict into an effective political force, less hobbled by the opposition. Let us hope the mid-terms mark the moment when the Tea Party's over.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420306807|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|4bae4ee6180bcc11cc6f2a958cfdf82bdb0b858d -->",

        "headline":"The Snowden dossier: balancing acts",
        "body":"<p>A number of remarkable things have happened this week in the continuing fallout over Edward Snowden's dossier of revelations about mass surveillance. The past two days have seen more disclosures – this time in the Washington Post. The two chiefs of the US National Security Agency are, it has been confirmed, to quit. In the UK, the government has conceded for the first time that the revelations do, indeed, raise wider concerns about the balance between privacy and security which Westminster should consider. In the same breath the prime minister has encouraged parliament to investigate this newspaper for publishing the facts that make any debate possible.</p><p>The Washington Post's latest two articles make fascinating reading. One <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/documents-reveal-nsas-extensive-involvement-in-targeted-killing-program/2013/10/16/29775278-3674-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story_1.html\" title=\"\">reveals the NSA's extensive involvement in the US's targeted killing drone programme</a>. Another <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-collects-millions-of-e-mail-address-books-globally/2013/10/14/8e58b5be-34f9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html?hpid=z1\" title=\"\">shows how the NSA is harvesting hundreds of millions of individuals' address books</a> at a rate of anything up to 250m a year. Both are valuable contributions to the public's knowledge. They came as Reuters reported that the coming departure of NSA director Keith Alexander and his civilian deputy could give President Obama the chance to reshape the eavesdropping agency.</p><p>In America the debate is on the move. There are currently three bills before Congress proposing reforms to the limits and oversight of surveillance. One of them <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/nsa-surveillance-patriot-act-author-bill\" title=\"\">is drafted (with bi-partisan support) by the conservative Republican author of the Patriot Act</a>, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, who was appalled to learn – through newspapers, not any form of oversight – about how his legislation was actually being applied. He says he plans \"to put [the NSA's] metadata programme out of business\".</p><p>There are practically no voices in Congress calling for the Washington Post or New York Times to be investigated. It is simply not an issue – just as prior restraint on publication would be unimaginable in the US. The former general counsel of the NSA, Stewart Baker, expressed it thus in a recent debate in New York: \"Snowden violated the law, but once he's given it to the reporters, the reporters are protected.\" It would be unthinkable for a president to suggest that the NYT should be investigated by Congress under the rubric of \"counter-terrorism\". This current administration has a poor record in regard to aggressively prosecuting whistleblowers, but it is virtually unheard of for espionage legislation to be deployed against reporters. American lawmakers do not confuse terrorism with journalism. Congress does still act as a check on the executive.</p><p>In the UK, events are being played out against a backdrop in which politicians are proposing a form of regulation involving the medieval instrument of a royal charter – a form of backdoor legislation cooked up, not (as in popular legend) by Ed Miliband over late-night pizzas, but by the Cameron government itself. We will return to the subject of the post-Leveson debate on another occasion. But the burden of proof over press regulation now shifts. For nearly two years the press was required to demonstrate it could set up its own independent regulator (a task not yet complete). Now the boot is on the other foot: politicians must show they understand the meaning of an unfettered press free to report on matters of high public importance. It's not clear they do.</p><p>It is, at least, welcome that the intelligence and security committee has now conceded that the debate that journalism has provoked is a necessary one. The committee has announced it is to take evidence on the vital wider issues raised by the Snowden material. There are, of course, active questions about how effective or independent the ISC has itself proved. So this exercise will also involve yet another burden of proof. The committee has to demonstrate it is not (to borrow a phrase)  \"marking its own homework\" but genuinely hosting an open and long overdue discussion about the difficult balance any democracy has to strike between security, privacy and liberty.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420306404|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|4ec56b354a744e37c800ef13483f7219e693b968 -->",

Grabbing the microphone, she started defending God's honour before the nation.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>He will not be mocked. The greatest deception here is this is not one nation under God. It never was. The constitution would not have been written by freemasons. They go against God. You cannot serve two masters.</p></blockquote><p>After being removed and questioned, she was taken away for psychiatric evaluation.</p><p>Her mental health is no laughing matter. But the <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/16/this-is-not-one-nation-under-god-house-stenographer-taken-from-the-floor-after-bizarre-outburst/\">description of her interjection by much of the media as a \"bizarre\" interruption to the House vote</a> deserves interrogation.</p><p>Because everything about this was bizarre. From the moment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\">Ted Cruz got up and started quoting Ashton Kutcher and talking about Star Wars</a> into the wee hours, this entire process has been nothing but bizarre. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\">America, once again, took the familiar road</a> from the height of dysfunction to the brink of default – until reality grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and slapped it straight, before it did itself and others grave harm.</p><p>Because America is powerful, the world has to take notice of these self-inflicted crises. But because it has become so predictably dysfunctional and routinely reckless, they are difficult to take seriously or, at times, even fathom. To the rest of the world and much of America, this is yet another dangerous folly. The fact that the nation did not default should come as cold comfort. The fact that we are even talking about it defaulting is a problem.</p><p>This particular flirtation with fate was driven by a visceral opposition to the moderate provision of something most western nations take for granted: healthcare. The reforms they opposed had been been passed by the very body of which they are a member and had been been approved by the US supreme court, the guardian of the very constitution they claimed to be defending. For this, they started a fight they never had the numbers to win and carried on waging it long after it was clear they had lost.</p><p>\"We're not going to be disrespected,\" <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\">insisted Republican Indiana Congressman Marlin Stutzman</a>, last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>Nor did anyone else. That's why the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/congress-budget-debate.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;\">Republicans went down to humiliating defeat</a>. As South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham admitted:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We took some bread crumbs and left an entire meal on the table. This has been a really bad two weeks for the Republican party.</p></blockquote><p>But to couch this episode only as a Democratic victory would really miss the point. For the process by which such a shutdown and breakdown could happen is not just the work of a few cranky Tea Party types. It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/shutdown-us-government-republican-party\">rooted in an electoral system that is heavily gerrymandered</a>, where only those who can pay, can play. The reason the Republican dissenters could proceed with such unstrategic zeal is because they are in safe, rigged seats and so risk no challenge at the polls.</p><p>Indeed, given that they only have to fear nomination within their own party, rather than election by the nation at large, there is an incentive to act out in this way because it appeals to the base. When constituencies are so heavily contorted in the interests of incumbents that there is precious little consequence to anything a politician does, then <a href=\" http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/\">you don't really have a democracy</a>, you just have the vote.</p><p>This temporary resolution buys them time, but it does not by them any real solution – since there is absolutely nothing to prevent a repeat performance. Which is what it is: a performance. As said Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid put it on Wednesday night:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm tired. Concluding this crisis is historic. But let's be honest: this was pain inflicted on the nation for no good reason. We cannot … we cannot, cannot make the same mistakes again.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, they can. Almost certainly, they will.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420250081|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|84d00ba2f51e10e4f891e7b2a79303d3738162ee -->",

        "headline":"Kate Winslet's Vogue cover is ageless. But not in a good way",
        "body":"<p>Kate Winslet is on the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/14/kate-winslet-vogue-photos_n_4096789.html\">cover of this month's Vogue</a> and the photo is unbelievable.</p><p>I mean, literally unbelievable. The 38-year-old, who does OK without <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/21/mario-testino-interview-fashion-photography\">Mario Testino's</a> help, looks in this portrait like a CGI version of herself. Her hair is detachable plastic; her eyes are like marbles. Her expression, which I guess is her own, albeit under Testino's direction, is sort of mysterious with a touch of, \"Help! I've been laminated!\"</p><p>It is abominably, thrillingly awful.</p><p>Like the plastic surgery debate, the airbrushing debate never gets us anywhere. Who, given the kind of scrutiny these women fall under, wouldn't beg and plead for a little help from the art department? Not that they need much encouraging. It's a catch-22: the movie and beauty industries won't change until older women are more visible, but older women don't want to be visible until the industries change. (And by older, obviously, I mean post-34.)</p><p>Who can blame them? You could probably mount a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/29/malcolm-gladwell-david-and-goliath-interview\">Malcolm Gladwell-type argument</a> that, like drug use in sport, women movie stars should be allowed to use any resources available to them, to level the playing field against the God-given gifts of youth and symmetry. It puts the rest of us under pressure, of course, and trickles down into all sorts of considerations, but there comes a point in life when you understand you aren't a movie star and move on. Honestly, good luck to them.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420337962'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381873870653/katewinsletvogue-496x620.jpg' alt='Kate Winslet Vogue Cover' width='460' height='620' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Winslet on the cover of November's issue of Vogue. Photograph: guardian.co.uk</figcaption></figure><p>In this case, the Vogue cover will probably end up doing us all favour, since it's so blatantly, revealingly ludicrous. Testino, whose job I recall seeing described once as being that of making beautiful people look more beautiful, has always produced crashingly boring portraits, which kitsch out every last shred of his subjects' humanity. Say what you like about Annie Leibovitz, at least she brings props.</p><p>The actual interview with Winslet, on the other hand, is quite good. She defends her right to have three children by three different fathers and, sounding like Edith Evans, says briskly:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[M]y kids don't go back and forth; none of this 50/50 time with the mums and dads. My children live with me; that is it. That is it!</p></blockquote><p>It's the kind of quote that, if you're not careful, will land you a <a href=\"http://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/taunton_news/10693454.One_arrested_after_Fathers4Justice__Spiderman__ends_Taunton_bridge_protest/\">guy in a Spiderman suit</a> with a Fathers 4 Justice placard on your doorstep.</p><p>Perhaps, the Barbie-like cover shot will repel people; perhaps, there will be enough outrage to provoke Winslet to respond, as she did after she was airbrushed on the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2643777.stm\">cover of GQ</a> ten years ago. Though, that was slightly different, since weight was a factor and Winslet has always campaigned about size-ism.</p><p>But this is ageism: they've stripped the lines from her face, and, at 38, she is entering the danger zone for actresses and is probably inclined to capitulate. (On point, I saw a preview of a new biopic of Dickens last week, in which Ralph Fiennes plays the hero and Kristin Scott Thomas, his former leading lady from The English Patient, plays <em>the mother</em> of his mistress.)</p><p>The best response to the Vogue cover is to laugh: the magazine is so far out to sea at this point, it has no sense of how transparent its manipulations are. It's like the inverse of Dorian Grey – as the portraits on the cover get more and more \"perfect\", the body of the product gets ever more sickly. You almost wonder if, as in Spike Jonze's new movie, Her, it is making a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/sep/09/spike-jonze-her-scarlett-johansson\">satirical point about realism</a>, although neither satire nor point-making is quite the magazine's style. Its style, this month at least, is flat and fake, a fantasy that fails on its own terms.</p><p>The grotesque can be beautiful, but not here.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420070199|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|360d98083ca04184b538a8fe6ac5e26e9bb3c758 -->",

        "headline":"The Koch brothers' beer offensive against Obamacare loses its fizz",
        "body":"<p>What's a family values conservative to do when every effort to protect millions of Americans from the scourge of affordable healthcare fails? </p><p>Break out the beer, of course. The latest campaign to kill off Obamacare in its infancy is now playing out on college campuses where a conservative group known as Generation Opportunity (GO), who are funded in part by the billionaire Koch brothers, is using the <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/10/14/3689755/young-are-being-recruited-to-help.html\">lure of free beer</a> and \"opt out\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_koozie\">beer koozies</a> to persuade young students not to buy health insurance – or, at least, not to buy it from the Obamacare exchanges.</p><p>Traditionally, one might expect God-fearing conservatives to be warning youth about the dangers of alcohol consumption, rather than plying them with free liquor, but these are desperate times. The determined Koch brothers have already spent <a href=\"http://www.prwatch.org/news/2013/09/12247/breaking-new-list-dark-money-shell-game-groups-connected-kochs\">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> trying to derail the president's healthcare law. So far, though, despite their best efforts, Obamacare has proved as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-01/will-the-young-invincibles-join-obamacare-.html\">\"invincible\" as the young people</a> it needs to enroll. While it's unlikely that the beer exchanges, shall we call them, will be the game-changer, the Kochs may well end up driving many of us to drink with their relentless and futile vendetta to undo the law – not just the college students.</p><p>Nearly every movement to \"educate the public\" about the \"dangers\" of Obamacare can be linked in some way to the Koch brothers, and this latest college campus effort is no different. Last month, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/koch-brothers-heritage-action-donation-98054.html\">Politico revealed</a> that GO has received $5.04m from the Koch-funded entity known as Freedom Works. This \"grassroots\" movement is now about to embark on an \"<a href=\"http://optout.org/\">Opt Out</a>\" tour of 20 college towns across the country as part of its effort to steer young people away from the Obamacare exchanges. As GO's 29-year-old president, Evan Feinberg, put it:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>What we're trying to communicate is, 'No, you're not actually required to buy health insurance' … you might have to pay a fine, but that's going to be cheaper for you, and better for you.</p></blockquote><p>After coming under criticism for this statement, Feinberg (who previously worked at the Charles Koch Institute) has since clarified that GO is not trying to persuade young people to opt out of buying insurance altogether, just from buying it through the healthcare exchanges.</p><p>Maybe, I'm naive to think that most young Americans will not fall for this cynical ploy, no matter how much free beer they are plied with. It seems to me that any campaign that is based on a false premise – in this case, that young people could get cheaper insurance before Obamacare or since – seems destined for failure. </p><p>According to a report released in September by the Department of the Health and Human Services, <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/09/20130917b.html\">56% of the people</a> who are applying for health insurance today will be able to get coverage through the health insurance marketplace for <em>less than $100 a month</em>. This means that a large percentage of the youth market that GO are targeting would be able to get comprehensive health coverage under Obamacare for a very low rate.</p><p>If Feinberg or any other GO employee genuinely knows about better insurance deals than that for students, it would be really helpful if they listed them on their Opt Out website. Surely, that would be a far better use of their Koch dollars than buying more crates of beer?</p><p>As it is, the Opt Out website contains no information beyond vague and unsubstantiated claims about Obamacare being a \"bad deal\", and two embarrassingly poorly made ads featuring a \"Creepy Uncle Sam\" character who pops up between a woman's legs as she undergoes a gynaecological exam and asks a young man to roll over while he pulls on a surgical glove. The message – that government should stay out of healthcare – is about as subtle as Miley Cyrus' recent sledgehammer licking antics.</p><p>Whether Creepy Uncle Sam and his creepier backers will succeed in bringing down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) remains to be seen, but the prognosis is not good. Since the ACA was signed into law in 2010, it has miraculously managed to withstand \"Hitler death panel\" comparisons, state by state efforts to block its implementation, a US supreme court challenge to its constitutionality and, most recently, a defunding effort that led to the federal government shutdown. </p><p>As the New York Times recently reported, the Koch brothers <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/us/a-federal-budget-crisis-months-in-the-planning.html?_r=0\">have been heavily involved</a> in all of these separate efforts through their generous funding of groups like Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action and, of course, Generation Opportunity. But so far, their efforts have been in vain. Not only is Obamacare still the law of the land, but the law has actually <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/gop-plummets-obamacare-soars-shutdown\">gained a major bump</a> in support since the shutdown stand-off.</p><p>As it happens, even the Koch brothers have begun to realize that their attempts to stop the ACA are getting them nowhere. Last week, a representative of Koch Industries sent a <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/10/koch-industries-doesnt-want-be-tainted-obamacare-prompted-shutdown/70350/\">letter</a> to members of the Senate distancing the company from efforts to defund Obamacare, while still making it clear that Koch really does not like the law. </p><p>Does this mean the Koch brothers are done with their various and multifaceted efforts to bring it down? Probably not, but if they at least scale back their efforts to just distributing free beers, that might not be such a bad thing.</p><p>After what they have put us all through, we deserve one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420191676|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|4afa5db3c99a66b0acdaf56847bbfb25046defc5 -->",

        "headline":"Massive open online courses: a first report card",
        "body":"<blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Who's going to grade all that homework?</p></blockquote><p>Those of us who are engaged in teaching \"massive open online courses\", or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/08/mooc-coursera-higher-education-investment\">Moocs</a>, find ourselves answering a lot of questions these days, and that's one we hear a lot.</p><p>One month into my own effort for Northwestern University, I've heard so many versions of that one on the street, in meetings, and even when doing TV interviews, that I have a quick and facile answer: the students and the software. The more interesting questions, however, are about the kinds of teaching and learning possible through platforms like <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\">Coursera</a> (that's where my NU class – \"<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/googlemedia\">Understanding Media by Understanding Google</a>,\" with an initial enrollment of more than 45,000 – is offered).</p><p>A high-school teacher friend asked, for instance, just where I think the most learning is taking place. As much as I might like to point to my lectures, or the 85 pieces of assigned background reading, the most obvious answer turns out to be in online discussion forums – where the conversation is so compelling that I have posted more than 250 times myself. There, in hundreds of asynchronous conversations with peers in every time zone, thousands of learners are working out what they think about the intersection of the web with journalism and media, as they peer through the lens provided by this one particular company.</p><p>I really shouldn't have been surprised by the quality of discourse that my teaching assistants and I are tracking (for an average of 10 hours a day), given that a pre-course and a mid-course survey both indicate that 80% or more of the students in out class have four-year college degrees or better. And I really didn't stop to think about how rich the discussions would be due to the diversity of geography and life experiences of the student body – only 20% of whom report they live in the United States. The second largest cohort comprises students in India.</p><p>My teacher friend also wanted to know how I could gauge how much the students were learning. But because the class is still running, my answers have to be framed as questions I am trying to answer myself.</p><p>First, with more than half the class never having taken a Mooc before, I wonder if what I'm observing is obscured by unfamiliarity with the platform, or the vagaries of technology and spotty bandwidth. The answer is yes, for some, but not for the majority.</p><p>Many students are clearly running the text of my lectures, their own work, and their peers' efforts through <a href=\"http://www.wiredacademic.com/2012/09/found-in-translation-mooc-player-coursera-partners-with-amara-for-wiki-translations/\">translation software</a> – some of it twice, in a tech-driven version of that old parlor game \"telephone\". So, a second question is whether the learning is masked by language issues. The answer is sometimes, but not usually.</p><p>A third question is if open-book, untimed, automatically-graded quizzes can be valuable in helping students assess their learning. The answer here is 50:50. Hey, the class is partly about Google; so they can pretty much Google the answers, right?</p><p>Last, I must ask how good peer-graded homework assignments really are for this type of learning. That question requires the most reflection. Language limitations, time pressures and job responsibilities – not to mention, the reality that anyone who's on the web can be distracted from a task at any time – may make it too early to judge definitively. But because many people who appear to be among the class's best students are sharing their very, very low opinion of peer-grading, attention must be paid.</p><p>Let's frame this as a business challenge. My students may not be paying with dollars and rupees, but they are paying with something equally scarce – their time and attention. If massive online courses are ever going to include paid options, as well as classes that are open and free, the efficacy of peer-grading is an issue that universities and platform providers must address.</p><p>Meanwhile, as the instructor, I am learning a lot, as well. And I see, through the growing sophistication of their weekly homework, that students are improving their understanding not just of this topic, but also of their own habits and behavior. To \"pass\", students need to score 70 out of a possible 100 points during the six-week course, and I expect that thousands will do just that.</p><p>Even in a free course, students hold themselves and their classmates to high standards. The more students are engaged with one another, the more likely they are to push themselves to achieve those standards. And again, these engaged, self-critical students are well worth the time spent listening and communicating with them.</p><p>To realize the potential of the Mooc \"movement\", <a href=\"http://www.theawl.com/2013/02/how-to-save-college\">universities</a>, <a href=\"http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/\">faculties</a>, and platform providers are all going to need to up our games. As has always been true on a traditional, physical campus, the best students already have.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420180516|2013-10-18T10:47:05Z|67314360522aafb5944358551cf85924966a84fa -->",
