        "headline":"Why BlackBerry failed",
        "body":"<p>\"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/03f754da-455b-11e3-b98b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2jgXSlSDK\" title=\"\">A tech giant rises – another falls</a>,\" said the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/397501470087847936/photo/1\" title=\"\">front-page headline</a> on the Financial Times. It juxtaposed Twitter's initial public offering (IPO), which is set to raise more from the market than Google did in 2004, with the chaotic events at BlackBerry, which <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/04/blackberry-abandons-fairfax-deal-heins-out/\" title=\"\">dropped a plan to sell itself for $4.7bn</a>, jettisoned its chief executive and <a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/11/04/blackberry-investors-disapprove-of-debt-deal/\" title=\"\">said it would raise $1bn in cheap debt</a>.</p><p>Is that how it goes? Is the technology business a sort of one-in, one-out game? It's certainly hard to find a company with more enthusiastic investors ahead of the bell than Twitter – though let's see how things go once the shares are traded – nor one that has been more heftily dumped than BlackBerry, which in June 2008 boasted shares topping $144. Now they languish at $6.50.</p><p>Or did BlackBerry just get too old? Is that it?</p><p>Actually, no. The difference between technology companies (and companies generally) that survive and those that don't is much simpler. As with biological species, it's all about adaptability. If you can't adapt, then you will be erased by history.</p><p>The obvious example is Apple, which in 1997 was just 90 days from bankruptcy. Steve Jobs, older and wiser than when he had been fired from it, came back, used his industry connections (particularly Bill Gates) to get the company stable and began building the company back up. The iPod, originally conceived as a device to make people buy more Macintosh computers, instead turned into a huge product line in itself.</p><p>But by 2005, Jobs recognised that making iPods wouldn't be enough: modern phones would soon be able to store just as much music as a cheap iPod, and make phone calls too. So he set Apple's designers and engineers to making a phone.</p><p>If Apple hadn't shifted from making iPods to iPhones – what startup companies call a \"pivot\", meaning a shift in business focus – then it would have been erased: the Mac and iPod business together generated about $6bn in Apple's most recent quarter, less than half that of Google, and one-third that of Microsoft.</p><p>The iPhone seems obvious and its success assured now – but as recounted in <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007448401&amp;guni=Article:in%20body%20link\" title=\"\">Fred Vogelstein's forthcoming book Dogfight</a>, it was actually a tightrope walk involving barely ready prototypes, buggy software and last-minute deals. When Jobs showed off the iPhone in January 2007, there wasn't an assembly line for them, and Jobs's demos had to be carefully planned to avoid embarrassing crashes using a \"golden path\" worked out laboriously by testers.</p><p>Ditto for the iPad: even internal testers were unsure what it was \"for\", Vogelstein records. (In that, they sound much like the collective \"huh?\" that emanated from many who first saw it.) Now the iPad generates more money than Microsoft's entire Windows business.</p><p>So success isn't foretold in the technology business. Nor was BlackBerry's demise. True, it had a lead, but a <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/coming-saturday-the-inside-story-of-why-blackberry-is-failing/article14563602/\" title=\"\">detailed analysis by Canada's Globe and Mail of the failure of the nation's darling</a> shows that its managers discussed different ways to get out of their predicament time and again. The problem wasn't that they didn't have ideas; it was that they made the wrong choices. They didn't fail to adapt; they failed to make the correct adaptations.</p><p>You can see this happening elsewhere. Microsoft, which used to be just a software licensing company, began making hardware with the Xbox (sure, keyboards were first, but not relevant) and now is building its own Surface tablets, and will soon own Nokia's handset business. It'll be a software-writing, tablet-making, phone-building company – just like Apple. Google too now owns a phone manufacturer (Motorola) and is building new hardware (its Glass device). Even being a big and hugely profitable company doesn't mean you don't have to adapt.</p><p>So while it might seem as though BlackBerry's time simply came and went, the truth is – if we only had time machines, and a desire to save it – that there were always times when it could have been saved from this agonising swirl around the black hole of irrelevance. And Twitter, too, will meet some point when it abruptly faces a choice that will either kill it, or make it stronger. Every company does; and many choose wrongly. That's why most companies go bust in their first five years. Surviving beyond that (as Twitter, Facebook and many others have done) doesn't exempt you from having to adapt.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421714190|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|6201643fd846de204bf21561264467372984a79c -->",

        "headline":"Rising homelessness in Paris: does it have the most rough sleepers of the big European capitals?",
        "body":"<p>At 9pm, as the street lights glinted off the river Seine beyond Notre Dame cathedral, by the Pont Marie bridge, Yan, 37, was neatly laying out his cardboard boxes for the night in front of a chic sofa-bed shop. A dozen people were already climbing into sleeping bags nearby, an elderly woman was sorting clothes, a man in his 60s was wrapped in a duvet reading a book as the last well-heeled commuters hurried past from the metro. Yan, a Polish butcher, trained in charcuterie, just wanted a job in his trade. \"But you can't work with food while you're sleeping rough, it just wouldn't feel hygienic …\" he muttered. He had been sleeping rough in Paris for three years, occasionally doing agricultural work outside the city. With the weather not yet plunging to freezing, he felt OK inside two sleeping bags on a bed of cardboard on the concrete. \"When it gets colder, we'll go down into underground car parks to sleep. Not the metro, because, with the constant noise and activity, you can't get to sleep before 1am, then you're up again at five. Here, I'll shut my eyes at 10 or 11pm, I'll be gone by seven.\"</p><p>Beside him, Igor, 50, an unemployed Slovakian painter and decorator, remembered sleeping in offices he once worked on. Now he too just wants a job. Do the police bother them? \"No, they just patrol at around midnight, have a quick look to check we're all alive.\"</p><p>At the Socialist-run Paris city hall nearby, where election fever is hotting up before next spring, some would argue it's better to be poor in Paris than a lot of other places, saying levels of social aid in the capital are high. But, years after French presidential candidates of both left and right (the Socialist Lionel Jospin, then the rightwing Nicolas Sarkozy) promised that no more people would ever need to sleep rough, the number on cardboard boxes in the street is rising. Campaigners warn that successive French governments have failed to solve not only homelessness but a wider housing crisis. With no clear regular statistics collected, it's impossible to prove what some Parisians believe on their early morning commute past sleeping bags in sandpits in children's parks, mattresses in doorways, sometimes women and children on the pavements: that there are more people sleeping rough in their city than other big European capitals. The French national statistics office warned of <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2013/07/02/le-nombre-de-sdf-a-augmente-de-50-depuis-2001_915267\" title=\"\">a 50% increase in homelessness in France from 2001 to 2012</a>, including a rise in foreigners and women. They calculated 141,500 homeless across France at the start of last year, but charities add hundreds of thousands more at risk and in precarious housing situations.</p><p>There's a centuries-long history of people being down and out in Paris, a city with a tradition of transient populations and now more European migrants, said Julien Damon, a sociologist at Sciences Po university. \"Paris is seen as an extremely tolerant city and generous in its offer of aid and social protection. It's perhaps the EU city that spends most in terms of public policy on shelter and these issues.\" He said homelessness was less stigmatised in France. \"In London you can't sleep in a tent and stay in the same place all day. In Paris, you can. There's no criminalisation of begging.\" But if Paris homelessness is perhaps tolerated more than in London and Berlin, that did not mean the problem was being solved by successive governments.</p><p>Polls show that French people are sympathetic to the homeless. In European surveys, the French are the nationality most likely to view homelessness as the unfortunate result of financial crisis, unemployment and housing crises and the least likely to blame the individual for personal reasons such as drugs or alcohol. A <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2009/11/19/01011-20091119FILWWW00586-56-des-francais-ont-peur-d-etre-sdf.php\" title=\"\">2009 poll</a> found that a staggering 56% of French people felt they could one day be homeless themselves, 75% felt \"solidarity\" with rough sleepers.</p><p>The past decade has seen successive protests, such as organised tent cities, in Paris to highlight the plight of the homeless.</p><p>Others make their own gestures. Joël Catherin, a young lawyer who began writing quirky cardboard signs for the homeless people in his posh Paris neighbourhood, in turn inspired <a href=\"http://www.rezinaprod.com/grand-mere.htm\" title=\"\">a short film by Bernard Tanguy</a>. In his flat, Catherin showed me boxes full of hundreds of tattered cardboard signs he had drawn. In Paris, the felt-tipped signs reading \"I'm hungry\" beside a paper cup for coins are a regular fixture for people sitting on street corners. Catherin had noticed an elderly Romanian woman, Ioana, sleeping rough in his neighbourhood near the Madeleine district with a similar sign. One winter night, angered by the cold and the homelessness problem, he made her a new sign: \"I could be your grandmother.\" It worked, money fell into the pot, people started noticing. He was soon drawing up signs for other homeless people he befriended – comments on politics, football, jokes. From a reference to the FT magazine, \"How to Spend it?\" to \"Sale, end of line\", \"All we need is love, 1 euro\". Locals, social media and the French press began searching out <a href=\"http://www.rue89.com/2011/04/10/joel-avocat-des-riches-qui-invente-des-pancartes-pour-sdf-198817\" title=\"\">these mysterious, odd and unsettling subtitles of the cityscape</a>.</p><p>\"Humans don't need subtitles,\" Catherin said. \"It's more that, through the words on the cardboard, passersby looked at these people differently and realised they were human beings. It wasn't about money, it was about changing the way people view others.\"</p><p>\"Sometimes it felt as if these homeless people were like human furniture. People passed them while putting their bottles in the bottle-bank for recycling, but didn't think of them as human,\" he said. The thing about the now infamous sign, 'I could be your grandmother', he felt, was that \"it made people go and speak to her, show some sympathy. It became part of our neighbourhood.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421707174|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|d716ea6a05531059f647e16119d887bb5cc48fc2 -->",

        "headline":"Where's the outrage about the monarchy's extravagant expenses?",
        "body":"<p>There's quite a view from the chamber in City Hall where the London assembly meets to scrutinise the mayor. Occasionally during one of Boris Johnson's more vague and waffling answers at mayor's question time, my eyes wander to admire the fine vista of the north side of the Thames, and come to rest upon one of London's most ancient buildings – the Tower of London.</p><p>The tower was, of course, the place where enemies of the monarch were once imprisoned. Judging from the reaction from some sections of the media to a <a href=\"http://tomcopley.com/spare-sycophancy/\" title=\"\">short blog post I wrote</a> bemoaning the reaction of some politicians to the royal christening, there are some who'd like the tower to be bought back into use for this very purpose.</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/london-assembly-attacks-mps-for-fawning-royal-baby-tributes-8915177.html\" title=\"\">originally ran</a> in the Evening Standard. Unsurprisingly, it caused the Daily Mail to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2481513/Tributes-Prince-George-stomach-churning-says-Labours-Tom-Copley.html\" title=\"\">froth over with faux-outrage</a>. Conservative MP Bob Neill accused me of being \"out of touch\", proving once again that no one fawns over royalty quite like a Tory. Still, it's nice to see Neill standing up for those who can't stand up for themselves. The Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/11/01/prince-george-labour_n_4189456.html?1383304808&amp;utm_hp_ref=uk\" title=\"\">ran the story</a> as the main headline on its front page, asking readers if they agreed with me.</p><p>The media reaction demonstrates once again how monarchy infantilises us by creating a semi-mystical institution that is supposedly above criticism. The expectation is that we should suspend our critical faculties, nod, smile and say how bloody marvellous the whole thing is. No thanks. Opinion polling consistently shows that 20-25% of the British people want a democratic alternative to hereditary monarchy. That's millions of people who deserve to have their voices heard.</p><p>The Queen is quite understandably held in high public affection. But that does not mean that we should not debate the serious constitutional issue of whether it is right that in the 21st century we continue to select our head of state by accident of birth rather than by universal suffrage. This is not some minor issue. Through royal prerogative, powers are exercised by the prime minister on behalf of the monarch with absolutely no oversight or scrutiny from parliament. Perhaps the most insidious of these is the ability it gives a prime minister to pack the unelected House of Lords with his stooges, a practice that has always gone on but which has been taken <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/18/unthinkable-lords-chosen-by-lot\" title=\"\">to new extremes by David Cameron</a>.</p><p>The royal family is granted absolute protection from public scrutiny in a manner that would put the Daily Mail into apoplexy if it were any other part of the public sector. Most egregiously, the royal family is entirely exempted from Freedom of Information requests. It is well known that Prince Charles <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/12/prince-charles-lobbying-david-cameron\" title=\"\">uses his position to lobby ministers</a>, in particular when it comes to his pet issues of architecture and homeopathic medicine. Yet ministers have vetoed all attempts to bring correspondence between Charles and ministers to light. This is hardly transparent government.</p><p>Members of parliament were quite rightly lambasted in the media when details of abuses of expenses were revealed. Yet we don't hear a peep from the Daily Mail about extravagant royal expenses. To quote Ian Davidson MP, a former member of the public accounts committee, \"every time we examined royal finances we found extravagance and indulgence as well as abuse of expenses by junior royals\".</p><p>Some people thought that my comments about the royal christening were somewhat churlish. So let me put this into context. I represent a city in which 650,000 children live in poverty, where 391,000 children live in overcrowded housing and 17,000 live in severely overcrowded housing. In the sixth richest city in the world these numbers should shame us all. You'll have to forgive me for being angry that valuable parliamentary time was spent paying tribute to the christening of a very rich, wealthy baby.</p><p>When mild criticism of our hereditary monarchy provokes such a storm in the media, it's no wonder that politicians tend to avoid straying into the debate. But we shouldn't be cowed. On Saturday I spoke at the <a href=\"http://www.republic.org.uk/updates/?event=republic-members-day-and-agm-2013\" title=\"\">annual general meeting of Republic</a>, the organisation that campaigns for an elected head of state, where we also heard from other European republican movements. The Swedish movement boasts three MPs from three different parties on its management committee, something that I would hope to see replicated in this country in the near future. Republicans everywhere should speak up, be proud of what we believe in and work together to win the argument for a democratic alternative to monarchy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421693592|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|24df64886f3f99d3af5868a9187e0da96bd9efc7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Is President Obama a suspected war criminal?</p><p>If you have read the recent reports on drone strikes by <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/BenEmmerson.aspx\">Ben Emmerson, UN special rapporteur</a> on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/executions/pages/srexecutionsindex.aspx\">Christof Heyns, UN special rapporteur</a> on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/amnesty-us-officials-war-crimes-drones\">Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch</a>, there is only one answer to this question … and it is not the answer most would want to hear. </p><p>If you have not read the reports, let me provide you with a brief summary of the common themes. The reports repeatedly criticized President Obama for what has been a near complete lack of transparency. Lack of transparency, according to the reports, impedes accountability. By failing to acknowledge responsibility for drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, there can be no accountability to those who have wrongfully had their innocent loved ones killed in attacks.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ISSUES/FREEDOMOPINION/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx\">Frank La Rue, special rapporteur</a> on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, noted the role the right to information plays in promoting good governance. La Rue added that there exists a right to know the truth because the truth enables access to other rights: in this case, the right to reparations and accountability for the wrongful deaths of loved ones.</p><p>Connecting the issue of transparency to accountability under the law, Heyns stated:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>A lack of appropriate transparency and accountability concerning the deployment of drones undermines the rule of law and may threaten international security. Accountability for violations of international human rights law (or international humanitarian law) is not a matter of choice or policy; it is a duty under domestic and international law.</p></blockquote><p>This brings us to the question of whether President Obama's targeted killing program, implemented through the use of drone strikes, complies with both international human rights law and international humanitarian law. <em>Outside of a defined conflict zone</em>, international human rights law is the applicable law. This is important because human rights law demands significantly more stringent rules for the use of lethal force than does humanitarian law.</p><p>If the United States is only involved in an armed conflict in Afghanistan, international human rights law would be the regime that regulates the use of lethal force in Pakistan and Yemen. Therefore, as noted by Amnesty International, the use of lethal force outside of Afghanistan is legal when it can be demonstrated that:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[It was] only used when strictly unavoidable to protect life, no less harmful means such as capture or non-lethal incapacitation was possible, and the use of force was proportionate in the prevailing circumstances.</p></blockquote><p>Amnesty International concluded that it is highly likely that drone strikes in Pakistan fail to \"satisfy the law enforcement standards that govern intentional use of lethal force outside armed conflict\", and therefore:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[T]heir deliberate killings by drones … very likely violate the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of life and may constitute extrajudicial executions.</p></blockquote><p>If we accept the argument made by the Obama administration and the Bush administration before it – that the United States is involved in an armed conflict with al-Qaida and associated forces wherever they are engaged – international humanitarian law is the <em>lex specialis</em> in Pakistan and Yemen. Yet, even with less rigorous limitations on the use of lethal force under international humanitarian law, there is mounting evidence that the Obama administration's use of drones constitute violations of international law in the form of war crimes.</p><p>Human Rights Watch examined six strikes in Yemen. <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/10/22/between-drone-and-al-qaeda-0\">According to its report</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Two of these attacks were in clear violation of international humanitarian law – the laws of war – because they struck only civilians or used indiscriminate weapons. The other four cases may have violated the laws of war because the individual attacked was not a lawful military target or the attack caused disproportionate civilian harm.</p></blockquote><p>Going beyond the examination of individual strikes, President Obama has utilized tactics that inherently violate the laws of war. These include the use of so-called \"signature strikes\" and \"double taps\". According to Amnesty International:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Under international humanitarian law, US drone operators must at all times abide by the principle of distinction; namely distinguish between civilians and combatants … All feasible precautions must be taken in determining whether a person is a civilian … In case of doubt, the person must be presumed to be protected against direct attack.</p></blockquote><p>Signature strikes target individuals for death based not on the confirmed identity or activities of the targets, but rather \"behavioral characteristics\" identified as those typical of militants. This is a clear violation of the principle of distinction. Further, Amnesty International questions President Obama's assertion that drone strikes are only launched when there is \"near certainty\" that civilians will not be killed in the strike – a likely reference to President Obama's disputed method of counting \"all military-age males\" in the vicinity of an alleged target as militants.</p><p>Amnesty International argues that the president's precautionary measures \"are only relevant if the US applies the status of 'civilian' to unidentified individuals, rather than presuming they are combatants whom they deem directly targetable. Otherwise, these killings could constitute war crimes or extrajudicial executions.\"</p><p>The \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan\">double tap</a>\" involves launching an initial drone strike, which is followed by a second strike that targets rescuers and first responders. The rationale behind the use of double taps is that those who converge on the scene of the initial strike must be militants themselves.</p><p>Thus, the use of double taps relies on two assumptions. The first is that the victims of the initial strike were militants – an assumption the facts simply do not corroborate in numerous cases. And the second assumption, which is that first responders must also be militants, fails because of the failure of the first. Further, even if the victims of the initial strike were legitimate targets, to assume those who converge on the scene of the initial strike to be military targets clearly fails to satisfy the principle of distinction.</p><p>Once again, the United States stands at a crossroad. Either it can immunize President Obama and members of his administration from accountability, as it did President Bush and his administration. As seen, this route exposes the hypocrisy of the administration's counter-terrorism policy to full display. Or the US can subject its leaders to the same standards it demands of others.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421636902|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|f2d8dd92bef753e2c0bc906e56eb28027a1c41ca -->",

        "body":"<p>As Americans in Virginia and New Jersey head to the polls to vote for a governor Tuesday, one has to wonder what will make them mark their ballots for their preferred candidates. One thing is certain: a politician doesn't need to run on substance these days; soundbites will get the job done. If politicians want to curry favor with their base, they should take a leaf from the playbook of Representative Joe Wilson, who interrupted President Obama during a 2009 speech to Congress, shouting, \"You lie!\"</p><p>Decorum? No. Worldwide attention? Yes.</p><p>In New Jersey, a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 700,000 among registered voters, incumbent Governor Chris Christie, a Republican who leads in the polls by a wide margin, spent the last weekend of the campaign touring the state encountering crowds that \"treated him more like a celebrity than a politician\", according to the New York Times. What about his opponent? The Democratic challenger is Senator Barbara Buono; yet it's almost as if she doesn't exist. She needs some soundbites that could be turned into Twitter hashtags.</p><p>Are voters picking winners based on outsize personalities, rather than the substantial issues of the day, such as unemployment? Governor Christie is, both literally and figuratively, an outsized candidate who takes positions that would appear to be to the right of New Jersey's voters. Yet, where does his public personality in the media leave his opponent? In the dust, apparently.</p><p>The middle class in New Jersey has taken a hammering economically, but Christie is hailed as a strong possible presidential candidate for 2016.</p><p>We shouldn't be surprised at larger-than-life, media-savvy candidates being elected to office, as we have only to look at the rise of Corey Booker, the new Democratic Senator for New Jersey and former mayor of Newark. Again, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/nyregion/booker-wins-senate-race-in-new-jersey.html?_r=0\">from the New York Times</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>With a Twitter following six times as large as the city he has led, Mr Booker was known outside Newark largely for his appearances on late-night television and his heroics: rescuing a neighbor from a burning building, shoveling out snowbound cars, living on a food stamp diet.</p></blockquote><p>There was something about a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2432826/Cory-Booker-exchanges-flirtatious-messages-Portland-stripper-Twitter.html\">Twitter relationship with a vegan stripper from my hometown of Portland</a>, Oregon, but I'll let that slide. Although Booker oversaw budget cuts that reduced the size of the Newark police force, which his critics pointed to as a factor in a two-week spree of murders this summer, even Tea Party favorites Rand Paul and Sarah Palin couldn't help his Republican opponent, Steve Lonegan (remember him?), cast a shadow on Booker's media spotlight.</p><p>In Virginia, Democrat Terry McAuliffe is in a tough race for the state's governorship. McAuliffe is a rough-and-tumble political combatant revered for his fundraising abilities. In fact, he is known in Democratic circles as a \"super-funder\". He raised a $34.4m campaign war chest; his Republican opponent, Ken Cuccinelli, raised $19.7m.</p><p>McAuliffe is pals with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and President Obama took to the stump on Sunday to support him. How many watts of star-power does this man need? What will he bring to the state if he gets elected – sleepovers in the governor's mansion?</p><p>The campaign has been rife with negative advertising, mostly from the Democratic side. Cuccinelli is running against Obamacare, while relying on his Tea Party base and the NRA. That's about it on the substance of issues at hand. While McAuliffe has found support from Republican business leaders who expect him to improve the state's business climate, we haven't heard a lot about the Virginia company he ran, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GreenTech_Automotive\">GreenTech</a>.</p><p>Politicking is as old as the hills. What's new is the plethora of media channels: Facebook, Twitter, blogs, cable \"news\" channels and an odd preponderance of journalists who don't ask tough questions of candidates. In an era of soundbites and rapid-fire tweeting, society stands to lose if we are not electing officials to office based on their true, substantive plans for how they will govern and represent the electorate that votes them in. </p><p>In the meantime, we can <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rob-ford-i-m-not-an-alcoholic-i-m-not-a-drug-addict-1.2355543\">look to Toronto's scandal-struck mayor, Rob Ford,</a> to see what substantive plans he brought to that city, and we can discuss whether Michelle Obama should be wearing stiletto heels or flats. It's enough to make one nostalgic for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_(paper)\">the hanging chad</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421656048|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|b57d85437cbb28268ae192b1e990feb73718ff61 -->",

        "body":"<p>So Jeremy Paxman and Russell Brand have more in common than fetching facial hair. It turns out that the Newsnight anchor agreed with the comedian more than he let on when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\" title=\"\">the pair sparred in a YouTube-ready exchange</a> that centred on Brand's disillusion with the democratic process. \"I think part of Russell Brand's diagnosis is right,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/05/paxman-politics-russell-brand-voting\" title=\"\">Paxman confesses</a> in the latest edition of the Radio Times. \"There is a huge sense of disillusion out there.\"</p><p></p><p>Some will react to that the way they would to a complaint by Miley Cyrus about the sexualisation of young female musicians: you should know, because you're part of the problem. For if politicians are held in low regard, if not outright contempt, then some responsibility surely belongs to those from the rottweiler school of interviewing who cannot look at an elected official without dripping disdain. Those who watch Paxman, or listen to the Today programme's John Humphrys, can hardly be blamed for picking up some of that cynical attitude to the Westminster classes, which regards anyone who's won an election as automatically suspect. Recall Paxman's <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/571500/\" title=\"\">description of his own mindset</a> when interviewing a politician: \"I am always asking myself why is this lying bastard lying to me?\"</p><p></p><p>Don't get me wrong: I'm not calling for Paxman or Humphrys to pull in their claws. Those in power merit forensic, unrelenting scrutiny. The problem is the definition of power. Paxman seems to believe the only authority that deserves the full Paxo treatment is the elected variety. He tends to reserve the trademark sneer, loaded first question and presumption of guilt for members of parliament and ministers – even those who, truth be told, wield only the most modest modicum of influence.</p><p></p><p>Rare is the occasion when he shows similar venom to those who wield unelected power. Watch the compilation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/27/jeremy-paxmans-greatest-clips\" title=\"\">Paxo's greatest hits</a> and they consist chiefly of the grand inquisitor shredding politicians. Look for a similar encounter with a corporate titan, the heads of one of those companies or banks that exert vast influence over the national or global economy, and you will struggle. If it's happened once or twice, it's the exception not the rule. The likes of former junior minister <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\"bddWaHuxTzc\"\" title=\"\">Chloe Smith</a> have more to fear from Paxman than the likes of Google's Eric Schmidt.</p><p></p><p>This problem goes far beyond the Newsnight presenter.

The implication is that they would deserve it less if they were unelected. But this is surely the wrong way around. It is unelected, unaccountable power that needs more scrutiny.

        "headline":"The ultimate guide to US election night 2013",
        "body":"<p>There are many reasons to think that election night 2013 may not be the most exciting of affairs. Even the historic election of the first white mayor in Detroit in 40 years <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-detroit-mayoral-race-20131103,0,5811.story\">is almost a foregone conclusion</a>, with Democrat Mike Duggan up by 25 points. Yet there are also a few reasons that you should pay attention. These three races may not be close, but all can offer lessons.</p><h2>1. Chris Christie and 2016</h2><p>Christie is about to become the first Garden State Republican to win a majority of the vote in a major statewide election since George Bush Sr in 1988. There isn't a longer streak in America of one party not winning at least 50% of the vote in at least one major statewide contest. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/27/chris-christie-appeal-historic-win\">Other statistics bear out</a> how unusual Christie's victory will be.</p><p>As important as the size of Christie's win, is how he's going to get it. A coalition of white people who had been deserting the Democrats in New Jersey and minorities is delivering for Christie. The latter group is especially important for a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/03/18/the-republican-problem-with-hispanic-voters-in-7-charts/\">party whose elders want to reach out</a> to black people and Hispanics. The establishment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/11/rand-paul-2016-gop-presidential-odds\">almost always decides presidential primaries</a>, and after two terms out of the White House, the yearning to win exceeds the thirst for ideological purity.</p><h2>2. Bill de Blasio and crime</h2><p>De Blasio is about to take the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-new-york-city-mayor-lhota-vs-de-blasio\">New York City mayoral election</a> by a margin of at least 40 points. He'll win a higher percentage of the vote for a Big Apple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_mayoral_elections\">non-incumbent mayoral candidate since 1925</a>. When a victory is this wide, you can assign almost any factor as at least partially the cause.</p><p>Let me give one: crime is not the same election issue it once was. Republicans in New York City and candidates nationwide <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayoralty_of_Rudy_Giuliani\">found success</a> in the 1980s and 1990s by promising to crack down on \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/nyregion/catsimatidis-no-friend-of-hoodlums.html?_r=0\">hoodlums</a>\". </p><p>But now, violent and other types of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/07/economist-explains-16\">crime is falling</a>, and issues such as police overreach are as important as the crime the police is trying to prevent. Also, <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/114-de-blasio-with-big-lead-over-lhota-going-into-election-day/\">other issues</a> – like economic inequality – can rise to the top.</p><p>Republicans in urban areas are going to come up with a message that better resonates in a time of safety in order to remain viable.</p><h2>3. Terry McAuliffe and 2014</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421712606'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/6/1354831666301/mcauliffe.jpg' alt='terry mcauliffe' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Importantly for election watchers, Terry McAuliffe will win despite being disliked by most voters. Photograph: Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>McAuliffe, a Democrat, is about to become the first member of the party White House to take the Virginia gubernatorial election since 1975. He's doing so in a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/10/virginia-governor-2014-midterms\"> state that looks a lot</a> like the nation, demographically. Most importantly for election watchers, McAuliffe will win despite being disliked by most voters.</p><p>McAuliffe's success has largely depended on Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli being even more disliked. Sound familiar? It should, because a very similar battle is going on for the 2014 midterms. Democrats are trying to break a stretch of the White House party losing or winning fewer than 10 seats in the House of Representatives – a stretch that dates back to the civil war. They need to take 17 seats to win back the House.</p><p>Right now, Democrats are ahead on the national House ballot by about four points among <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/generic_congressional_vote-2170.html\">likely 2014 voters</a>. As in Virginia, it's all about being less ugly. President Obama's approval rating is bad, but Republican approval ratings are worse. The fact that voters in Virginia are disobeying the longer term election after the presidential race trend should have national Republicans at least somewhat worried.</p><p>If big races and possible long-term implications aren't your thing, there are some other lesser known affairs could keep result-watchers up for much of the night:</p><h2>1. Alabama first district, House Republican primary runoff</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421712607'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383602553748/Bradley-Byrne-Dean-Young-008.jpg' alt='Bradley Byrne, Dean Young' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The fight between Bradley Byrne, left, and Dean Young is an intra-party battle that looks a lot like the Republican party's quarrel nationwide. Photo: AP</figcaption></figure><p>It's a fight between the business-friendly establishment candidate Bradley Byrne and Tea Partier Dean Young. Byrne is a fiscal conservative who believes President Obama was born in this country, while Young is a social conservative who thinks President Obama was born in Kenya. It's an intra-party battle that looks a lot like the Republican party's quarrel nationwide. The Guardian's Paul Lewis has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/30/alabama-primary-republican-q-a\">a lot more on the positions of the candidates</a>.</p><p>Bryne had long been thought of as the favorite, and got the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama's_1st_congressional_district_special_election,_2013\">highest percentage of the vote</a> in the initial primary with 35% to Young's 22%. In the runoff, the <a href=\"http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=791752\">latest poll</a> has Young surging to 43% and Byrne stuck at 40%. Polling special primary elections in the south is nearly impossible, though the candidate with the most energized base – probably Young – likely has an edge. Either way, this race is too close to call at this point.</p><h2>2. Boston's mayoral runoff</h2><p>You'd be excused if you couldn't point to <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/09/24/walsh-connolly-must-fight-for-same-ground-distinguish-themselves-between-now-and-november/GGXziuGiMGD8jw2u2mAb7J/story.html\">a single policy difference</a> between Democrats John Connolly and Marty Walsh. The candidates can't seem to disagree, except that Connolly attacks Walsh for being an ex-union official, while Walsh goes after Connolly for being a lawyer. There aren't any gender, race, or religious differences either. It's really a race about personality at this point, and this has led to <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-boston-mayor-connolly-vs-walsh\">one heck of a tight race</a>. </p><p>Walsh won the first round 18% to 17%, though Connolly jumped out to an early edge in the runoff. Walsh has closed the gap and is up by less than one point in the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-boston-mayor-connolly-vs-walsh\">HuffPollster aggregate</a>. The only thing certain in this contest is that for the first time in 20 years Boston will have a mayor whose name isn't Thomas Menino. </p><h2>3. Virginia's attorney general general election</h2><p>The last time the Democratic party won all three elected statewide offices (governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general) in Virginia <a href=\"http://blogs.roanoke.com/politics/2013/10/18/what-are-the-odds-of-a-democratic-sweep/\">was 1989</a>. With governor and lieutenant governor in the bag, Democrats are hoping their standard bearer Mark Herring can emerge victorious against Republican Mark Obenshain. Unlike the other Republican candidates running on the statewide ticket, Obenshain has avoided the Tea Party tarring. </p><p>The result is a race that is far too close to call. Obenshain is up by 0.1pt in the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-virginia-attorney-general-obenshain-vs-herring\">HuffPollster aggregate</a>. If Herring wins, expect Republicans to blame Cuccinelli for dragging down the whole ticket. If Obenshain pulls it off, expect more moderate Republicans to point to him as an example of what can happen when a more mainstream Republican is presented to the public. It's pretty much a lose-lose for the Tea Party.</p><h2>Overall</h2><p>Despite my earlier protestations, there are indeed some interesting stories to unfold on election night 2013.

        "body":"<p>Having announced a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/marks-and-spencer-sales-fall\" title=\"\">drop in clothing sales of 1.3%</a> this morning, I can't help but wonder if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/marks-and-spencer-sales-fall\" title=\"\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> might be pinning all its hopes on its new <a href=\"http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/columns/olivia-bergin/TMG10426789/Why-MandSs-cashmere-onesie-will-be-top-of-my-Christmas-list.html\" title=\"\">£199 luxury cashmere onesie</a>, released just in time for the Christmas gift guides. Considering one can pick up a fleece number from Primark for just over a tenner, you might argue that it's a bold move, but I think you'd be underestimating the British enthusiasm for toasty comfort.</p><p>The introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jan/16/ever-ok-to-wear-onesie\" title=\"\">onesie</a> has seen the loungewear market explode, to the point where a pair of <a href=\"http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/galleries/TMG9226828/1/Urban-Legends.html\" title=\"\">£295 Penelope Chilvers slippers</a> have become the year's fashion must-haves. Previously limited to those ladies of leisure who spent their divorce settlements from Russian oligarchs lying around their Belgravia mansions like velveteen cats, loungewear is now available to the masses and, taking into account the high unemployment rate and the soaring costs of heating bills, you can see why.</p><p>I've never really understood the antipathy towards onesies – it seems to be a generational thing, signifying a postwar discomfort with comfort itself, rooted in a time where chilblains carried hipster kudos (they had a similar disdain for the shellsuit). I've never heard anyone under 30 disparage the onesie – as anyone who's ever slept in one will tell you, they are bloody warm (I spent most of last Christmas in my dinosaur one, and happily it doubles up as a Halloween costume, although one has to be careful to ascertain the location of the tail before going to the lavatory).</p><p>I'd go as far to say that a snugglier nap time cannot be had, and I come from a family of blanket wearers. Once inside my house, outdoor clothes are cast away in favour of a variety of items chosen for their place on the cosiness scale, with no attention being paid to their eccentricity. Hence why I usually jettison the silk slips and kimonos that would be sported by my ideal, glamorous self, in favour of some combination of the following items: a floor-length woolly Aran sweater smock that falls to my ankles (provenance unknown); a pair of fleecy pyjama bottoms three sizes two big which are a vision in black and white cow print (despite my mother forbidding me from wearing them in front of any member of the male sex lest I die a spinster); a reversible turquoise polar bear jumper; and a pair of novelty slippers that look like monster feet. And that's before we even start discussing headgear (fur, usually).</p><p>But it's par for the course when you grew up in the country. Having visited friends and family and caught them \"chillaxing\" in similar get-ups, it really does call the British taste into question. You wouldn't catch a French woman dead in multicoloured arm-warmers. All of which has convinced me that this garment is very much needed. Indeed, I'd go so far as suggesting that the government stop investing so much in winter fuel allowance and start handing these out to pensioners instead. The initial investment is worth it if it socks one to the energy companies. It'll certainly be on my Christmas list. My energy company's just switched my tariff?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421700100|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|bd6fe250969f2569032d052eb8a764351d7c24de -->",

        "body":"<p>Is President Obama a suspected war criminal?</p><p>If you have read the recent reports on drone strikes by <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/BenEmmerson.aspx\">Ben Emmerson, UN special rapporteur</a> on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/executions/pages/srexecutionsindex.aspx\">Christof Heyns, UN special rapporteur</a> on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/amnesty-us-officials-war-crimes-drones\">Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch</a>, there is only one answer to this question … and it is not the answer most would want to hear. </p><p>If you have not read the reports, let me provide you with a brief summary of the common themes. The reports repeatedly criticized President Obama for what has been a near complete lack of transparency. Lack of transparency, according to the reports, impedes accountability. By failing to acknowledge responsibility for drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, there can be no accountability to those who have wrongfully had their innocent loved ones killed in attacks.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ISSUES/FREEDOMOPINION/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx\">Frank La Rue, special rapporteur</a> on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, noted the role the right to information plays in promoting good governance. La Rue added that there exists a right to know the truth because the truth enables access to other rights: in this case, the right to reparations and accountability for the wrongful deaths of loved ones.</p><p>Connecting the issue of transparency to accountability under the law, Heyns stated:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>A lack of appropriate transparency and accountability concerning the deployment of drones undermines the rule of law and may threaten international security. Accountability for violations of international human rights law (or international humanitarian law) is not a matter of choice or policy; it is a duty under domestic and international law.</p></blockquote><p>This brings us to the question of whether President Obama's targeted killing program, implemented through the use of drone strikes, complies with both international human rights law and international humanitarian law. <em>Outside of a defined conflict zone</em>, international human rights law is the applicable law. This is important because human rights law demands significantly more stringent rules for the use of lethal force than does humanitarian law.</p><p>If the United States is only involved in an armed conflict in Afghanistan, international human rights law would be the regime that regulates the use of lethal force in Pakistan and Yemen. Therefore, as noted by Amnesty International, the use of lethal force outside of Afghanistan is legal when it can be demonstrated that:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[It was] only used when strictly unavoidable to protect life, no less harmful means such as capture or non-lethal incapacitation was possible, and the use of force was proportionate in the prevailing circumstances.</p></blockquote><p>Amnesty International concluded that it is highly likely that drone strikes in Pakistan fail to \"satisfy the law enforcement standards that govern intentional use of lethal force outside armed conflict\", and therefore:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[T]heir deliberate killings by drones … very likely violate the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of life and may constitute extrajudicial executions.</p></blockquote><p>If we accept the argument made by the Obama administration and the Bush administration before it – that the United States is involved in an armed conflict with al-Qaida and associated forces wherever they are engaged – international humanitarian law is the <em>lex specialis</em> in Pakistan and Yemen. Yet, even with less rigorous limitations on the use of lethal force under international humanitarian law, there is mounting evidence that the Obama administration's use of drones constitute violations of international law in the form of war crimes.</p><p>Human Rights Watch examined six strikes in Yemen. <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/10/22/between-drone-and-al-qaeda-0\">According to its report</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Two of these attacks were in clear violation of international humanitarian law – the laws of war – because they struck only civilians or used indiscriminate weapons. The other four cases may have violated the laws of war because the individual attacked was not a lawful military target or the attack caused disproportionate civilian harm.</p></blockquote><p>Going beyond the examination of individual strikes, President Obama has utilized tactics that inherently violate the laws of war. These include the use of so-called \"signature strikes\" and \"double taps\". According to Amnesty International:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Under international humanitarian law, US drone operators must at all times abide by the principle of distinction; namely distinguish between civilians and combatants … All feasible precautions must be taken in determining whether a person is a civilian … In case of doubt, the person must be presumed to be protected against direct attack.</p></blockquote><p>Signature strikes target individuals for death based not on the confirmed identity or activities of the targets, but rather \"behavioral characteristics\" identified as those typical of militants. This is a clear violation of the principle of distinction. Further, Amnesty International questions President Obama's assertion that drone strikes are only launched when there is \"near certainty\" that civilians will not be killed in the strike – a likely reference to President Obama's disputed method of counting \"all military-age males\" in the vicinity of an alleged target as militants.</p><p>Amnesty International argues that the president's precautionary measures \"are only relevant if the US applies the status of 'civilian' to unidentified individuals, rather than presuming they are combatants whom they deem directly targetable. Otherwise, these killings could constitute war crimes or extrajudicial executions.\"</p><p>The \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan\">double tap</a>\" involves launching an initial drone strike, which is followed by a second strike that targets rescuers and first responders. The rationale behind the use of double taps is that those who converge on the scene of the initial strike must be militants themselves.</p><p>Thus, the use of double taps relies on two assumptions. The first is that the victims of the initial strike were militants – an assumption the facts simply do not corroborate in numerous cases. And the second assumption, which is that first responders must also be militants, fails because of the failure of the first. Further, even if the victims of the initial strike were legitimate targets, to assume those who converge on the scene of the initial strike to be military targets clearly fails to satisfy the principle of distinction.</p><p>Once again, the United States stands at a crossroad. Either it can immunize President Obama and members of his administration from accountability, as it did President Bush and his administration. As seen, this route exposes the hypocrisy of the administration's counter-terrorism policy to full display. Or the US can subject its leaders to the same standards it demands of others.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421636902|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|f2d8dd92bef753e2c0bc906e56eb28027a1c41ca -->",

        "body":"<p>There's a sign next to where they brew the tea at <a href=\"http://www.teavana.com/\">Teavana</a>. It reads:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Some call it steeping to perfection. We call it pre-boarding for your tea journey.</p></blockquote><p>I saw that and thought: funny. My mum calls it <a href=\"http://www.sheffieldforum.co.uk/archive/index.php/t-718989.html\">\"mashing\"</a>.</p><p>Anyway, Teavana, America's first purpose-built tea bar, backed by Starbucks and <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/10/23/starbucks-teavana-fast-food-tea-tea-houses/3146149/\">newly opened on New York's Upper East Side</a>, is reassuringly hilarious. I mean, it's rather nice, in its own way: soft lighting, warm colours, attentive staff pressing upon you free samples of that flavoured tea that tastes like a bit like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hot-Ribena/206397416853\">hot Ribena</a>. It has an extensive range, and some pretty-looking cakes. It's very clean.</p><p>But it's just so crushingly pointless. It's a tea bar (it serves <em>no</em> coffee), but it acts more like a determinedly ambitious boutique hotel. You're welcomed at the front door by staff in uniform, presented with a menu card, encouraged to take in the surroundings. They – this is true – actually <em>gift-wrapped</em> my Chelsea bun.</p><p>It's easy to mock – boy, is it easy to mock – but Teavana, with all its new-age, pseudo-spiritual bullshit, points to a wider trend: what you might call America's fetishisation of tea. Since when did tea become part of a marketable lifestyle? The questions in New York's cafés are always the same: black or green? Hold or cold? Kale or quinoa? Gay or straight? And once you've finished this back-and-forth, what do you end up with?</p><p>A rather forlorn-looking cup of tepid water into which the bag has yet to be introduced.</p><p>What Teavana tells us is: tea is now a drink for America's boujis. Construction workers and delivery men, stick to your Dunkin's coffee – your calloused hands and peanut brains probably can't handle something so chichi. We are tea drinkers, not barbarians: we're creative, alternative, organic, sustainable. We play the oboe in our spare time; we make our own hummus. We're caffeine-free, and we all went to Oberlin – and we're gonna make a big deal about ourselves.</p><p>Well, I call foul. This is tea we're talking about! Delicious, refreshing, normal tea! With milk! In a china cup!</p><p>There's really nothing better. Some of life's best bits come with a nice cup of tea attached: on the sofa watching the first morning of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket\">Test match</a>, with a cream scone in an English country garden, in a museum café when your parents come to visit. Tea accompanies life's most important moments. Just imagine the scene:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Mum, I've just failed my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/alevels\">A-levels</a>.</p><p>\"Oh, love. I'll stick the kettle on. Chai latte all right?\"</p></blockquote><p>I know: everyone has their own tastes and mores, and who am I, really, to say that Mandarin Oolong or Coconut Mango Sakura Allure™ isn't worth the mug it's brewed in?</p><p>I also don't say this as a heathen: good quality tea is essential to making the perfect cup. My dad, for example, wouldn't have <a href=\"http://www.pgtips.co.uk/\">PG</a> in the house. (<a href=\"http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/tea/co-operative-fairtrade-indian-prince-tea-bags/\">Co-op Indian Prince</a>, actually. Very underrated.)</p><p>It's just that one of the great virtues of tea, as drunk conventionally in Britain with milk, is its simplicity, its unshowiness. There's a certain art to making a great cup of tea, but the point is anyone can do it. Teavana shows us the folly of over-complicating things. Tea is a fine, versatile drink on its own, and doesn't need pumpkin spice, or lavender sage, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/13/alexander-litvinenko-murder-british-evidence-russia\">Polonium 210</a>, or whatever, to prosper.</p><p>It just needs boiling water  – and it <em>must</em> be boiling: I really can't emphasise that enough, America – and it needs time. To do it any other way is to diminish it.</p><p>I get it: it's all about the coin. Starbucks may profess to love coffee, but what it really loves is money: <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2013/10/30/new-store-openings-push-starbucks-revenue-up-13/\">revenues of $3.8bn in the last quarter</a>. It has conquered coffee; why not do the same with tea? And when you're charging $5.95 for a \"craft tea fusion\" – answers on a postcard, please – you're laughing all the way to the bank.</p><p>But please, enough with the preciousness. Tea doesn't deserve this – it's doing just fine, thanks. A working kettle, some boiling water, a decent bag and a splash of milk: simple, but devastatingly effective. Sometimes, the best things really don't need any embellishment. And unless the \"tea journey\" involves drinking too much at a <a href=\"http://www.motorwayservices.info/\">motorway service station</a> and having to turn off at the next exit for a wee – I think I'll pass.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421641896|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|1f37d3ff4db24ed7d05130b2aa0ef914ed63e0da -->",

        "body":"<p>As Americans in Virginia and New Jersey head to the polls to vote for a governor Tuesday, one has to wonder what will make them mark their ballots for their preferred candidates. One thing is certain: a politician doesn't need to run on substance these days; soundbites will get the job done. If politicians want to curry favor with their base, they should take a leaf from the playbook of Representative Joe Wilson, who interrupted President Obama during a 2009 speech to Congress, shouting, \"You lie!\"</p><p>Decorum? No. Worldwide attention? Yes.</p><p>In New Jersey, a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 700,000 among registered voters, incumbent Governor Chris Christie, a Republican who leads in the polls by a wide margin, spent the last weekend of the campaign touring the state encountering crowds that \"treated him more like a celebrity than a politician\", according to the New York Times. What about his opponent? The Democratic challenger is Senator Barbara Buono; yet it's almost as if she doesn't exist. She needs some soundbites that could be turned into Twitter hashtags.</p><p>Are voters picking winners based on outsize personalities, rather than the substantial issues of the day, such as unemployment? Governor Christie is, both literally and figuratively, an outsized candidate who takes positions that would appear to be to the right of New Jersey's voters. Yet, where does his public personality in the media leave his opponent? In the dust, apparently.</p><p>The middle class in New Jersey has taken a hammering economically, but Christie is hailed as a strong possible presidential candidate for 2016.</p><p>We shouldn't be surprised at larger-than-life, media-savvy candidates being elected to office, as we have only to look at the rise of Corey Booker, the new Democratic Senator for New Jersey and former mayor of Newark. Again, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/nyregion/booker-wins-senate-race-in-new-jersey.html?_r=0\">from the New York Times</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>With a Twitter following six times as large as the city he has led, Mr Booker was known outside Newark largely for his appearances on late-night television and his heroics: rescuing a neighbor from a burning building, shoveling out snowbound cars, living on a food stamp diet.</p></blockquote><p>There was something about a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2432826/Cory-Booker-exchanges-flirtatious-messages-Portland-stripper-Twitter.html\">Twitter relationship with a vegan stripper from my hometown of Portland</a>, Oregon, but I'll let that slide. Although Booker oversaw budget cuts that reduced the size of the Newark police force, which his critics pointed to as a factor in a two-week spree of murders this summer, even Tea Party favorites Rand Paul and Sarah Palin couldn't help his Republican opponent, Steve Lonegan (remember him?), cast a shadow on Booker's media spotlight.</p><p>In Virginia, Democrat Terry McAuliffe is in a tough race for the state's governorship. McAuliffe is a rough-and-tumble political combatant revered for his fundraising abilities. In fact, he is known in Democratic circles as a \"super-funder\". He raised a $34.4m campaign war chest; his Republican opponent, Ken Cuccinelli, raised $19.7m.</p><p>McAuliffe is pals with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and President Obama took to the stump on Sunday to support him. How many watts of star-power does this man need? What will he bring to the state if he gets elected – sleepovers in the governor's mansion?</p><p>The campaign has been rife with negative advertising, mostly from the Democratic side. Cuccinelli is running against Obamacare, while relying on his Tea Party base and the NRA. That's about it on the substance of issues at hand. While McAuliffe has found support from Republican business leaders who expect him to improve the state's business climate, we haven't heard a lot about the Virginia company he ran, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GreenTech_Automotive\">GreenTech</a>.</p><p>Politicking is as old as the hills. What's new is the plethora of media channels: Facebook, Twitter, blogs, cable \"news\" channels and an odd preponderance of journalists who don't ask tough questions of candidates. In an era of soundbites and rapid-fire tweeting, society stands to lose if we are not electing officials to office based on their true, substantive plans for how they will govern and represent the electorate that votes them in. </p><p>In the meantime, we can <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rob-ford-i-m-not-an-alcoholic-i-m-not-a-drug-addict-1.2355543\">look to Toronto's scandal-struck mayor, Rob Ford,</a> to see what substantive plans he brought to that city, and we can discuss whether Michelle Obama should be wearing stiletto heels or flats. It's enough to make one nostalgic for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_(paper)\">the hanging chad</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421656048|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|b57d85437cbb28268ae192b1e990feb73718ff61 -->",

        "headline":"The ultimate guide to US election night 2013",
        "body":"<p>There are many reasons to think that election night 2013 may not be the most exciting of affairs. Even the historic election of the first white mayor in Detroit in 40 years <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-detroit-mayoral-race-20131103,0,5811.story\">is almost a foregone conclusion</a>, with Democrat Mike Duggan up by 25 points. Yet there are also a few reasons that you should pay attention. These three races may not be close, but all can offer lessons.</p><h2>1. Chris Christie and 2016</h2><p>Christie is about to become the first Garden State Republican to win a majority of the vote in a major statewide election since George Bush Sr in 1988. There isn't a longer streak in America of one party not winning at least 50% of the vote in at least one major statewide contest. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/27/chris-christie-appeal-historic-win\">Other statistics bear out</a> how unusual Christie's victory will be.</p><p>As important as the size of Christie's win, is how he's going to get it. A coalition of white people who had been deserting the Democrats in New Jersey and minorities is delivering for Christie. The latter group is especially important for a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/03/18/the-republican-problem-with-hispanic-voters-in-7-charts/\">party whose elders want to reach out</a> to black people and Hispanics. The establishment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/11/rand-paul-2016-gop-presidential-odds\">almost always decides presidential primaries</a>, and after two terms out of the White House, the yearning to win exceeds the thirst for ideological purity.</p><h2>2. Bill de Blasio and crime</h2><p>De Blasio is about to take the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-new-york-city-mayor-lhota-vs-de-blasio\">New York City mayoral election</a> by a margin of at least 40 points. He'll win a higher percentage of the vote for a Big Apple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_mayoral_elections\">non-incumbent mayoral candidate since 1925</a>. When a victory is this wide, you can assign almost any factor as at least partially the cause.</p><p>Let me give one: crime is not the same election issue it once was. Republicans in New York City and candidates nationwide <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayoralty_of_Rudy_Giuliani\">found success</a> in the 1980s and 1990s by promising to crack down on \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/nyregion/catsimatidis-no-friend-of-hoodlums.html?_r=0\">hoodlums</a>\". </p><p>But now, violent and other types of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/07/economist-explains-16\">crime is falling</a>, and issues such as police overreach are as important as the crime the police is trying to prevent. Also, <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/114-de-blasio-with-big-lead-over-lhota-going-into-election-day/\">other issues</a> – like economic inequality – can rise to the top.</p><p>Republicans in urban areas are going to come up with a message that better resonates in a time of safety in order to remain viable.</p><h2>3. Terry McAuliffe and 2014</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421712606'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/6/1354831666301/mcauliffe.jpg' alt='terry mcauliffe' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Importantly for election watchers, Terry McAuliffe will win despite being disliked by most voters. Photograph: Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>McAuliffe, a Democrat, is about to become the first member of the party White House to take the Virginia gubernatorial election since 1975. He's doing so in a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/10/virginia-governor-2014-midterms\"> state that looks a lot</a> like the nation, demographically. Most importantly for election watchers, McAuliffe will win despite being disliked by most voters.</p><p>McAuliffe's success has largely depended on Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli being even more disliked. Sound familiar? It should, because a very similar battle is going on for the 2014 midterms. Democrats are trying to break a stretch of the White House party losing or winning fewer than 10 seats in the House of Representatives – a stretch that dates back to the civil war. They need to take 17 seats to win back the House.</p><p>Right now, Democrats are ahead on the national House ballot by about four points among <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/generic_congressional_vote-2170.html\">likely 2014 voters</a>. As in Virginia, it's all about being less ugly. President Obama's approval rating is bad, but Republican approval ratings are worse. The fact that voters in Virginia are disobeying the longer term election after the presidential race trend should have national Republicans at least somewhat worried.</p><p>If big races and possible long-term implications aren't your thing, there are some other lesser known affairs could keep result-watchers up for much of the night:</p><h2>1. Alabama first district, House Republican primary runoff</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421712607'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383602553748/Bradley-Byrne-Dean-Young-008.jpg' alt='Bradley Byrne, Dean Young' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The fight between Bradley Byrne, left, and Dean Young is an intra-party battle that looks a lot like the Republican party's quarrel nationwide.

Byrne is a fiscal conservative who believes President Obama was born in this country, while Young is a social conservative who thinks President Obama was born in Kenya. It's an intra-party battle that looks a lot like the Republican party's quarrel nationwide. The Guardian's Paul Lewis has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/30/alabama-primary-republican-q-a\">a lot more on the positions of the candidates</a>.</p><p>Bryne had long been thought of as the favorite, and got the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama's_1st_congressional_district_special_election,_2013\">highest percentage of the vote</a> in the initial primary with 35% to Young's 22%. In the runoff, the <a href=\"http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=791752\">latest poll</a> has Young surging to 43% and Byrne stuck at 40%. Polling special primary elections in the south is nearly impossible, though the candidate with the most energized base – probably Young – likely has an edge. Either way, this race is too close to call at this point.</p><h2>2. Boston's mayoral runoff</h2><p>You'd be excused if you couldn't point to <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/09/24/walsh-connolly-must-fight-for-same-ground-distinguish-themselves-between-now-and-november/GGXziuGiMGD8jw2u2mAb7J/story.html\">a single policy difference</a> between Democrats John Connolly and Marty Walsh. The candidates can't seem to disagree, except that Connolly attacks Walsh for being an ex-union official, while Walsh goes after Connolly for being a lawyer. There aren't any gender, race, or religious differences either. It's really a race about personality at this point, and this has led to <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-boston-mayor-connolly-vs-walsh\">one heck of a tight race</a>. </p><p>Walsh won the first round 18% to 17%, though Connolly jumped out to an early edge in the runoff. Walsh has closed the gap and is up by less than one point in the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-boston-mayor-connolly-vs-walsh\">HuffPollster aggregate</a>. The only thing certain in this contest is that for the first time in 20 years Boston will have a mayor whose name isn't Thomas Menino. </p><h2>3. Virginia's attorney general general election</h2><p>The last time the Democratic party won all three elected statewide offices (governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general) in Virginia <a href=\"http://blogs.roanoke.com/politics/2013/10/18/what-are-the-odds-of-a-democratic-sweep/\">was 1989</a>. With governor and lieutenant governor in the bag, Democrats are hoping their standard bearer Mark Herring can emerge victorious against Republican Mark Obenshain. Unlike the other Republican candidates running on the statewide ticket, Obenshain has avoided the Tea Party tarring. </p><p>The result is a race that is far too close to call. Obenshain is up by 0.1pt in the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-virginia-attorney-general-obenshain-vs-herring\">HuffPollster aggregate</a>. If Herring wins, expect Republicans to blame Cuccinelli for dragging down the whole ticket. If Obenshain pulls it off, expect more moderate Republicans to point to him as an example of what can happen when a more mainstream Republican is presented to the public. It's pretty much a lose-lose for the Tea Party.</p><h2>Overall</h2><p>Despite my earlier protestations, there are indeed some interesting stories to unfold on election night 2013. You just have to look hard enough.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421655144|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|cc66bf4cc16824c66a33ca84c7f2f9ec5fb11042 -->",

        "headline":"Conservative Americans are more terrified of sex than violence",
        "body":"<p>If you bothered to listen to the Parents Television Council, you would think that New York's tiny IFC Center was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/01/new-york-cinema-blue-warmest-colour\">evil incarnate</a> when the theatre decided not to enforce the NC-17 rating for the film Blue Is the Warmest Color. The Parents Television Council<a href=\"http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/10/31/blue-is-the-warmest-color-ptc-protest/\"> called the move \"shocking\"</a> and fretted that this meant \"minor children\" would be allowed to view graphic sex scenes (because they'll no doubt be camping on the street to see a three-hour French drama). Though its \"stern warning\" was not widely reported, it may very well have contributed to the film's strong box office results thus far. </p><p>Everyone is entitled to their beliefs, but here's where the fury of the<a href=\"http://w2.parentstv.org/Main/\"> Parents Television Council</a> breaks down: these conservatives are so obsessed with sex, but seemingly care far less about violence. </p><p>While the Council was wailing about the possibility of a teenager seeing a lesbian film, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/shooting-los-angeles-airport-suspect-held\">gunman opened fire at Los Angeles airport</a>, resulting in one death and a number of injuries. That might have been a moment for the PTC, which ranks violence after sex in its list of evils it seeks to regulate on the airwaves, to deplore the shooting and, perhaps, note that there is some credence to the calls for stricter gun control laws (or, at least, less violence on screen and in video games). Real-world violence, however, tends to have little resonance with cultural scolds. It is certainly not worth mentioning when there is cinematic sex to condemn. </p><p>The fact that Blue Is the Warmest Color is even rated NC-17 in the first place makes it yet another entry in the discussion, most recently illuminated by Kirby Dick in his documentary <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493459/\">This Film Is Not Yet Rated</a>, about the hypocrisy and arbitrariness of film ratings, particularly where sex is concerned. </p><p>Sex, female nudity, female enjoyment of sex, and especially female enjoyment of lesbian sex, tend to draw the strictest ratings. Violence, however, is given much more of a pass. Even gory violence will be rated R, whereas a women's sexual pleasure is NC-17. </p><p>What's so scary about sex and the female body? And why is it so much scarier than violence – including violence committed upon the female body? </p><p>Concerns regarding sex over violence are nothing new in western society. Sex was, of course, right up there with forbidden fruit. Perceived as instigated by a woman, it then cast women in later religious thought as particularly carnal, a danger that could invite the devil into society. In the Speculum Maius, an encyclopedia used during the Middle Ages, friar Vincent de Beauvais wrote of women's frivolity, with their \"monstrous headdresses\" and particularly of the \"lascivious and carnal provocation\" of their clothing. Women were the \"devil's decoy\", capable of preventing men from achieving holiness. </p><p>One of the most famous sexual women in the Middle Ages is Chaucer's Wife of Bath, who laments \"Alas, alas, that ever love was sin\". While she is considered an example of healthy sexuality, her tale begins with a violent rape and ends with the rapist escaping punishment to instead enjoy a sexually fulfilling marriage. We never hear what happens to the rape victim, who likely ends up cast out of society. </p><p>Violence was, in fact, justified when aimed at women if they were said to be disobedient. That is, if they asserted some form of independence. While the bulk of victims of the<a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/860378/The_Woman-as-witch_stereotype_in_Early_Modern_England_Continental_Europe_and_New_England\"> early modern witch burnings</a> were likely women past child-bearing age and thus no longer considered sexual, they were also living alone, ungoverned by male dominance. The witch hunts hinted that women who lived outside the social order deserved violent treatment. </p><p>Women's sexuality has been the target of male study, suspicion, and regulation throughout millennia. Aristotelian philosophy classed women more as property, not individuals, and the idea of their having agency was anathema to a healthy society.</p><p>Violence, on the other hand, is a male purview. Men conducted war, carried weapons, meted out punishment. Duels were sanctioned as a means of effecting justice. It's a historical \"boys will be boys\" mentality, justified for its ends. Through violence, one can create empires. Sex just replaces those who were lost along the way.</p><p>Bad enough that women's lustfulness could lean men astray. Far worse when that lustfulness is shared with another woman. </p><p>The first TV show to depict a serious and erotic lesbian relationship, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, used the specter of witchcraft as a conduit of their romantic connection. The censors cracked down on their relationship – whereas Buffy featured frightening, intense violence, and a fair bit of heterosexual sex, the network was quick to tell creator Joss Whedon that it <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&amp;prgDate=09-May-2000\">didn't want to see any kissing between the lesbians</a>. Terrifying violence was solid entertainment, an expression of romantic love between two young women might damage the children. </p><p>If conservative American adults would stop focusing on sex for a moment, they might see that what is really damaging children in the US is an excess of gun violence. The obsession with depictions of cinematic sexuality is a smokescreen for a real discussion of how to protect the most innocent among us.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421644594|2013-11-05T16:06:57Z|3a202ec8334cbd1322af1c0d2bbdafb31af15782 -->",
