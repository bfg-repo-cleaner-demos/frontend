So far the roads are okay, but it’s taking a long time to get anywhere.</p> <p>&nbsp;I talked to a shop owner whose shop was destroyed; he lost everything. He’s wondering how he’s going to feed his five children. I also met a little girl, who was trying to dry out her books.

It is in the lead so it is unlikely that you will have a scenario of every one piling in an uncoordinated way. The challenge is huge but you have a government that is coherent and which works well with donors. President Benigno Aquino is very much present, very engaged.

        "body":"<p>The horror of the Philippines typhoon evokes that of another recent human tragedy, the civil war in Syria. The pictures are similar, fleeing families, stunned, pathetic children. We see people enduring unimaginable privation through no cause of their own. The disasters are different, one natural, the other manmade. Yet we look at them and yearn to be empowered. We long to help.</p><p></p><p>It is very hard to do so. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/23/2004-tsunami-five-years-on\" title=\"\">tsunami that hit Indonesia in 2004</a> and the earthquakes in Pakistan during 2005 and in Haiti during 2010, attracted billions of dollars in aid. In few cases could primitive infrastructures and local governments cope with \"the help tsunami\", as assistance was known. Aid was stolen, regimes were corrupted and priorities distorted. It is said of Haiti that it has recovered from the earthquake but not from the aftermath.</p><p></p><p>In the case of Syria the eagerness for empowerment to help initially took a more specific form, a rush to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/26/syria-us-un-inspection-kerry\" title=\"\">military intervention</a>. Surely a powerful, prosperous and well-intentioned west, some claimed and still claim, could help Syria back to peace and stability, even tolerance. Surely a few weapons sent to the right quarters, a few well-directed missiles, will help that wretched family cowering in the ruins of Aleppo. We just need to get on with it.</p><p></p><p>Good deeds can be no easier to perform than evil ones. The projection of power, including the power to help, is dissipated by distance. Even a country as sophisticated as the United States found it hard to recover from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/hurricane-isaac-new-orleans-levees\" title=\"\">New Orleans floods</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/03/east-coast-remains-storm-oklahoma\" title=\"\">New England tornado</a>. So often help from afar is no more useful than the toys sent to commemorate the dead children of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1966/oct/22/fromthearchive\" title=\"\">Aberfan</a>.</p><p></p><p>The key is to approach faraway disasters, natural or man-made, with humility. The rush to superficial blame – religious sectarianism in Syria, global warming in the Philippines – is the pretence that there is some way out. It is like the response to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/07/bbc-holds-firm-ethiopia-famine-funds\" title=\"\">Ethiopian famines of the 1980s</a>: \"We should have changed the regime.\" Some things are beyond our control.</p><p></p><p>The craving to help is the most benign human instinct. It cannot be suppressed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/10/help-typhoon-haiyan-relief-effort\" title=\"\">Frontline relief through the Red Cross and United Nations</a> is vastly better organised today. All we can do is to support those organisations in making help more efficient.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422180204|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|3055d213e6736005471e40085b66719c6a6bf593 -->",

        "body":"<p>Hitting the Philippines with winds of 195mph, typhoon Haiyan has been described as the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in recorded history. </p><p>The category five storm - which has also been called Yolanda in the Philippines - is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/typhoon-haiyan-batters-philippines\">reported to have had speeds at landfall of 195mph and gusts of up to 235mph</a>, meaning that it is believed to be stronger than the world's last strongest tropical cyclone, hurricane Camille, which was recorded as making landfall in Mississippi with 190 mph winds in 1969. The Guardian's south-east Asia correspondent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-hodal\">Kate Hodal, </a>writes today:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Thousands of people have been evacuated and thousands more have fled their homes as the category five storm sent waves as high as 5m (15ft) ashore on the islands of Leyte and Samar in the central Philippines, overturning powerlines and leaving streets knee-deep in water</p></blockquote><h2>Typhoon, hurricane or cyclone?</h2><p>If the usage of the terms hurricane, typhoon and cyclone are getting you in a bit of a mix, don't worry. According to the <a href=\"http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/cyclone.html\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (Noaa) these are simply different names for the same weather phenomenon. The term 'hurricane' is used in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, 'typhoon' is used in the Northwest Pacific and 'cyclones' are the term to use in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422136753'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/8/1383920456272/Typhoon-Haiyan-graphic-008.jpg' alt='Typhoon Haiyan graphic' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Graphic showing route of typhoon Haiyan. By Guardian graphics</figcaption></figure><p>You might also have seen Haiyan referred to as a super-typhoon. The Nooa can also clear this one up, according to the <a href=\"http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A3.html\">definition on their website</a> a super-typhoon is</p><blockquote><p>A term utilised by the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center for typhoons that reach maximum sustained 1-minute surface winds of at least 65 m/s (130 kt, 150 mph). This is the equivalent of a strong Saffir-Simpson category 4 or category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin or a category 5 severe tropical cyclone in the Australian basin.</p></blockquote><p>The Noaa also explain that there are several ways in which a <a href=\"http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E1.html\">tropical cyclone's intensity can be measured</a>; either central pressure or highest measured wind speed. But measuring such high winds can be tricky as the Noaa note \"measurements of such winds are inherently going to be suspect as instruments often are completely destroyed or damaged at these speeds.\"</p><h2>How does typhoon Haiyan compare?</h2><p>Dr Jeff Masters, meteorologist and co-founder of the Weather Underground has attempted to <a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2573\">answer just this question</a>. Haiyan which came ashore at 4:40 am local time has been reported as making landfall at 195mph. Masters explains how the reported wind speed has been calculated:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Three hours before landfall, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed Haiyan's sustained winds at 195 mph, gusting to 235 mph, making it the 4th strongest tropical cyclone in world history. Satellite loops show that Haiyan weakened only slightly, if at all, in the two hours after JTWC's advisory, so the super typhoon likely made landfall with winds near 195 mph. </p><p>The next JTWC intensity estimate, for 00Z UTC November 8, about three hours after landfall, put the top winds at 185 mph. Averaging together these estimates gives a strength of 190 mph an hour after landfall. Thus, Haiyan had winds of 190 - 195 mph at landfall, making it the strongest tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in world history. </p></blockquote><p>As Masters explains, Haiyan although the strongest tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in world history, it is actually the fourth strongest tropical cyclone in history. We've put the list of official strongest cyclones in world history that Master cites into the table below:</p><table>\n      <caption>\n            The strongest tropical cyclones in world history\n          </caption>\n      <thead>\n        <tr><th class=\"bold left\">Super Typhoon</th><th class=\"bold left\">Year</th><th class=\"bold left\">Winds, mph</th><th class=\"bold left\">mb</th><th class=\"bold left\">Landfall?</th></tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr><td class=\"left\">Nancy </td><td class=\"left\">1961 </td><td class=\"left\">215 </td><td class=\"left\">882 </td><td class=\"left\">Made landfall as a Cat 2 in Japan, killing 191 people </td></tr><tr><td class=\"left\">Violet </td><td class=\"left\">1961 </td><td class=\"left\">205 </td><td class=\"left\">886 </td><td class=\"left\">Made landfall in Japan as a tropical storm, killing 2 people </td></tr><tr><td class=\"left\">Ida </td><td class=\"left\">1958 </td><td class=\"left\">200 </td><td class=\"left\">877 </td><td class=\"left\">Made landfall as a Cat 1 in Japan, killing 1269 people </td></tr><tr><td class=\"bold left\">Haiyan </td><td class=\"bold left\">2013 </td><td class=\"bold left\">195 </td><td class=\"bold left\">895 </td><td class=\"bold left\">Made landfall in the Philippines at peak strength. </td></tr><tr><td class=\"left\">Kit </td><td class=\"left\">1966 </td><td class=\"left\">195 </td><td class=\"left\">880 </td><td class=\"left\">Did not make landfall. </td></tr><tr><td class=\"left\">Sally </td><td class=\"left\">1964 </td><td class=\"left\">195 </td><td class=\"left\">895 </td><td class=\"left\"> Made landfall as a Cat 4 in the Philippines. </td></tr>\n      </tbody>\n      <xml:group/>\n      </table><p>An important thing to note though is that the<a href=\"http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E1.html\"> Noaa have stated</a> that the maximum sustained winds estimated for typhoons during the 1940s to 1960s were too strong. </p><h2>What does this mean for the Philippines?</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/typhoon-haiyan-hits-philippines\">latest report</a> from our south-east Asia correspondent at least three people have been killed and another seven injured as typhoon Haiyan made its way across the Philippines, whilst hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated and thousands more have fled their homes.</p><p>The Google map above shows the path of typhoon Haiyan.

        "headline":"Typhoon Haiyan won't keep us Filipinos down for long",
        "body":"<p>Sitting on the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is no stranger to natural disasters. Filipinos (or Pinoys as we're called in the Philippines), however, are a resilient people. Watching the news I heard that there was no clean water, no food and no electricity. What most people don't realise, though, is that this is the norm for the majority of the country.</p><p>Most Filipinos are accustomed to hardship. With 98 million people vying for space and resources, surviving is part of the daily struggle. However, with thousands dead and millions displaced from their homes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/10/typhoon-haiyan-thousands-dead-philippines\" title=\"\">Typhoon Haiyan</a> has left us more vulnerable than ever.</p><p>The Philippines experiences around 20 typhoons and natural-related disasters a year, with another one to hit early next week, and another four due before the end of the year. Filipinos call them <em>bagyo</em>. I've experienced my fair share of them. Many of the TV<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/nov/10/philippines-typhoon-haiyan-survivors-in-pictures\" title=\"\"> images</a> showed people wading through shoulder-deep water, braving strong winds, trying to get by. I remember being eight or nine years old, travelling through Antipolo and being carried across a swell, rain battering the nearby houses, and men slowly trying to drive their jeeps through. Despite the amount of risk involved, they took it on the chin and kept going.</p><p>In 2006 the Philippines experienced in effect a civil war in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao, the country's southernmost island. A Muslim rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and civilian volunteers clashed after the group was accused of bombing the provincial governor's motorcade.</p><p>Despite a ceasefire being agreed, 4,000 families were displaced by the fighting. A year later, the conflict hit world news after marines were beheaded while searching for a kidnapped Italian priest. The priest was later released. The conflict, though, shook the country – but, despite underlying tensions between Muslims and Christians, the people managed to overlook their differences and a peace deal was reached last year.</p><p>As if the recovery from Haiyan is not difficult enough, Filipinos are still struggling after the earthquake in Bohol last month, which had a magnitude of 7.2. With the destruction of centuries-old churches, more than 200 people dead, and many more left homeless, one could not be blamed for assuming that the Philippines has been especially unlucky this year.</p><p>But we are an optimistic nation. One asset Filipinos have is that they are a people of faith. Their belief in God is what keeps them going through the hardest of times. They are also incredibly generous and giving, as Prince Philip reminded us all when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/20/prince-philip-nhs-nurse-filipino\" title=\"\">he met a Filipino nurse</a> at Luton hospital. It is both this belief in something greater, and our inherent ability to give ourselves to a cause worth fighting for, that will also see us through this disaster.</p><p>This weekend I had a Skype conversation with my aunt who lives in the capital, Manila. She told me that although many people were warned about Typhoon Haiyan well in advance, our extensive experience of typhoons meant that the warnings were not always taken seriously.</p><p>In the Philippines, most homes have been built by the people who live in them. Many occupants chose to stay with the buildings that they have invested so much effort in: even with the threat of death, home is considered the safest place.</p><p>A friend I spoke to who lives in the Leyte area said that the number of people confirmed dead had reached 500. With so many bodies, a mass grave has been dug. My father lives close to Leyte in Samar province, which is one of the hardest-hit areas. I've tried to contact him but am yet to hear anything. Like many others who have family in that region, the recovery process is proving to be long and hard.</p><p>But such a tragedy is not enough to keep us down. Filipinos are used to hardship, and for those who have survived this terrible disaster they will stand up and come back fighting– although it may be difficult – with the resilience that has always shaped us.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422128769|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|93c0571826ef58e1eb033fac18a61a644284265b -->",

        "body":"<p>I met <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/dec/06/philippines-delegator-tears-climate-change\" title=\"\">Naderev Saño</a> last year in Doha, when the world's governments were meeting for the annual UN climate talks. The chief negotiator of the Filipino delegation was distraught. Typhoon Bopha, a category five \"super-typhoon\" with 175mph winds (282km/h) had just ripped through the island of Mindanao. It was the 16th major storm of the year, hundreds of thousands of people had lost their homes and more than 1,000 had died. Saño and his team knew well the places where it had hit the hardest.</p><p>\"Each destructive typhoon season costs us 2% of our GDP, and the reconstruction costs a further 2%, which means we lose nearly 5% of our economy every year to storms. We have received no climate finance to adapt or to prepare ourselves for typhoons and other extreme weather we are now experiencing. We have not seen any money from the rich countries to help us to adapt ... We cannot go on like this. It cannot be a way of life that we end up running always from storms,\" he said. He later told the assembly: \"Climate change negotiations cannot be based on the way we currently measure progress. It is a clear sign of planetary and economic and environmental dysfunction ... The whole world, especially developing countries struggling to address poverty and achieve social and human development, confronts these same realities.</p><p>\"I speak on behalf of 100 million Filipinos, not as a leader of my delegation, but as a Filipino …\" At this point he broke down.</p><p>Saño was uncontactable today, because phone lines to Manila were down, but he was thought to be on his way to Warsaw for the UN talks, which resume on Monday. This time, with uncanny timing, his country has been battered by the even stronger super-typhoon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/typhoon-haiyan-batters-philippines\" title=\"\">Haiyan</a>, one of the most powerful ever recorded anywhere – 25 miles (40km) wide and reaching astonishing speeds of possibly 200mph (322km/h).</p><p>We don't yet know the death toll or damage done, but we do know that the strength of tropical storms such as Haiyan or Bopha is linked to sea temperature. As the oceans warm with climate change, there is extra energy in the system. Storms may not be increasing in frequency but Pacific ocean waters are warming faster than expected, and there is a broad scientific consensus that typhoons are now increasing in strength.</p><p>Typhoon Haiyan, like Bopha, will be seen widely in developing countries as a taste of what is to come, along with rising sea levels and water shortages. But what alarms the governments of vulnerable countries the most is that they believe rich countries have lost the political will to address climate change at the speed needed to avoid catastrophic change in years to come.</p><p>From being top of the global political agenda just four years ago, climate change is now barely mentioned by the political elites in London or Washington, Tokyo or Paris. Australia is not even sending a junior minister to Warsaw. The host, Poland, will be using the meeting to celebrate its coal industry. The pitifully small pledges of money made by rich countries to help countries such as the Philippines or Bangladesh to adapt to climate change have barely materialised. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://blueandgreentomorrow.com/2013/11/07/report-calls-for-incentives-to-change-after-fossil-fuels-received-500bn-of-subsidies-in-2011/\" title=\"\">fossil fuel subsidies are running at more than $500bn (£311bn) a year</a>, and vested commercial interests are increasingly influencing the&nbsp;talks.</p><p>As the magnitude of the adverse impacts of human-induced climate change becomes apparent, the most vulnerable countries say they have no option but to go it alone. The good news is that places such as Bangladesh, Nepal, the small island states of the Pacific and Caribbean, and many African nations, are all starting to adapt their farming, fishing and cities.</p><p>But coping with major storms, as well as sea level rise and water shortages, is expected to cost poor countriues trillions of dollars, which they do not have. \"Time is running out,\" Saño told the world last year. \"Please, let this year be remembered as the year the world found the courage to take responsibility for the future we want. I ask of all of us here, if not us, then who? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_Not_Now,_When%3F_%28novel%29\" title=\"\">If not now, then when?</a> If not here, then where?\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422013268|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|5d80accce438ddd6b140ea6a733b3c6a29a48732 -->",

        "body":"<p>When super-typhoon Bopha struck without warning before dawn, flattening the walls of their home, Maria Amparo Jenobiagon, her two daughters and her grandchildren ran for their lives.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/04/philippines-typhoon-people-evacuate-homes\" title=\"\">storm on 4 December was the worst ever to hit the southern Philippines</a>: torrential rain turned New Bataan's river into a raging flood. Roads were washed away and the bridge turned into an enormous dam. Tens of thousands of coconut trees crashed down in an instant as unbelievably powerful winds struck. The banana crop was destroyed in a flash – and with it the livelihoods of hundreds of farmers.</p><p>The only safe place the family could think of was the concrete grandstand at the village sports stadium. Two months later, Jenobiagon, 36, and her three-year-old granddaughter, Mary Aieshe, are still there, living in one of the improvised tents spanning its steep concrete tiers along with hundreds of other people.</p><p>\"We were terrified. All we could hear was loud crashing. We didn't know what to do. So we came here,\" Jenobiagon said. \"Everyone ran to the health centre but houses were being swept away and the water was neck deep. Everywhere we went was full of mud and water. We went to a school but it was flooded, so we came to the stadium.\"</p><p>Lorenzo Balbin, the mayor of New Bataan, said the fury of the storm was far beyond the experience of anyone living in Mindanao. It would take 10 years to replace the coconut crop, he said. Some villages in Compostela Valley may be too unsafe to live in.</p><p>Bopha, known locally as Pablo, broke records as well as hearts. At its height, it produced wind speeds of 160mph, gusting to 195mph. It was the world's deadliest typhoon in 2012, killing 1,067 people, with 800 left missing. More than 6.2 million people were affected; the cost of the damage may top $1bn. As a category 5 storm (the highest), Bopha was <a href=\"http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/03/12/pablo-category-5-supertyphoon-us-scientists\" title=\"\">significantly more powerful</a> than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hurricanekatrina\" title=\"\">hurricane Katrina</a> (category 3), which hit the US in 2005, and last year's heavily publicised <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">hurricane Sandy</a> (category 2).</p><p>With an estimated 216,000 houses destroyed or damaged, tens of thousands of people remain displaced, presenting a challenge for the government and aid agencies.</p><p>The lack of international media coverage of Bopha may in part be explained – though not excused – by western-centric news values, and in part by the high incidence of storms in the Pacific region.</p><p>The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year (including three super-typhoons) plus numerous incidents of flooding, drought, earthquakes and tremors and occasional volcanic eruptions, making it one of the most naturally disaster-prone countries in the world.</p><p></p><p>But more disturbing than Bopha's size was the fact that it appeared to reflect rapidly deteriorating climatic trends.</p><p>The five most devastating typhoons recorded in the Philippines have occurred since 1990, affecting 23 million people. Four of the costliest typhoons anywhere occurred in same period, according to an <a href=\"http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/weathering-the-crises-feeding-the-future-philippine-food-justice-report-146554\" title=\"\">Oxfam report</a>. What is more, Bopha hit an area where typhoons are all but unknown.</p><p>The inter-governmental panel on climate change says mean temperatures in the Philippines are rising by 0.14C per decade. Since the 1980s, there has been an increase in annual mean rainfall. Yet two of the severest droughts ever recorded occurred in 1991-92 and 1997-98.</p><p>Scientists are also registering steadily rising sea levels around the Philippines, and a falling water table. All this appears to increase the likelihood and incidence of extreme weather events while adversely affecting food production and yields through land erosion and degradation, analysts say.</p><p>Mary Ann Lucille Sering, head of the Philippine government's climate change commission, is in no doubt her country faces a deepening crisis that it can ill afford, financially and in human terms. Typhoon-related costs in 2009, the year the commission was created, amounted to 2.9% of GDP, she said, and have been rising each year since then.</p><p>\"Extreme weather is becoming more frequent, you could even call it the new normal,\" Sering said. \"Last year one typhoon [Bopha] hurt us very much. If this continues we are looking at a big drain on resources.\" Human activity-related \"slow onset impacts\" included over-fishing, over-dependence on certain crops, over-extraction of ground water, and an expanding population (the Philippines has about 95 million people and a median age of 23).</p><p>\"Altogether this could eventually lead to disaster,\" Sering said. Unlike countries such as Britain, where changing weather has a marginal impact on most people's lives, climate change in the Philippines was \"like a war\". Opinion surveys showed that Filipinos rated global warming as a bigger threat than rising food and fuel prices, she said.</p><p>Even given this level of awareness, Bopha presented an enormous test for emergency services. Oxfam workers in Davao City, working with the UN, local NGO partners, and the government's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), quickly moved to the area to offer assistance. Oxfam has committed $2m in Bopha relief funds on top of its annual $4m Philippines budget. But the UN-co-ordinated Bopha Action Plan, which set an emergency funding target of $76m, has received only $27m so far.</p><p>The overall post-Bopha response has comprised three phases: immediate help, including the provision of shelter and clean water, sanitation and hygiene facilities; rebuilding and relocation; and mitigation and prevention measures.</p><p>\"The first thing was to provide water bladders to the evacuation centre in New Bataan. We concentrated on providing emergency toilets and water systems,\" said Kevin Lee, response manager for the Humanitarian Response Consortium, a group of five local NGOs. \"We had a 15-strong team from Oxfam and the HRC, digging holes and putting in plastic pipes. Next we started looking at emergency food and shelter.</p><p>\"The devastation was worse than anything I have ever seen. Up to 90% of the coconut trees were just flattened. That's the local economy on the ground. And that's really difficult to fix quickly,\" Lee said. But his team's swift action had positive results, he added. There have been no water-borne diseases in New Bataan and no outbreak of cholera.</p><p>The consortium has now moved on to longer-term projects such as building a waste management plant, setting up markets at relocation sites, and working on disaster risk reduction programmes, so that when the next typhoon hits, local people may be better prepared.</p><p>The Lumbia resettlement project outside Cagayan de Oro, in northern Mindanao, provides an example of what can be achieved. Here, victims of tropical storm Washi, which swept through the area in 2011, killing 1,200 people and causing nearly $50m in damage, have been offered newly-built homes on land owned by the local university.</p><p>The Lumbia project's slogan is \"build a community, not just homes\", and it has gone down well with displaced villagers. \"It's better here than before. It's more elevated, we don't have to worry about floods,\" said Alexie Colibano, a Lumbia resident. \"Before we were living on an island in the river. Now we feel more secure.\"</p><p>About 15,000 Bopha victims remain in evacuation centres, including in the New Bataan stadium grandstand. In total, about 200,000 are still living with friends or relatives.</p><p>In Manila, meanwhile, Benito Ramos, the outgoing executive director of the NDRRMC, is busy planning for the next super-typhoon. \"We are preparing for a national summit this month on how to prepare, including early warning, building codes, land use regulations, geo-hazard mapping, relocation and livelihoods,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>But the bigger issue is climate change, which posed an \"existential threat\" to the Philippines, Ramos said. \"We are mainstreaming climate change in all government departments and policies. If we don't adapt and adjust, we all agree we are heading for disaster.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/403734118|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|a06fc801fdb5de82a9548947a10ee21bc7471148 -->",

Five people also died in landslides in two other towns in Zambales, according to army officials and police.</p><p>Rescuers used their hands, pots and shovels to dig through the muck that buried a cluster of houses, while relatives of two other missing residents waited in the rain in the village of Wawandue.</p><p>\"This is the first after a long time that we were hit by this kind of deluge,\" Khonghun told Manila's DZBB radio network. He had to stop the interview when another body was pulled out from the mud near him.</p><p>Typhoon Usagi enhanced the torrential monsoon rains that drenched the main northern Philippine region of Luzon over the weekend. The powerful typhoon blew away late on Saturday and a new tropical storm off southern Japan was continuing to intensify the downpours in Luzon, government forecaster Samuel Duran said.</p><p>Many low-lying areas of the Philippine capital, Manila, and outlying regions were swamped on Monday, prompting authorities to close schools and offices.</p><p>In Hong Kong flight schedules were returning to normal on Monday after major disruptions caused by Usagi, which was the season's strongest storm. At its peak it forced about 250 flight cancellations in Hong Kong, before weakening to a tropical depression over the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.</p><p>Train and airline services around Guangdong had returned to normal after the storm, China's state broadcaster CCTV said.</p><p>China's national weather centre said the storm would continue to weaken as it moves north-west.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418031832|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|ca2d30f7162045294536eee6f421736bea478e86 -->",

        "body":"<p>Super Typhoon Haiyan is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/07/world/asia/philippines-typhoon-haiyan/\">bearing down</a>&nbsp;on the Central Philippines.&nbsp;</p> <p>You don't need to be a meteorologist to understand that you don't want to be anywhere near this thing. Just look at that <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115518/super-typhoon-haiyan-among-strongest-ever\">satellite photo</a>. It looks just like Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>By the time it hits the Eastern Visayas, Haiyan will have maximum sustained winds of 149mph. How fast is that?</p> <p>Well, 149mph is 24mph faster than&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina\">Hurricane Katrina</a>&nbsp;was when it made landfall. It would be an incredibly strong hurricane &ndash; four on the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale\">&nbsp;Saffir-Simpson&nbsp;</a>hurricane wind scale. There is no difference between a hurricane and a typhoon, except for the region in which they originate. Only a few hurricanes in United States history had&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew\">stronger winds at landfall</a>: Andrew, Camille and Charley come to mind immediately. All of these were devastating to the areas affected.&nbsp;</p> <p>The winds reflect the strength of a storm that is rarely seen. It's central pressure is somewhere south of 900mb at the current time. There are only four other storms over the past 20 years in the western Pacific with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/11/07/super-typhoon-haiyan-closes-in-on-philippines-among-strongest-storms-ever/\">a lower pressure</a>. Though we don't have the tools to measure the exact pressure of storms in the western Pacific, Haiyan is at least within the top 20 of all time. Katrina had a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115518/super-typhoon-haiyan-among-strongest-ever\">pressure of 902mb</a>, which is the all-time record for a US hurricane.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet it's not just the pressure or the wind. We will be looking at somewhere between eight and 12 inches of rain,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/super-typhoon-haiyan-a-serious/19561621\">across a wide area</a>. That would be well within the<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/7568-greatest-hurricanes.htm\">&nbsp;top echelon for hurricanes</a>&nbsp;in the United States. Flood warnings are regularly issued for rain amounts an eighth to a twelfth as much. With additional rain from other storm systems, multiple mudslides are a good possibility.&nbsp;</p> <p>Haiyan is going to be historic in many ways. The winds, which will likely drop by landfall, are now 195mph. This may be the strongest such winds since we started using satellites to measure storm strength. Nate Cohn of the New Republic said he has<a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115518/super-typhoon-haiyan-among-strongest-ever\">&nbsp;never seen anything like Haiyan</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course, it's easy to get lost in the meteorology of the storm.&nbsp;</p> <p>What this storm is about, at the end of the day, is how many people will be affected. Indeed, it is the wide area of the storm that makes one most worried. The storm is 500 miles wide. That's wider than Katrina was at its peak. It's affecting more than 25 million people. That's more people than live in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area\">New York City metropolitan area,&nbsp;</a>which was affected by Hurricane Sandy last year.&nbsp;</p> <p>This storm is incredibly dangerous. We can only hope the storm turns out to be less severe than forecasted. Otherwise, I fear the news from the Central Philippines in the days ahead.&nbsp;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421967489|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|8459c878903692f113660a5d33a5cad993d05d43 -->",

        "body":"<p>When typhoon Haiyan - known in the Philippines as Yolanda - pounded into the islands of Samar and Leyte at 4.40am after picking up speed on a 900-mile track across the Pacific,  the <a href=\"http://www.usno.navy.mil/JTWC/\" title=\"\">US navy's warning centre, JTWC,</a> in Honolulu, calculated its winds to be gusting at up to 235mph (380kph).</p><p>This would make it the fourth most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded and possibly the strongest to have ever hit land. By comparison, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Jude_storm\" title=\"\">St Jude, the storm</a> that hit in southern England last month, had winds gusting to 99mph.</p><p>As Filipino communities calculated the flood and wind damage done in the 25-mile-wide path of the storm, meteorologists questioned claims that Haiyan was the strongest ever to make landfall. \"All we can say at this stage is maybe. The estimates of wind strength and central pressure are just that – estimates – albeit from well-attested satellite techniques developed over decades. Without ground observations right in the centre of the track we can never be totally sure,\" said Julian Heming, tropical prediction scientist at the Met Office.</p><p>Haiyan is the third Category 5 \"super typhoon\" to hit the Philippines since 2010. \"In 2010 Megi peaked at 180mph winds but killed only 35 people, and did $276m in damage. But Bopha, which hit the southern Philippine island of Mindanao on 3 December, 2012 , left 1,901 people dead and was the costliest natural disaster in Philippines history at the time,\" said <a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2573\" title=\"\">Jeff Masters, director of meteorology at US-based Weather Underground in his daily blog.</a></p><p>According to the Philippine government, the area's typhoons have been getting stronger. \"Menacingly, the Filipino typhoons are getting stronger and stronger, especially since the 90s,\" said Romulo Virola, head of the <a href=\"http://www.nscb.gov.ph/headlines/StatsSpeak/2008/081408_rav_typhoons.asp\" title=\"\">government's national statistics board.</a> \"From 1947 to 1960, the strongest typhoon to hit us was Amy in December 1951 with a highest wind speed recorded at 240kph in Cebu. From 1961 to 1980, Sening was the record holder with a highest wind speed of 275kph in October 1970. During the next 20 years, the highest wind speed was recorded by Anding and Rosing at 260kph. In the current millennium, the highest wind speed has soared to 320kph recorded by Reming in Nov-Dec 2006. If this is due to climate change, we better be prepared for even stronger ones in the future.\"</p><p>The steady warming of the oceans is likely to lead to fewer but stronger tropical typhoons, said scientists from the intergovernmental panel on climate change in a special report on climate extremes this year. \"The average tropical cyclone maximum wind speed is likely to increase, but the global frequency of tropical cyclones is likely to decrease or remain unchanged,\" it said.</p><p>A record seven typhoons developed across the west Pacific during October, beating beat the previous record of six in 1989. Nearly one-third of the world's tropical storms form within the western Pacific and many track due west to the Philippines archipelago, the first major landmass they meet. In a normal season, only three or four typhoons develop.</p><p>Other regions are also experiencing some of their strongest storms in years. Last month, cyclone Phailin, which gusted at up to 160mph (260kph) forced 500,000 people in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states, India, to flee their homes. The Atlantic hurricane season has been one of the quietest on record in 2013 but in September hurricane Manuel was one of the worst in Mexico's history, causing $4bn worth of damage.</p><p>Earlier this year the <a href=\"http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/Advisories-RSMCs.html\" title=\"\">World Meteorological Organisation</a> calculated that tropical cyclones had killed nearly 170,000 people in 2000-2010, and affected more than 250 million, causing economic damage of $380bn.</p><p>After roaring across the Philippines, typhoon Haiyan is expected to move into the South China Sea and eventually hit Vietnam and Laos. \"Once Haiyan exits into the South China Sea, it will steadily decay, due to colder waters and higher wind shear. However, it will still be a formidable Category 1 or 2 typhoon when it hits Vietnam and Laos, and I expect that the 12 or more inches of rain that the storm will dump on those nations will make it a top-five most expensive natural disaster in their history,\" said Masters.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422049656|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|600067d553ebff05a8d363e57ca0eb5853914ea6 -->",

Experts predicted \"catastrophic damage\" as a result of the super-typhoon, whose speeds at landfall of 195mph and gusts of up to 235mph were faster than the previous strongest tropical cyclone, Hurricane Camille, which was recorded in the US at 190mph in 1969.</p><p>Official reports indicated that two people had been killed after being struck by power lines, another by lightning and possibly one more by a falling tree.</p><p>But the final toll is expected to climb much higher as so many affected areas were cut off, said Mathias Eick, of the European commission's humanitarian aid department (Echo) in Manila.</p><p>\"In our previous experience with similar storms, because the Philippines are comprised of many islands and many isolated communities, often the statistics show a very low human toll [at first] but then within 24 or 48 hours the numbers just take off,\" he added. \"We're talking about a storm where two-thirds of the whole area of the Philippines was directly affected – not entirely by the eye of the storm but by a very large area – and with many isolated communities on smaller islands or living in mountainous areas, it takes some time for the authorities, Red Cross and volunteers to collate the information.\"</p><p>About 12 airports were closed – including those in the tourist islands of Palawan and Boracay – and schools and offices shut, with roughly 1 million people in shelters scattered around 29 provinces.</p><p>Haiyan – the Philippines' 25th typhoon this year – has put an estimated 12 million people at risk and as of 10pm local time was still pummelling the country with sustained winds of 120mph and gusts of 143mph, with the eye of the storm located 20 miles west of Coron, Palawan, <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/nation/special-coverage/weather-alert/43229-20131108-yolanda-5pm-update\" title=\"\">according to local media</a>.</p><p>\"There aren't too many buildings constructed that can withstand that kind of wind,\" <a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2574\" title=\"\">said meteorologist Jeff Masters</a>. \"There are very few storms that have stayed at category 5 strength for so long.\"</p><p>The 370-mile-wide storm, which is called Yolanda in the Philippines, cut power to entire provinces, ripped iron roofs off buildings and threw trees across roads. Certain areas, such as Tacloban City and Cadiz, were particularly badly hit.</p><p>\"We've been hearing from my colleagues in [the city of] Tacloban that they've seen galvanised iron sheets flying just like kites,\" Mai Zamora, of the charity World Vision, told the BBC. \"It's actually all around the roads now. The roads are flooded in Tacloban.\"</p><p>Camera-phone videos uploaded to YouTube and Twitter showed streets reduced to rivers full of debris, trees bent horizontal or fully uprooted and huge waves crashing against slums located along riverways.</p><p>The damage to infrastructure, agriculture and livestock, electricity, water supplies, shipping routes and harbours all across the Philippines could be huge, said Eick. The World Food Programme expects that at least 2.5 million people will require food assistance.</p><p>On Bohol island, where a 7.3-magnitude earthquake last month toppled colonial churches and killed 200 people, residents waited out the typhoon in the dark, without power or water supplies, said Jackie Pinat of the Catholic aid agency Cafod.</p><p>\"Many people on the island lost their homes in the earthquake, and many structures are unsafe,\" she said. \"Most people in the coastal villages around Maribojoc are still in designated evacuation centres.\"</p><p>In 2012 Typhoon Bopha destroyed much of the southern islands, killing about 1,100 people and causing more than $1bn (£625m) damage.</p><p>Experts say that the sheer velocity of Haiyan may help limit the severity of damage, as a tremendous effort from the Philippines' emergency response included early evacuations and operational supplies: President Benigno Aquino III assigned three cargo planes, 20 navy ships and 32 military planes and helicopters for rescue operations and to provide relief. \"No typhoon can bring Filipinos to their knees if we'll be united,\" he said in a televised address.</p><p>However, the typhoon's resulting storm surge could still cause extensive damage.</p><p>After 48 hours as a category 5 storm, Haiyan was downgraded to a category 4 and is expected to leave the Philippines early on Saturday. It will move towards the warm waters of the South China Sea and could make landfall in central Vietnam late .</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422043952|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|ec3257d7a089f0f9d0be2ce4f630236eb9fabb00 -->",

        "body":"<p>At least 100 people have died in the Philippines from the impact of super typhoon Haiyan, a senior government official said on Saturday.</p> <p>Many bodies were lying in the streets of the central city of Tacloban, according to reports received by Captain John Andrews, deputy director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.</p> <p>Andrews told the Associated Press the &quot;reliable&quot; information about the deaths was relayed to him by his staff in Tacloban, but communications with the capital Manila were only possible every few hours.</p> <p>Officials said most of the houses in Tacloban, a city of about 220,000 people, had been destroyed in a surge of flood water and high winds, according to Reuters.</p> <p>Before communications were cut on Friday, city officials had reported heavy flooding. Mobile phone networks, power lines and trees were toppled and most roads were cut off.</p> <p>&quot;Almost all houses were destroyed, many are totally damaged. Only a few are left standing, but with partial damage,&quot; said Major Rey Balido, a spokesman for the national disaster agency.</p> <p>Cabinet secretary Rene Almendras, a senior aide to President Benigno Aquino, said that the number of casualties could not be immediately determined, but that the figure was &quot;probably in that range&quot; given by Andrews. Government troops were helping recover bodies, he said.</p> <p>US marine Colonel Mike Wylie, who surveyed the situation in Tacloban in preparation for possible American assistance, said the damage to the runway at the seaside air terminal was significant, but military planes were still able to land with relief aid.</p> <p>&quot;The storm surge came in fairly high and there is significant structural damage and trees blown over,&quot; he told the AP.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-58f57781-55f0-45a8-b722-db874e7dc10a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/9/1383979889615/e70ef64c-3bd5-4b34-8c91-f0b187227ecb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Vehicles piled up in a flooded street in Tacloban.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Vehicles piled up in a flooded street in Tacloban. Photograph: Reuters TV</figcaption> </figure> <p>The Philippine television station GMA reported its news team saw 11 bodies, including that of a child, washed ashore on Friday and 20 more bodies at a pier in Tacloban hours after the typhoon ripped through the coastal city.</p> <p>At least 20 more bodies were taken to a church in nearby Palo town that was used as an evacuation centre but had to be abandoned when its roofs were blown away, the TV network reported. TV images showed howling winds peeling off tin roof sheets during heavy rain.</p> <p>Ferocious winds felled large branches and snapped coconut trees. A man was shown carrying the body of his six-year-old daughter, who drowned, and another image showed vehicles piled up in debris.</p> <p>Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever to hit land, was leaving the Philippines behind on Saturday, having flattened houses, triggered landslides and floods and knocked out power and communications across a number of islands. More than 750,000 people were forced to flee their homes.</p> <p>The toll of death and damage is expected to rise sharply as rescue workers and soldiers reach areas cut off by the massive, fast-moving storm, now heading towards Vietnam.</p> <p>Authorities in 15 provinces in Vietnam started to call back boats and prepare for possible landslides. Nearly 300,000 people were moved to safer areas in two provinces alone – Da Nang and Quang Nam – according to the government's website.</p> <p>Forecasters said the storm was expected to pick up renewed strength over the South China Sea.</p> <p>There were hopes the Philippines had avoided a worse disaster because the rapidly moving typhoon blew away before wreaking more damage, officials said.</p> <p>But because communications were severed, it was impossible to know the full extent of casualties and damage. </p> <p>Southern Leyte governor Roger Mercado said the typhoon ripped roofs off houses and triggered landslides that blocked roads. The dense clouds and heavy rains made the day seem almost as dark as night, he said.</p> <p>&quot;When you're faced with such a scenario, you can only pray and pray and pray,&quot; Mercado told the Associated Press by telephone. He said mayors in the province had not called in to report any major damage.</p> <p>&quot;I hope that means they were spared and not the other way around,&quot; he said. &quot;My worst fear is there will be massive loss of lives and property.&quot;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3bdb4051-c91e-49f1-b272-6216aae216d8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/9/1383980099226/cdf061ff-9b34-4c4e-8e9e-b89dbf19b874-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"People trapped in a house by floodwaters in Mindoro\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>People trapped in a house by floodwaters in Mindoro. Photograph: AP</figcaption> </figure> <p>Eduardo del Rosario, head of the disaster response agency, said the speed at which the typhoon sliced through the central islands helped prevent its 375-mile band of rain clouds dumping enough of their load to overflow waterways. Flooding from heavy rains is often the main cause of deaths from typhoons.</p> <p>&quot;It has helped that the typhoon blew very fast in terms of preventing lots of casualties,&quot; regional military commander Lieutenant-general Roy Deveraturda said. He said the evacuation of so many villagers before the storm also saved many lives.</p> <p>As relief workers began assessing the damage, US secretary of state John Kerry said his country stood ready to help.</p> <p>&quot;Having so recently had my own visit to the Philippines prevented by another powerful storm, I know that these horrific acts of nature are a burden that you have wrestled with and courageously surmounted before. Your spirit is strong,&quot; Kerry said in a statement.</p> <p>Among the evacuees were thousands of residents of Bohol who had been camped in tents and other makeshift shelters since a magnitude-7.2 earthquake hit the island province last month.</p> <p>Relief workers said they were struggling to find ways to deliver food and other supplies, with roads blocked by landslides and fallen trees.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422060247|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|b5aa74789341792ea1d32003ddc114606e0c4d46 -->",

The governor said based on their estimate, 10,000 died,\" he said.</p><p>Tacloban city administrator Tecson Lim said that the death toll in that city alone \"could go up to 10,000\". Tacloban is the provincial capital of Leyte, with a population of more than 200,000. The Philippine Red Cross said in Tacloban bodies had been found \"piled up around the roads\" and in churches. Between 300 and 400 bodies had been recovered, Lim said. </p><p>On Samar island, which faces Tacloban, Leo Dacaynos of the provincial disaster office told Associated Press on Sunday 300 people were confirmed dead in Basey town and another 2,000 were missing.</p><p>He said the storm surge caused sea waters to rise 20 feet when the typhoon hit. There were still towns on Samar that had not been reached, he said, and appealed for food and water. Power was knocked out and there was no mobile  signal, making communication possible only by radio.</p><p>Many corpses hung on tree branches, buildings and sidewalks, Associated Press reported.</p><p>\"On the way to the airport we saw many bodies along the street,\" said Philippine-born Australian Mila Ward, 53, who was waiting at the Tacloban airport to catch a military flight back to Manila.</p><p>\"They were covered with just anything tarpaulin, roofing sheets, cardboards,\" she said. Asked how many, she said, \"Well over 100 where we passed.\"</p><p>The super-typhoon made landfall on Samar and Leyte islands in the eastern Visayas at about 4.40am on Friday local time, with winds up to 315km/h (195mph) tearing roofs off buildings, turning roads into rivers full of debris and knocking out electricity pylons.</p><p>With many provinces left without power or telecommunications, and airports in the hardest-hit areas, such as Tacloban, in tatters, experts say it is impossible to know the extent of the storm's damage – or deliver badly needed aid. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422102134'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/10/1384060375582/Residents-search-for-belo-008.jpg' alt='Residents search for belongings in the wreckage of Tacloban.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Residents search for belongings in the wreckage of Tacloban. Photograph: Dennis Sabangan/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>Roughly 12 hours after the 600km (370-mile)-wide Haiyan blew west towards Vietnam, where it is expected to make landfall early on Sunday, officials and aid workers are only now beginning to piece together details on the number of dead and injured. </p><p>Government figures showed that more than 4 million had been directly affected. The World Food Programme has mobilised some $2m (£1.25m) in aid and aims to deliver 40 tonnes of fortified biscuits to victims within the next few days.</p><p>Satellite images show normally green patches of vegetation ripped up into brown squares of debris in Tacloban, where local TV channel GMA broadcast images of huge storm surges, flattened buildings and families traipsing through flooded streets with their possessions held high above the water.</p><p>The head of the UN Disaster Assessment Co-ordination Team, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, described \"destruction on a massive scale\" in the city of 220,000 and said: \"The last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami. There are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris.\"</p><p>Al-Jazeera correspondent Jamela Alindogan was trapped in her hotel as the eye of the storm passed overhead and ripped the roof off the building. Evoking scenes of chaos as badly hurt victims wandered the streets without medicine, food or water, and doctors at the local hospital attended to the wounded in the dark without electricity or candlelight, she said: \"There is no food, not even in the hotels, and there's no water. The situation is really very desperate.\"</p><p>Other sources told of victims trying to climb out from under rubble to find assistance, and mobs rampaging through the streets looking for food, water or medicine, and looting electrical goods and groceries from malls. \"Almost all the houses were destroyed,\" said Major Rey Balido of the Philippines national disaster agency. \"Only a few are left standing.\"</p><p>Relatives of those living in the typhoon's path have had no news from their loved ones and are nervously waiting until power is restored to the area. \"I spoke to my mother just a few hours before the typhoon made landfall in my city, Tacloban,\" said taxi driver Sherwin Martinata, 32, in the capital, Manila. \"She was saying she was all right but now I have no idea if my family is safe. There is no power, no phones. I can't get through at all. I'm worried, but I'm powerless.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422102135'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/10/1384059928017/A-boat-washed-ashore-sits-008.jpg' alt='A boat washed ashore sits on destroyed houses in Tacloban.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A boat washed ashore sits on destroyed houses in Tacloban. Photograph: Aaron Favila/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Those living in the hardest-hit areas, such as the eastern Visayas, are among the poorest in the Philippines, say aid agencies, who warn that there will be little or no savings for many of the victims to fall back on – putting an already vulnerable population at even greater risk of future food and job insecurity.</p><p>On Bohol island – where a 7.3-magnitude earthquake toppled colonial-era churches and killed some 200 people last month – residents were successfully evacuated ahead of the storm and as a result many lives were probably saved, said Mathias Eick of the European commission's humanitarian aid department (Echo). However, because the island's main power supply comes from neighbouring Leyte, residents are still without electricity or water.</p><p>In Tacloban, where many residents live along the coast, the sheer force of the storm was just too much for the buildings to withstand, with evacuation centres such as stadiums and churches later collapsing. \"The sheer magnitude and scale of the disaster sort of overpowered all the contingency measures, and we're fearing that we'll be finding more dead bodies in those evacuation centres themselves,\" said Alwynn Javier of Christian Aid.</p><p>Without information on the ground or access to hard-hit areas, aid agencies have been stuck, not knowing how much aid is needed or which areas need it most.</p><p>\"The only information we have been able to get so far is from the UN and some from the news,\" said Javier. \"We should have good ground reach, but are really impeded by this lack of access because even our partners on the ground have been hit themselves.\"</p><p>Officials and rescue workers hoped that Sunday would see concerted efforts by authorities to set up command centres and rescue groups, which will in turn help bring supplies to those who need them most. But gaining access to those areas will prove hard, said Richard Gordon of the Philippine Red Cross, who added that without bulldozers or tractors to clear paths, volunteers will have to bring cutting equipment to clear uprooted trees and debris.</p><p>The Philippines sees roughly 20 typhoons every year, with some more devastating than others. Last year's Typhoon Bopha killed more than 1,100 people and caused over $1bn in damage.</p><p>Haiyan – the 25th typhoon to hit the Philippines this year – is expected to make landfall in several provinces in central Vietnam with winds around 220km/h (137mph). More than 450,000 troops have been deployed, as well as 12 planes, 356 ships and thousands of vehicles, in order to mobilise supplies, with more than 300,000 people evacuated in Da Nang and Quang Ngai provinces.</p><p>\"It may be the strongest storm to hit Vietnam in history,\" said Vietnam's director of the Central Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre in Bui Minh Tang. Coastal areas should expect to see waves as high as 5-8 meters (16-26ft) and a wind radius up to 500km wide, officials warned.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422083841|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|4a76b47b556f8fb1f36a008e99fdbf59df4aa912 -->",

        "body":"<p>A huge rescue operation is under way in the Philippines to help the victims of typhoon Haiyan, which may have killed more than 10,000 people in the city of Tacloban alone.<br />President Benigno Aquino, who landed in Tacloban on Sunday to get a firsthand look at the disaster, said the casualties \"will be substantially more\" than the official count of 151, but gave no figure or estimate. He said the government's priority was to restore power and communications in isolated areas to allow for the delivery of relief and medical assistance to victims.</p> <p>The Philippines does not have sufficient resources on its own to deal with a disaster of this magnitude, and the US and other governments and agencies were mounting a major relief effort, said Philippine Red Cross chairman Richard Gordon.</p> <p>At the request of the Philippine government, the US defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, directed US Pacific Command to deploy ships and aircraft to support search-and-rescue operations and airlift emergency supplies, according to a statement released by the department.</p> <p>The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, said in a message to Aquino that the EC had sent a team to assist the Philippine authorities and that \"we stand ready to contribute with urgent relief and assistance if so required in this hour of need\".</p> <p>If the typhoon death toll is confirmed, it would be the deadliest natural catastrophe on record in the Philippines.</p> <p>The airport in Tacloban, about 360 miles south-east of Manila, looked like a muddy wasteland of debris, with crumpled tin roofs and upturned cars. The airport tower's glass windows were shattered, and air force helicopters were busy flying in and out at the start of relief operations. Residential homes that had lined a four-mile stretch of road leading to Tacloban city were all blown or washed away.</p> <p>The winds were so strong that Tacloban residents who sought shelter at a local school tied down the roof of the building, but it was still ripped off and the school collapsed, Lim said. It wasn't clear how many died there.</p> <p>\"The devastation is, I don't have the words for it,\" interior secretary Mar Roxas said. \"It's really horrific. It's a great human tragedy.\"</p> <p>Defence secretary Voltaire Gazmin said Aquino was \"speechless\" when he told him of the devastation the typhoon had wrought in Tacloban.</p> <p>\"I told him all systems are down,\" Gazmin said. \"There is no power, no water, nothing. People are desperate. They're looting.\"</p> <p>The city's two largest malls and groceries were looted and the gasoline stations destroyed by the typhoon. Police were deployed to guard a fuel depot to prevent looting of fuel.</p> <p>On Sunday, the city's overwhelmed services were reinforced by 100 special police force units sent in from elsewhere to help restore peace and order.</p> <p>One Tacloban resident said he and others took refuge inside a parked Jeep to protect themselves from the storm, but the vehicle was swept away by a surging wall of water.</p> <p>\"The water was as high as a coconut tree,\" said 44-year-old Sandy Torotoro, a bicycle taxi driver who lives near the airport with his wife and eight-year-old daughter. \"I got out of the Jeep and I was swept away by the rampaging water with logs, trees and our house, which was ripped off from its mooring.</p> <p>\"When we were being swept by the water, many people were floating and raising their hands and yelling for help. But what can we do? We also needed to be helped,\" Torotoro said.</p> <p>In Torotoro's village, bodies could be seen lying along the muddy main road, as residents who had lost their homes huddled, holding on to the few things they had managed to save. The road was lined with trees that had fallen to the ground.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the typhoon, people were seen weeping while retrieving bodies of loved ones inside buildings and on a street that was littered with fallen trees, roofing material and other building parts torn off in the storm's fury. All that was left of one large building whose walls were smashed in were the skeletal remains of its rafters.</p> <p>Tim Ticar, a local tourism officer, said 6,000 foreign and local tourists were stranded on the popular resort island of Boracay, one of the tourist spots in the typhoon's path.</p> <p>The United Nations secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, offered his condolences and said UN humanitarian agencies were working closely with the Philippine government to respond rapidly with emergency assistance.</p> <p>UNICEF estimated that about 1.7m children live in areas affected by the typhoon, according to the agency's representative in the Philippines Tomoo Hozumi. UNICEF's supply division in Copenhagen was loading 60 metric tons of relief supplies for an emergency airlift expected to arrive in the Philippines on Tuesday.</p> <p>In Vietnam, preparations for the typhoon were under way. About 600,000 people from the central region who had been evacuated returned home because the storm changed course and was instead heading for the northern coast, where authorities began evacuating nearly 100,000 in three northern provinces.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422102048|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|22650a9c9e9f9e2ae4bb752af542a0350ca0a5de -->",

        "body":"<p>The first shipments of emergency aid have begun arriving in storm-wrecked regions of the Philippines, with relief agencies warning the extent of the devastation caused by typhoon Haiyan have severely hampered the logistics of bringing vital shelter, water and food to the millions affected.</p><p>As David Cameron announced &pound;6m in initial emergency aid from Britain, and the EU promising €3m (&pound;2.5m) and the US flying in Marines, aid groups said immediate relief efforts would have to be matched by longer-term aid planning to assist those who had lost crops, fishing fleets and livelihoods during the near-200mph winds and 6-metre storm surge.</p><p>The groups added that while they had some warning of the typhoon's approach, efforts to get assistance in place in advance had been hampered by the sheer ferocity of one of the strongest storms ever recorded. &quot;In one town where we had made preparations, even the evacuation centre had to be evacuated, as the storm was so strong,&quot; said Ian Bray from <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Oxfam</a>.</p><p>Among the first of overseas assistance to arrive in the Philippines, were 80 US Marines from their base in Okinawa, southern Japan, flown in to help the Filipino army with relief logistics.</p><p>One significant challenge is that no one as yet knows the precise extent and location of all the devastation. There has been understandable focus on Tacloban, the main city on Leyte island, where up to 10,000 are feared dead. But there has been little word from other, more remote areas in the path of the storm, both on Leyte and also Samar island, to the north-east, and the northern tip of Cebu, to the west.</p><p>Bray said Oxfam had a team elsewhere on Cebu, who had managed to make their way, with great difficulty, to the north. There, they estimated that 98% of buildings had been damaged, and said children were holding signs, begging for food and water.</p><p>Likening the extent of destruction to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Bray said: &quot;Getting up there was really difficult, because the roads are strewn with debris and wreckage. Getting to places for immediate response is going to be a big challenge for everyone, because of the level of destruction.&quot;</p><p>There was more to think of beyond shelter, clean water and food, he added: &quot;In the immediate aftermath people need these emergency requirements, but in the medium- to long-term people's crops will be affected, and things like fishing equipment. Though there's obviously a massive immediate need there will also be other needs as well, not just today but in the months to come.&quot;</p><p>Pete Garratt, disasters emergency manager for the <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Red Cross</a>, said: &quot;Our team in Tacloban is saying that moving very far out of Tacloban, or even around parts of it, is hard enough. There's debris, flooding damage and floodwater. There are concerns around the looting. People are desperate for supplies. There are [also] security concerns.&quot;</p><p>He added: &quot;It all makes the logistical element of relief supplies very tricky. We had a lot of stuff in Cebu, and more on its way to Cebu from Manila, and international freight coming in to Manila and Cebu. But it's onwards from Cebu to the most affected areas that's going to be the really tricky part of this.&quot;</p><p>Garrett said relief efforts following the typhoon, which is believed to have affected about 4 million people, will be possibly the biggest since the huge Pakistan floods of 2010, which left about a fifth of the country underwater.</p><p>While British agencies have begun appeals, the <a href=\"http://www.dec.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Disasters Emergency Committee</a> (DEC), which makes co-ordinated appeals for donations in major humanitarian catastrophes, said it has still to decide whether it will take action.</p><p>One of the criteria for such an appeal is whether it would raise significantly more funds than those of individual charities combined. Brendan Paddy from DEC said it was unclear whether this was the case, given the relatively slight cultural and population links between the UK and the Philippines.</p><p>A decision is likely early this week, he said: &quot;We would need to be sure that the amount of extra time, money and effort needed to make an appeal would generate enough of an extra return to make it worthwhile.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422130124|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|639075a6ad5482a751000065aa0f8ed862ff9cce -->",

Here's some of it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first shipments of emergency assistance have begun arriving in storm-wrecked regions of the Philippines, with aid agencies warning the extent of the devastation wreaked by typhoon Haiyan have severely hampered the logistics of bringing vital shelter, water and food to the millions affected.</p> <p>As David Cameron announced &pound;6m in initial British emergency aid, with the EU promising €3m and the US flying in Marines, aid groups said immediate relief efforts would have to be matched by longer-term planning to assist those who had lost crops, fishing fleets and other infrastructure from the near-200mph winds and 6m storm surge.</p> <p>They also said that while aid groups had some warning of the typhoon’s approach, efforts to get assistance in place in advance had been hampered by the sheer ferocity of one of the strongest storms ever recorded. “In one town where we had made preparations, even the evacuation centre had to be evacuated, as the storm was so strong,” said Ian Bray from Oxfam.</p> <p>Among the first aid to arrive was 80 US Marines from their base in Okinawa, southern Japan, flown in to help the Philippines army with logistics. The EU later pledged €3m in aid while Cameron promised &pound;6m, also speaking to his Filipino counterpart, Benigno Aquino, to express his condolences.</p> <p>One significant challenge is that no one as yet knows the precise extent and location of all the devastation. There has been understandable focus on Tacloban, the main city on Leyte island, with some estimates saying up to 10,000 people could have died here alone. However, there has been little word from other, more remote areas in the path of the storm, both on Leyte and also Samar island, to the north-east, and the northern tip of Cebu, to the west.</p> <p>Bray said Oxfam already had a team elsewhere on Cebu, who had managed to make their way, with great difficulty, to the north. There, the team estimated, 98% of buildings had been damaged. They saw children holding signs, begging for good and water.</p> <p>Likening the extent of destruction to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Bray said: “Getting up there was really difficult, because the roads are strewn with debris and wreckage. Getting to places for immediate response is going to be a big challenge for everyone, because of the level of destruction.”</p> <p>There was more to think of beyond shelter, clean water and food, he added: “In the immediate aftermath people need these emergency requirements, but in the medium to long term people’s crops will be affected, and things like fishing equipment. Though there’s obviously a massive immediate need there will also be other needs as well, not just today but in the months to come.”</p> <p>Pete Garratt, disasters emergency manager for the British Red Cross, said access was extremely tricky: “Our team in Tacloban is saying that moving very far out of Tacloban, or even around parts of it, is hard enough. There’s debris, flooding damage and floodwater, and there are some concerns around the looting. People are desperate for supplies. There are some security concerns.”</p> <p>He said: “It all makes the logistical element of relief supplies very tricky. We had a lot of stuff in Cebu, and more on its way to Cebu from Manila, and international freight coming in to Manila and Cebu.

The governor said, based on their estimate, 10,000 died,&quot; Soria told Reuters. &quot;The devastation is so big.&quot; More than 330,900 people were displaced and 4.3 million &quot;affected&quot; by the typhoon in 36 provinces, the U.N.'s humanitarian agency said, as relief agencies called for food, water and tarpaulins for the homeless.</p> <p>Witnesses and officials described chaotic scenes in Leyte's capital, Tacloban, a coastal city of 220,000 about 580 km (360 miles) southeast of Manila, with hundreds of bodies piled on the sides of roads and pinned under wrecked houses. The city lies in a cove where the seawater narrows, making it susceptible to storm surges.</p> <p>The city and nearby villages as far as one kilometre (just over half a mile) from shore were flooded, leaving floating bodies and roads choked with debris from fallen trees, tangled power lines and flattened homes. TV footage showed children clinging to rooftops for their lives.</p> <p>Many Internet users urged prayers and called for aid for survivors in the largely Roman Catholic nation on social media sites such as Twitter.</p> <p>&quot;From a helicopter, you can see the extent of devastation. From the shore and moving a kilometre inland, there are no structures standing. It was like a tsunami,&quot; said Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas, who had been in Tacloban since before the typhoon struck the city.</p> <p>&quot;I don't know how to describe what I saw. It's horrific.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527f59ade4b03445394402bd\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-10T10:05:51.218Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-hodal\"><strong>Kate Hodal</strong></a>, who is in Manila, has sent this update, beginning with the first international efforts to help those affected:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Two C-130 planes carrying about 50 US marines will arrive in Manlia on Sunday night to help with the relief effort for the victims of typhoon Haiyan, US Marine Corps official said, with additional forces expected to follow. The marines are expected to help provide logistics and will be sent to locations deemed necessary by the Philippines government, but it is expected they will be deployed to Tacloban first.</p> <p>At Villamar Air Base in Manila, journalists, desperate relatives and army and police crowded around boxes of supplies waiting to get into relief planes headed for the devastated city of Tacloban. The Philippines army has been sending in supplies and personnel, but the four C-130 planes have so far been able to arrive only during daylight.</p> <p>The last cargo flight on Sunday left Manila with runway lights, search and rescue teams and body bags, with the destroyed airport in Tacloban reportedly serving as a makeshift morgue.</p> <p>&quot;We're sending medicine, relief goods, emergency response teams and tents, generators, communications equipment and fuel,&quot; said army spokesman Colonel Miguel Okol. &quot;But our priority right now us sending out security – Philippines National Police – to deal with the [reports of] violence.&quot;</p> <p>A battalion, comprising up to 250 police, had been sent to Tacloban, he said.</p> <p>Orla Fagan of the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it was still too early to judge government estimates of the death toll without access to all regions. The official toll still stood in the hundreds, but the Red Cross and officials on the ground have estimated it could be more 10,000.</p> <p>&quot;We haven't been out to the west of the Visayas yet so we have no idea what's gone on there,&quot; Fagan said. &quot;Tacloban was really badly hit and we could [see] a replicating of that, we just don't know.&quot; UN teams had been deployed south and north of Tacloban to assess damage further out, as well as to Ilo Ilo, which was still without food, water or power, Fagan said.</p> <p>Most of the Philippines army planes had been sent Tacloban, but one was also sent to Roxas.<br />Osprey tilt-rotor planes will also be deployed and sent to areas where it is difficult to land standard aircraft.</p> <p>Mathias Eick of of the European Commission's office of humanitarian aid said the first emergency decisions were being taken on EU funding and would be announced on Sunday. &quot;Electricity has just come on in some parts of Bohol – which was badly affected by last months earthquake – and hopefully water will follow soon,&quot; he said.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527f5541e4b08521f0cfb4e9\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-10T10:05:46.444Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Here are our live updates of events in the Philippines and elsewhere caused by the devastating storm which struck the region of Leyte.</p> <p>So far 10,000 people are estimated to have died in the Philippines from super typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever recorded, which reportedly destroyed around three-quarters of the area of Leyte province. The extent of the damage and death toll will likely take many days to assess, and could well rise significantly, especially as the still-strong weather system heads across the South China Sea into Vietnam.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422105609|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|cb8801305e25ab48867e65aa6c287408faeda090 -->",

        "headline":"Typhoon Haiyan: desperate survivors and destruction in flattened city",
        "body":"<p>The distance from the airport to the centre of town is just seven miles by road, but the journey can easily take six hours. To get to Tacloban, the small city in Leyte province in the Philippines that was flattened on Friday by typhoon Haiyan, you have to manoeuvre through piled-up bodies, uprooted trees, jagged pieces of debris and survivors staggering around searching for food, water and supplies.</p><p>The coastal city of 222,000 inhabitants bore the brunt of 195mph winds as the strongest storm ever recorded tore off roofs and destroyed evacuation centres.</p><p>Storm surges of up to six metres in height turned roads into rivers of sewage and seawater, landing whole ships on top of houses and obliterating bridges and roads.</p><p>At least 10,000 people are thought to have died so far in Leyte province alone, with the toll expected to rise.</p><p>On Monday the first US military plane carrying relief supplies and a contingent of marines left Manila headed for Tacloban, loaded with bottled water, generators wrapped in plastic, a forklift and two trucks, Associated Press reported.</p><p>Without clean water, food or medicine, Tacloban's survivors have begun raiding houses, shops and malls to find supplies, with video footage showing residents scrambling out of a mall with electronic goods that they were probably hoping to barter for food.</p><p>One shop owner was photographed defending his premises with a pistol, while reports emerged of aid convoys being hijacked and cash machines being looted. Local officials warned the Philippine president, Benigno Aquino&nbsp;III – who visited Tacloban on Sunday – that residents from nearby towns were entering the city to steal supplies and <a href=\"http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/11/10/13/pnoy-urged-declare-martial-law-tacloban\" title=\"\">pleaded with him to declare martial law</a>.</p><p>Even Tacloban's airport was reduced to a shell. But survivors, authorities and media all crowded into the building through ragged gaps in its walls.</p><p>The airport is both a makeshift command centre – from which the army finally began, on Sunday, to deliver much-needed supplies – and the only way out for many survivors, who are queuing hundreds deep in an effort to leave the chaos behind.</p><p>More grimly, the airport has been turned into a makeshift morgue for the growing number of bodies, found stacked in churches, snagged on tree branches or underneath rubble. Mass graves have been dug to accommodate the corpses, with police chief Elmer Soria reckoning that most victims either drowned or were crushed to death by crumbling buildings.</p><p>\"It was like a tsunami,\" said Philippine interior secretary Mar Roxas, who visited Tacloban on Sunday by helicopter. \"I don't know how to describe what I saw. It's horrific.\"</p><p>With communications still inoperative across vast swaths of the hardest hit areas, it is  impossible to judge the scale of the destruction. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/10/typhoon-haiyan-relief-effort-aid-agencies\" title=\"\">Aid agencies warned</a> they could not reach all those affected, with airports and harbours across the Philippines either closed or badly disrupted.</p><p>Emergency teams have been forced to try to reach survivors on foot, in many cases walking for hours over debris to access remote and ravaged areas.</p><p>Speaking from Samar island, Aya Lowe, who drove to Tacloban from Manila to assess the damage, said the roads in and out of the city were at a standstill. \"We came across the main bridge towards Tacloban and there was just a huge traffic jam to come in or out,\" she said. \"There were people coming in on mopeds and families trying to find their loved ones, and people coming out with boxes of shampoo and mayonnaise and random stuff.\"</p><p>Luiza Carvalho, the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator for the Philippines, said it was vital that aid agencies reach those who are stranded in isolated areas. \"They are at risk of further threats such as malnutrition, exposure to bad weather and unsafe drinking water,\" she said.</p><p>But with the typhoon having swept across a number of cities – one Filipino official said the storm \"island-hopped\" – Tacloban is just one town among many that will have to be rebuilt from scratch. If the death toll is as high as is feared, Haiyan could emerge as the deadliest natural catastrophe in the Philippines' history.</p><p>More than 350,000 people are awaiting supplies in 1,220 evacuation centres, with 4.3  million people across the country affected by Haiyan, said Orla Fagan of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha).</p><p>Rescue teams deployed in Bogo city and San Remigio, on the island of Cebu, said some buildings have been flattened, with significant damage to both homes and sugar plantations, which have served as many residents' primary source of income in this agricultural area.</p><p>She added that some areas were still 80% under water.</p><p>UN teams have been dispatched to the areas south and north of Tacloban and to Iloilo, to the west of Leyte and Samar islands, to assess the damage there.</p><p>\"We haven't been to the west of the Visayan islands yet so we have no idea what's gone on there,\" Fagan said. \"We could be replicating what happened in Tacloban.\"</p><p>President Aquino has come under fire for an initially slow relief effort, but argued that logistics prevented emergency supplies from reaching devastated areas any sooner. International aid, however, is on the move, with the US flying in Marines on Sunday with the aim of providing much-needed logistics, and the UK announcing £6m in initial emergency aid and the EU €3m for immediate relief. The US embassy said it would provide $100,000 for health, water and sanitation support. Australia said it would provide an initial 15.5m pesos ($358,900) in relief supplies. The World Food Programme will also be sending food, communications equipment and logistics to Cebu, just west of Leyte, with a number of military planes departing on Sunday from Villamor Airforce Base in Manila with food, fuel, generators, body bags, runway lights, search and rescue teams and police.\"Our priority right now is sending out security – Philippines national police – to deal with the violence,\" spokesman Colonel Miguel Okol told the Guardian.</p><p>While a number of Tacloban residents aimed to board the military planes headed back to Manila, hundreds of friends and family crowded together at the air base trying to make the opposite journey in order to find relatives they feared may have been killed by the typhoon.\"Until now, I have had no contact with my family in Tacloban, so I have been here since 5am,\" said Almar Rosal, 21, one of some 20 university students at the base. \"I just want to check on them to make sure they're  OK, but we were told the planes stopped because people were hijacking supplies. So now we are going to drive to Leyte. It will probably take us 24hrs to reach Tacloban city.\"</p><p>Another Tacloban native, Rochelle de Leon, said she was planning to fly from Manila to Cebu, then take a boat to Leyte island, where she would have to take a van and walk, carrying supplies. \"I'll dress in camouflage so we won't get mobbed,\" she said by phone from Cebu. \"I just want to know that my mum is OK. She was home alone when the typhoon hit and, well, I haven't heard anything since.\"</p><p>Thirteen people were killed and dozens hurt in Vietnam as Haiyan approached the coast, state media reported, even though it had weakened substantially after hitting the Philippines.</p><p>Vietnam authorities have moved 883,000 people in 11 central provinces to safe zones, the government's website said. A further 150,000 people were moved to safe areas in northern provinces, authorities said. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/10/help-typhoon-haiyan-relief-effort\" title=\"\">• How you can help the typhoon Haiyan relief effort</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422131382|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|afbcba445b47a0fea1699645a9f0084c9ec1eca5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Dazed survivors of a super typhoon that swept through the central Philippines killing an estimated 10,000 people begged for help and scavenged for food, water and medicine on Monday, threatening to overwhelm military and rescue resources.</p> <p>As President Benigno Aquino deployed hundreds of soldiers in the coastal city of Tacloban to quell looting, reports showed apocalyptic scenes of destruction in another region that has not been reached by rescue workers or the armed forces.</p> <p>Aquino, who before the storm said the government was aiming for zero casualties, has shown exasperation at conflicting official reports on damage and deaths. One TV network quoted him as telling the head of the disaster agency that he was running out of patience.</p> <p>The government has not confirmed officials' estimates over the weekend of 10,000 deaths, but the toll from Haiyan, one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, is clearly far higher than the current official count of 255. The armed forces in the central Philippines on Monday reported a death toll of 942.</p> <p>The official toll is likely to climb rapidly once rescuers reach remote villages along the coast, such as Guiuan, a town in eastern Samar province with a population of 40,000 that was largely destroyed.</p> <p>\"The only reason why we have no reports of casualties up to now is that communications systems ... are down,\" said Colonel John Sanchez, posting on the armed forces Facebook page.</p> <p>About 300 people died in Samar, said an official from the provincial disaster agency. Baco, a city of 35,000 in Oriental Mindoro province, was 80% under water, the United Nations said. An official from World Vision said there were early reports that as much as 90% of northern Cebu had been destroyed. An aid team from Oxfam reported \"utter destruction\" in the northernmost tip of Cebu.</p> <p>\"The situation is bad, the devastation has been significant. In some cases the devastation has been total,\" secretary to the cabinet Rene Almendras told a news conference.</p> <p>The United Nations said officials in Tacloban, which bore the brunt of the storm on Friday, had reported one mass grave of 300-500 bodies.</p> <p>More than 600,000 people were displaced by the storm across the country and some have no access to food, water, or medicine, the UN says. Tacloban, 360 miles south-east of Manila, was relying almost entirely for supplies and evacuation on just three military transport planes flying from nearby Cebu city.</p> <p>Dozens of residents clamoured for help at the airport gates.</p> <p>\"Help us, help us. Where is President Aquino? We need water, we are very thirsty,\" shouted one woman. \"When are you going to get bodies from the streets?\"</p> <p>Awelina Hadloc, the owner of a convenience store, foraged for instant noodles at a warehouse that was almost bare from looting. She said her store had been washed away by a 10-foot storm surge.</p> <p>\"It is so difficult. It is like we are starting again,\" said the 28-year-old. \"There are no more supplies in the warehouse and the malls.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422161376|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|71bfb15bb60cfd36d4c44fc197e36a7449cbc1d7 -->",

        "body":"<p>The area has seen typhoons every year – just not of this magnitude. Having gone through severe typhoons, I don't think people thought they would not survive this one.</p><p>The storm was supposed to strike at 9am. But by 5.30am there was heavy rain and extremely strong winds so we knew it had made landfall. One hour later the cellphone signal went out and the  hour after that there was no radio signal. The heart of the storm hit at 8.30am and an hour later the storm surge came in as well. It started to die down at 10.30am, so there were six hours in which children and families in extremely dilapidated housing had to go through that.</p><p>The building I was in was one of the sturdier ones, but the windows were smashed by flying debris and part of the roof was ripped off, so the rain was sweeping through and the whole place was flooded. When the flash-flooding came through it wiped out the whole living area downstairs: it was up to a metre-and-a-half high.</p><p>I think I went in quite mentally prepared for the typhoon but I was surprised by how strong it was. The devastation I was not prepared for. People were just in shock. They couldn't believe how powerful the storm was. People began to leave the evacuation centre [near us] – the roofs and windows had been smashed. People there really suffered from the storm surge and used a bed as a raft to float to our building and climb to the second floor.</p><p>They were trying to go home, look for relatives, make sure everyone was safe and salvage what was left of their homes – pretty much nothing. There were families who had left a family member behind to protect the house from being looted. There was a lot of debris and a lot of flooding. There were trees and fallen electricity lines strewn everywhere. On the side of the road people were laying out dead bodies covered in clothes and whatever they could find. There were children as well as adults.</p><p>I saw a dozen or so. But I am sure there are many in coastal areas that have not been retrieved or in places that completely flattened there must be a lot of bodies under there.</p><p>We had tried to co-ordinate with the government prior to the storm and had preparedness plans but they were thrown out of the window because the government itself was incapacitated. We walked for seven hours into the centre because no regional official was around.</p><p>We saw a lot of people with cuts and bruises where they had been hit by flying debris or glass had struck them but there was no way to get them the support they needed. Medical supplies from hospitals were looted because people realised there was no one around to help them. By Sunday, I got to a hospital in Tacloban and saw a sign outside saying: \"No admission – no medical supplies.\"</p><p>On Saturday, everyone was desperate for food. By midday we saw looting for basic supplies, which escalated the day after into whatever they could get. We saw people taking refrigerators out; perhaps something they really needed – they knew they wouldn't be able to afford another one after the storm. Other people were taking flat-screen TVs. People were looting fashion outlets and taking high-heeled shoes – anything they could get. It was hard to tell whether it was opportunistic or desperate.</p><p>[They were] ripping out the gates of grocery stores because the markets were not open and they did not have food. They were angry at the government for not supporting them – they felt it was absolute hell and there was no way of recovering. It was absolutely clear not that they didn't want to help themselves but they couldn't [stop themselves].</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422187520|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|70c7fcc94b60e3875f4ba931afdfd0b7e0c5fb12 -->",

Information is beginning to trickle out from previously cut-off towns.</p><p>\"The situation is bad, the devastation has been significant. In some cases the devastation has been total,\" the secretary to the cabinet, Rene Almendras, told a news conference.</p><p>\"The only reason why we have no reports of casualties up to now is that communications systems ... are down,\" reported Colonel John Sanchez of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.356701284467306.1073741835.323973651073403&amp;type=1\" title=\"\">Philippines armed forces</a> after posting aerial pictures of  apocalyptic scenes in Guiuan, eastern Samar, where Haiyan first made landfall.</p><p>\"One hundred percent of the structures either had their roofs blown away or sustained major damage.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422174045'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/11/1384161259360/Haiyan-mopther-gives-birt-003.jpg' alt='Haiyan: mopther gives birth in the debris' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Emily Ortega, 21, bottom, rests after giving birth at an improvised clinic at Tacloban airport on Monday.

Their pictures showed Haiyan ripping roofs from buildings as it tore through the town. Bodies covered with blankets could be seen on the streets, amid flattened houses and uprooted trees.</p><p>\"I have no house, I have no clothes. I don't know how I will restart my life, I am so confused,\" an unidentified woman said, crying. \"I don't know what happened to us. We are appealing for help. Whoever has a good heart, I appeal to you please help Guiuan.\"</p><p>The mayor of Giporlos, further north, rode for eight hours by motorbike to seek help following the \"total destruction\" of his coastal town. In a video posted on the <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/nation/43345-eastern-samar-towns-ruin-yolanda\" title=\"\">Rappler social news site</a>, he said at least 95% of the town of 12,000 had been damaged.</p><p>The typhoon hit the eastern seaboard of the Philippines on Friday, tearing across its central islands and smashing its way through Tacloban, 580km (360 miles) south-east of Manila, while vast waves swept away coastal villages and drove ships high on to the shore.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422174046'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/11/1384143572781/e1127d93-eeb3-4add-8bdd-94a07f98f07f-460x276.jpeg' alt='Tacloban city, Leyte province in central Philippines, after Typhoon Haiyan ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>An aerial view of Tacloban city, Leyte province.

Authorities had evacuated 800,000 people before the typhoon hit – but many died in evacuation centres, which were incapable of withstanding fierce winds gusting at up to 275kph (170mph) and storm surges of up to 6 metres (20ft).</p><p>International aid teams are rushing to the scene, with US marines arriving to assist with search and rescue and deliver emergency supplies at the request of Manila. The World Food Programme is airlifting 44,000 tonnes of <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/stories/philippines-typhoon-wfp-sends-high-energy-biscuits-survivors\" title=\"\">high-energy biscuits</a> to the disaster zone.</p><p>But rescue efforts have struggled to make headway given damage to roads, airports, bridges and harbours, and a tropical depression is also expected to bring heavy rain to the region as early as Tuesday.</p><p>A worker for the World Vision charity described her eight-hour walk to Tacloban as an \"endless path of misery\" in a message posted on Twitter.</p><p>President Benigno Aquino III said he was considering declaring a state of emergency or martial law in Tacloban after survivors seized food, water and goods from stores and homes. He has already deployed 300 soldiers and police to restore order.</p><p>Residents crowded the airport gates, clamouring for help, Reuters reported.</p><p>\"Help us, help us. Where is President Aquino? We need water, we are very thirsty,\" shouted one woman. \"When are you going to get bodies from the streets?\"</p><p>The UN said officials in Tacloban, which bore the brunt of the storm on Friday, had reported one mass grave containing 300-500 bodies. Corpses continued to litter the streets, while others lay buried where buildings collapsed around them.</p><p>Rupert Ambil of Rappler, who grew up around the storm-destroyed neighbourhoods, wrote on Sunday that he could barely recognise the once-serene city.</p><p>\"It's like the city had been bulldozed and I was in a different time and place. I saw devastation. I smelled death. I fear anarchy,\" <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/nation/43311-diary-tacloban-death-anarchy\" title=\"\">he wrote</a>.</p><p>\"For now, amid the chaos and grief, it's every man for himself.\"</p><p>Leo Dacaynos of the provincial disaster office in Samar told the Associated Press that 300 people were confirmed dead in one town and another 2,000 missing, with other places yet to be reached by rescuers. He pleaded for food and water, adding that power was out and that communication was possible only by radio.</p><p>Baco, a city of 35,000 in Oriental Mindoro province, was 80% under water, the UN said, while an aid team from Oxfam reported \"utter destruction\" in the northern-most tip of Cebu.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422174047'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/11/1384162284731/Guiuan-in-Eastern-Samar-d-007.jpg' alt='Guiuan in Eastern Samar: destroyed houses' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Destroyed houses in the town of Guiuan in Eastern Samar province. Photograph: Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Steven Burns, a Manila resident whose wife's family grew up in Guiuan, said his in-laws had been unable to contact anyone in the town since Friday.</p><p>\"People were well aware there was a typhoon on the way&nbsp;… they just didn't comprehend how bad it would be,\" he said.</p><p>He said that while the government did evacuate when extreme weather was on its way, there were relatively few safe places to evacuate to in this case.</p><p>\"There are very few structures in these places which would survive such storms, and Guiuan will have got the full hit.\"</p><p>On Sunday, Pope Francis issued a Twitter message urging people to follow him in prayer for victims in the mostly Catholic country, as well as leading tens of thousands of worshippers at the Vatican.</p><p>The Philippines is highly vulnerable to natural disasters – it was recovering from last month's 7.2-magnitude quake in central Bohol province when the typhoon struck – but Haiyan is believed to be the deadliest on record for the country of 96 million people. About 5,100 died when typhoon Thelma hit the central Philippines in 1991, while 5,791 died in a 1976 earthquake and resulting tsunami.</p><p>Thirteen people were killed and dozens hurt during heavy winds and rain in Vietnam, state media reported, although Haiyan had weakened as it reached the coast. It is expected to weaken further before arriving in southern China.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422168359|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|d3655c0e6bd36fa27d725f982e2ad5fb94ea8e67 -->",

        "headline":"Typhoon Haiyan: Philippines prepares climate change plans for worse to come",
        "body":"<p>As one of the world's poorest and least developed countries, the Philippines is handicapped by a chronic lack of resources, poor or non-existent infrastructure, and a far-flung archipelagic geography when dealing with the natural catastrophes that regularly afflict it.</p><p>But hard-won experience is also forcing Filipino government administrators and agencies, and their international collaborators, to examine and create new strategies for disaster preparedness, response and mitigation that have important potential applications in other parts of the world.</p><p>As the impact of climate change grows ever more marked, the ill-starred Philippines, lying prone and vulnerable at the windswept eastern end of the Pacific, is becoming a hothouse for developing new methods and systems in the growing business of disaster relief. But as super-typhoon Haiyan cruelly demonstrated, it still has a long way to go.</p><p>The Philippines averages about 20 typhoons a year, including three super-typhoons plus numerous incidents of flooding, drought, earthquakes and tremors and occasional volcanic eruptions, making it one of the most naturally disaster-prone countries in the world.</p><p>According to the UN Office for Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha), the Philippines <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report/97021/disasters-asia-s-2012-figures-and-trends\" title=\"\">has recorded</a> 182 disasters that, since 2002, killed almost 11,000 people. This figure does not include super-typhoon Bopha, known locally as Pablo, which hit the southern Philippines last December, killing more than 1,000 people,  nor last Friday's super-typhoon Haiyan.</p><p>Bopha produced wind speeds of 160mph, gusting to 195mph and was the world's deadliest typhoon in 2012. More than 6.2 million people were affected. The cost of the damage was estimated at more than $1bn. Haiyan topped those wind speeds and has reportedly claimed 10 times the number of victims. Early estimates suggest 4.5 million people have been affected. The financial cost is so far incalculable.</p><p>The appearance that these storms are getting bigger and more damaging reflects rapidly deteriorating climatic trends. The five most devastating typhoons ever recorded in the Philippines have occurred since 1990, affecting 23 million people. Four of the costliest typhoons anywhere occurred in the same period, <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what-we-do/emergency-response/philippines-typhoon-bopha\" title=\"\">according to Oxfam</a>.</p><p>The inter-governmental panel on climate change says mean temperatures in the Philippines are rising by 0.14C per decade. Scientists are also registering steadily rising sea levels around the Philippines, and a falling water table. All this appears to increase the likelihood and incidence of extreme weather events, analysts say.</p><p>Mary Ann Lucille Sering, head of the <a href=\"http://climate.gov.ph/\" title=\"\">Philippine government's climate change commission</a>, warned in an interview with the Guardian in Manila earlier this year that her country faced a deepening crisis that it could ill afford financially and in human terms. Typhoon-related costs in 2009, the year the commission was created, amounted to 2.9% of GDP, she said, and have been rising each year since then.</p><p>\"Extreme weather is becoming more frequent, you could even call it the new normal,\" Sering said. \"Last year one typhoon [Bopha] hurt us very much. If this continues we are looking at a big drain on resources.\" Human activity-related \"slow-onset impacts\" included over-fishing, over-dependence on certain crops, over-extraction of ground water, and an expanding population (the Philippines has about 95 million people and a median age of 23).</p><p>\"Altogether this could eventually lead to disaster,\" Sering said. And her fears are widely shared. Opinion surveys showed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/17/filipino-super-typhoon-climate-change\" title=\"\">Filipinos rated global warming as a bigger threat than rising food and fuel prices</a>, she said.</p><p>To deal with these enormous challenges, the Philippines government has created the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), which works with the UN and relief agencies to try to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events and other disasters.</p><p>The response to a storm such as Haiyan in theory comprises three phases: immediate help, including the provision of shelter and clean water, sanitation and hygiene facilities; rebuilding and relocation; and mitigation and prevention measures.</p><p>Supplying emergency toilets and water bladders is essential in preventing diseases such as cholera, and, for example, dehydration among babies and young children, aid workers say. Shelter in the form of tents is also a first priority and for this and other key supplies, the Philippines will rely on airlifts by the UN and international donor governments such as Britain, which in some cases pre-position supplies.</p><p>The NDRRMC has produced a national disaster risk reduction and management plan for the period 2011 to 2028 which takes a holistic and long-term approach to disaster relief. Factored into its strategies are considerations of pre- and post-disaster sustainable development, poverty alleviation, environmental protection, and physical security. The idea is to \"build back better\" once the clear-up begins.</p><p>The plan also focuses, with charities such as Oxfam, on training networks of first responders – local people who know what to do when disaster strikes without waiting for the emergency services to arrive, which can take days or weeks. Unfortunately, with a disaster the magnitude of Haiyan, such systems may be initially overwhelmed.</p><p>Examples of longer-term projects following on from disasters include the building, if funds allow, of waste management plants, setting up markets at relocation sites, and working on disaster risk reduction programmes, so that when the next typhoon hits, local people may be better prepared.</p><p>For this to work, aid agency workers say, it is essential that the international community remains committed, financially and otherwise, once the initial drama of the human emergency subsides.</p><p>One success story in the Philippines is to be found in the Lumbia resettlement project outside Cagayan de Oro, in northern Mindanao. Here, victims of tropical storm Washi, which swept through the area in 2011, killing 1,200 people and causing nearly $50m in damage, have been offered newly-built homes on land owned by a university away from the local river's flood plain. The Lumbia project's slogan is \"build a community, not just homes\".</p><p>Benito Ramos, the former executive director of the NDRRMC, told the Guardian in February that the bigger challenge of climate change was becoming more dangerous. Climate change, he said, posed an existential threat to the Philippines. \"We are mainstreaming climate change in all government departments and policies. If we don't adapt and adjust, we all agree we are heading for disaster.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422206881|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|85f2f646d50598b1c5db3bc2f5bc147bdce10fd9 -->",

        "body":"<p>The first consignments of aid have begun arriving in storm-devastated regions of the Philippines as the true extent of the destruction wreaked by typhoon Haiyan began to emerge, three days after one of the most powerful storms ever recorded made landfall.</p><p></p><p>Two US marine C-130 cargo planes arrived in Tacloban, the coastal city where virtually every building was destroyed by the typhoon's huge storm surge, and were unloading emergency items on Monday evening – the first wave of an aid operation taking in dozens of countries and agencies.</p><p></p><p>The confirmed death toll is 942 and one mass grave in Tacloban was reported to have been filled with 500 bodies. About 10,000 people are estimated to have died overall.</p><p></p><p>While winds gusting to 170mph caused significant damage, the  devastation in areas such as Tacloban – where scenes are reminiscent of the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami – was principally the work of the 6-metre-high storm surge, which carried away even the concrete buildings in which many people sought shelter.</p><p></p><p>Survivors spoke of walls and roofs giving way, plunging them into the water.</p><p>\"The situation is bad, the devastation has been significant. In some cases the devastation has been total,\" the cabinet secretary, Rene Almendras, told reporters in Manila.</p><p>The commander of the US marine contingent in Tacloban, Brigadier General Paul Kennedy, said after a helicopter flight over the city: \"I don't believe there is a single structure that is not destroyed or severely damaged in some way. Every single building, every single house.\"</p><p></p><p>The confirmed toll is likely to rise significantly once rescuers reach more remote parts of the coast, currently cut off from communications.</p><p></p><p>Guiuan, a town on Samar island to the east of Tacloban with a population of 40,000, is believed to have been largely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The aid effort is both enormous in scale – according to the United Nations, more than 600,000 people have been displaced by the storm – and fraught with complications, with roads blocked and most ports and airports closed.</p><p></p><p>In Tacloban even the initial work of removing bodies from the debris has yet to properly begin. Some survivors are begging for supplies while others have ransacked shops, some of which are now guarded by police.</p><p></p><p>While authorities moved about 800,000 people before Haiyan made landfall on Friday, the great reach of the storm surge meant many still perished.</p><p></p><p>Fermin Carangan, an air force commander in Tacloban, described trying to sit out the storm inside his military base. \"It was 7.30 in the morning. The rain and wind were so strong and the water surged in fast and rose without letup. We had no time to move elsewhere, so we clambered up the room, about 10 of us,\" he told the Associated Press.</p><p>\"Then the roof started to peel off. One by one we were exposed to the rain and we were just holding on to the roof wooden beams. Then the walls of the building started collapsing and each one of us started falling into the water. We were yelling at each other. Then all of us got separated.\"</p><p>Carangan spent five hours clinging to a wooden roof beam before paddling to shore, managing to rescue a young boy also floating on a piece of wood.</p><p>Others were not so lucky. Nestor Librando, a 31-year-old carpenter, took the body of his two-year-old son to a chapel in Tacloban. When the waters rose and his family were swept out of a military compound where they took shelter, he had held the boy in one arm and his three-year-old son in another. The younger child slipped from his hands and was pulled under the water.</p><p>\"This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life, the worst thing I could imagine,\" Librando said. \"I brought him to this chapel because there was nowhere else to take him. I wanted Jesus Christ to bless him.\"</p><p>With winds weakening to about 75mph, the tropical storm made landfall in northern Vietnam early on Monday. Authorities there evacuated hundreds of thousands of people but there were no reports of significant damage or injuries. However, local media in southern China reported seven people had died as the storm moved into Hainan and Guangxi provinces.</p><p>The Philippines president, Benigno Aquino, has declared a  \"state of national calamity\", but has said that outside the provinces of Leyte and Samarm, there appeared to be few casualties.</p><p>Britain has promised £6m in aid and is sending  experts, with other assistance pledged from the EU, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, along with dozens of aid agencies and UN organisations.</p><p>Co-ordinating this effort will be a major challenge, aid experts have warned. The international response to the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti in 2010 was plagued by confusion, prompting aid agencies to say people died needlessly because of chaotic initial phases of the humanitarian effort.</p><p>Leonard Doyle, from the International Organisation for Migration in Manila, said a repeat of those mistakes appeared less likely here.</p><p>\"The challenge is huge but you have a government that is coherent and which works well with donors,\" Doyle said. \"President Benigno Aquino is very much present, very engaged. It is a well-functioning government at multiple levels. The wild card is the sheer extent of the disaster.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422205412|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|62aacd2a1f82ec013705a8293c369daebed8ecc0 -->",
