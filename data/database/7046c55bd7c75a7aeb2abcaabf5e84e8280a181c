        "body":"<p><strong>Asda has taken payment on my credit card for £196.51 for an online grocery delivery I never received, and is not responding to my demands for a refund. I placed an order online with Asda for a delivery to a rented holiday house in Pembroke. The delivery was booked to coincide with our arrival for a week's holiday on 31 August between 4pm and 6pm. The delivery did not arrive within the time slot, so I rang the customer service number provided at about 6.05pm and was kept on hold for almost 25 minutes (as I only had access to a mobile I was charged £4.23 for the call). When they finally answered I was told they had experienced computer failure and that all deliveries were delayed by up to three hours. I said I could not wait that long with a tired and hungry family in a holiday home without even a teabag. So I asked if I could cancel, and the person said that was no problem. </strong></p><p><strong>We then went out for 10 minutes and while we were gone the delivery van came (this was just before 7pm). The card left by the driver stated we had to ring customer services to rearrange delivery. We decided not to try and rearrange the delivery as we had already told customer services to cancel it anyway. </strong></p><p><strong>Returning from holiday a week later I checked my credit card online and found that Asda had charged me for the shopping. I emailed to complain, but received an email suggesting that I was just moaning about a missed time slot and stating that the local store had confirmed delivery. I then sent a written complaint on 20 September demanding a refund and compensation. I got no reply and sent a further email – still no reply. Can you help? I will never consider shopping at Asda again. </strong><em>KK, York</em><strong> </strong></p><p>We have all got so used to the convenience of online grocery shopping that when it lets us down it is all the more disappointing. What seems odd about this is that you were asked to provide two mobile phone numbers when placing your order so drivers could contact you in case of any problems. After we contacted Asda, it admitted it hadn't met its own \"high standards\" of customer service and leapt into apologetic mode, refunding your credit card in full and also sending you £30 in vouchers to make up for the inconvenience.</p><p>It said: \"After investigating the issue it appears there was a system error at the store which occurred when the payment was requested from the bank, which caused the glitch. Our operations team is investigating this to make sure it doesn't happen again. We can only apologise for not resolving it sooner.\" So it looks like you WILL have to shop at Asda in order to spend the vouchers.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

        "body":"<p><strong>In May this year, I bought a Ford Fiesta from the car dealer Sandicliffe in Leicester, and completed an online customer survey which promised me £50 cash back if I introduced someone who subsequently bought a car within one month.</strong></p><p><strong>Two weeks later, my partner and I returned and he bought a Mazda MX5, which he had seen at the time I bought mine. When he paid for the car I handed over the voucher and was told a cheque would be in the post. Since then I have heard nothing, despite telephone calls and visits to the showroom when my car has been in for work. Admittedly £50 is not a lot of money – not enough to fill either car with petrol – but why are we enticed with cashback offers which the company concerned has no intention of honouring? </strong><em>LT, Leicester</em></p><p>You are right to draw attention to this practice, as we receive many complaints about companies' failure to actually deliver on their promises. Finally, on 13 September you received a cheque for £50 from Sandicliffe. It had been posted on 2 September, but with just 33p postage and to the wrong address. Fortunately the occupants know you and brought it round. Although we can take no credit for the happy outcome, this shows that persistence pays off. Let's hope the company has updated its postal records and acquainted itself with current postage rates.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

        "body":"<p><strong>Asda has taken payment on my credit card for £196.51 for an online grocery delivery I never received, and is not responding to my demands for a refund. I placed an order online with Asda for a delivery to a rented holiday house in Pembroke. The delivery was booked to coincide with our arrival for a week's holiday on 31 August between 4pm and 6pm. The delivery did not arrive within the time slot, so I rang the customer service number provided at about 6.05pm and was kept on hold for almost 25 minutes (as I only had access to a mobile I was charged £4.23 for the call). When they finally answered I was told they had experienced computer failure and that all deliveries were delayed by up to three hours. I said I could not wait that long with a tired and hungry family in a holiday home without even a teabag. So I asked if I could cancel, and the person said that was no problem. </strong></p><p><strong>We then went out for 10 minutes and while we were gone the delivery van came (this was just before 7pm). The card left by the driver stated we had to ring customer services to rearrange delivery. We decided not to try and rearrange the delivery as we had already told customer services to cancel it anyway. </strong></p><p><strong>Returning from holiday a week later I checked my credit card online and found that Asda had charged me for the shopping. I emailed to complain, but received an email suggesting that I was just moaning about a missed time slot and stating that the local store had confirmed delivery. I then sent a written complaint on 20 September demanding a refund and compensation. I got no reply and sent a further email – still no reply. Can you help? I will never consider shopping at Asda again. </strong><em>KK, York</em><strong> </strong></p><p>We have all got so used to the convenience of online grocery shopping that when it lets us down it is all the more disappointing. What seems odd about this is that you were asked to provide two mobile phone numbers when placing your order so drivers could contact you in case of any problems. After we contacted Asda, it admitted it hadn't met its own \"high standards\" of customer service and leapt into apologetic mode, refunding your credit card in full and also sending you £30 in vouchers to make up for the inconvenience.</p><p>It said: \"After investigating the issue it appears there was a system error at the store which occurred when the payment was requested from the bank, which caused the glitch. Our operations team is investigating this to make sure it doesn't happen again. We can only apologise for not resolving it sooner.\" So it looks like you WILL have to shop at Asda in order to spend the vouchers.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

        "body":"<p><strong>I have been a member of the RAC for years, but had not used them until September when my car (with attached catering trailer) broke down about 10 miles from my home. I spent more than an hour trying to ring the breakdown number and was fed up listening to the recorded message. When an operator finally answered I was told someone would be with me within the hour. No one came. </strong></p><p><strong>I then had to spend another 40 minutes getting through again, only to be told it would be at least three or four hours until someone would be with me. In desperation I spent £150 to have my trailer collected (I could not leave it as it held frozen stock worth more than £1,000, which I would have lost had it defosted). I waited with my car and after speaking to the RAC again, after waiting another hour, I was told it would be another three or four hours before an RAC person would be with me. I ended up paying privately (another £50) for rescue and getting home. </strong></p><p><strong>The next day I spent more than an hour trying to reach the RAC to complain and also to get my car collected and taken to my garage. Can you help? </strong><em>CG, Ross on Wye, Herefordshire</em><strong> </strong></p><p>You were, it seems, the victim of unfortunate timing, but that is no excuse. The RAC said it was dealing with a high number of breakdowns nationally at the end of the school holidays – one of the busiest travelling periods of the summer. In a statement it said: \"As a result, CG regrettably suffered unacceptable delays, both on the phone and at the roadside. We do understand how important it is that delays such as this are prevented wherever possible and we are working hard to ensure there is no repetition.\"</p><p>It is writing to you to apologise and, as a gesture of goodwill, has offered you six months' free membership, which is worth about £50 – but not the £200 you wanted. We pressed RAC for a better offer, but none was forthcoming. You have told us you will not be taking up the offer of six months' free membership as you no longer want to be a member.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

When I checked my bank account four months later I found that my direct debit hadn't been cancelled and that I had paid LA Fitness £160 for a membership I had believed I had terminated – and had not even used. I cancelled my direct debit and called the manager, who has not returned my calls.</strong></p><p><strong>I have now received two letters requesting my direct debit to be set up again. In frustration, I sent three emails to \"member services\", after being unable to find any other way of making contact with head office. I have also had a letter threatening to add £40 to the £160 I already \"owe\". </strong><em>MN, Rugby, Warwickshire</em><strong> </strong></p><p>There are two issues that emerged here. Firstly, it transpires you were inadvertently sending messages to a website unrelated to LA Fitness, which eventually explained to you it is not affiliated to the company. Secondly, cancellation of gym membership can be fraught with difficulties, which is why the Office of Fair Trading is scrutinising the sector. But as you were made redundant you are apparently eligible for <a href=\"http://www.lafitness.co.uk/our-member-pledge/\" title=\"\">LA Fitness's member pledge guarantee</a>, which means you can cancel your membership with no penalties. The company said it had been trying to contact you when your bank advised it that you had cancelled your direct debit on 20 August. LA Fitness has asked you to send in paperwork confirming your redundancy so it can close your account and refund your £160. But in your view, the company should be embarrassed to have handled a disability issue this way.</p><p>LA Fitness said it is concerned by your version of events, which contravenes its company policy, and will be investigating further.</p><p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
