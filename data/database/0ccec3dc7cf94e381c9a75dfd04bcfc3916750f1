This sounds contradictory but as the great historian David Kynaston <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10412144/Private-schools-are-blocking-social-mobility.html\">has written</a>, private schools are “those highly resourced, highly skilled and ferociously dedicated blockers of downward mobility”. They perpetuate networks of privilege but they are presumably also fantastic schools. This combination of positional and actual good helps explain why their fees have gone up so quickly in the two decades – and why many families scrimp and save to send their kids there ...</p> <p>It is less than clear what Sir John is recommending be done. Perhaps he just wants the Tory leadership to come across as less posh than they are. He dutifully mentions education, which is of course important, especially in the early years. But if what he genuinely wants is an end to private schools’ dominance of British life he would surely need to engage with what Prof Kynaston says: that unless something is done to stop them being so exclusive and so good at what they do, then “the current political consensus is … almost meaningless.”</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2013/11/from-lordashcroft-2.html\">• Lord Ashcroft at ConservativeHome says he can understand why Ed Miliband wants leaders' debate before the election, but that they could backfire.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The risk for Mr Miliband is that far from giving him a chance to explain why he thinks price controls are workable, TV debates would further expose the idea’s superficiality. As President Bartlet observed in the <em>West Wing</em>, the ten-word answer can be deadly in politics, but where are the next ten words, and the ten after that? And as Henrique Capriles, the Venezuelan opposition leader, said of President Maduro, “every time he opens his mouth, he scares away the investments that create employment and worsens the crisis”. Rather than transforming perceptions of Miliband after five years as Labour leader, TV debates could confirm them. Meanwhile, they would allow Cameron and Clegg to argue at greater length that higher living standards are achieved by proper economic management, not least controlling the deficit, and by encouraging businesses rather than threatening them.</p> <p>These are risks, not certainties. A gamble on TV debates may yet help Labour, if the Tories can be persuaded to take part despite having more to lose. But Miliband’s eagerness to hold them is not a signal of confidence. It’s the opposite.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/grantshapps/12-facts-why-your-energy-bills-are-sky-high-and-giew\">• Grant Shapps has used a Buzzfeed list to attack Labour. </a>He has produced a Buzzfeed posted entitled: 12 Facts - Why Energy Bills Are Sky High And What We Could Do About It.</p> <p><a href=\"http://revolts.co.uk/?p=628\">• Philip Cowley and Mark Stuart on their Revolts blog list the 10 most interesting votes in the Commons since 2010.</a></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528258ede4b07aa4168b4aba\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T16:36:46.001Z\">4.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Hansard for the opening of the bedroom tax debate is now<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/todays-commons-debates/read/unknown/369/\"> on the Hansard website.</a></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528256ede4b0f37bee4ff5bc\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T16:29:57.891Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In the Commons the Tory MP<strong> David TC Davies</strong> defended the government's bedroom tax.

Why should the state be paying for two people to set up in, frankly, a teenage love nest? </p> <p>When I was 17 years old, if I wanted to see my girlfriend at the age of 17, I would go and see her on a park bench in Newport. Why is the government paying for them to have a flat all by themselves at all, never-mind whether it's one-bedroom or two-bedroom? </p> <p>And I got into a lot a of trouble because I suggested to the young man that perhaps he should go out and find a job himself. And he said there weren't any... I said, 'Well why don't you move to where the work is' and I immediately ran into a whole load of criticism for that. </p> <p>I even had someone email me here. He said, 'You're a Christian, you should be serving the Lord, one day you will stand by the Lord and account for this hardship'. </p> <p>And I wrote back and said, 'I read my bible, I don't see anywhere in the bible where it says 17 year olds should be given a flat but I see plenty of examples of people who have had to move for a better way of life, whether it was Abraham going off to the Promised Land or Moses or the disciples who toured all over Europe'. They all moved.</p> </blockquote> <p>I've taken the quote from the Press Association.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528253efe4b07aa4168b4ab2\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T16:18:08.885Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Four Lib Dem MPs have tabled a Commons early day motion saying that the bedroom tax is a mistake and that, unless there are extensive changes - including a wider range of exemptions, and the removal of penalties from people who do not have the option of moving to a smaller home - it should be abolished.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2013-14/705\">You can read the text of the motion here. </a>Broadly it reflects the motion passed at the Lib Dem conference in September.</p> <p>The four Lib Dem MPs are: Greg Mulholland, Ian Swales, Adrian Sanders and Roger Williams.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528251dee4b0f37bee4ff5b4\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T16:10:49.089Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Caroline Lucas</strong>, the Green MP, used an intervention at the start of the bedroom tax debate to condemn the policy. She has sent out a news release saying that 1,270 people in Brighton and Hove are affected by the policy, of whom 300 are now behind with their rent. Of those 300 people, 205 are disabled.</p> <p>The Green-led council in Brighton and Hove has a policy of not evicting people who fall behind with their rent because of the bedroom tax, she says.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a brutal policy, and the government simply doesn’t care that some of the most vulnerable in our society – many of whom have disabilities – are being hit hard.</p> <p>It’s worse than Victorian that the poor are being targeted by this tax, especially when the richest are benefiting from tax cuts. And it’s horrifying that such a high proportion of those affected are disabled. The policy risks pushing people who are already desperate into the hands of pay day loan sharks.</p> <p>The bedroom tax is a cruel and counterproductive measure from a government that seems completely indifferent to the impact of its policies.</p> <p>They say that people can get money from the discretionary housing payments fund but that just isn’t enough. It has to help people affected by all the welfare cuts. Brighton and Hove City Council’s DHP allocation for this year is just over &pound;1m. That’s a drop in the ocean compared to the total reduction in benefit expenditure resulting from all the government’s cuts, which is over &pound;13m.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52824daae4b0f37bee4ff5ad\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:51:10.078Z\">3.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Citizens Advice does not get a vote in this evening's division on the bedroom tax.

Thousands are being pushed into arrears, 96 per cent of people affected have no alternative smaller homes to move into and some housing associations say they are being forced to demolish homes whilst 1.8 million languish on waiting lists.</p> <p>The number of issues of rent arrears that Citizens Advice Bureaux deal with is rising fast. The sky-high cost of housing is a huge strain on our clients’ budgets and is pushing many into the arms of payday lenders.</p> <p>Ministers are right to seek value for money, but the rushed nature of these changes and the lack of alternative housing means many will be caught in a catch-22 and unable to avoid the extra cost.</p> <p>The fundamental problem with the high cost of Housing Benefit is the lack of houses, not the families who live in them. This upside-down approach to policy does nothing to tackle the chronic housing shortage we face in the UK.</p> <p>For many disabled people and their families, having a second bedroom is not a luxury but an indispensible necessity. The under-occupancy penalty risks forcing a small number of families to bear the burden of years of under-investment in our housing stock.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52824a31e4b07aa4168b4aa7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:34:13.684Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And here's what the Labour MP <strong>Stephen Pound</strong> said about his brother being a victim of the bedroom tax in the debate.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a young man who lives in Earls Court who is in total renal failure.

I've taken the quote from the Press Association.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's a shame that the pensions minister [Steve Webb] does not listen to his own party who only in September at the Liberal Democrat party conference voted overwhelmingly against the bedroom tax, saying that it is 'discriminating against the most vulnerable in society' and noted that the government had shown 'a lack of appreciation of the housing requirements of children and adults with disabilities and care needs'. </p> <p>But I am afraid that's what you get with the Liberal Democrats. They say one thing at their conference and when they are out on the doorsteps but they vote another way in here when it really counts. When they could make a difference they turn the other way. </p> <p>So while the work and pensions secretary [Iain Duncan Smith] scuttles off to Paris, he gets his Liberal Democrat pensions minister to defend a policy that isn't even part of his brief and is in contradiction with his own party's policy. I say shame on him and shame on his party.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52824443e4b0f37bee4ff59b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:15:58.492Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Tim Farron</strong>, the Lib Dem president, is set to vote against the government on the bedroom tax tonight, I'm told. A friend of Farron's tells me:&nbsp;&quot;Party conference in Glasgow expressed its will very strongly against the bedroom tax and so Tim is listening to party members and will probably be voting against the government tonight. Tim is the voice of the party members, they have expressed their view and Tim wants to make sure that their voice is heard.&quot;</p> <p>Here's<a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/siteFiles/resources/docs/conference/2013%20Autumn/Policy/F27.pdf\"> the motion on the bedroom tax that the Lib Dems passed at their party conference (pdf).&nbsp;</a>It criticised the policy, and called for an immediate review of its impact.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52823be8e4b0f37bee4ff592\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T14:49:35.407Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Rachel Reeves v Steve Webb - Verdict:</strong> Labour MPs have been claiming that Iain Duncan Smith stayed away today because he was too embarrassed to defend his bedroom tax policy. Having just heard the opening of the debate, another possibility occurs; perhaps he just realised that Steve Webb would do a better job. There is virtually nothing in the welfare portfolio harder to defend than the bedroom tax, and Duncan Smith (who is easily riled) would have probably ended up sounding shouty and belligerent if he had been here to respond to Rachel Reeves. Webb, though, was good. Defending sound policies is fairly easily, but the real test in the Commons comes when you are asked to defend the indefensible, and Webb managed about as well anyone could in the circumstances. But ultimately he was on a hopeless mission. Reeves hammered away at the injustices and inconsistencies of the bedroom with brisk, machine-gun efficiency, but it was the Labour interventions, and the stories they contained, that really sunk the government. (The Tory interventions were particularly poor.) The problems with the bedroom tax have been extensively documented already, but this was still an unusually moving opening to a debate.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52823a7be4b0f37bee4ff590\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T14:27:50.633Z\">2.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Webb tells MPs that, if someone comes to see them with a hard case, they should ask the council if it has spent all the money available for discretionary payments. And, if it has, they should ask it if it has asked the government for more money.</p> <p>Labour has nothing to say on the deficit, he says again.&nbsp;</p> <p>And that's it.

Will the government exempt people who have applied to swap homes but are still waiting for a smaller property to become available?</p> <p>Webb says the Lib Dem motion on the bedroom tax was better than Labour.</p> <p>In response to a question about Manchester, he says Manchester returned &pound;595,000 last year which it received for discretionary housing payments (DHP) but did not use.

But at the end of the year councils returned &pound;10m.</p> <p>Webb says last year the government allocated &pound;60m.

Urgent and Emergency Care covers a range of areas including: A&amp;E departments, NHS 111 centres and other emergency telephone services, ambulances, minor injury units, and urgent care centres. </p> <p>The review is being led by Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England’s Medical Director. A report on Phase 1 of the review is being published tomorrow and it is embargoed until then.</p> <p>This is an NHS England report. NHS England is an independent body, accountable to me through the Mandate. The report being published tomorrow is a preliminary one, setting out initial thinking. A final version will be published in the new year.</p> <p>Sir Bruce has said that he will outline initial proposals and recommendations for the future of urgent and emergency care services in England. These have been informed by an engagement exercise that took place between June and August this year.</p> <p>These proposals will be further consulted upon through a number of channels including commissioning guidance and demonstrator sites. Spring 2014 will see another progress report.</p> <p>Decisions on changing services are taken at a local level by commissioners and providers, in consultation with all interested parties. That is exactly as it should be, Mr Speaker, as only then can the system be responsive to local needs.</p> <p>It is vital to ensure that both urgent and emergency care and the wider health and care system remain sustainable and readily understandable for patients.&nbsp;</p> <p>A&amp;E performance levels have largely been maintained thanks to the expertise and dedication of NHS staff. A&amp;E departments see 95% of patients within four hours and this figure hasn’t dropped below the 95% target since the end of April.</p> <p>But urgent and emergency care is falling behind the public’s needs and expectations.</p> <p>The number of people going to A&amp;E departments has risen historically, not least because of an ageing population. A million more people are coming through the doors than in 2010.</p> <p>Winter inevitably further challenges the system, which is why we are supporting the most under-pressure A&amp;Es with &pound;250 million. Planning has started earlier than ever before this year, and the NHS has been extremely focused on preparing for additional pressure.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, we will look at Sir Bruce’s report extremely carefully. Reform of the urgent and emergency care system may take years to complete, but that does not mean that it is not achievable.</p> <p>We are exceptionally fortunate in this country to have in the NHS one of the world’s great institutions. Patients need to know that it will continue to be there for them whenever they need it. </p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52822607e4b0f37bee4ff578\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T13:00:41.160Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Labour's<strong> Graham Jones</strong> says 36,000 people used his local walk-in centre.

It’s pass-throughs onto the bills – the policies that come through because of the government policies and because of the need to invest in networks and in distributions.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• She rejected a suggestion that the energy companies wanted green levies to be scrapped.</strong> What they wanted was a debate over whether those measures should be funded through bills, or whether they should be funded by central government, she said.</p> <p>I've taken the quote from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p>And here is some Twitter coverage of her speech to the conference.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EnergyUKcomms/statuses/400197389845147648\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>'The total economic value added to the country by the industry is a whopping &pound;102billion' - Angela Knight <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EUKConf13&amp;src=hash\">#EUKConf13</a></p>— Energy UK (@EnergyUKcomms) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EnergyUKcomms/statuses/400197389845147648\">November 12, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Janet_qofe/statuses/400197864389103617\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>'Energy industry pays its taxes' insists Angela Knight <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23eukconf13&amp;src=hash\">#eukconf13</a></p>— Janet Wood (@Janet_qofe) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Janet_qofe/statuses/400197864389103617\">November 12, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoannaElson/statuses/400197976347648000\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Angela Knight at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EUKConf13&amp;src=hash\">#EUKConf13</a> 'trust is hard to gain and easy to lose' and 'industry well recognises that mistakes have been made'.</p>— Joanna Elson (@JoannaElson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoannaElson/statuses/400197976347648000\">November 12, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Rachel_Spike/statuses/400199449836023808\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>'Now is the time to park the blame game and work together for the future' Angela Knight <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23eukconf13&amp;src=hash\">#eukconf13</a></p>— Rachel RickardStraus (@Rachel_Spike) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rachel_Spike/statuses/400199449836023808\">November 12, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-44a8c7a8-e702-480d-ae6b-55ab97336b28\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2009/11/16/1258402072124/Angela-Knight-001.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Knight\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Angela Knight.

It is so difficult for people to work out what exactly they are paying for that they fear the big energy companies are taking them for a ride when bills go up.</p> <p>Fair or not, they look at the big suppliers and they see a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks. So this is a ‘fred the shred’ moment for the industry. You deliver an essential public service, so your industry must serve the public – and the public must have trust in what you do.</p> <p>So we have opened up our books and we are looking at how we can reduce the impact of government policies on bills.</p> <p>&nbsp;But our commitment must be matched by a commitment in industry to open up your books and set out exactly how you are bearing down on your own costs to make bills as low as possible.</p> <p>The industry must be much more transparent and Ofgem will have our full support to introduce whatever regulations are necessary to deliver that greater transparency.</p> </blockquote> <p>Comparing the energy firms to the banks may not go down particularly well, but at least Angela Knight, Energy UK's chief executive, will feel at home.

I will concentrate particularly on the Ed Davey speech, and the opening of the Commons debate on the bedroom tax, but there is plenty of other politics to keep an eye on too. Here's the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Inflation figures are released.</p> <p><em>10.15am:</em> The Probation Chiefs Association and the Probation Association give evidence to the Commons justice committee.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Ed Miliband gives a speech announcing a Labour taskforce looking at digital skills. As Patrick Wintour reports, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/ed-miliband-tackle-uk-it-dependence-overseas-workers\">Miliband will say that it will be headed by the former Tomorrow's World presenter Maggie Philbin.</a></p> <p><em>11.15am:</em> Justine Greening, the international development secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international development committee about the development implications of Scottish independence.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Michael Gove, the education secretary, gives a speech on children's services. As Randeep Ramesh reports, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/12/michael-gove-reform-social-work\">Gove will announce a &quot;personal&quot; mission for a radical plan to reform social work on Monday – citing his own life which was &quot;transformed because of the skill of social workers and the love of parents who were not my biological mother and father&quot; as proof of the profession's power to change lives.</a></p> <p><em>11.50am:</em>&nbsp;Ed Davey, the energy secretary, speaks at the Energy UK annual conference. As Damian Carrington reports,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/11/ed-davey-public-trust-energy-companies\">Davey will say that energy companies are facing are facing a &quot;Fred the Shred&quot; moment because the public sees in them &quot;a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks&quot;.</a></p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion calling for the repeal of the bedroom tax. Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary, will open for Labour, but <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2013-11-12/iain-duncan-smith-to-miss-bedroom-tax-debate-in-commons/\">Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, will not be responding.</a> Instead it will be another minister.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Norman Lamb, the care minister, gives evidence to the Commons health committee on managing long-term care conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>2.45pm:</em> David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorist legislation, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. My colleague Paul Owen will be covering the hearing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/nsa-files-live\">on his NSA files live blog.</a></p> <p>As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary before 12.30pm and another in the afternoon.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T09:31:15.831Z\">at 9.31am GMT</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422262919|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|4a84447b5577ddde3d9c154df96f4346ba2d946f -->",

        "headline":"Want an energy revolution? Think beyond the big six",
        "body":"<p>As American economists like to observe, blaming any market failure on greed is <a href=\"http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2011/12/misguided_occupiers.html\" title=\"\">like blaming a&nbsp;plane crash on gravity</a>: gravity is always with us; what we need to know is why the plane crashed this time. When I thought that was a quote from <a href=\"http://akliman.squarespace.com\" title=\"\">Andrew Kliman</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kliman\" title=\"\">Marxist economist at Pace University</a>, I&nbsp;thought: \"Quite so! Let's look for some real answers!\" When I discovered that it was, in fact, the neoliberal <a href=\"http://www.tsowell.com\" title=\"\">Thomas Sowell, professor at Stanford</a>, I thought \"Screw you! That's easy to say, but gravity isn't out to get us.\"</p><p>Do we accept greed as a fact of life and try to find ways of curbing it and regulating it, so that we can live with it&nbsp;and move forward? Or do we rail against it, and try to create social conditions in which greedy people are at least slightly embarrassed about it? I don't have the answer to that, and it may well be the fundamental question.</p><p>But in the energy debate, there are&nbsp;better answers than any proffered by politicians, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/11/ed-davey-public-trust-energy-companies\" title=\"\">Ed Davey's \"greed speech\"</a> on Tuesday, in which he said that energy companies were starting to lose public trust and were seen to be&nbsp;reflecting the \"greed that consumed the banks\", to David Cameron's rather bashful suggestion that what the energy&nbsp;industry really needs is a policy&nbsp;review (nobody panic – this isn't&nbsp;foot-dragging; the prime minister said he wanted it \"immediately\").</p><p>All politicians want this story to be about greed. They differ only as to whose fault the greed is, or who didn't do enough to rein it in. This makes superficial sense: there are six big energy firms whereas there used to be 20, and these are exactly the cabalistic conditions in which greed runs riot.</p><p>Cameron blames Labour for this, as the last time it was in government it relaxed the competition law around energy. Like so much of politics&nbsp;that centres on whose fault it&nbsp;is rather than what to do about it, this is&nbsp;meaningless. If the Conservatives were such huge fans of competition, they would have voted against this law&nbsp;in the first place.</p><p>\"Greed\" is an unhelpful diagnosis, but the question of fault is less helpful still. And the notion of a review – into why companies who should be competing instead appear to be collaborating, and all putting up their prices at the same time, by roughly the same amount, in response to the same world price conditions which are, in fact, static – is about as much help as a price freeze at an astronomically high baseline.</p><p>Periodically, somebody raises the fact that most of our so-called big six are foreign companies, and ascribes to this their failure to take into account human considerations – like \"can anybody afford it?\" – when they raise their prices.</p><p>This doesn't stack up – the smallest price rise in the recent hike is French group EDF, at a cartel-busting (according to the Telegraph) 3.6%. The next lowest is E.ON, at 6.6%, which is a German company. Yet the highest, at an eye-watering 10.4%, is Npower, which is also&nbsp;German. And British Gas doesn't indulge in much nationalistic sentimentality, with its 9.2% rise.</p><p>The astonishing backdrop to this is that 68% of people in a <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/04/nationalise-energy-and-rail-companies-say-public/\" title=\"\">YouGov poll last&nbsp;week</a> thought that energy should be nationalised. And even if the nationality of the sector doesn't matter, it doesn't follow that nationalising wouldn't have any effect – a government would be answerable to a populace. It would have to explain why its prices had gone up relative to the world price; it would be able to introduce tariffs in which thriftiness among the affluent could be encouraged, without resulting in even greater hardship for the fuel-poor.</p><p>But there's an aspect of the nature of&nbsp;ownership that is even more important than what it does to our bills. When you own a stake in the energy you use, you use less of it. <a href=\"http://www.solarschools.org.uk\" title=\"\">Solar Schools</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.1010global.org/uk\" title=\"\">10:10</a> carbon reduction project, has been a striking example of this. Schools have always been able to get a solar scheme off the ground with help from one of the big six; but the real behavioural change happens when they raise the money, they build the panels and they get the savings. Likewise, people can invest in a renewable project but it doesn't necessarily change their own energy behaviour; negawatts (units of energy saved) are generated when people build their own wind turbine, and it powers their own town. \"Tangibility\" is the word that comes up constantly – you don't waste it when you can conceive of the energy you have invested in coming in to your house. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/30/germany-renewable-energy-revolution\" title=\"\">Feldheim, in Germany</a>, is the most evolved example of this in Europe, and possibly in the world: it powers itself entirely on wind, solar and biogas. All the financial investment is from the villagers, of whom there are 150. The numbers are slightly messed up now by its massive eco-tourist trade, but this much is clear: when you are a stakeholder you pay less and you use less. Naturally, at the level of the individual, this only applies to renewables. There's no scope to buy a small share in your local coal mine or oil refinery. So there's an inevitable slant towards sustainable energy – which is the direction I'd like to go in anyway. But if we could take ownership of energy, whatever its source, at a national level, we might see the same behavioural changes played out at that level – a real negawatt revolution. We have problems that are bigger than bills, but all the answers are eerily similar: think beyond the big six.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams </em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422316648|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|3033d74e5765b2e20d7d3189c0617cdc95078f95 -->",

        "body":"<p>Consumers are being urged to beware the pitfalls when using price comparison sites to find best deals on everything from energy to savings. The latest warning comes as we are all being encouraged to switch in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/oct/31/british-energy-suppliers-price-hikes-explanations-do-not-add-up\" title=\"\">winter price hikes</a> from the majority of the big six gas and elecricity suppliers.</p><p>Consumers can enter the size of their bill and the name of their existing provider on sites such as Moneysupermarket.com and uSwitch.com to work out how much energy they use. But the calculations are based on the new, higher tariffs. This means there is a risk of underestimating the amount of energy they actually use.</p><p>Mark Todd, of Energyhelpline.com, advises consumers to enter their usage in kilowatt hours, or inflate their bills by the price rise themselves. \"This is an industry-wide issue for all energy price quoting tools during price rises.\"</p><p>Meanwhile uSwitch.com is talking to the regulator Ofgem and other accredited sites about the issue.</p><h2><strong>Savings</strong></h2><p>With inflation standing at 2.7%, we also put our trust in these websites to help us get the best rate on our savings.</p><p>But commission is paid to these sites by some banks and building societies that could result in missing out on the best deal.</p><p>Some of those paying commission are promoted by omitting savings accounts from other providers that don't pay a fee in a list of top rates.</p><p>However, following criticism, Moneysupermarket.com, visited by more than 40 million users in 2012, has tweaked its search process to make it clearer that there are two different types of lists – one with \"featured\" accounts and one with \"all accounts\".</p><p>Yet to get a true list of the best-paying accounts from across all UK banks, the user still needs to select \"all accounts\" buried at the bottom of the list. The site has also scrapped a tick-box, hidden from initial view, which was automatically ticked without the consumer's knowledge and removed savings providers that do not pay fees.</p><p>Kenny Jacobs, chief marketing officer at Moneysupermarket.com, says: \"We do show the entire market, although not every account can be applied for directly. We have&nbsp;made this clearer to customers.\"</p><p>Jasmine Birtles from Moneymagpie.com says when it comes to banking, Moneyfacts.co.uk is the \"cleanest\" of the comparison services. \"However, it's not as easy to use as some of the others,\" she adds.</p><h2><strong>Insurance</strong></h2><p>When getting a quote for an insurance policy some sites make assumptions about your situation, warns consumer group Which? These may be appropriate to your needs, but pay careful attention in case they do not apply to you.</p><p>A spokesman says: \"If your home has a thatched roof or if you live on a flood plain, you may have to provide the website with this specific information – and if you forget, or can't find a way to do so, you could be at risk of buying a policy that, if the worst happened, means you may not be able to claim.\"</p><p>Birtles says that consumers should be on their guard with all comparison sites. \"They are useful but need to be used with caution,\" she says.</p><p>This is particularly true of motor insurance, where there's a huge amount of competition. \"In this case it's helpful to speak to a broker on the phone – like AA or Kwikfit – where you can keep telling them you want a better price or you'll go elsewhere. It's amazing how they can magic up cheaper and better rates.\"</p><p>Which? recommends checking more than one site when searching for any financial product. Meanwhile the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), promises: \"We will review the risks that price comparison websites present and whether they comply with regulatory requirements.\"</p><p>Martin Wheatley, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, recently told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee that he thought price comparison websites were all being \"gamed\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422025964|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|5aaf6004a5999cd44978bf32856d5f03167f7882 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ed Miliband  has claimed that key public services would save £100m if the coalition backed his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/ed-miliband-energy-price-freeze-tories\" title=\"\">party's energy price freeze</a>.</p><p></p><p>The Labour leader, visiting the target seat of Hornsey and Wood Green in north London on Saturday, unveiled new figures which he said showed that the NHS alone would save more than £40m, equivalent to the salaries of 1,300 nurses.</p><p></p><p>Schools, he said, would save £28m, equivalent to the salaries of more than 700 teachers, if the government enforced a 20-month price freeze on the energy firms today.</p><p></p><p>Labour said that savings to the wider public sector, including local authorities, meant the final savings figure would be even higher.</p><p></p><p>However Miliband's figures drew a vigorous response from the government. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Sajid Javid, said Labour had \"got their sums wrong\". He added: \"Their policy would actually cost the public finances more in lost VAT and corporation tax - meaning more borrowing and more debt, exactly what got us into a mess in the first place.</p><p>\"But Labour's price freeze is a price con - it would mean rising prices before, rising prices after, and even Ed Miliband says he would break his promise if there is a wholesale price rise during the freeze. That's why hard-working people won't believe Ed Miliband would deliver on his promise.\"</p><p></p><p>Miliband's claims came in a speech given on a tour of the north London constituency alongside his prospective parliamentary candidate, Catherine West, whose main opponent in 2015 will be the incumbent Liberal Democrat MP, Lynne Featherstone.</p><p></p><p>Miliband said: \"If Labour win the next election, we will freeze energy prices until 2017.</p><p>\"Labour's price freeze will save families an average £120 and an average small business user would benefit by over £5,000.</p><p></p><p>\"But it's not just Britain's families and businesses that would benefit from this price freeze, it's our vital public services too.</p><p></p><p>\"New figures today show that if David Cameron put in place our freeze today, public services would save £100m.</p><p></p><p>\"And that matters more than ever in an era when there's less money around. The NHS is one of our vital national institutions and one of the biggest users of energy. If David Cameron got on and implemented our energy price freeze today the NHS would benefit to the tune of £40m to help it deal with this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/02/winter-hospitals-crisis-nhs-warning\" title=\"\">winter's A&amp;E crisis</a>, the equivalent of the salaries of 1,300 nurses.</p><p></p><p>\"Our schools could save £28m, that's the same as the salaries of over 700 teachers. This freeze will happen under the next Labour government.\"</p><p></p><p>Chris Leslie MP, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, who compiled the data showing how much government departments would save from an energy freeze, said: \"These figures show that it's not only households and businesses that are paying the price for a broken energy market, it's the taxpayer too.</p><p>\"We need Labour's price freeze and reforms to the energy market - not only to help hard-pressed families, but to spare the taxpayer these higher costs too.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422076548|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|be3ab41b57eee6d8c145feb9c9f8adddd1011aa8 -->",

        "headline":"Cameron's green levy threat 'devastating' energy efficiency industry",
        "body":"<p>David Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/23/energy-industry-competition-test-cameron\" title=\"\">pledge to drop green charges on energy bills</a> is having a \"wholly devastating impact\" on the energy efficiency industry, according to the UK's biggest insulation manufacturer.</p><p>Following controversy over rising energy prices, the government is reviewing the levies, which support energy efficiency and renewable power, after the prime minister said last month that such charges needed to be \"rolled back\".</p><p>John Sinfield, managing director of Knauf Insulation, said in a letter to the prime minister: \"Do you really want to condemn more families to the choice of eating or heating this winter? Addressing the energy efficiency of our homes is the only route which offers permanent savings year on year.\"</p><p>While the biggest cause of soaring energy bills in recent years has been rising gas prices, green levies make up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/oct/10/green-taxes-energy-bill-fuel-sse-price-rising\" title=\"\">9% of energy bills</a>. About half of the levies fund a scheme called the Energy Companies Obligation (Eco), which insulates the draughty homes of people receiving benefits and a bill-discount scheme for pensioners. Ministers have repeatedly signalled that the scheme, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10413354/Green-taxes-cut-would-lower-energy-bills-within-weeks.html\" title=\"\">which the big six energy companies have lobbied against</a>, will be changed.</p><p>\"I write to you to inform you of the wholly devastating impact already being caused to the energy efficiency industry, further to your announcement on green levies at PMQs,\" said Sinfield.</p><p>He added: \"Eco has been designed poorly, implemented badly and has not delivered on its potential. But it is not broken. My plea to you is to put the policy right … rather than consider sacrificing it at the altar of short-term political point scoring.\" At least five other companies and organisations have also written to Cameron expressing the same fears. Geoff Mackey, a director at another major insulation manufacturer, BASF, said Eco was important and targeted at those who most needed it, but that it could be improved.</p><p>The UK has the worst levels of fuel poverty in the EU after Estonia, and the government's official advisor on fuel poverty told the Guardian in October that any cut to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/11/osborne-plan-cut-energy-company-obligation\" title=\"\">Eco scheme would be \"unforgivable\"</a>. Andrew Warren, from the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said attempting to cut energy bills by cutting Eco was \"utterly peverse\". He said: \"Clearly the best way of responding to the big six's greed is to minimise the need for their product.\"</p><p>Warren, who <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2305390/industry-warns-green-levy-review-is-having-devastating-impact-on-eco-insulators\" title=\"\">himself wrote to Cameron</a> last Thursday, said the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/nov/07/green-tax-energy-bills-renewables\" title=\"\">uncertainty created</a> by Cameron's pledge to review green levies had already caused Eco projects to be abandoned. He said 7,000 jobs had been lost in the insulation business due to a crash in demand since January when Eco replaced previous policies, and the new uncertainty would lead to new job losses.</p><p>The UK has the oldest housing stock in Europe and over 5m homes still lack cavity wall insulation, while 7m lofts are inadequately insulated. Sinfield described the government's flagship energy efficiency policy, the green deal, as \"failing\". The scheme allows homeowners to pay for insulation measures using loans that are paid back using the savings they made on energy bills.</p><p>Ministers claimed the green deal would treat 14m homes by 2020, but since January <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/npower-energy-efficiency/green-deal-government-data-break-down\" title=\"\">just 57 green deals have been completed</a>. \"We in the industry have put to you what a successful Eco and green deal would look like time and time again,\" said Sinfield in the letter.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422032784|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|ccf5c09865141181758caa875af781773598e16a -->",

This sounds contradictory but as the great historian David Kynaston <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10412144/Private-schools-are-blocking-social-mobility.html\">has written</a>, private schools are “those highly resourced, highly skilled and ferociously dedicated blockers of downward mobility”. They perpetuate networks of privilege but they are presumably also fantastic schools. This combination of positional and actual good helps explain why their fees have gone up so quickly in the two decades – and why many families scrimp and save to send their kids there ...</p> <p>It is less than clear what Sir John is recommending be done. Perhaps he just wants the Tory leadership to come across as less posh than they are. He dutifully mentions education, which is of course important, especially in the early years. But if what he genuinely wants is an end to private schools’ dominance of British life he would surely need to engage with what Prof Kynaston says: that unless something is done to stop them being so exclusive and so good at what they do, then “the current political consensus is … almost meaningless.”</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2013/11/from-lordashcroft-2.html\">• Lord Ashcroft at ConservativeHome says he can understand why Ed Miliband wants leaders' debate before the election, but that they could backfire.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The risk for Mr Miliband is that far from giving him a chance to explain why he thinks price controls are workable, TV debates would further expose the idea’s superficiality. As President Bartlet observed in the <em>West Wing</em>, the ten-word answer can be deadly in politics, but where are the next ten words, and the ten after that? And as Henrique Capriles, the Venezuelan opposition leader, said of President Maduro, “every time he opens his mouth, he scares away the investments that create employment and worsens the crisis”. Rather than transforming perceptions of Miliband after five years as Labour leader, TV debates could confirm them. Meanwhile, they would allow Cameron and Clegg to argue at greater length that higher living standards are achieved by proper economic management, not least controlling the deficit, and by encouraging businesses rather than threatening them.</p> <p>These are risks, not certainties. A gamble on TV debates may yet help Labour, if the Tories can be persuaded to take part despite having more to lose. But Miliband’s eagerness to hold them is not a signal of confidence. It’s the opposite.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/grantshapps/12-facts-why-your-energy-bills-are-sky-high-and-giew\">• Grant Shapps has used a Buzzfeed list to attack Labour. </a>He has produced a Buzzfeed posted entitled: 12 Facts - Why Energy Bills Are Sky High And What We Could Do About It.</p> <p><a href=\"http://revolts.co.uk/?p=628\">• Philip Cowley and Mark Stuart on their Revolts blog list the 10 most interesting votes in the Commons since 2010.</a></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528258ede4b07aa4168b4aba\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T16:36:46.001Z\">4.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Hansard for the opening of the bedroom tax debate is now<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/todays-commons-debates/read/unknown/369/\"> on the Hansard website.</a></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528256ede4b0f37bee4ff5bc\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T16:29:57.891Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In the Commons the Tory MP<strong> David TC Davies</strong> defended the government's bedroom tax.

Why should the state be paying for two people to set up in, frankly, a teenage love nest? </p> <p>When I was 17 years old, if I wanted to see my girlfriend at the age of 17, I would go and see her on a park bench in Newport. Why is the government paying for them to have a flat all by themselves at all, never-mind whether it's one-bedroom or two-bedroom? </p> <p>And I got into a lot a of trouble because I suggested to the young man that perhaps he should go out and find a job himself. And he said there weren't any... I said, 'Well why don't you move to where the work is' and I immediately ran into a whole load of criticism for that. </p> <p>I even had someone email me here. He said, 'You're a Christian, you should be serving the Lord, one day you will stand by the Lord and account for this hardship'. </p> <p>And I wrote back and said, 'I read my bible, I don't see anywhere in the bible where it says 17 year olds should be given a flat but I see plenty of examples of people who have had to move for a better way of life, whether it was Abraham going off to the Promised Land or Moses or the disciples who toured all over Europe'.

She has sent out a news release saying that 1,270 people in Brighton and Hove are affected by the policy, of whom 300 are now behind with their rent. Of those 300 people, 205 are disabled.</p> <p>The Green-led council in Brighton and Hove has a policy of not evicting people who fall behind with their rent because of the bedroom tax, she says.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a brutal policy, and the government simply doesn’t care that some of the most vulnerable in our society – many of whom have disabilities – are being hit hard.</p> <p>It’s worse than Victorian that the poor are being targeted by this tax, especially when the richest are benefiting from tax cuts. And it’s horrifying that such a high proportion of those affected are disabled. The policy risks pushing people who are already desperate into the hands of pay day loan sharks.</p> <p>The bedroom tax is a cruel and counterproductive measure from a government that seems completely indifferent to the impact of its policies.</p> <p>They say that people can get money from the discretionary housing payments fund but that just isn’t enough. It has to help people affected by all the welfare cuts. Brighton and Hove City Council’s DHP allocation for this year is just over &pound;1m. That’s a drop in the ocean compared to the total reduction in benefit expenditure resulting from all the government’s cuts, which is over &pound;13m.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52824daae4b0f37bee4ff5ad\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:51:10.078Z\">3.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Citizens Advice does not get a vote in this evening's division on the bedroom tax.

Thousands are being pushed into arrears, 96 per cent of people affected have no alternative smaller homes to move into and some housing associations say they are being forced to demolish homes whilst 1.8 million languish on waiting lists.</p> <p>The number of issues of rent arrears that Citizens Advice Bureaux deal with is rising fast. The sky-high cost of housing is a huge strain on our clients’ budgets and is pushing many into the arms of payday lenders.</p> <p>Ministers are right to seek value for money, but the rushed nature of these changes and the lack of alternative housing means many will be caught in a catch-22 and unable to avoid the extra cost.</p> <p>The fundamental problem with the high cost of Housing Benefit is the lack of houses, not the families who live in them. This upside-down approach to policy does nothing to tackle the chronic housing shortage we face in the UK.</p> <p>For many disabled people and their families, having a second bedroom is not a luxury but an indispensible necessity. The under-occupancy penalty risks forcing a small number of families to bear the burden of years of under-investment in our housing stock.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52824a31e4b07aa4168b4aa7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:34:13.684Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And here's what the Labour MP <strong>Stephen Pound</strong> said about his brother being a victim of the bedroom tax in the debate.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a young man who lives in Earls Court who is in total renal failure.

I've taken the quote from the Press Association.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's a shame that the pensions minister [Steve Webb] does not listen to his own party who only in September at the Liberal Democrat party conference voted overwhelmingly against the bedroom tax, saying that it is 'discriminating against the most vulnerable in society' and noted that the government had shown 'a lack of appreciation of the housing requirements of children and adults with disabilities and care needs'. </p> <p>But I am afraid that's what you get with the Liberal Democrats. They say one thing at their conference and when they are out on the doorsteps but they vote another way in here when it really counts. When they could make a difference they turn the other way. </p> <p>So while the work and pensions secretary [Iain Duncan Smith] scuttles off to Paris, he gets his Liberal Democrat pensions minister to defend a policy that isn't even part of his brief and is in contradiction with his own party's policy. I say shame on him and shame on his party.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52824443e4b0f37bee4ff59b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:15:58.492Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Tim Farron</strong>, the Lib Dem president, is set to vote against the government on the bedroom tax tonight, I'm told. A friend of Farron's tells me:&nbsp;&quot;Party conference in Glasgow expressed its will very strongly against the bedroom tax and so Tim is listening to party members and will probably be voting against the government tonight. Tim is the voice of the party members, they have expressed their view and Tim wants to make sure that their voice is heard.&quot;</p> <p>Here's<a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/siteFiles/resources/docs/conference/2013%20Autumn/Policy/F27.pdf\"> the motion on the bedroom tax that the Lib Dems passed at their party conference (pdf).&nbsp;</a>It criticised the policy, and called for an immediate review of its impact.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52823be8e4b0f37bee4ff592\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T14:49:35.407Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Rachel Reeves v Steve Webb - Verdict:</strong> Labour MPs have been claiming that Iain Duncan Smith stayed away today because he was too embarrassed to defend his bedroom tax policy. Having just heard the opening of the debate, another possibility occurs; perhaps he just realised that Steve Webb would do a better job. There is virtually nothing in the welfare portfolio harder to defend than the bedroom tax, and Duncan Smith (who is easily riled) would have probably ended up sounding shouty and belligerent if he had been here to respond to Rachel Reeves. Webb, though, was good. Defending sound policies is fairly easily, but the real test in the Commons comes when you are asked to defend the indefensible, and Webb managed about as well anyone could in the circumstances. But ultimately he was on a hopeless mission. Reeves hammered away at the injustices and inconsistencies of the bedroom with brisk, machine-gun efficiency, but it was the Labour interventions, and the stories they contained, that really sunk the government. (The Tory interventions were particularly poor.) The problems with the bedroom tax have been extensively documented already, but this was still an unusually moving opening to a debate.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52823a7be4b0f37bee4ff590\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T14:27:50.633Z\">2.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Webb tells MPs that, if someone comes to see them with a hard case, they should ask the council if it has spent all the money available for discretionary payments. And, if it has, they should ask it if it has asked the government for more money.</p> <p>Labour has nothing to say on the deficit, he says again.&nbsp;</p> <p>And that's it.

He is talking about trying to get tenants to swap with other social housing tenants.</p> <p><strong>Simon Hughes</strong>, the Lib Dem deputy leader, says he supported the Lib Dem motion on the bedroom tax passed at the party conference. Will the government exempt people who have applied to swap homes but are still waiting for a smaller property to become available?</p> <p>Webb says the Lib Dem motion on the bedroom tax was better than Labour.</p> <p>In response to a question about Manchester, he says Manchester returned &pound;595,000 last year which it received for discretionary housing payments (DHP) but did not use. If Manchester is short of money this year, it can apply for more money, he says.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528237bae4b0f37bee4ff58e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T14:20:47.807Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Webb says he cannot commit the government to more money for remote rural communities.</p> <p>But Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, tends to be quite sensitive to the needs of communities like this, he says.</p> <p>Webb says Reeves did not mention the need to address the deficit.</p> <p>The welfare budget is the biggest in Whitehall.</p> <p>And housing benefit for social tenants is an area you have to look at.</p> <p>So spare rooms are an obvious issue to consider.</p> <p>Webb says there is an issue about adapted accommodation.</p> <p>The government could have tried writing down complex rules.</p> <p>But instead it decided it would be easier to allocate the discretionary money it would need to spend to help people with adapted homes and just give it to councils.</p> <p>Webb says last year, when the government gave councils money to make discretionary payments to help people with housing payments, Labour said it was not enough. But at the end of the year councils returned &pound;10m.</p> <p>Webb says last year the government allocated &pound;60m.

Urgent and Emergency Care covers a range of areas including: A&amp;E departments, NHS 111 centres and other emergency telephone services, ambulances, minor injury units, and urgent care centres. </p> <p>The review is being led by Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England’s Medical Director. A report on Phase 1 of the review is being published tomorrow and it is embargoed until then.</p> <p>This is an NHS England report. NHS England is an independent body, accountable to me through the Mandate. The report being published tomorrow is a preliminary one, setting out initial thinking. A final version will be published in the new year.</p> <p>Sir Bruce has said that he will outline initial proposals and recommendations for the future of urgent and emergency care services in England. These have been informed by an engagement exercise that took place between June and August this year.</p> <p>These proposals will be further consulted upon through a number of channels including commissioning guidance and demonstrator sites. Spring 2014 will see another progress report.</p> <p>Decisions on changing services are taken at a local level by commissioners and providers, in consultation with all interested parties. That is exactly as it should be, Mr Speaker, as only then can the system be responsive to local needs.</p> <p>It is vital to ensure that both urgent and emergency care and the wider health and care system remain sustainable and readily understandable for patients.&nbsp;</p> <p>A&amp;E performance levels have largely been maintained thanks to the expertise and dedication of NHS staff. A&amp;E departments see 95% of patients within four hours and this figure hasn’t dropped below the 95% target since the end of April.</p> <p>But urgent and emergency care is falling behind the public’s needs and expectations.</p> <p>The number of people going to A&amp;E departments has risen historically, not least because of an ageing population. A million more people are coming through the doors than in 2010.</p> <p>Winter inevitably further challenges the system, which is why we are supporting the most under-pressure A&amp;Es with &pound;250 million. Planning has started earlier than ever before this year, and the NHS has been extremely focused on preparing for additional pressure.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, we will look at Sir Bruce’s report extremely carefully. Reform of the urgent and emergency care system may take years to complete, but that does not mean that it is not achievable.</p> <p>We are exceptionally fortunate in this country to have in the NHS one of the world’s great institutions.

I will concentrate particularly on the Ed Davey speech, and the opening of the Commons debate on the bedroom tax, but there is plenty of other politics to keep an eye on too. Here's the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Inflation figures are released.</p> <p><em>10.15am:</em> The Probation Chiefs Association and the Probation Association give evidence to the Commons justice committee.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Ed Miliband gives a speech announcing a Labour taskforce looking at digital skills. As Patrick Wintour reports, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/ed-miliband-tackle-uk-it-dependence-overseas-workers\">Miliband will say that it will be headed by the former Tomorrow's World presenter Maggie Philbin.</a></p> <p><em>11.15am:</em> Justine Greening, the international development secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international development committee about the development implications of Scottish independence.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Michael Gove, the education secretary, gives a speech on children's services. As Randeep Ramesh reports, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/12/michael-gove-reform-social-work\">Gove will announce a &quot;personal&quot; mission for a radical plan to reform social work on Monday – citing his own life which was &quot;transformed because of the skill of social workers and the love of parents who were not my biological mother and father&quot; as proof of the profession's power to change lives.</a></p> <p><em>11.50am:</em>&nbsp;Ed Davey, the energy secretary, speaks at the Energy UK annual conference. As Damian Carrington reports,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/11/ed-davey-public-trust-energy-companies\">Davey will say that energy companies are facing are facing a &quot;Fred the Shred&quot; moment because the public sees in them &quot;a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks&quot;.</a></p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion calling for the repeal of the bedroom tax. Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary, will open for Labour, but <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2013-11-12/iain-duncan-smith-to-miss-bedroom-tax-debate-in-commons/\">Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, will not be responding.</a> Instead it will be another minister.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Norman Lamb, the care minister, gives evidence to the Commons health committee on managing long-term care conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>2.45pm:</em> David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorist legislation, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. My colleague Paul Owen will be covering the hearing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/nsa-files-live\">on his NSA files live blog.</a></p> <p>As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web.

        "body":"<p>EDF has become the latest energy company to raise prices for its customers, announcing an average price rise of 3.9% on its dual fuel tariffs and warning that more increases could come if the government does not cut fees for social and environmental work.</p><p>The firm said that from 3 January customers would see bills rise by £49 a year, to an average of £1,300, but it claimed it was \"holding back rising costs\" from government schemes to limit price rises.</p><p>The increase, which will also apply to customers taking just gas or electricity from EDF, is less than half those announced by rival firms including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/17/british-gas-energy-prices-gas-electricity-centrica\" title=\"\">British Gas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/24/scottish-power-raises-energy-prices-bills-gas-electricity\" title=\"\">Scottish Power</a>, but is unlikely to be welcomed by the two-thirds of EDF's 5.8 million business and residential customers not on fixed tariffs.</p><p>EDF said it had taken action ahead of the outcome of the government's review of the costs of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/helping-households-to-cut-their-energy-bills/supporting-pages/energy-companies-obligation-eco\" title=\"\">Eco scheme</a> to help vulnerable households and other green schemes, designed to bring down costs for consumers.</p><p>It said if the government made bigger changes to the costs of its social and environmental schemes than it had anticipated, it would pass those savings on to customers, but if the changes were smaller there could be further price rises.</p><p>The firm said the extra £49 on bills was made up of the following:</p><p>• £24 to meet a 9% rise in transmission and distribution costs</p><p>• £10 to meet smart-metering costs</p><p>• £6 to meet a 22% rise in the cost of meeting renewable obligations</p><p>• £1 to meet rising wholesale costs</p><p>• £8 to meet other rising costs including VAT, warm home discount, feed-in tariff</p><p>The price rise includes the removal of a 70p-a-month discount for dual fuel customers. It will be largest for customers in the south-east of England who will see bills rise by 4.3%, while in the south of Scotland bills will rise by just 2.78%.</p><p>The chief executive of EDF Energy, Vincent de Rivaz, said: \"The best way to help customers is for us to keep our prices as low as possible. I know that price rises are always unwelcome, but we have taken the first step to show what can be done if rising costs are tackled head-on.\"</p><p>De Rivaz said he supported social and environmental programmes, but that their cost and affordability had to be challenged.</p><p>\"Energy firms, politicians and consumer groups need to be part of the solution and stand on the side of customers to give them energy at an affordable price. That means operating as efficiently as possible and designing the most cost-effective social and environmental programmes,\" he said.</p><p>Reg Platt, senior research fellow at the thinktank IPPR said described the price rise as \"simply astonishing\".</p><p>He said: \"They have in effect issued a threat to government saying 'cut back your policies or we'll raise our prices further'. The policy they want to cut, Eco, provides households with insulation and efficient boilers to protect them against rising energy bills.</p><p>\"David Cameron has said he wants to roll back so-called 'green levies'. If this means the government is going to roll over to the energy companies and cut spending on energy efficiency policy it will be billpayers that get hurt.\"</p><p>The secretary of state for energy and climate, Ed Davey, has warned energy firms that they face a \"Fred the Shred\" moment because consumers' trust in them has broken down as it did with the banks.</p><p>Commenting on EDF's price increase, he said: \"Any price rise is disappointing but I'm encouraged that EDF have kept their price rise much closer to inflation than some of their competitors.</p><p>\"The competition we've introduced to the energy market means people have a choice. They can look for the best deal available; including from smaller suppliers, with the confidence that switching will make an immediate difference to their bills and force the Big Six to compete on price.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422267678|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|6e7f9bcd6ba66126ed115d0f2e81de9d972b981e -->",

        "headline":"Ed Davey: public trust in energy companies is breaking down",
        "body":"<p>Energy companies are facing a \"Fred the Shred\" moment because the public sees in them \"a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks\", the energy secretary, Ed Davey, will tell the industry on Tuesday.</p><p>Davey's linking of energy companies to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Goodwin\" title=\"\">Fred Goodwin</a>, the disgraced banker who led the Royal Bank of Scotland to collapse and a taxpayer bailout, raises the rhetoric of the heated and prolonged row over soaring energy bills to a new level.</p><p>In a speech at the annual conference of EnergyUK, which represents the industry, he will say: \"Trust between those who supply energy and those who use it is breaking down. It is so difficult for people to work out what exactly they are paying for, that they fear the big energy companies are taking them for a ride when bills go up.\"</p><p>He will claim: \"Fair or not, they look at the big suppliers and they see a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks. So this is a 'Fred the Shred' moment for the industry. You deliver an essential public service, so your industry must serve the public – and the public must have trust in what you do.\"</p><p>The comments follow accusations by Labour, which has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if elected, that the government has failed to take the side of the consumer.</p><p>Davey will tell the industry that the UK needs profitable energy companies so that they can invest in replacing the nation's ageing and dirty power stations. But he will warn: \"Those profits cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poorest in our society. Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders.\"</p><p>EnergyUK has said the profit margins of the big six are about 5%. Critics accept that is likely to be accurate for the parts of the energy businesses supplying domestic customers, but say the profit margins for the electricity generation arms of the companies are much higher.</p><p>Davey will also addresses the controversy over the, government-imposed green levies that make up 9% of the average duel-fuel bill. \"We have opened up our books and we are looking at how we can reduce the impact of government policies on bills,\" he will say. However, there is deep confusion over which of the numerous green levies are being scrutinised under the review announced by David Cameron in October.</p><p>The prime minister along with the energy minister, Michael Fallon, have insisted all the levies – including both those that cut energy bills for pensioners and those claiming benefits and those to support renewable energy – could be cut. Davey, a Lib Dem, and the Conservative climate change minister, Greg Barker, have both insisted renewable energy subsidies are not part of the review.</p><p>Davey will challenge the big six to be more transparent about the profits they make in both their retail and generation arms. \"Our commitment [over green levies] must be matched by a commitment in industry to open up your books and set out exactly how you are bearing down on your own costs to make bills as low as possible.\" He will say the regulator Ofgem will have the government's full support in forcing greater transparency if necessary.\"</p><p>A <a href=\"http://press.which.co.uk/whichpressreleases/consumer-trust-in-the-energy-industry-hits-new-low/\" title=\"\">poll published on 3 October</a> by consumer group Which shows just 15% of the public trust energy companies to act in customers' best interest, down from 27% before recent above-inflation price rises, making energy the most distrusted of all consumer industry sectors.</p><p>In response to Davey's comments at the Energy UK Annual Conference, Energy UK said: \"The energy industry is already working hard to ensure everyone can keep the lights on and stay warm this winter. The best way to do this is for everyone to work together which is why this tit for tat Punch and Judy show of insults is so unproductive.</p><p>\"The energy industry is vital to the UK. It is  a major employer, a serious investor and a significant taxpayer. As analysis form UBS shows about 95 per cent of rising energy costs are out of the hands of the energy companies and can be attributed to government policies and other network, social and environmental costs.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422224701|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|e1603e483706d29c8ce11d0e651df451bda409da -->",

        "body":"<p>Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, has accused the big six energy companies of using customers as \"cash cows\" by raising bills unfairly.</p><p>But he also renewed his attack on Ed Miliband, describing the Labour leader's proposal to freeze energy prices as \"intellectually bankrupt\".</p><p>Davey was speaking at the annual conference of Energy UK, the lobby group for the power industry, on the day in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/12/edf-energy-price-increase\" title=\"\">EDF became the latest firm to raise prices.</a></p><p>He noted the rise by the French group was more \"modest\" than others but urged consumers to vote with their feet by switching to cheaper suppliers. \"Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders,\" he said. \"And frankly, the latest round of bill rises have not been fully and openly justified.\"</p><p>Davey said the energy industry faced a \"Fred the Shred\" moment where they could take action to be more responsible or risk being pilloried like the banks – specifically the former RBS boss Fred Goodwin.</p><p>But Davey was even more critical of Miliband, saying many of the problems that he was trying to sort out had been left on his plate by the former energy secretary. Davey said Miliband \"should know better\" than to play to newspaper headlines with \"quick fixes\" such as a price freeze.</p><p>Davey said he was absalutely clear that the role of government was not to fix prices. \"This will have a huge detrimental impact on the investment we need to deliver secure energy supplies. And an investment squeeze would mean a huge black hole in Britain's energy security – risking blackouts and higher prices in the long run,\" he argued.</p><p>Davey admitted he was put under pressure by power companies to lift energy efficiency measures and other costs off bills. \"Quite a few people have been trying to put pressure on the government,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422297392|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|6e04da2625bff8cc5683d168984fe1aefede9dc2 -->",

        "headline":"Energy UK warns that household bills could rise by 50% over six years",
        "body":"<p>Energy leaders have warned that household bills could rise by another 50% over the next six years.</p><p>The claim from the industry's trade body, Energy UK, came as EDF became the latest big six supplier to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/12/edf-energy-price-increase\" title=\"\">increase its current tariff</a> by an average of 3.9% from January.</p><p>And it came as senior executives from RWE and another major power company said they believed that security of supply was more important than affordability.</p><p>Angela Knight, the chief executive of Energy UK, defended the sector and argued that the UK had the lowest gas price in the European Union and one of the lowest electricity costs. But she said the &quot;old trilemma&quot; of decarbonisation, energy security and affordability meant there was relentless upward pressure on prices.</p><p>&quot;The industry has become a lightning conductor for the general concern about the cost of living. As a result we stand accused for things that we do, for things that we don't do, for things that we are responsible for and things that we are not … this is not an understood industry.&quot;</p><p>Knight then referred to a report from investment bank UBS that said: &quot;UK household energy bills have risen 70% since 2004; we expect them to rise another 46% in nominal terms by 2020.&quot; Knight pointed out that UBS also blamed 95% of the future estimated tariff rises to government policies and power transmission network costs.</p><p>The UBS report was also endorsed at the conference by Andrew Wright, the chief executive of energy regulator Ofgem, although he quibbled with some assumptions on the network costs. Meanwhile Guy Johnson, a director at RWE npower, said he believed that energy security was the most important element of the trilemma mentioned by Knight. His position, in response to a question at the same conference, was endorsed by Benj Sykes, the UK country manager of Dong Energy. EDF is now the fifth of the big six to raise prices, announcing average gas and electricity price rises of just under 4%.</p><p>Mark Todd, director of price comparison website energyhelpline, said the move was in some ways welcome. &quot;This is the lowest price rise so far at 3.9%, and is set to embarrass the four other big six players that have so far announced hikes averaging 9.1%. It highlights the difference between the companies, proving that they are not simply sheep bleating similar price rises one after another.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422297567|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|f3eed78308afe103c8a3d52e0e16f6c01b411420 -->",

        "headline":"SSE hikes shareholder payouts ahead of Friday's energy price rise",
        "body":"<p>Energy firm SSE has announced an inflation-busting dividend for shareholders just two days before it puts up customer bills by 8.2%.</p><p>SSE's dividend to shareholders will go up by 3.2% to 26p a share, a healthy return above the 2.2% inflation rate. On Friday SSE's 10 million customers – largely in Scotland and southern England – will see their bills going up well above inflation, taking the average dual-fuel bill to £1,380, in the same week that the National Audit Office warned of above-inflation energy bills until 2030.</p><p>SSE made the case for higher bills in its first-half results on Wednesday morning, which showed a 12% fall in adjusted pre-tax profits to £354m for the six months to the end of September, compared with £400m last year.</p><p></p><p>SSE said it made a £89.4m loss on its retail business of selling energy to customers, blaming higher wholesale gas prices, as well as rising environmental, social and distribution costs. The firm made a £455m profit from running energy networks and £160m on its wholesale business, which generates electricity, produces and stores gas.</p><p>SSE, which was fined a record £10.5m by regulator Ofgem earlier this year for \"prolonged and extensive mis-selling\", also revealed it had lost 60,000 customers over the period.</p><p>Company executives were forced on the defensive on Wednesday morning, insisting they put customers before shareholders.</p><p>Alan Young, managing director of corporate affairs at SSE, admitted that standards in the industry needed to improve. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"If we don't have a decent relationship with customers we will lose the mandate to run the business.\"</p><p>Young defended SSE's generous payouts to shareholders, after the company boasted in its latest annual report that it has paid above-inflation dividends every year since SSE was formed in 1998.</p><p>\"SSE is a good performer when it comes to paying dividends, but those dividends have got a purpose,\" he said. \"We want to make sure we are able to continue to attract the investment&nbsp;… that is needed to make sure the UK has secure energy supplies for many years to come.\"</p><p>The SSE chief executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies, told Radio 5 bills would be cut – \"no ifs, no buts\" – if the government's green levies were reduced. The big six energy companies have been calling on the government to shift the cost of green levies, which pay for free and subsidised home insulation, from their businesses to the taxpayer.</p><p>Hard-pressed customers face further bad news as Whitehall's spending watchdog warned of 17 years of rising utility bills, while in a separate report, UBS analysts have warned that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/fuel-bill-increases-edf-big-six\" title=\"\">energy costs are set to rise by almost 50% by 2020</a>.</p><p>SSE kicked off the annual winter price hikes this year and has since been followed by British Gas, nPower, Scottish Power and EDF Energy – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill\" title=\"\">generating a political furore over soaring energy bills</a>.</p><p>The climate change and energy secretary, Ed Davey, became the latest to join the chorus of condemnation on Tuesday when he accused the big six of using customers as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/11/ed-davey-public-trust-energy-companies\" title=\"\">cash cows to be squeezed in pursuit of higher returns for shareholders</a>\".</p><p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, former prime minister John Major and the archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby have also weighed in against the energy companies, which the latest polls show are less trusted than banks and car salesman.</p><p>E.ON, the only one of the big six not to have announced a price rise, is reported to be planning to reveal a 6.6% price increase later this month.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422367806|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|238a308d5c4a1736548a8901f48b07595ece47c3 -->",

        "headline":"£2,000 fuel bills on the way, consumers warned",
        "body":"<p>Householders have been warned that energy bills could rise by almost 50% over the next six years as EDF became the latest big six supplier to announce inflation-busting gas and electricity price increases.</p><p>A new report from the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, also stokes the price row  by claiming that ministers \"do not know\" whether power bills will be affordable in years to come, as multibillion pound infrastructure investment pushes up tariffs.</p><p>The report says: \"The available projections suggest that increases in both energy and water bills will continue to outstrip inflation, on average, up to 2030.\"</p><p>The warning came as EDF unveiled plans to raise prices by 3.9% from January with a proviso – described as blackmail by critics – that the increase would be more if green taxes were not lifted by the government. EDF is building the £16bn Hinkley Point nuclear plant in Somerset, a government-underwritten project whose cost will eventually be passed to consumers.</p><p>Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF in Britain, justified the rise and insisted his firm would be seen as a \"force for good\" for the UK in the long term.</p><p>But the biggest shock on Tuesday came at the UK's annual energy industry conference, where Angela Knight, a former Tory MP and bank spokeswoman who is now chief executive for trade body Energy UK, revealed that new research from investment bank UBS predicted energy prices would rise by 46% in the years to 2020.</p><p>This meant that prices have increased by 260% since 2004, according to UBS analysts who blamed  a history of inadequate investment and social and environmental policies.  UBS referred to an annual domestic bill of £1,100 but many consumers are already paying £1,500 which could mean a rise to well over £2,000 by 2020.</p><p>Knight said energy companies had made some mistakes but were being unfairly blamed for much wider issues. \"The industry has become a lightning conductor for the general concern about the cost of living. As a result we stand accused for things that we do, for things that we don't do, for things that we are responsible for and things that we are not … this is not an understood industry,\" she said.</p><p>Knight argued that the UK still had the lowest gas price in the EU and among the lowest electricity costs. But she said the \"old trilemma\" of decarbonisation, energy security and affordability meant there was relentless upward pressure on prices.</p><p>Guy Johnson, a director at RWE npower, a member of the big six, said he believed that energy security was more important than either affordability or decarbonisation.</p><p>Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, warned attendees at the conference that the latest round of bill rises \"have not been fully and openly justified.\"</p><p>However, the NAO has put further pressure on the government to intervene with a damning report saying there is little understanding in government of the financial implications of its own policies to bring much needed investment into energy, water and telecoms.</p><p>The NAO recommends the Treasury should publish the expected overall impact on consumer bills, to promote transparency and debate about new infrastructure. It also argues departments should consider the implications for consumer bills and their overall affordability before making policy commitments on infrastructure.</p><p>Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: \"Government and regulators do not know the overall impact of planned infrastructure on future consumer utility bills, or whether households, especially those on low incomes, will be able to afford to pay them. It seems critical to know 'how much is too much', based on reliable information.\"</p><p>Davey also used the conference to renew his attack on Ed Miliband, describing the Labour leader's proposal to freeze energy prices as \"intellectually bankrupt\". The energy secretary said he remained convinced the government should not intervene in prices. \"This will have a huge detrimental impact on the investment we need to deliver secure energy supplies. And an investment squeeze would mean a huge black hole in Britain's energy security – risking blackouts and higher prices in the long run,\" Davey said.</p><p>Commenting on EDF's warning on green levies, the director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, Andrew Warren, said: \"It is absolutely disgraceful that a company that is majority owned by another government should be seeking to blackmail the UK government into changing its established policy to require energy companies to help customers stop wasting money by wasting fuel.</p><p>\"There has been no increase whatsoever in the levels of social obligations placed upon the big six this year. This concerted attack on the energy company obligation by the big six is predominantly a distraction technique to draw attention from the price gouging they are practicing.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on Wednesday 13 November 2013 to insert a quote from the report.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422342557|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|b327516817d01c9c0389206e9968ba8fdb8ee979 -->",
