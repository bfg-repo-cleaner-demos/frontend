        "body":"<p>Hundreds of strangers have turned out for the funeral of a second world war veteran after undertakers put out an appeal for mourners to attend his service.</p><p>Uniformed veterans, teenage air cadets and serving members of the armed forces joined members of the public at the funeral of Harold Jellicoe Percival, known as Coe, who died in a nursing home in Lytham St Annes, near Blackpool in Lancashire, last month.</p><p>Percival, who served as ground crew with RAF Bomber Command, never married and had no children, and funeral directors feared no one would attend his cremation on Monday morning.</p><p>His death prompted Roland L Whitehead and Daughter funeral directors to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/09/military-veterans-respond-funeral-appeal-war-hero\" title=\"\">make appeals in a local newspaper</a> – calls that were further <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=harold%20percival&amp;src=typd\" title=\"\">publicised on social media</a> – for armed service personnel past and present to attend Percival's funeral.</p><p>So few people were expected at the service that the pallbearers were expecting to have to stay in the chapel to make up the numbers after carrying in Percival's coffin.</p><p>But, after an extraordinary response to the advert on social media, it was standing room only in Lytham crematorium on Monday, with well over 100 mourners paying their respects in the drizzle outside.</p><p>Initially, no family members were expected to attend. But after the service, Percival's nephew, Andrew Colyer-Worsell, said the family was overwhelmed by the turnout. \"It was very emotional,\" he said. \"It just shows how great the British public are.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422202602'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/11/1384177991200/Harold-Jellicoe-Percival--011.jpg' alt='Harold Jellicoe Percival funeral' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Some of those who knew him said Percival would not have relished all the fuss. Photograph: PA</figcaption></figure><p>He said his uncle might not have relished the attention during his life. \"He would be hiding around the corner right now,\" said Colyer-Worsell, stressing that Percival was not one to dwell on his past in the war. \"He was an old soldier, not a hero: just a veteran who did his duty.\"</p><p>Opening the service after the two-minute Armistice Day silence at 11am, the Rev Alan Clark said he was humbled by the number of people who had come to show their respects. \"We marvel at the power of the printed word, whether on paper or on screen,\" he said.</p><p>He went on to quote from the John Donne poem No Man Is An Island: \"No man is an island / Entire of itself / Every man is a piece of the continent / A part of the main.\"</p><p>The vicar gave a short eulogy about a man he described as a \"very private person – something of a nomad, carrying his possessions in a rucksack\".</p><p>Janet Wareing, the matron at his nursing home in Lytham, described Percival as \"a lovely character, very feisty and independent … [He] knew his own mind. He was very proud of what he achieved.\"</p><p>During the second world war, Percival served with 617 squadron, which carried out the famous dambusters raid to destroy dams in the Ruhr valley in Nazi Germany.</p><p>After the war, he worked in Australia, later retiring to England and living at the Alistre Lodge nursing and care home, in Lytham.</p><p>He was a distant relative of the former British prime minister Spencer Perceval, who was shot dead by a bankrupt broker, John Bellingham, as he entered the House of Commons in 1812.</p><p>Percival's coffin, draped in a union jack, was carried into the chapel to the title music from the Dambusters film. A bugler then played the Last Post.</p><p>The congregation, inside and out, sang along as the Lytham community choir performed Jerusalem.</p><p>Before the service, Sam Hodson, 21, an air trooper just back from Afghanistan, explained why he had decided to attend. \"It's important to show respect for those who put their lives on the line for this country,\" he said.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422202603'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/11/1384178366312/Veteran-Harold-Percivals--011.jpg' alt='Veteran Harold Percival's funeral' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Young people were at the Lytham crematorium to honour Percival and his comrades. Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Hayden Carnall, 16, had come with other teenagers from the 177 (Blackpool Airport) Squadron Air Training Corps, taking the morning off college to attend. \"We want to pay our respects and support his family,\" he said.</p><p>Stefan Fish, formerly of the 14th/20th Kings Hussars and now a Blackpool palliative care team leader, said he had attended too many funerals with few or no mourners in his new line of work.</p><p>\"This is the opposite side of the coin,\" he said, looking around at the crowd. \"This isn't really about honouring one man. It's about honouring a whole generation. We owe them a massive debt of gratitude.\"</p><p>Bernard Worsfold, 80, chairman of the local RAF veterans' association, said he had expected to be one of just six people at the funeral – the other five being all from his branch. \"The funeral directors had phoned us up seeing if we could get a few people together to come, so of course we did,\" he said. \"I never expected anything like this turnout. I'm really pleased.\"</p><p>He said the association's welfare officer would often visit Percival in his home, and had found him to be a very stubborn man who knew what he wanted. \"But,\" he added, \"if you can't have what you want when you're 99, when can you?\"</p><p>He said Percival might not have appreciated the fuss, though. \"I'm not sure whether he would have liked all this,\" said Worsfold, gesturing at the gathering crowd.</p><p>Phil Burton was one of a number of veterans who arrived by motorbike to pay their respects. A member of the Brothers in Arms biking fraternity who served 14 years with the Royal Artillery in Northern Ireland and Bosnia, Burton said he had driven through the rain from Leyland, in the South Ribble.</p><p>He agreed that Percival might not have relished the attention. \"If you'd asked him, he'd probably not have wanted this. Nobody wants a fuss when they go,\" he said. \"But if he's looking down now, seeing all these people, he'll be thinking: 'The family's come for me.'\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422199766|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|bc787153e44453a17a752c985888b39f020b935e -->",

        "headline":"Lest we forget, most ex-soldiers don't go bad in civvies",
        "body":"<p>Despite the parades and the professions of gratitude, soldiers are more belittled today than at any time since the 19th century. Menacing, working-class men haunt middle-class nightmares. They appear all the more frightening when the services have trained them in the techniques of violence and sent them to Afghanistan and Iraq to hone their skills.</p><p>In contemporary cliche, the ex-serviceman is like a cornered animal. He suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder that leaves him angry enough to lash out without reason. His road home takes him from Helmand province to Wormwood Scrubs via a spell living rough. A society that in the mid-20th century treated the squaddie as a working-class hero now depicts him as&nbsp;a thug.</p><p>Whether his thuggery is his fault is a question that divides people you can broadly define as pacifists from militarists or, if that is too strong, those who believe that we should support the armed forces as a point of principle.</p><p>All sides pretend, however, that military service invariably changes men for the worse. In my experience, when all sides agree, you should open your eyes and look for the falsehoods they are failing to confront.</p><p>The pacifist doctrine that war is always wrong is easy to state but almost impossible to follow. True pacifists should condemn all who take up arms equally. But the pressure of holding to a pacifist position when your country is at war is often too much to bear. Nearly every opponent of the Afghan war I know has begun by justifying their opposition by imagining moral equivalence between Britain and the Taliban jihadis. They then stop mentioning radical Islam and talk as if there are no killers on the other side. The horrors of war become the sole responsibility of the west, which appears to be fighting out of sheer malice.</p><p>I, and I guess most people watching the ceremony at the Cenotaph on 10 November, will applaud the troops, while reserving the right to condemn the politicians and generals who have led Britain to effective defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>Pacifists, by contrast, have to condemn the lions along with the donkeys. Writing for the religious website <a href=\"http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/news/columns/segger\" title=\"\">Ekklesia, Jill Segger</a> explained why good people must not show solidarity with ex-servicemen and women. British troops had tortured and murdered Iraqis and Afghans, she said. The case of \"Marine A\", who killed a captive in cold blood, then told his patrol: \"Obviously this doesn't go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention\", supports her argument. But even Segger has to admit most soldiers do not torture and murder. War had tainted them nevertheless. \"The brutalising experiences of combat lead many to harm themselves and others when they return to civilian life.\"</p><p>The popular press screams at those who \"hate Britain\" and \"insult our boys\". But it is as keen to present pictures of brutalised men. In a typical piece, the <em>Sunday Mirror</em> <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/9000-ex-service-personnel-homeless-after-2071049\" title=\"\">\"revealed\"</a> that ex-service personnel made up one in 10 rough sleepers on Britain's streets. They were poor and dangerous – \"a ticking time bomb\" in our towns and cities.</p><p>The only difference between the tabloids and the pacifists is that the newspapers want to condemn the state that sent men to war rather than war itself. The military charities – and there are hundreds of them – are happy to go along with the tale of a callous government pushing the men and women into desperate lives because it helps bring the donations in.</p><p>Yet the story both sides tell is such a half-truth you may as well call it a lie. The homelessness charity Crisis told me the notion that there were almost 10,000 ex-service personnel sleeping on the streets was nonsense.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Howard League for Penal Reform was so concerned by reports that battle-hardened men were turning to crime that it organised an inquiry under the chairmanship of Sir John Nutting QC. Its results bust every contemporary myth.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.howardleague.org/military/\" title=\"\">inquiry found</a> that ex-servicemen were more likely to be in prison for crimes of violence than the average offender. But its endorsement of middle-class prejudice stopped there. There was no significant rise in the numbers of ex-servicemen in prison after the Afghan and Iraqi wars, Nutting said. On the contrary, the average ex-serviceman was less likely to end up behind bars than the average&nbsp;civilian.</p><p>Let me repeat: you are less likely to turn to crime if you have a career in the forces than if you stay at home. Sir John concluded that it was hard to find a direct link between crime and service in the forces.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Liberal readers may not care to hear this but, if they can survive combat, a spell in the forces need not be a disaster for young working-class men and women. The army teaches them how to better themselves when they leave. It and the other services help men and women make the transition to civilian life, as do the military charities. No one should be surprised that most ex-servicemen and women lead law-abiding lives.</p><p>Hugh Milroy, the chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.veterans-aid.net/\" title=\"\">Veterans Aid</a>, told me there are about 4&nbsp;million former servicemen and women in Britain. \"If the stories special interest groups looking for money circulated were right, British society would have broken down,\" he said.</p><p>I've no difficulty wearing a poppy while asserting, and indeed exercising, my right to damn the politicians and generals. There's nothing jingoistic about a flower from a battlefield, while the Cenotaph service is mournful and contemplative. With the exception of Rule, Britannia<em> </em>(which will sound more of a joke than ever this year), the music is elegiac on the whole. No nation determined to assert its superiority would play Elgar's Nimrod or Dido's Lament at its national ceremony of remembrance. Nor would it ask for a respectful silence.</p><p>The armed forces that fought two world wars included men and women of every colour and creed and that fact could do with being remembered. I&nbsp;cannot help thinking as well that, were it not for certain residents of old people's homes, who could do with charitable support, the Nazis would have sent my ancestors to the gas chambers.</p><p>But above all others, camaraderie provides the best reason for giving former servicemen and women their due. Despite everything you read, they are a part of us and all around us. And I&nbsp;am happy to say that the overwhelming majority of them are getting along just fine.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422051236|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|74d9d7974e682c2b017d010224a6c253ce296120 -->",

        "body":"<p>Australians had already &ldquo;crystallised a good idea of ourselves&rdquo; and did not need redemption in the first world war, a conflict which was &ldquo;devoid of virtue&rdquo;, the former Labor prime minister, Paul Keating, said.</p> <p>Marking Remembrance Day at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, Keating said that at the time of the first world war, there was nothing in &ldquo;our young nation&rdquo; that required a war to legitimise Australia.</p> <p>&ldquo;The first world war was a war devoid of any virtue,&rdquo; Keating said.</p> <p>&ldquo;Those Australians fought and died not in defence of some old world notion of competing empires and territorial conquests but for the new world &ndash; the one they belonged to and hoped to return to,&rdquo; Keating said.</p> <p>&ldquo;This is why Australia was never in need of any redemption at Gallipoli, any more than it was in need of one at Kokoda thirty years later. There was nothing missing in our young nation or our idea of it that required the martial baptism of a European cataclysm to legitimise us.&rdquo;</p> <p>His speech was a direct rejection of the common belief that Australia &ldquo;came of age&rdquo; in the first world war and that the Anzac legend, formed in the campaign at Gallipoli, was the birthplace of Australia as a nation. Nearly 62,000 Australians died in the first world war with 150,000 wounded.</p> <p>Keating said it was only as a result of a &ldquo;loyalty to imperial Britain&rdquo; that Australians returned to the killing fields of Europe.</p> <p>&ldquo;By 1915 we had no need to re-affirm our European heritage at the price of being dragged to a European holocaust,&rdquo; Keating said.</p> <p>&ldquo;We had escaped that mire, both sociologically and geographically. But out of loyalty to imperial Britain, we returned to Europe's killing fields to decide the status of Germany, a question which should earlier have been settled by foresight and statecraft.&rdquo;</p> <p>Keating was speaking on Remembrance Day, November 11, marking the 95th anniversary of the Armistice which ended the first world war (1914&ndash;1918) and the 20th anniversary of the re-interment of the unknown Australian soldier at the Australian War Memorial. As prime minister in 1993, <a href=\"http://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/keating.asp\">Keating delivered the eulogy </a>to the unknown soldier and his words were unveiled in a plaque at the entrance to the Hall of Memory.</p> <p>This year&rsquo;s service marked the addition of the names of two soldiers who died in Afghanistan in the past year, 24-year-old Corporal Scott James Smith, of the Special Operations Engineer Regiment, and 32-year-old Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird MG, of the 2nd Commando Regiment.</p> <p>Keating said it was hard to imagine young Europeans &ldquo;these days&rdquo; fighting for the European Commission, just as it would be hard to &ldquo;dragoon&rdquo; young Australians en masse into war.</p> <p>&ldquo;One thing is certain: young Australians ... can no longer be dragooned en masse into military enterprises of the former imperial variety on the whim of so-called statesmen.</p> <p>&ldquo;They are fortunately too wise to the world to be cannon fodder of the kind their young forebears became: young innocents who had little or no choice.&rdquo;</p> <p>Keating said he was heartened that so many young Australians &ldquo;found a sense of identity and purpose from the Anzac legend&rdquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;But the true commemoration of their lives, service and sacrifice is to understand that the essence of their motivation was their belief in all we had created here and our responsibility in continuing to improve it.</p> <p>&ldquo;Homage to these people has to be homage to them and about them and not to some idealised or jingoist reduction of what their lives really meant.&rdquo;</p> <p>He said Australians were drawn to the lesson about &ldquo;supposedly ordinary people&rdquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;What the Anzac legend did do, by the bravery and sacrifice of our troops, was reinforce our own cultural notions of independence, mateship and ingenuity. Of resilience and courage in adversity.</p> <p>&ldquo;We liked the lesson about supposedly ordinary people; we liked finding that they were not ordinary at all. Despite the fact that the military campaigns were shockingly flawed and incompetently executed, those ordinary people distinguished themselves by their latent nobility.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422155119|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|1a489592906148c3a4a057c1cb28ee6de38c7fcb -->",

        "body":"<p>After the guns went silent on Armistice Day, 11 November 1918, and after the men had trickled home to their towns and their suburbs, to their wives, girlfriends, children and parents, Australia set about building the memorials to the dead and lost.</p><p>As a nation we actually began sculpting our landscape in remembrance after the second  Boer war in 1902. That's when the words of Rudyard Kipling's Recessional – \"Lest We Forget\" – penned, ironically, for Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, first popped up on stone structures in the bigger cities of this distant corner of the empire.</p><p>Then the first world war bequeathed too heavy a memorial burden – nearly 62,000 dead, 155,000 wounded – for the cities and the rural centres to manage alone. And so, from two-horse alpine towns and seaside villages to outback stops in the red centre and suburban shopping strips – the people rallied in the 20s and 30s to fund their monuments.</p><p>Committees were formed. Kids entered walkathons, chooks and meat trays were raffled in pubs. Shilling by shilling they raised most of the money while governments footed the bill for the official shrines and memorials.</p><p>From childhood – thanks to the marble soldiers in country towns, the bronze plaques at our public swimming pools and drinking fountains, the honour boards in our schools, the obelisks at our local shops – we are imbued with remembrance. So much so, perhaps, that we are not always cognisant of its cultural and political potency.</p><p>I once drove a German friend east from Canberra and through Braidwood – a place so archetypically Aussie country town-ish that a plethora of iconic films including The Year My Voice Broke, Ned Kelly, Robbery Under Arms and Forty Thousand Horsemen, were filmed there.</p><p>As we passed through she pointed to the stone soldier atop a plinth inscribed in gold with the names of the dead – a fixture I have driven past so many times that it barely touches my consciousness.</p><p>She said: \"In Australia you remember the soldiers all of the time, everywhere. Germans can't do it in the same way. Because of what the Nazis did it makes it hard to commemorate our lost in the first world war, too.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422152823'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/10/1384127175438/Remembrance-day---war-mem-010.jpg' alt='Remembrance day - war memorial' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The graves of unknown Australian soldiers in High Wood cemetery on the western front. Photograph: Mike Bowers</figcaption></figure><p>I understood years later when I visited the cemetery at Fricourt on the European western front, where German dead are buried four to the grave under iron crosses.</p><p>Compared with Commonwealth cemeteries that buzz with visitors in French-Belgian summers (endless twilights of pealing bells and birdsong and painterly crimson flourishes of poppies across golden fields conjure such cruel beauty given the vast horror staged there), Fricourt is usually almost empty. </p><p>In 1919 Armistice Day became Remembrance Day across the Commonwealth. And remarkably, perhaps, nearly a century later some Australian communities are still raising money to build new memorials – marble soldiers, bronze plaques and obelisks – to their war dead.</p><p>Yes Australia, like so many countries, suffered greatly as a nation for generations as a result of the war. And the looming centenary of world war one is reviving and localising the emotional resonance of such momentous human loss.</p><p>On a national level, days of commemoration such as Remembrance Day and Anzac Day, which overlap in terms of purpose to remember all our war dead, offer politicians opportunity to mythologise loss, to tie it to national character and to current conflicts.</p><p>So it is locally that commemoration in Australia finds it intrinsic purpose and its absolute worth. For it is in the towns and the suburbs that the plaques and the plinths and the statues speak a truth that still resonates. </p><p>Each town knows the stories of its memorials. Ask. Go through the names – there's the baker, the two solictors, the schoolteacher, the newspaperman, the five sets of brothers, the sawyer, the barman, the barber, the full-forward, full-back and two back flankers from the footy team. Then ponder what happened to the town afterwards.</p><p>Those stories, as much as those from the battlefields, are incarnate in the monuments. And that true story of war is the one that must prevent its glorification or manipulation for politics – even though the words on the memorials themselves might obfuscate precisely what happened.</p><p>As Ken Inglis writes in his remarkable book about Australian war memorials, Sacred Places: \" . . . soldiers of the Queen did not stagger or sink or topple or have bits blown off, but fell, to become not quite simply the dead but the fallen, who cleanly, heroically, sacrificially gave their lives in war. People raised on such high diction were not prepared for squalid actualities.\"</p><p>Such compromised language – which does, as intended, induce \"remembrance\" as opposed to \"regret\" – is now intrinsic to our diction for the war dead. Yes, you'll hear about the \"fallen\" and their \"sacrifice\" everywhere today.</p><p>But in the country towns, particularly, they still talk about the individual men who died and precisely how, who exactly they were and what they did, and the gaping holes they left in communities and families.</p><p>And these towns are a microcosm of the national.</p><p>In the Euroa district in northern Victoria, for example, 1100 men – about 60 per cent of the eligible – enlisted, some 240 died and hundreds more were irreparably damaged. Some tiny district towns like Longwood, which lists on its roll of honour 14 sets of brothers killed, struggled to stay in existence.</p><p>The Euroa district, which has already raised about 40 honour boards and memorials since Remembrance Day 1919, is now raising $300,000 for yet one more.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422152824'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/10/1384127054371/remembrance-day---war-mem-010.jpg' alt='remembrance day - war memorial' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>High Wood cemetery in northern France, the final resting place of many Australians.  Photograph: Mike Bowers</figcaption></figure><p>This one will mark the three Victoria Cross winners who were raised in the district: Leslie Maygar, Alexander Burton and Frederick Tubb. All died in the \"great war\".</p><p>\"Having three VC winners from the one place is, we are told, unique within the Commonwealth. And we think it is worth marking that with a memorial,\" says Jeff Starkey, a local historian who is writing a book on the social impact of the war on the district.</p><p>It is a complex and often sad yarn, of spinsters and widows, of men who returned but couldn't function. There's the one-legged cobbler. The veteran who hid in his parents' pub for years. The suicides. Those who went mad. And then there is the tragedy of those who'd felt forced to go and fight in the first place.</p><p>Like Private Alf Wakenshaw, who eventually volunteered late in the war after he and many other district men anonymously received the white feather, a symbol of cowardice. He was killed in France on 25 August 1918.</p><p>On Armistice Day 1918 his twin David, still serving in France, unaware that the war had just ended and seething with bitterness at whoever had sent the feather to his twin brother, wrote home: \"I must mention that one occasion I met my brother here in France and he referred to that 'white feather' incident saying he never wanted to go back to Euroa because of it; but his mind was built on finding out who the feather king or queen might be. Being his twin brother, I think it will be my duty to find out ... and return the feather with the inscription 'You are the criminal and the fool'. I am going to find the feather-king on my return.\"</p><p>Some in the district still talk guardedly about the king and queen of the white feather. Tragedy certainly has that way of reverberating down the generations.</p><p>So, yes, the monuments, in their ubiquity, comprise a critical national iconography.</p><p>But more fundamentally and importantly, they are the keys to an honest remembrance of a not-so-great war's tragic social impact.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422151055|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|a0ee5cc8e0ba927238c35ad9602009a2659e4255 -->",

        "headline":"Poem of the week: Returning, We Hear Larks by Isaac Rosenberg",
        "body":"<p>This week's poem, Returning, We Hear Larks, is one of <a href=\"http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/collections/rosenberg\" title=\"\">Isaac Rosenberg</a>'s most popular war poems, but I often wonder if he'd have made further revisions, given time. It's among the last handful of poems he wrote, working on scraps of paper in circumstances that would have silenced a less motivated artist. Yet the piece is typically his own, while laying bare the diverse influences integral to his style.</p><p>Rosenberg's life and work are a fusion of conflicting energies. To begin with the obvious ones: he was a painter and playwright as well as a poet. His first language was Yiddish; his first literary inspiration the Old Testament. Some of his best prewar poems are in the style of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/william-blake\" title=\"\">Blake</a> – and not shallow imitations, either. Symbolist, realist, modernist, Romantic: Rosenberg could be selectively anthologised to embody any of these movements.</p><p>Most critics have favoured those of his war poems that use a vernacular idiom and free-verse structure to expose the misery and grotesqueness of everyday soldiering. You might argue that, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jun/08/poem-of-the-week-wilfred-owen\" title=\"\">like Owen</a>, Rosenberg was released by war from self-conscious literariness. But you'd only be partly right. His finest war poem, <a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/dead-man-s-dump/\" title=\"\">Dead Man's Dump</a>, is highly literary, a fused montage of the biblical, the Blakean and the Whitmanesque. Returning, We Hear Larks comes from a similar mould.</p><p>One revision we know about comes in the first line, which originally read, \"Sombre the night hangs.\" Changing \"hangs\" to \"is\" shows good judgment: simpler is stronger. But simplicity is only one aspect of Rosenberg's method. The line's grammatical inversion is good judgment working in a different direction. That trochaic opening bell-stroke of \"Sombre\" is a dramatic, mood-setting call to attention. Although the thought continues in the next two lines, a full-stop after the assertion ensures a resonant pause. Another simple verb, \"have\" in \"we have our lives\" suggests these \"lives\" are like solid objects, to be grasped and owned in the face of the \"sinister threat\" that \"lurks there\" (ie in the sombre night), waiting to snatch them away.</p><p>From the next tercet we learn the men are returning to camp at dawn after a nocturnal sortie. Rosenberg is probably recalling an occasion from his time in the works battalion servicing the Hindenburg Line, in February 1917. The irregular, almost ragged tercets convey the limping, shambling gait of exhausted men. Adjectival phrases such as \"anguished limbs\" may seem overdone, but they help retard the rhythm, and accentuate the sense of relief, the clarity and lightness of getting back to camp and \"a little safe sleep\".</p><p>Linguistic excess can pay off. Rosenberg loved inventing compound words, and the coined adjective \"poison-blasted\" seems a brilliant stroke. The poet never deluded himself about the war: he viewed it as \"a demonstration in vast and tragic forms of the stupidity and ineffectiveness of our species\". War's blasts and poisons are moral as well as literal, and this compound detonates an array of meanings.</p><p>Rosenberg's challenge in the poem is to lend combat-credibility to a subject bathed in Romantic luminescence. It doesn't deter him from using the biblical language of \"hark\" and \"lo\" or the repetition of \"joy\", however, and in lines seven and eight, his speaker might have stepped out of one of his Old Testament plays.</p><p>Shelley's <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174413\" title=\"\">To a Skylark</a> is echoed in the metaphorical description of the birdsong as rain-showers: \"Music showering our upturned list'ning faces.\" But Rosenberg needs a stronger objective correlative than rain to express his sense of the miraculous. He finds the solution in a magnificent phrase: \"heights of night ringing with unseen larks\". This has a muscular musicality unlike the finespun ethereality of Shelley. \"Ringing\" achieves a piercing and reverberating sound effect, and just possibly hints at the urgency of communication signalled by field telephones. It visualises the larks gathered invisibly round, like an ambush, or a protective fortress. That the birds are \"unseen\" contrasts tantalisingly with the loud nearness of their voices. And beneath them, the men are also perhaps enclosed by their shared experience, forming a ring of \"upturned list'ning faces\". As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780753825778/isaac-rosenberg-the-making-of-a-great-war-poet\" title=\"\">Rosenberg biographer Jean Moorcroft Wilson says</a>, the image relates to a charcoal drawing he made in 1912, entitled Hark, Hark the Lark. She tells us there was also a painting, now lost, which Rosenberg submitted to a <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/slade\" title=\"\">Slade School</a> competition. It was called Joy, and concluding the prose description Rosenberg had written: \"Joy – joy – the birds sing joy\". Writing his \"lark\" poem in 1917, under desperate pressures, he's surely not merely recycling earlier material but asserting the continuum of his creative identity.</p><p>The last section begins abruptly, with a statement of stark truthfulness, which then turns complicated. \"But song only dropped\" is interestingly ambiguous. \"Dropped\" is a word more applicable to bombs and rain than birdsong. It makes sense to apply \"only\" to the noun rather than the verb, but the qualifier's positioning casts doubt. It can also be read as a faintly sardonic reference to the frailty and incompleteness of the experience: the song simply dropped away and disappeared.</p><p>This reading may be borne out by the ensuing similes. The blind man's dreams are swept away, or dropped, \"By dangerous tides\". The girl is an unwittingly predatory sexual figure, perhaps related to the war goddess Rosenberg imagines elsewhere – a traitor and devourer of men.</p><p>Neither impressionistic sketch nor realist narrative, though drawing on both, partly rhymed and partly free, haunted by an antithesis of innocence and experience almost too painful to translate into language, the poem seems to look into the heart of Romantic epiphany and find an abyss. Less than a year later, on 1 April 1918, Private Rosenberg was killed at dawn after a night patrol.</p><h2>Returning, We Hear Larks</h2><p>Sombre the night is.<br />And though we have our lives, we know<br />What sinister threat lurks there.</p><p>Dragging these anguished limbs, we only know<br />This poison-blasted track opens on our camp –<br />On a little safe sleep.</p><p>But hark! joy – joy – strange joy.<br />Lo! heights of night ringing with unseen larks.<br />Music showering our upturned list'ning faces.</p><p>Death could drop from the dark<br />As easily as song –<br />But song only dropped,<br />Like a blind man's dreams on the sand<br />By dangerous tides,<br />Like a girl's dark hair for she dreams no ruin lies there,<br />Or her kisses where a serpent hides.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422186942|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|e540a232ac2560f273efc9525c3edd41e99bc27d -->",

        "body":"<p>Hundreds of strangers have turned out for the funeral of a second world war veteran after undertakers put out an appeal for mourners to attend his service.</p><p>Uniformed veterans, teenage air cadets and serving members of the armed forces joined members of the public at the funeral of Harold Jellicoe Percival, known as Coe, who died in a nursing home in Lytham St Annes, near Blackpool in Lancashire, last month.</p><p>Percival, who served as ground crew with RAF Bomber Command, never married and had no children, and funeral directors feared no one would attend his cremation on Monday morning.</p><p>His death prompted Roland L Whitehead and Daughter funeral directors to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/09/military-veterans-respond-funeral-appeal-war-hero\" title=\"\">make appeals in a local newspaper</a> – calls that were further <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=harold%20percival&amp;src=typd\" title=\"\">publicised on social media</a> – for armed service personnel past and present to attend Percival's funeral.</p><p>So few people were expected at the service that the pallbearers were expecting to have to stay in the chapel to make up the numbers after carrying in Percival's coffin.</p><p>But, after an extraordinary response to the advert on social media, it was standing room only in Lytham crematorium on Monday, with well over 100 mourners paying their respects in the drizzle outside.</p><p>Initially, no family members were expected to attend. But after the service, Percival's nephew, Andrew Colyer-Worsell, said the family was overwhelmed by the turnout. \"It was very emotional,\" he said. \"It just shows how great the British public are.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422202602'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/11/1384177991200/Harold-Jellicoe-Percival--011.jpg' alt='Harold Jellicoe Percival funeral' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Some of those who knew him said Percival would not have relished all the fuss. Photograph: PA</figcaption></figure><p>He said his uncle might not have relished the attention during his life. \"He would be hiding around the corner right now,\" said Colyer-Worsell, stressing that Percival was not one to dwell on his past in the war. \"He was an old soldier, not a hero: just a veteran who did his duty.\"</p><p>Opening the service after the two-minute Armistice Day silence at 11am, the Rev Alan Clark said he was humbled by the number of people who had come to show their respects. \"We marvel at the power of the printed word, whether on paper or on screen,\" he said.</p><p>He went on to quote from the John Donne poem No Man Is An Island: \"No man is an island / Entire of itself / Every man is a piece of the continent / A part of the main.\"</p><p>The vicar gave a short eulogy about a man he described as a \"very private person – something of a nomad, carrying his possessions in a rucksack\".</p><p>Janet Wareing, the matron at his nursing home in Lytham, described Percival as \"a lovely character, very feisty and independent … [He] knew his own mind. He was very proud of what he achieved.\"</p><p>During the second world war, Percival served with 617 squadron, which carried out the famous dambusters raid to destroy dams in the Ruhr valley in Nazi Germany.</p><p>After the war, he worked in Australia, later retiring to England and living at the Alistre Lodge nursing and care home, in Lytham.</p><p>He was a distant relative of the former British prime minister Spencer Perceval, who was shot dead by a bankrupt broker, John Bellingham, as he entered the House of Commons in 1812.</p><p>Percival's coffin, draped in a union jack, was carried into the chapel to the title music from the Dambusters film. A bugler then played the Last Post.</p><p>The congregation, inside and out, sang along as the Lytham community choir performed Jerusalem.</p><p>Before the service, Sam Hodson, 21, an air trooper just back from Afghanistan, explained why he had decided to attend. \"It's important to show respect for those who put their lives on the line for this country,\" he said.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422202603'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/11/1384178366312/Veteran-Harold-Percivals--011.jpg' alt='Veteran Harold Percival's funeral' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Young people were at the Lytham crematorium to honour Percival and his comrades. Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Hayden Carnall, 16, had come with other teenagers from the 177 (Blackpool Airport) Squadron Air Training Corps, taking the morning off college to attend. \"We want to pay our respects and support his family,\" he said.</p><p>Stefan Fish, formerly of the 14th/20th Kings Hussars and now a Blackpool palliative care team leader, said he had attended too many funerals with few or no mourners in his new line of work.</p><p>\"This is the opposite side of the coin,\" he said, looking around at the crowd. \"This isn't really about honouring one man. It's about honouring a whole generation. We owe them a massive debt of gratitude.\"</p><p>Bernard Worsfold, 80, chairman of the local RAF veterans' association, said he had expected to be one of just six people at the funeral – the other five being all from his branch. \"The funeral directors had phoned us up seeing if we could get a few people together to come, so of course we did,\" he said. \"I never expected anything like this turnout. I'm really pleased.\"</p><p>He said the association's welfare officer would often visit Percival in his home, and had found him to be a very stubborn man who knew what he wanted. \"But,\" he added, \"if you can't have what you want when you're 99, when can you?\"</p><p>He said Percival might not have appreciated the fuss, though. \"I'm not sure whether he would have liked all this,\" said Worsfold, gesturing at the gathering crowd.</p><p>Phil Burton was one of a number of veterans who arrived by motorbike to pay their respects. A member of the Brothers in Arms biking fraternity who served 14 years with the Royal Artillery in Northern Ireland and Bosnia, Burton said he had driven through the rain from Leyland, in the South Ribble.</p><p>He agreed that Percival might not have relished the attention. \"If you'd asked him, he'd probably not have wanted this. Nobody wants a fuss when they go,\" he said. \"But if he's looking down now, seeing all these people, he'll be thinking: 'The family's come for me.'\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422199766|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|bc787153e44453a17a752c985888b39f020b935e -->",
