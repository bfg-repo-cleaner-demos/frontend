        "body":"<p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has vowed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/obama-nsa-dossier-classified-surveillance\" title=\"\">a review into National Security Agency surveillance activities</a> will result in the \"right\" balance between security and privacy and that outrage over alleged espionage and eavesdropping should not disrupt trade talks between Europe and the US.</p><p>Speaking in Warsaw after talks with Poland's foreign minister, Kerry said that Europeans and others have legitimate questions about the surveillance and that those would be answered in private diplomatic discussions.</p><p>\"We need to understand that we are all in this together,\" Kerry said. \"We are all in the effort to be able to provide protection to our citizens. And we have to strike the right balance between protecting our citizens and obviously the privacy of all our citizens. That is a balance that we do try to strike.\"</p><p>Kerry said Barack Obama had ordered a complete review of the NSA's activities. But Kerry said it was important that concerns over the NSA did not affect discussions about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/13/us-and-eu-transatlantic-trade-liberalisation\" title=\"\">Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a>. Some European officials have said the surveillance issue may have a negative impact on the negotiations.</p><p>\"This is about jobs, it's about the economy, it is about economic competition in a global community that competes, sometimes by rules that are very questionable and shaky,\" Kerry said.</p><p>Kerry, the most senior Obama administration official to visit Europe since revelations of NSA spying sparked outrage across the continent, emphasised that the US understood concerns.</p><p>\"We want to hear from our allies, we want to have this conversation,\" Kerry said. \"President Obama welcomes this opportunity to work with our allies. And, ultimately, if we get it right, which we will, we will not only alleviate the concerns but we can actually strengthen our intelligence relationships going forward.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421686568|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|7d220e26ec374564bd893367b7004a7b938d79c9 -->",

He added: \"It doesn't happen overnight, it takes time.\"</p><p>After leaving Riyadh, Kerry will travel to Poland, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Morocco before returning to Washington. He has already visited Cairo as part of the 10-day tour.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421639854|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|00d26679ed885d22e36ec327b1984aaea4257107 -->",

        "headline":"Battle to end anti-gay job discrimination given boost in US Senate",
        "body":"<p>A landmark bill that would ban workplace discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender people passed a key vote in the US Senate on Monday, relying on support from a few initially reluctant Republicans.</p><p>The procedural vote to move to a Senate debate on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (Enda), viewed as a key test of support for the bill, passed the Senate by 61 votes to 30, one more than required.</p><p>But the prospects of the bill eventually becoming law were dealt a blow when the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, said he did not support it. \"The Speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small business jobs,\" Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said.</p><p>Boehner had previously avoided committing to a position on the legislation, and his opposition was a setback for supporters of the bill.</p><p>Barack Obama strongly supports Enda, and, in an op-ed piece published by the Huffington Post yesterday, said millions of LGBT Americans currently went to work fearful of losing their jobs.</p><p>\"It's offensive. It's wrong. And it needs to stop because, in the United States of America, who you are and who you love should never be a fire-able offence,\" the president wrote.</p><p>Obama compared the battle over Enda to efforts to end discrimination against women and religious and racial minorities. \"Passing Enda would build on the progress we've made in recent years,\" he added. \"When Congress passes it, I will sign it into law, and our nation will be fairer and stronger for generations to come.\"</p><p>The procedural move in the Senate required 60 votes to ensure that conservative Republicans could not block it. In total, seven Republicans joined all the members of the Democratic majority, including three who appeared to hesitate.</p><p>The vote was delayed as Republican senators Kelly Ayotte, Pat Toomey and Rob Portman met in the Republican cloak room, just off the Senate floor, where they were lobbied by the legislation's backers.</p><p>Those involved in the a last-minute attempt to persuade the Republican trio included Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, and his deputy, Chuck Schumer.</p><p>All three Republicans eventually voted for the measure, ensuring it scraped through, after apparently negotiating future amendments in exchange for their support.</p><p>The fact the vote received the backing of moderate Republicans, as well as Democrats from conservative states who in previous years might have felt obliged to vote no, revealed that social attitudes in the US are changing, though slowly.</p><p>Another wavering Republican Senator, Dean Heller, had announced earlier in the day that he would back the bill, which would make it illegal for a firm in any US state to sack an individual because of their gender identity or sexual orientation.</p><p>Heller, a senator from Nevada – which is one of 22 states to have banned workplace discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation – described his decision to support the bill as \"the right thing to do\". He added: \"This legislation raises the federal standards to match what we have come to expect in Nevada, which is that discrimination must not be tolerated under any circumstance.\" The Senate last voted on Enda in 1996, when it failed by one vote.</p><p>The proposed legislation has become a touchstone issue, revealing the fissure between the moderate and more conservative wings of the GOP.</p><p>Gay and transgender advocacy groups consider the bill a critical step towards equal rights in the US. They have had the support of Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who has tried to lobby colleagues to back the bill.</p><p>However, conservative Republicans have expressed discomfort with a bill that would afford new federal rights to gay and transgender people, claiming that, if enacted, the law would enable unwarranted lawsuits. A recent study by the Government Accountability Office – the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of Congress – found the existing state-level anti-discrimination laws had led to \"relatively few\" legal actions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421667733|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|81dc5d5a167455a58073a5579d6eb0ce4307b854 -->",

        "body":"<p>Hours before its biggest political test since defeat in the 2012 national election, the Republican party is praying that voters in Virginia's election for state governor on Tuesday prove more like the enthusiastic crowd gathered recently just outside the town of Norfolk.</p> <p>Ageing, overwhelmingly white &ndash; despite being hosted by the local Filipino cultural centre &ndash; and surrounded by the world's largest naval base, the core supporters turning out at last-minute rallies like this for conservative candidate Ken Cuccinelli are as loyal as they come.</p> <p>The problem is, there aren't enough of them. Shortly before the opening prayer, organisers patrol the back of a half-empty room, gently prodding the elderly campaigners to stand closer together so they appear a tight throng before the watching television cameras. The stark math is mirrored by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/\">multiple opinion polls</a> showing that the once-dominant Cuccinelli has slipped more than six points behind his Democratic rival Terry McAuliffe.</p> <p>Both sides have spent the final few days preaching to the converted in similar small rallies up and down this swing state. Both camps are increasingly more pre-occupied with ensuring turnout among the political base than persuading any last-minute floating voters.</p> <p>At recent McAuliffe rallies, even Barack Obama and his Democratic predecessor Bill Clinton have warned that the Democrats' biggest danger lies in a low turnout, a particular problem in the \"off-year\" votes that follow presidential elections.</p> <p>But only Republicans are actively hoping that moderate floating voters stay home this time. &ldquo;If turnout is in the 30s, the low 30s, we&rsquo;re gonna win,&rdquo; Virginia Republican party chairman Pat Mullins was <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/ken-cuccinelli-virginia-election-2013-99287.html#ixzz2jgmuybTj\">reported to have told supporters</a> this weekend.</p> <p>&ldquo;If it gets higher up in Fairfax [in Democratic-leaning northern Virginia], say, like, 40, it&rsquo;s likely we won&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to hit 40 anywhere. I&rsquo;m looking at 32.&rdquo;</p> <p>The results on Tuesday night will show if this bitter, personality-driven campaign has indeed turned off Virginia's moderates, yet the bigger question for Republicans nationally is whether the apparent unpopularity of their hardline candidate will be a taste of things to come in the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential race.</p> <p>The contrast is made all the more stark by opinion polls further up the coast in New Jersey, where moderate Republican candidate Chris Christie is ahead of his Democratic rival by a margin even bigger than McAuliffe in the other gubernatorial race due to reach a climax on Tuesday.</p> <p>These two state elections have become therefore not just a mirror for Republican electoral hopes nationally, but a battleground for the two competing ideological groups battling for control of the party.</p> <p>While former presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been out supporting Christie, Cuccinelli has played host to 2016 hopefuls such as senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul.</p> <p>Rand Paul, son of the libertarian favourite Ron, was unapologetic about his focus on national topics during last week's rally in Norfolk &ndash; rehearsing his growing appeal on civil liberties issues such as excessive surveillance by the National Security Agency.&nbsp;&ldquo;While this is not primarily a state issue, this is something where you have a candidate who believes in the right to privacy and will say no to a federal government spying on its citizens,&rdquo; said Paul.</p> <p>&ldquo;There is only one candidate in this race that will defend the second amendment, the fourth amendment, and the sixth amendment, and it's Ken Cuccinelli.&rdquo;</p> <p>This is an area where the new breed of conservative Republicans differs from more traditional hardliners.</p> <p>Battling against his divisive reputation as social conservative on issues such as abortion, Cuccinelli has been painting himself as civil liberties campaigner &ndash; reminding supporters how he helped release a wrongfully-convicted murderer while serving as state attorney general.</p> <p>&ldquo;I am running in the office first held by Thomas Jefferson, that is an extremely humbling thought,&rdquo; he said while standing alongside Paul. &ldquo;America started here, a few miles away in Cape Henry 406 years ago &ndash; and this is where the battle for first principles should continue to be fought. We should be a guiding post, not just for the commonwealth of Virginia but for the USA.&rdquo;</p> <p>It's on the issue of big government however, that the distinction between modern conservative Republicans and their Democratic rivals are most extreme, particularly after the flawed launch of Obama's healthcare reforms and the recent government shutdown gave fresh vigour to the fight in Virginia.</p> <p>&ldquo;Talk about a clear choice,&rdquo; says Cuccinelli. &ldquo;I need your help to communicate these choices, they are as clear as they could be: on taxes, on Obamacare, on the second amendment. Bigger government will lead you to Terry's position, smaller government will lead you to mine.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;I am the only candidate who has been fighting for you for 20 years,&rdquo; he adds, pointing to his time suing Washington as state attorney general. &ldquo;Whether it's for one person who was wrongfully committed of crimes he didn't commit or whether it's fighting the biggest opponent in the world: the United States government.&rdquo;</p> <p>If Republicans had wanted to market-test which of their competing strategies for winning back control of Washington would prove acceptable to swing voters, they could not have staged a more clear cut test than Tuesday's votes in Virginia and New Jersey.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421641066|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|bc876e0b9c749529db0987dd56a0a5c0a3de09ec -->",

        "body":"<p>Multiple shots were fired inside a northern New Jersey mall shortly before closing time and the search was on early Tuesday for the suspected shooter, a Bergen county official said. There was no report of injuries.</p> <p>Jeanne Baratta said authorities believed the shooter may still be in the Garden State Plaza Mall. Swat teams were concentrating their search in the north-east corner of the 200,000 square metre mall in Paramus.</p> <p>Baratta said a call was received saying shots were fired at the facility shortly before the mall's 9.30pm closing time on Monday night.</p> <p>Paramus police chief Kenneth Ehrenberg said early on Tuesday that the suspect had been dressed in black and wore what was believed to be a motorcycle helmet. A weapon had not been recovered.</p> <p>Witnesses said the sound of gunfire sent customers and employees rushing for the exits and hiding places.<br />Baratta said authorities found one bullet casing.</p> <p>Hundreds of law enforcement officers converged on the mall, which was put on lockdown. New Jersey state police landed a helicopter in the parking lot of one of the state's largest and most popular shopping malls.</p> <p>Baratta said Swat teams and police with canine units were going through the mall and working to evacuate anyone still inside. As of early Tuesday authorities believed there were still people in the mall, she said.</p> <p>Nick Woods was working in a Lego store when a woman ran by shouting that there was a shooting.<br />Woods said his supervisor locked them in a back room, along with a woman, a man and a child.</p> <p>When they peeked out two hours later, they saw police officers standing outside and he called the police emergency dispatcher to ask that the officers be told they were coming out. He said the emergency operator told him she could not contact individual police officers and that he should walk out with his hands in the air.</p> <p>\"I had to go out of the store shouting at the officers with my hands up and they turned and pointed their guns at me,\" Woods said. \"It was one of the scariest experiences of my life.\"</p> <p>Jessica Stigliano, 21, of Richfield, New Jersey, said she was sitting in the mall's food court when she saw people running and yelling \"shots were fired\".</p> <p>Carlos Sinde, 36, of Astoria, Queens, said he was ushered out of a cinema screening of the movie Gravity. \"Once the security guards started telling us what was going on, that's when there was hysteria,\" he said.</p> <p>The mall is located in Bergen county, about 15 miles (24km) north-west of Manhattan.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421670781|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|3d3cc0fe289deb2570d5a1f558ff23fff36afbf6 -->",

We expect it to move below 7% by mid-2015, a year ahead of the Bank of England's current forecast. However, given the positive developments in the last couple of months, the Bank is likely to downgrade its unemployment forecast in its next Inflation Report due next Wednesday. This will probably be accompanied with upward revisions to growth as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers, World First, said:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The services sector is flying.&nbsp;Records in both output and employment have guided the PMI to the highest level since Tony Blair took power in the UK back in 1997, as confidence around the long-term ability for recovery continues to increase. Combined with the manufacturing figure from Friday and yesterday’s 6 year record construction number, we can safely say that momentum is firmly gathering in the UK economy. The wind is very much in our sails.</p> <p>We would have to say that growth is now running at close to 5% on an annualised basis, on these initial estimates, and, at the moment, shows little sign of abating. We must now wait for the Bank of England’s appraisal of this run of numbers. There will be a fair few of the economic fraternity of who will be looking forward to next week’s Quarterly Inflation Report and expecting some form of outlook change from the MPC; a change that will see rates rising sooner than the 2016 expectation that was originally forecast…</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andy Scott, associate director at HiFX:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following positive surprises in the manufacturing and construction sector indexes, the early indicators for the fourth quarter look like 2013 could see the economy grow at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Markit, the company that measures and releases the data for all three sectors, said that combining the three indexes points to GDP growth this quarter of 1.3%. This should serve to ease some concerns that have arisen over the past few weeks that the recovery won’t be sustained. The buoyancy of the housing market where prices have been rising steadily helped by increasing mortgage approvals and the government’s help to buy scheme has been what a lot of commentators have put the recovery down to but clearly it’s broader based. With unemployment continuing to fall at a modest but steady pace, confidence will be maintained which should boost consumer spending and corporate investment. </p> </blockquote> <h2>And here's our full story:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\">Service sector growing at fastest pace since 1997</a></h2> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c878e4b08cac6a3300fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:29:47.754Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">MPs grill Wonga: Payday lenders admit making changes</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Wonga has also admitted it was forced to make changes to its sales practices following an Office of Fair Trading investigation,as the hearing before MPs continued...</strong></p> <p>It was told to highlight risk factors more prominently on its website and make clearer disclosures around APRs (percentage interest rates).</p> <p><strong>QuickQuid</strong> and <strong>Mr Lender</strong> admits that they have been ordered by the Office of Fair Trading to change their procedures on 'roll overs' where hard-pressed borrowers ask for a loan to be rolled over at the end of the term.</p> <p>In total, Mr Lender admits that it was told to make around 30 changes to its procedures.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:31:44.278Z\">at 10.31am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c778e4b00d1cb164472b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:28:59.928Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Back to parliament, and&nbsp;MPs are pressing payday lenders on how they check whether borrowers can afford a payday loan. </strong></p> <p>Adam Freeman, chief executive of Mr Lender, admits that it has no idea if a borrower is taking out new loans from Wonga or other lenders at the same time.&nbsp;</p> <p>He gives an example of a person taking home &pound;1,500 a month with &pound;600 left after rent and other expenses.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We might then lend them &pound;300 or &pound;350.

        "body":"<p>A court in Bangladesh has sentenced 152 people to death for their actions in a 2009 border guard mutiny in which 74 people, including 57 military commanders, were killed.</p><p>Dhaka's metropolitan sessions court judge Mohammad Akhtaruzzaman also sentenced 157 others, mostly border guards, to life in prison while 271 people were acquitted. The extensive case involves 846 accused, and the verdicts are still being announced.</p><p>The mutiny on 25-26 February 2009 took place two months after the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, took office. The  military was unhappy over the response of the government, which did not allow troops to attack the border guards' headquarters in Dhaka where military commanders were killed.</p><p>Hasina offered an amnesty to quell the revolt but rescinded the offer when dozens of bodies were found in sewers and in mass graves.</p><p>Bangladesh's military has staged 21  coup attempts. The amnesty offer and the government's handling of the case strained the military's relationship with Hasina, and she pledged to try those responsible.</p><p>The country's criminal investigation department investigated and pressed charges against 850 people with serious crimes including murder and arson. Four of the accused died and 20 were tried in absentia.</p><p>Human rights groups have criticised Bangladesh for the mass trial, saying it will not aid justice. New York-based Human Rights Watch last week said at least 47 suspects have died in custody while the suspects have had limited access to lawyers, and to knowledge of the charges and evidence against them. Bangladeshi authorities have denied the allegations.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421683522|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|0029cb01d6b5c0a686861dce24b24aaa931b60d9 -->",

        "body":"<p>SAC Capital has become the first hedge fund to plead guilty to insider trading after an extensive six-year dragnet by government regulators, who issued a warning to future \"Gordon Gekkos\" and imposed fines that totalled $1.8bn.</p> <p>\"No institution should rest in the belief that is too big to jail,\" said Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York. \"That is a moral hazard.\"</p> <p>April Brooks, who heads the New York field office of the FBI, said the proposed settlement should act as a warning to \"those who venerate Gordon Gekko\", referring to the Machiavellian capitalist in the 1987 movie Wall Street who popularized the phrase \"greed is good\".&nbsp;</p> <p>SAC has agreed to a passel of penalties, which follow a July indictment by Bharara's office. It must pay a&nbsp;$900m fine and forfeit another $900m to the federal government, though $616m that SAC companies have already agreed to pay to settle parallel actions by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be deducted from the $1.8bn.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most of the money will come from founder&nbsp;Steven A Cohen rather than outside investors. Bharara said the fine would not be tax-deductible.</p> <p>Anyone working at SAC currently will also have to face obstacles to their futures. No one at the firm, even those who co-operated, will have immunity from further prosecution, Bharara said.</p> <p>SAC also agreed to accept a five-year probation period &ndash; in which any employee seeking to start a new investing business would require government permission &ndash; and agreed to shut down its advisory business, which accepts money from outside investors.&nbsp;</p> <p>The agreement still has to be approved by a judge, officials said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The move isolates SAC, which once reigned at the center of the hedge-fund world and whose founder was listed by Forbes as being worth $8.8bn. \"SAC will no longer be able to invest anyone's money but their own,\" said Brooks.</p> <p>Brooks quoted the July indictment, which called the insider trading at SAC \"substantial, pervasive and on a scale without known precedent\", adding that \"it was nothing short of institutional failure\".&nbsp;</p> <p>She also indicated that government regulators, including the Department of Justice, FBI and the SEC, plan to use SAC as a lesson to other fund managers. Brooks said officials will \"relentlessly pursue\" insider traders. \"How your employees make their money is just as important as how much they make,\" she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a statement, FBI assistant director George Venizelos said SAC Capital's plea demonstrates \"that cheating and breaking the law were not only permitted but allowed to persist\".</p> <p>In the July indictment, prosecutors said evidence against SAC was \"voluminous\" and included electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prosecutors said a work culture at SAC permitted, if not encouraged, insider trading. Authorities alleged that SAC Capital earned hundreds of millions of dollars illegally from 1999 to 2010 as its portfolio managers and analysts traded on inside information from at least 20 public companies. Bharara in July said SAC Capital \"trafficked in inside information on a scale without any known precedent in the history of hedge funds&rdquo;.</p> <p>Of the roughly $15bn in assets that SAC managed as of earlier this year, about half belonged to Cohen and his employees. The rest was client money.</p> <p>Cohen was not named as a defendant in the case. He was repeatedly referenced in court papers at the \"SACowner\" who \"enabled and promoted\" insider trading practices.</p> <p>In a separate case, the SEC is pursuing Cohen, SAC's founder, in an attempt to ban him from the securities industry for failing to prevent insider trading at the company, which he founded in 1992. Cohen has disputed the SEC's allegations. That case remains unresolved.</p> <p>As part of the deal announced Monday, prosecutors said they will not assert claims for financial recovery against any present owner or shareholder of the SAC defendants for insider trading on behalf of the SAC up to 21 December last year, except for criminal fines or forfeiture claims related to insider trading profits or avoided losses. The agreement also reserved the right of prosecutors to charge others criminally.</p> <p>Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business who studies corporate reputation, said the settlement, despite its size and impact, would likely not serve as a deterrent to others who might be pondering insider trading.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Think about how many people didn't get fined today that should have,\" Argenti said. \"Think about how many companies have done things like this before, over a long period of time. When I track how people think of reputation in the financial sector and business, it's never been worse. Trust in business is at an all-time low. People look at this and say, 'Look at this. They made tons of money and now we know how.'\"</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421649512|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|89cf1960b0d4be5e688a745f24e5a7f29ecda13c -->",

        "body":"<p>A knife-wielding man hijacked a bus on Monday in rural Norway and killed the driver and two passengers before he was detained by authorities, officials said.</p><p>Police in Sogn and Fjordane county in western Norway gave few details about the suspect, but described him as a local resident originally from South Sudan. Police attorney Trine Erdal said the suspect was in his early 30s, not in his 50s as police had earlier reported.</p><p>The motive for the killings was not immediately clear.</p><p>The victims were two men in their 50s – the Norwegian bus driver and a Swedish passenger – and a 19-year-old Norwegian woman, Erdal said. All had been stabbed.

        "body":"<p>Congolese rebels have surrendered  after a 20-month uprising, offering the best hope of peace for years in the country's war-ravaged east.</p><p>The M23 rebel group declared a ceasefire and said it was ready to disarm and demobilise troops and pursue a political solution to end the crisis.</p><p>\"The chief of general staff and the commanders of all major units are requested to prepare troops for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration on terms to be agreed with the government of Congo,\" the M23 leader, Bertrand Bisimwa, said.</p><p>The announcement came hours after Democratic Republic of the Congo government forces drove the rebel fighters out of their  two remaining strongholds. \"Tshanzu and Runyoni were taken by the army around 3am,\" government spokesman Lambert Mende told Reuters. \"Many M23 fighters are surrendering. Militarily this is finished.\"</p><p>The Kinshasa government expects peace talks mediated by neighbouring Uganda to resume soon, Mende added.</p><p>Al-Jazeera showed pictures of  M23 military leader General Sultani Makenga's abandoned home in the village of Chanzu and quoted witnesses saying  he had fled to neighbouring Rwanda.</p><p>The M23 is made up of fighters who deserted the Congolese army in April 2012 following a mutiny. Its name <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20438531\" title=\"\">is a reference to a 23 March 2009 peace deal</a>  the CNDP militia accused the Congolese government of betraying. Eight hundred thousand people have fled their homes since the insurgency began.</p><p>The rebels' capitulation marks a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/world/africa/a-reason-for-hope-in-congos-perpetual-war.html\" title=\"\">dramatic turnaround</a>. Less than a year ago they marched into and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/20/congo-rebel-m23-take-goma\" title=\"\">captured the major eastern city of Goma</a> and bragged  they were ready to march on the capital. UN peacekeepers were passive spectators and the Congolese army descended into a drunken, defeated shambles.</p><p>But the lightning reversal appears to be a vindication of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/05/un-force-democratic-republic-congo\" title=\"\">UN decision to create its first fighting force with a mandate to go on the offensive</a>. Tanks and helicopters from the 3,000-strong UN intervention brigade have supported a reorganised, better paid and more disciplined Congolese army in the recent advances.</p><p>Perhaps most crucially of all, the backing that the M23 received from neighbouring Rwanda has virtually dried up in recent months, <a href=\"http://congosiasa.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/as-m23-nears-defeat-more-questions-than.html\" title=\"\">regional analyst Jason Stearns blogged last week</a>. \"According to several reports from the frontlines, despite indications of some cross-border support in the Kibumba area, the M23 was largely left to its own devices,\" Stearns wrote. \"'The Rwandans just wouldn't pick up their phone calls,' one source close to the M23 leadership told me.\"</p><p>Rwanda has always denied the charge made by the UN's group of experts that it was providing military and logistical support to the M23.</p><p>African leaders meeting in Pretoria, South Africa, congratulated Congolese government forces and the UN peace enforcement mission in eastern Congo for \"recapturing M23 strongholds and restoring government control\". Kabila was present at the meeting but the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, sent his foreign minister.</p><p>Conflict in eastern Congo goes back two decades to the Rwandan genocide and has claimed millions of lives,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/16/congo\" title=\"\"> earning the label \"Africa's first world war\"</a>.  The collapse of the M23 marks a hopeful breakthrough but numerous other armed groups continue to operate in the vast area.</p><p>Russell Feingold, US special envoy to the Congo and the Great Lakes region, told a briefing in Pretoria: \"In a region that has suffered so much, this is obviously a significant positive step in the right direction.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421684474|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|2c66d69b6f4fd25b92bc839a8d8320d15b135145 -->",

        "body":"<p>The chances of keeping the global temperature increase below 2C will &ldquo;swiftly diminish&rdquo; unless the world takes immediate action to escalate cuts in carbon emissions, the United Nations has warned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unep.org\">The UN Environment Program</a> said that even if nations meet their current emissions reduction pledges, carbon emissions in 2020 will be eight to 12 gigatonnes above the level required to avoid a costly nosedive in greenhouse gas output.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unep.org/publications/ebooks/emissionsgapreport2013/EmissionsGapReport2013/tabid/130755/ctl/Login/language/en-US/Default.aspx?returnurl=%2fpublications%2febooks%2femissionsgapreport2013%2fDefault.aspx\">The Emissions Gap Report 2013</a>, which was compiled by 44 scientific groups in 17 countries, warns that if the greenhouse &ldquo;gap&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;closed or significantly narrowed&rdquo; by 2020, the pathway to limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C will be closed.</p> <p>At UN talks in 2010, the international community agreed to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 2C by 2100, based on pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>Scientists at the recent IPCC gathering warned that the world could emit enough carbon to surpass <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/27/ipcc-world-dangerous-climate-change\">the 2C limit within 30 years</a>, and this latest UN analysis heightens concerns that the world could be heading for a temperature rise of 4C or even 6C, triggering damaging sea level rises, extreme weather events and food insecurity.</p> <p>The Emissions Gap Report, released ahead of climate talks in Warsaw next week, found that although the 2C target could be achieved with higher emissions by 2020, failure to significantly reduce CO2 levels will &ldquo;exacerbate mitigation challenges&rdquo; after this time.</p> <p>&ldquo;This will mean much higher rates of global emission reductions in the medium term; greater lock-in of carbon-intensive infrastructure; greater dependence on often unproven technologies in the medium term; greater costs of mitigation in the medium and long term; and greater risks of failing to meet the 2C target,&rdquo; the UN Environment Program stated.</p> <p>In order to avoid this scenario, the report recommends that emissions should reach a maximum of 44 gigatonnes of CO2 by 2020, falling to 40 gigatonnes by 2025 and further to 22 gigatonnes by 2050.</p> <p>However, given that the 2C target was set based on the assumption that action would start in 2010, the report warns it will become &ldquo;increasingly difficult&rdquo; to meet this goal. Global greenhouse gas emissions for 2010, the latest year for which data is available, stood at 50.1 gigatonnes.</p> <p>Although the report states the window for action is &ldquo;narrowing&rdquo;, the 2C target could still be achieved by implementing ambitious emissions reduction promises, tightening the rules of existing pledges and international co-operation on areas such as energy efficiency, renewables and fossil fuel subsidies.</p> <p>Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/30/climate-change-abbott-emissions-target\">Climate Change Authority said</a> that Australia&rsquo;s 5% emissions reduction goal is &ldquo;not a credible option&rdquo; and should be increased, possibly to 15% or 25%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/28/australia-should-reduce-carbon-emissions-by-at-least-25-by-2020\">A separate analysis</a> by WWF found that Australia has already burned through two-thirds of its share of a &ldquo;carbon budget&rdquo; that would keep the temperature rise under 2C.</p> <p>Achim Steiner, UN Environment Program executive director, said that delayed action to reduce emissions would increase the rate of climate change-fueled impacts.</p> <p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;lock-in&rsquo; would slow down the introduction of climate-friendly technologies and narrow the developmental choices that would place the global community on the path to a sustainable, green future,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, the stepping stone of the 2020 target can still be achieved by strengthening current pledges and by further action, including scaling up international co-operation initiatives in areas such as energy efficiency, fossil fuel subsidy reform and renewable energy.</p> <p>&ldquo;Even agriculture can contribute, as direct emissions from this sector are currently responsible for 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions &ndash; more if its indirect emissions are taken into account.&rdquo;</p> <p>Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who was recently accused of &ldquo;talking through her hat&rdquo; by Tony Abbott for linking bushfires to climate change, added: &ldquo;As we head towards Warsaw for the latest round of climate negotiations, there is a real need for increased ambition by all countries: ambition which can take countries further and faster towards bridging the emissions gap and a sustainable future for all.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, increased national ambition will not be enough to meet the scientific realities of climate change, which is one reason why a universal new agreement &ndash; able to catalyse international co-operation &ndash; is urgently needed by 2015.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421674669|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|89d4e449df071426876548cc217cd90faa5ae039 -->",

        "body":"<p>Doctors and psychologists working for the US military violated the ethical codes of their profession under instruction from the defence department and the CIA to become involved in the torture and degrading treatment of suspected terrorists, an investigation has concluded.</p><p>The report of the Taskforce on Preserving Medical Professionalism in National Security Detention Centres concludes that after 9/11, health professionals working with the military and intelligence services \"designed and participated in cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment and torture of detainees\".</p><p>Medical professionals were in effect told that their ethical mantra \"first do no harm\" did not apply, because they were not treating people who were ill.</p><p>The report lays blame primarily on the defence department (DoD) and the CIA, which required their healthcare staff to put aside any scruples in the interests of intelligence gathering and security practices that caused severe harm to detainees, from waterboarding to sleep deprivation and force-feeding.</p><p>The two-year review by the 19-member taskforce, Ethics Abandoned: Medical Professionalism and Detainee Abuse in the War on Terror, supported by the <a href=\"http://www.imapny.org/medicine_as_a_profession/interrogationtorture-and-dual-loyalty\">Institute on Medicine as a Profession (IMAP)</a> and the Open Society Foundations, says that the DoD termed those involved in interrogation \"safety officers\" rather than doctors. Doctors and nurses were required to participate in the force-feeding of prisoners on hunger strike, against the rules of the World Medical Association and the American Medical Association. Doctors and psychologists working for the DoD were required to breach patient confidentiality and share what they knew of the prisoner's physical and psychological condition with interrogators and were used as interrogators themselves. They also failed to comply with recommendations from the army surgeon general on reporting abuse of detainees.</p><p>The CIA's office of medical services played a critical role in advising the justice department that \"enhanced interrogation\" methods, such as extended sleep deprivation and waterboarding, which are recognised as forms of torture, were medically acceptable. CIA medical personnel were present when waterboarding was taking place, the taskforce says.</p><p>Although the DoD has taken steps to address concerns over practices at Guantánamo Bay in recent years, and the CIA has said it no longer has suspects in detention, the taskforce says that these \"changed roles for health professionals and anaemic ethical standards\" remain.</p><p>\"The American public has a right to know that the covenant with its physicians to follow professional ethical expectations is firm regardless of where they serve,\" said Dr Gerald Thomson, professor of medicine emeritus at Columbia University and member of the taskforce.</p><p>He added: \"It's clear that in the name of national security the military trumped that covenant, and physicians were transformed into agents of the military and performed acts that were contrary to medical ethics and practice. We have a responsibility to make sure this never happens again.\"The taskforce says that unethical practices by medical personnel, required by the military, continue today. The DoD \"continues to follow policies that undermine standards of professional conduct\" for interrogation, hunger strikes, and reporting abuse. Protocols have been issued requiring doctors and nurses to participate in the force-feeding of detainees, including forced extensive bodily restraints for up to two hours twice a day.</p><p>Doctors are still required to give interrogators access to medical and psychological information about detainees which they can use to exert pressure on them. Detainees are not permitted to receive treatment for the distress caused by their torture.</p><p>\"Putting on a uniform does not and should not abrogate the fundamental principles of medical professionalism,\" said IMAP president David Rothman. \"'Do no harm' and 'put patient interest first' must apply to all physicians regardless of where they practise.\"The taskforce wants a full investigation into the involvement of the medical profession in detention centres. It is also calling for publication of the Senate intelligence committee's inquiry into CIA practices and wants rules to ensure doctors and psychiatrists working for the military are allowed to abide by the ethical obligations of their profession; they should be prohibited from taking part in interrogation, sharing information from detainees' medical records with interrogators, or participating in force-feeding, and they should be required to report abuse of detainees.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421563159|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|654439bec74939bd78505b28f89aeced9650d1e3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Rebekah Brooks and her husband hatched a complicated plot to hide evidence from the police only to be foiled by a conscientious cleaner, an Old Bailey jury has heard. It was a curious tale involving an underground car park, two pizzas and a famous movie line of Richard Burton's.</p><p>The story was told by the Crown as part of a wider allegation that, as the chief executive of News International, Brooks had tried to conceal evidence of wrongdoing at the News of the World by deleting email records and destroying her journalistic notebooks. She denies two counts of conspiring to pervert the course of justice.</p><p>The jury at the phone-hacking trial also heard an opening speech on behalf of Andy Coulson that the Crown had mis-stated his role as editor of the News of the World and that \"it is his case that he was never party to an agreement to hack phones whatever others might have been doing on his watch\".</p><p>Completing his three-day opening argument for the Crown, Andrew Edis QC took the jury back to July 2011, to the aftermath of the Guardian's disclosure of the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone. \"A media firestorm was about to engulf the News of the World,\" he said. \"You can imagine the extremely anxious, if not panic-stricken approach to these developments that must have been going on at the News of the World.\"</p><p>With a Scotland Yard inquiry closing in, Edis said, News International announced it would close the News of the World, and Brooks, a former editor of the paper, realised she faced arrest when she kept an appointment with police on Sunday 17 July. It was in this context, Edis claimed, that she and her husband Charlie Brooks came up with a plan to stop police finding computers and records at their country home, Jubilee Barn in Oxfordshire, and their flat at Chelsea Harbour, central London.</p><p>That Sunday morning, a chauffeur drove the pair in their Audi from Oxfordshire to London. Back at Jubilee Barn, Edis alleged, the head of security at News International, Mark Hanna, collected items which were to be concealed and set off in a black Range Rover to the company's office in Wapping. Hanna, meanwhile, was in charge of protecting the Brookses from \"newspaper people\" and others in what had been named internally Operation Blackhawk.</p><p>By noon the chauffeur had dropped off Charlie Brooks and driven Rebekah Brooks to Lewisham police station, waiting while she was formally arrested and questioned. At 12.15pm, Edis said, Charlie Brooks was caught by CCTV cameras at Chelsea Harbour going down to the underground car park, carrying a jiffy bag and a laptop computer which he appeared to leave in or around a waste bin. Two hours later, the CCTV recorded Hanna apparently removing both items. According to cell site information from his mobile phone, Hanna then returned to head office at Thomas More Square.</p><p>That afternoon the police searched both of the Brookses' homes. Edis suggested to the jury that among the material concealed from there were two iPads and an iPhone which, according to electronic records, the couple had been using recently. \"The coast is clear,\" he said. \"The police have been and gone. But of course, it may not be entirely clear because there may be police or press keeping an eye on what was going on.\"</p><p>This became important, the jury heard, when it was decided to return some \"safe\" items to the Brookses that evening.</p><p>Hanna texted one of his men: \"Have plan. Can you call please?\" Edis suggested to the jury that this security man had been tasked to go to News International headquarters at Wapping, to collect a big bin bag containing some of the concealed items and to take them to Chelsea Harbour where there was some risk of being spotted by police or press. \"There has got to be some sort of pretext,\" he said. Which is where the pizzas allegedly became involved.</p><p>According to Edis, the security man had picked up two pizzas, phoned Charlie Brooks, delivered the pizzas to an unnamed man who came down to the underground car park, left the bin bag behind a bin and then texted his immediate boss with a line famously used by Richard Burton when communicating with his commanding officer in Where Eagles Dare.</p><p>\"Broadsword to Danny Boy\" he texted, adding: \"Pizzas delivered. The chicken is in the pot.\"</p><p>His boss texted back: \"Amateurs! We should have done a DLB or a brush contact on the riverside. Log the hours as pizza delivery.\" Edis explained that a DLB is a dead letter box of the kind used by spies and that what the text as a whole meant was: \"You have done the secret little job. We could have done that better. Log in the hours as pizza delivery because you can't log in the hours as perverting the course of justice.\"</p><p>\"The whole exercise,\" said Edis, \"was quite complicated and quite risky and liable to go wrong.\" On the following morning, the prosecutor told the jury, it had indeed gone wrong: when the chauffeur drove the Brookses to see their solicitor, leaving the bin bag still behind the waste bin.</p><p>In their absence, a cleaner, Mr Nascimento, had noticed the bag and its contents and taken it to his manager. When the Brookses returned, CCTV records showed, Charlie Brooks had searched the area around the waste bin and texted the security man who had left the bin bag there: \"Need to get Rebekah some lunch. Pizza.\"</p><p>But by then, said Edis, Nascimento's manager had decided to call the police \"which is how the police ended up with the bin bag\".</p><p>Separately, the jury heard that in the previous week, on Friday 8 July, the day after the closure of the News of the World was announced, Rebekah Brooks and her personal assistant, Cheryl Carter, had arranged to remove from the company archive seven boxes allegedly containing all the notebooks Brooks had used from 1995 to 2007. Carter had falsely told the archivist that they were her own notebooks, Edis said, and then falsely told police that Brooks had not been in the office on this day. \"It was quite dishonest,\" the prosecutor said. The notebooks had never been found.</p><p>Rebekah and Charlie Brooks, Cheryl Carter and Mark Hanna all deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice.</p><p>The trial continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421653953|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|150bcb4fc66c3c96d2247a2e143446373f43ebdc -->",

Dressed in a dark suit and no tie, and still full of figure, he did not even look like a prisoner. And he tried not to sound like one, either.</p><p>\"What is happening now is a military coup,\" he bellowed shortly after entering the courtroom, in the hectoring tone that Egyptians came to lampoon during his year-long presidency. \"I am furious that the Egyptian judiciary should serve as cover for this criminal military coup.\"</p><p>They were his first words in public since 2 July, when he gave a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/egypt-morsi-army-deadline-expires\" title=\"\">rambling televised speech</a> the night before he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/03/mohamed-morsi-egypt-second-revolution\" title=\"\">deposed by the army</a> following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/30/mohamed-morsi-egypt-protests\" title=\"\">days of mass protests</a> in which millions of Egyptians had called for the military to intervene.</p><p>On Monday he resurfaced for the preliminary hearing of his trial for incitement to murder. And his reappearance sparked bedlam. Seven of Morsi's co-defendants chanted against the army who ousted him, local journalists shouted for his execution, and scuffles broke out between rival lawyers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421646582'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/4/1383589283702/Mohamed-Morsi-in-a-cage-i-009.jpg' alt='Mohamed Morsi in a cage in a courthouse' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi stands in a cage on the first day of his trial in Cairo.

When he finally did appear, proceedings began in an orderly enough fashion. His co-accused gave a polite round of applause as he strode defiantly into the defendants' cage, flashing a four-fingered salute known as the Rabaa sign that has become a calling card for Morsi supporters.</p><p>But the trial quickly descended into farce, with the defendants' legal team chanting Morsi's name and crying \"the people demand the return of the president\".</p><p>Morsi's co-defendants added to the chorus with chants of \"down with military rule\", a slogan the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/26/egypt-revolution-muslim-brotherhood\" title=\"\">Muslim Brotherhood</a> declined to use before Morsi's overthrow in a vain attempt to win over the army.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421646583'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383580824155/bdc62ed2-4794-4200-8d2e-a4aa28dd67a4-460x276.jpeg' alt='A supporter of Egypt's ousted President Mohammed Morsi shouts to a police officer outside of a police academy compound were the trial of ousted President Mohammed Morsi is held in Cairo, Egypt.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A supporter of Mohamed Morsi shouts to a police officer outside  a police academy compound were Morsi's trial is being held. Photograph: Manu Brabo/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Incensed, a group of local journalists responded by shouting \"execution\", a reference to the death penalty some Egyptians hope awaits Morsi and his Brotherhood allies.</p><p>Then followed a scrum of journalists – foreign and Egyptian – who clambered over the court stalls and pushed past policemen to catch their first glimpse since July of Egypt's first democratically elected president.</p><p>He appeared well, even suave in comparison to his fellow defendants, who were clad in white prison tracksuits. He did not appear to have lost weight during his spell of incarceration. Other defendants had earlier spoken of a more difficult time in prison, with one claiming to journalists from inside the defendants' cage that most of them been tortured. The hair of Mohamed Beltagy, once a member of parliament, had turned from black to grey.</p><p>After the room quietened enough to let the presiding judge formally begin proceedings, each defendant rejected the legitimacy of the court, arguing that they had been imprisoned on political grounds. \"I am Dr Mohamed Morsi and I am the president of the republic,\" shouted Morsi, when asked to identify himself. \"This coup is a crime and treasonous, and the court is held responsible for it.\"</p><p>Another melee followed, with some journalists and policemen in the courtroom calling Morsi a traitor. One lawyer tried to throw a shoe, while others held up pictures of a reporter who was shot during street clashes last December – fighting that Morsi is now accused of inciting.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421646584'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/4/1383560030391/Morsi-supporters-protest--006.jpg' alt='Morsi supporters protest outside court.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Supporters of ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi protest outside the court where he is facing charges of inciting murder.

Those at the sit-in were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/23/morsi-power-grab-angers-opposition\" title=\"\">demonstrating against a new constitution</a> drafted by Morsi's allies.</p><p>The confrontation sparked night-long clashes that left at least 11 dead, some of them Brotherhood supporters, and began a spiral of political upheaval that led the army to overthrow Morsi in July following days of mass protests.</p><p>One of the reporters calling for his execution alleged that she had been tortured by Muslim Brotherhood members during the clashes in December.</p><p>Morsi and his co-defendants say they were arrested for political reasons as a result of July's regime change. But human rights lawyers acting for those who died last December reminded journalists during a break in proceedings that their charges were valid and predated Morsi's overthrow.</p><p>\"This is not a case that has been orchestrated,\" said Ragia Omran, a lawyer for the victims' families. \"It's important to note that we filed the charges on 5 December itself.\"</p><p>Pandemonium inside the court twice forced the trial's adjournment. Each time it reconvened, Morsi made a further speech. He spoke out four times in total.</p><p>\"This is not a court,\" he said in his fourth outburst. \"This court, with all due respect to the people in it, is not specialised to deal with the trial of the president of the republic. This is a coup. I am held against my will. The coup is treasonous and a crime, and I am president of the republic.\"</p><p>The defendants' outbursts led to unlikely exchanges between them and the judge, Ahmed Sabry Youssef, who tried to calm them in an avuncular fashion. \"Mohamed, you are not the one running the court,\" Youssef told Mohamed Beltagy, another Muslim Brotherhood member, after he disrupted proceedings. \"I am the one running the court.\"</p><p>During Morsi's final outburst, Youssef repeatedly told the former president \"malesh\" (\"never mind\") before giving up and leaving the courtroom for good. An official later announced that the next session would be on 8 January, and said Morsi would be sent to prison instead of being held incommunicado in a military facility.</p><p>Morsi refused to give the power of attorney to the lawyer secured for him by colleagues outside prison – Selim al-Awa, a prominent Islamist thinker who also ran for president last year. But one of the Brotherhood's legal team later grudgingly admitted that Morsi and his colleagues would have to engage with the trial.</p><p>\"The defendants don't want to recognise it, but this is the de facto court,\" said Bahaa Abdelrahman, a lawyer acting for Essam el-Arian, a senior Brotherhood official who was arrested last week. \"And we are going to have to deal with it.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421645663|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|072cba9f016beea8990e4ce058885e16a261d8b6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Three people were in custody on Monday after reports of a person carrying a sword or a handgun led&nbsp;led to a three-hour lockdown at Central&nbsp;Connecticut&nbsp;State University on Monday.</p> <p>Police said no weapons were recovered and there was no threat to the campus, but they were investigating whether the scare may have been set off by somebody wearing a Halloween costume.</p> <p>\"We had no real threat to students or faculty,\" said Chris Cervoni, chief of the campus police.</p> <p>The university declared a campus emergency at about noon Monday, directing people to stay inside and away from windows on the 182-acre campus south of Hartford. State troopers and police from several nearby cities responded, and SWAT teams swarmed around a 400-student residential building, James Hall, where the suspect had been seen.</p> <p>Officials said that even if it was a prank, the concern was real, noting the person dressed in camouflage was the subject of several 911 calls.</p> <p>\"In this situation, our prayers were answered,\" said Jack Miller, the university's president, who noted the FBI was among the agencies that responded. \"Certainly there have been many other situations that didn't conclude in this way.\"</p> <p>Jordan Governale, a 20-year-old junior from Farmington, said he walked by a man carrying a backpack and with a sword and sheath strapped to his back Monday morning. The man was wearing a mask, camouflage pants, knee pads and a vest resembling body armor, Governale said.</p> <p>A minute later, he said, he saw police.</p> <p>\"At first I thought it was a Halloween costume. But after I saw the cops I thought it was some sort of threat,\" he said. \"It's pretty scary. It's pretty strange, unexpected.\"</p> <p>The lockdown was lifted shortly after 3 pm. University spokeswoman Janice Palmer said that the students who had been inside James Hall were moved to another building for questioning.</p> <p>Cervoni said the three people of interest were taken into custody on a fourth-floor hallway of James Hall and the primary suspect is a student at CCSU. He said police were continuing to search the building.</p> <p>Classes were canceled for the rest of the day at the school, which has more than 12,000 students.</p> <p>Morgan Podlisny, an 18-year-old freshman who lives in the adjacent Seth North residence hall, said she and her friends watched the situation unfold next door.</p> <p>\"Our whole dorm was freaking out,\" she said. \"At first, there were a lot of cops there rushing in with guns.</p> <p>Kiara Gupton, a 21-year-old junior said she could see SWAT teams and dogs.</p> <p>\"I'm really just upset about this,\" she said, recalling last year's deadly school shooting in Newtown, about 30 miles away. \"It's scary. ... To see all these SWAT teams outside is really just overwhelming.\"</p> <p>Two New Britain schools near the campus were also locked down as a precaution, according to the superintendent's office.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421661529|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|1de81ddcb8f8356c7efede9ab90a9297a4fe6497 -->",

        "headline":"Twitter claims $13.6bn market valuation as tech rivals take aim",
        "body":"<p>Twitter, after canvassing professional investors for a week on how much they would be willing to pay for its shares, raised the asking price of its stock by 25% on Monday.</p> <p>The company said it would value its IPO at between $23 and $25 a share, up from the&nbsp;$17 to $20 range, indicating that it was a popular potential investment. Traditionally, however, the banks advising companies on their public debuts start out with a modest asking price, in the hopes that investors will prove willing to pay more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter also stopped selling its shares a day early, according to a news report by Reuters. It's common for companies to keep order books open for investors until the day before the IPO, but Twitter plans to close the books on Tuesday at noon, Reuters said. In the traditional signals of Wall Street, that move could be interpreted in two ways: it could indicate either high demand for the shares or that investors are tapped out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter, which plans to list its shares for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, can now claim a market value of $13.6bn before its shares have even started trading. The company could raise as much as $1.4bn in the offering.&nbsp;</p> <p>MKM Partners, a research firm for professional investors, said Twitter will be in the competitive \"elite\" of tech companies by its market value.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"We look at a [comparison] group including Facebook, LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Yelp and Zillow,\" MKM analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a client note late last week. \"These companies are regarded as 'category killers', each with very strong operating momentum, disruptive characteristics and open-ended opportunities.\"</p> <p>That doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing ahead, however. Twitter is facing business challenges from rivals as well as skepticism from investors burned by the Facebook IPO.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter is not seen as a good investment by nearly half of active investors, according to<a href=\"http://marketingland.com/poll-public-skeptical-about-twitter-ipo-63942\"> a new CNBC-AP poll out Monday</a>.</p> <p>\"That sentiment is stronger from higher-income respondents; some 56% of those with incomes of $75,000 a year have doubts about its investment prospects,\" <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101165620\">CNBC wrote</a>.</p> <p>In addition, as Twitter's profile rises, rivals are taking aim at its business prospects. \"We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow,\" the company said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter revealed on Monday, for instance, that <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312513424297/d564001dfwp.htm\">tech giant IBM has claimed that Twitter has violated three of its patents</a>. The patents involve the presentation of advertising and the process of searching for user contacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>By striking at Twitter's advertising plans, IBM is striking at the company's heart. Twitter gained&nbsp;85% of its revenue from advertising in 2012, and an even higher percentage &ndash; 89% &ndash; in the first nine months of this year. \"We generate substantially all of our advertising revenue through the sale of our three promoted products: promoted Tweets, promoted accounts and promoted trends.\"</p> <p>Twitter said IBM was not suing, however, and only inviting a negotiation. In its public filing, Twitter said \"we believe we have meritorious defenses,\" although it also said \"there can be no assurance that we will be successful\" in resolving the dispute.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421639031|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|c172a33db1ea167c359efa7a2ca8b724a47a9afc -->",

        "body":"<p>Lawyers acting for Jeremy Hammond, the Chicago-based hacktivist facing up to 10 years in prison for releasing internal emails from the private intelligence agency Stratfor, have lodged 265 letters of support with the federal judge who will determine his sentence on 15 November.</p> <p>The letters call on judge Loretta Preska of the US district court for the southern district of New York to show leniency towards Hammond, a former member of the hacking network Anonymous who has become a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre&nbsp;for hacktivists, civil libertarians and those concerned about the rights of whistleblowers. They include 36 submissions from leading data experts and freedom of information campaigners.</p> <p>Among the correspondents are Daniel Ellsberg, source of the 1970s Pentagon Papers leak on the Vietnam war, and Jesselyn Radack, a former Justice Department whistleblower who now works at the Government Accountability Project.</p> <p>Other letters come from Hammond&rsquo;s family and friends from the Chicago area who testify to his community work. One correspondent recounts how he was offered shelter by Hammond when he was homeless on the streets of Chicago.</p> <p>Hammond, 28, has pleaded guilty to one count under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) relating to a 2011 cyber attack on Strategic Forecasting, Inc, known as Stratfor &ndash; an information analysis company based in Austin, Texas. Working alongside a fellow hacker operating under the internet handle Sabu &ndash; who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/06/lulzsec-sabu-working-for-us-fbi\">later revealed to be an FBI informant</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Hammond downloaded an email spool from Stratfor containing millions of files and sent the data to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks which released them as the <a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/the-gifiles.html\">&ldquo;Global Intelligence Files&rdquo;</a>.</p> <p>In a memorandum to the court, Hammond&rsquo;s lawyers describe the hack as an &ldquo;act of civil disobedience&rdquo; emanating from his concern about the mushrooming of the private security industry that now accounts for 70% of all government spending on intelligence. The memo points out that he did not benefit personally from the action and that the government has confirmed there is no evidence of any financial motivation.</p> <p>The Guardian has spoken to several experts and individuals close to Jeremy Hammond who believe that he acted in good faith as a whistleblower and that a maximum 10-year sentence would be a travesty of justice. Here we post their views on a landmark case whose outcome could have grave ramifications for hacktivists and whistleblowers across the US:</p> <p>Roy Singham, chairman of ThoughtWorks, a global IT consultancy where open-data crusader Aaron Swartz was employed at the time he committed suicide while facing prosecution under the CFAA:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Innovation happens when people are experimenting at the edges of their social, intellectual and technological abilities. When you charge Aaron Swartz or Jeremy Hammond with computer crimes you are scaring away some of the smartest young people from thinking about issues that actually matter, and that has a massive chilling effect.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m disappointed about the silence of the tech industry over this case. You don&rsquo;t hear the tech giants coming out and condemning what happened to Aaron or what is now happening to Jeremy, which I consider an abuse of state power.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jason Hammond, Jeremy&rsquo;s twin brother:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My brother didn&rsquo;t do computer hacking for its own sake, or for personal gain - he did it because of his entire world view. He is an anarchist, an anti-war activist, an egalitarian. He wants to see the world free of over-reaching powers of government and corporations.</p> <p>If there were not people like Jeremy, Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning exposing betrayals of people's trust, then we would not know today the extent to which private individuals&rsquo; information is gathered, analyzed, and sold to private corporations and governments. We would not now be having the debate across the country about whether the NSA and private intelligence companies are going too far.</p> <p>That&rsquo;s the discussion that Jeremy wanted to encourage. The information that has been posted on WikiLeaks has been an eye opener for many, who are realizing they cannot trust the government to protect their privacy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Peter Ludlow, professor of philosophy at Northwestern University in Illinois:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy Hammond represents something new: he was a political activist first - an old-school Chicago boots on the ground activist who happened to be a gifted computer programmer. He has introduced a lot of hackers to a level of political maturity that they didn&rsquo;t previously have.</p> <p>He was not interested in personal gain, and the Stratfor site had already been hacked before he entered it. His goal was to expose the scope and nature of the private intelligence industry - and along the way he exposed an organized and well-funded system of deception targetting American citizens and others worldwide.</p> </blockquote> <p>Raven Rakia, a film-maker based in Bhopal, India. The Stratfor emails revealed that the agency had been contracted by Dow Chemical, parent company of Union Carbide which owned the Bhopal pesticide plant where the world&rsquo;s worst industrial catastrophe took place in 1984, to follow the activities of campaigners seeking redress for the victims:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy Hammond doesn't deserve 10 years in prison. In my eyes, Jeremy doesn't deserve to be in prison right now. Corporations spying on people warrant the same outrage as when governments spy on people. The activists of the Bhopal disaster had every right to know that Dow Chemical was spying on them and their efforts.</p> <p>The survivors of the Bhopal disaster are faced with serious health problems and their children and grandchildren have health issues and birth defects. These activists &ndash; who are asking for compensation for healthcare/research and for Dow Chemical to stop using dangerous, lethal chemicals in their city &ndash; are literally fighting for their lives. They deserve to know the truth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno of the &ldquo;Yes Men&rdquo;, the satirical duo who impersonate powerful people to make political points. They learned from the Stratfor emails that Dow Chemicals asked the intelligence firm to look into their activities in the wake of one of their pranks in which they had posed in a BBC interview as a Dow spokesman and offered $12bn in compensation to Bhopal victims:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy may have broken the law, but companies like Dow that are employing third parties to follow the activities of victims&rsquo; groups are breaking every code of human decency. Jeremy performed an ethical service &ndash; he revealed a network of lies and secrecy that we think the public should know about.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s a pretty deplorable state of affairs when they put people like him in jail - it would be obscene to sentence him to 10 years. His actions didn&rsquo;t hurt anybody, and we learnt an important truth about who was spying on whom. That seems to us to have been a net gain.</p> </blockquote> <p>Regan Maher, friend of Jeremy Hammond:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Jeremy and I were neighbors in the Pilsen area of Chicago. As we grew closer, I worked alongside him organizing a number of activist community projects that brought food, books, and other critical resources to people in need.</p> <p>We first worked together as volunteers to cook food for the homeless. Later we collaborated for several years on a project to send free books to prison inmates. He attended this service group consistently, week after week &ndash; he was the one person I knew I could always depend on.</p> <p>I believe that Jeremy deserves compassion because I have never seen him act out of any motivation besides the kindness of his heart. He is not a person with an ego, or something to prove. I know without a doubt that he acted out of a sense of justice. Jeremy gained absolutely nothing from what he has done, though he took a great risk to get there. He is a person who cares for the world with a great compassion and I truly believe that he will recognize the wrong that he has done, and move on to live up to his potential.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stefania Maurizi, investigative journalist for the Italian magazine, L&rsquo;Espresso:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I teamed up with news outlets around the world to reasearch and publish&nbsp;stories based on the Stratfor files database, and wrote <a href=\"http://espresso.repubblica.it/attualita/cronaca/2012/02/27/news/wikileaks-la-nuova-ondata-1.41108\">several articles</a> on the back of it including how Stratfor analysts view Italian politicians like the <a href=\"http://espresso.repubblica.it/internazionale/2012/03/02/news/l-italia-una-dependance-di-putin-1.41019%20\">former PM Mario Monti or controversial leader Silvio Berlusconi</a>. The material was in the public interest, throwing up newsworthy stories such as an alleged indictment against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. It is also important because it provides a unique insight into the methods, sources and values of a private intelligence company and its close links to government agencies.</p> <p>As a journalist who worked on Stratfor files, I feel I have duty of care to Jeremy Hammond. He released information in the public interest, he did not sell it. For him to face 10 years in jail, while CIA agents involved in rendition and torture, are free as the air &ndash; I do not call this justice.</p> </blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421640528|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|02878de680b601510bf46306f6d43cf44cff1b47 -->",

        "body":"<p>Women's healthcare providers in Texas took their battle over the legal right to abortion to the supreme court on Monday, filing an emergency request to strike down newly enacted restrictions they say will cause \" irreparable harm\" to those seeking abortions in the state.</p> <p>Scores of women seeking abortions in Texas have already been turned away and at least 14 clinics and surgery centres have been forced to shut down in the last few days as a result of an extreme state law, HB2, which came into effect late Thursday night, clinic staff said.</p> <p>A week ago, a US district judge put a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/texas-abortion-law-blocked-federal-judge\">temporary stop</a> on a requirement of the new law, that physicians who provide abortions have admitting privileges in local hospitals. The judge said it placed an undue burden on a woman seeking abortion and was therefore unconstitutional.&nbsp;</p> <p>But, in a surprise decision last Thursday, a federal appeals court allowed most of the provisions of the new law to go ahead, while a legal challenge over the restrictions moved through the courts.</p> <p>Louise Melling, the&nbsp;deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union said:&nbsp;&ldquo;Last week&rsquo;s court decision allowing this extreme measure to take effect has already begun to hit the state of Texas like a tsunami, taking away vital health services from women. ... The women of Texas are counting on the supreme court&nbsp;to ensure they have access to the care they need.&rdquo;</p> <p>The admitting privilege provision in HB2 was part of a sweeping anti-abortion law, passed in July by the Republican-led Texas legislature that attracted national attention after state senator Wendy Davis held an 11-hour filibuster to block it in June. Although she was successful, the law was passed in a special session in the state.</p> <p>A panel of judges at the fifth circuit court of appeals in New Orleans ruled last Thursday that Texas can enforce the law while a lawsuit challenging the restrictions moves forward. Attorneys for the state argued that Texas has the right to put in place laws that discourage abortion and said opponents had not proven in court that the law could cut off access to abortions.</p> <p>The reproductive health groups, who are asking the US supreme court to reinstate the district court's injunction granted a week ago, cite evidence presented earlier to that court, showing the requirement for admitting privileges would prevent 20,000 Texas women who would otherwise have had an abortion from accessing one. The application said that other women will face delays in obtaining abortions, and will therefore face an increased risk of complications.</p> <p>The US supreme court&nbsp;on Monday dismissed another abortion case involving Oklahoma. The dismissal left intact an Oklahoma court ruling that invalidated a state law cracking down on the use of the abortion-inducing drug RU-486.</p> <p>At a press call organised on Monday by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights &ndash; who jointly filed a lawsuit against the law last month on behalf of more than a dozen women's health providers and their patients &ndash; staff said the law had already \"wreaked substantial harm\" on their patients.</p> <p>Ken Lambrecht, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood in Greater Texas, said they had to turn away 100 patients in two clinics over the last few days.</p> <p>Lambrecht said: \"Patients are scared, some are angry\". He said that, currently, one in three women in Texas is not able to access abortion services. He warned: \"Women will seek care whether its safe and accessible or not. We're fighting the fight to provide safe and accessible care in our centres.\"</p> <p>Marni Evans, one of the women turned away from a clinic in Texas after the latest legal twist in the case, spoke of the \"soul searching\" involved in her and her fianc&eacute;, John, coming to a decision to have the procedure and how traumatic it was to have that decision taken away, when her appointment was cancelled.</p> <p>Evans, 37, an independent consultant from Austin, Texas, told reporters during a conference call that, she is now considering flying to Seattle, where she used to live to have an abortion.</p> <p>\"The decision for me or for any women to have an abortion is not easy, it is complicated,\" she said. \"We can barely afford our own healthcare let alone have a child.\"</p> <p>\"I can't help but wonder what other less fortunate women will do,\" she said.</p> <p>Another health provider, Whole Woman's health, said that it had been forced to turn away 45 patients in one day alone.</p> <p>In striking down HB2 last week, Judge Lee Yeakel said: &ldquo;The&nbsp;admitting privileges provision of House Bill 2 lacks a rational basis and places an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion.&rdquo;</p> <p>On Monday, Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the CRR, described the provision as a \"bogus law that attempts to&nbsp;do underhandedly what states cannot do directly &ndash; block women from accessing abortion service.\"</p> <p>The groups said that many clinics would be forced to shut down permanently, even if the lawsuit is decided in their favour, because many are small and would go out of business before the legal process is complete.</p> <p>The provision requiring admitting privileges for physicians at abortion facilities was part of a sweeping anti-abortion law, that also requires abortion clinics to meet heightened building standards, bans abortion after 20 weeks and requires strict adherence to federal guidelines in prescribing medicated abortion.</p> <p>In the application, addressed to Judge Antonin Scalia, to vacate the decision by the appeals court on Thursday, the Fifth Circuit's finding was described as an \"outlier\" because most of the courts who had looked at admitting privileges had found it to be unconstitutional.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421654646|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|f517aeb450fe22262e464795a33991ddfa0f350b -->",

        "body":"<p>Scientists are struggling to find the trigger for a disease that appears to be ravaging starfish in record numbers along the US west coast, causing the sea creatures to lose their limbs and turn to slime in a matter of days.</p><p>Marine biologists and ecologists will launch an extensive survey this week along the coasts of California, Washington state and Oregon to determine the reach and source of the deadly syndrome, known as \"star wasting disease\".</p><p>\"It's pretty spooky because we don't have any obvious culprit for the root cause even though we know it's likely caused by a pathogen,\" said Pete Raimondi, the chairman of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California.</p><p>Signs of the syndrome typically begin with white lesions on the arms of the starfish that spread inward, causing the entire animal to disintegrate in less than a week, according to a report by the Pacific Rocky Intertidal Monitoring Program at the University of California.</p><p>Starfish have suffered from the syndrome on and off for decades but have usually been reported in small numbers, isolated to southern California and linked to a rise in seawater temperatures, which is not the case this time, Raimondi said.</p><p>Since June, wasting starfish have been found in dozens of coastal sites ranging from south-east Alaska to Orange County, California, and the mortality rates have been higher than ever seen before, Raimondi said. In one surveyed tide pool in Santa Cruz during the current outbreak, 90-95% of hundreds of starfish were killed by the disease.</p><p>\"Their tissue just melts away,\" said Melissa Miner, a biologist and researcher with the Multi-Agency Rocky Intertidal Network, a group of government agencies, universities and non-profit groups that monitor tidal wildlife and environment along the west coast.</p><p>Miner, based in Washington state, has studied wasting starfish locally and in Alaska since June, when only a few cases had been reported. \"It has ballooned into a much bigger issue since then,\" she said.</p><p>The syndrome primarily affects the mussel-eating Pisaster ochraceus, a large purple and orange starfish, but Raimondi said that at least 10 species have shown signs of the disease since June.</p><p>If the numbers of Pisaster ochraceus begin to decrease, mussels could crowd the ocean, disrupting biodiversity, he said.</p><p>In addition to on-site sampling, scientists in the coming months will use an interactive map to spot starfish wasting location patterns and help identify a driver for the disease.</p><p>Raimondi said he could not estimate, out of the millions of starfish on the west Coast, how many have been affected or could be in the future.</p><p>\"We're way at the onset now, so we just don't know how bad it's going to get,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421677955|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|d6c633f5f22667924144282df42ef8feafe25ec8 -->",

        "headline":"Two billion planets in our galaxy may be suitable for life",
        "body":"<p>Our galaxy probably contains at least two billion planets that, like Earth, have liquid water on their surfaces and orbit around their parent stars in the \"habitable zone\" for life. The nearest, according to astronomers, could be a mere 12 light years away.</p><p>A new study, <a href=\" http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319909110\" title=\"\">published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, suggests that Earth-like planets capable of supporting life are far more common than previously thought. Using measurements from Nasa's Kepler space observatory, scientists led by Erik Petigura the University of California, Berkely, estimated that 22% of our galaxy's sun-like stars had rocky planets circling them that were within the zone that meant they got roughly the same amount of light energy as Earth gets from the sun. There are around 100bn stars in our galaxy, of which 10% are like the sun.</p><p>So far Kepler has studied more than 150,000 stars and identified more than 3,000 candidate planets, but many of these are \"gas giants\", similar to Jupiter, that orbit close to their parent stars. If there is life out there, it is far more likely to have evolved on rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces, similar to Earth.</p><p>To get their results, Petigura's team looked for planets in Kepler data that had a radius up to double that of Earth. They searched for planets that orbited far enough from their star that liquid water would not evaporate, but not so far that the water would all freeze.</p><p>Subhanjoy Mohanty, an astrophysicist at Imperial College London who was not involved with the study, said: \"This is the first estimate of the frequency of Earth-like planets around sun-like stars, in orbits large enough to lie in the habitable zone of their stars. The finding that roughly one in five sun-like stars may host such planets is an incredibly important one, probably exceeding the expectations of most cautious astronomers.\"</p><p>He added that the latest analysis increased the chances that there might be life somewhere among the stars. \"Previous analyses of Kepler data had shown that red dwarfs – the most common type of star in the galaxy, making up about 80% of the stellar population – very frequently harbour Earth-size planets, including in their habitable zones. This new study shows that the same is true as well around stars more like our own sun.  This is certainly an added impetus for planned future missions which will study the atmospheres of these potentially habitable planets, enabling us to investigate whether they are in fact habitable or not, and also whether their atmospheres show actual biosignatures of existing life.\"</p><p>Nasa also announced on Monday that the Kepler probe would be given a new lease of life, following fears that it would have to end its mission after only four years in space. In May 2013, scientists discovered that one of the gyroscopic wheels – known as \"reaction wheels\" – that kept the probe pointing in the right direction had stopped working and, try as they might, Nasa engineers could not get it working again. Unable to point itself at the stars with any accuracy, the probe could no longer be used to collect data about the position of new exoplanets.</p><p>But it looks as though there could be a solution that reorients the probe to look along the plane of the galaxy, which will allow it to remain stable with only two of its reaction wheels working. \"The old saying 'necessity is the mother of invention' has rung true here, with engineers and scientists from Nasa and the spacecraft manufacturers having figured out this way to, we hope, recover much of the performance we thought we had lost. We are very excited,\" said Bill Chaplin, an astrophysicist at the University of Birmingham in the UK.</p><p>If all goes well, the new Kepler mission – dubbed \"K2\" – will look for planets around smaller stars than the sun, and will also study the stars themselves. \"There are a wealth of fantastically interesting targets for astrophysics that can be observed in the ecliptic plane, which were not accessible in the original Kepler field, notably brighter clusters of stars – where the common origins and distances to these stars make the clusters excellent laboratories for testing our understanding of stars – and young, star-forming regions,\" said Chaplin.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647297|2013-11-05T11:23:19Z|cedade85a6f33115bc588d38bdae235cc4c60305 -->",
