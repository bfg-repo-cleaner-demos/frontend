He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Though the White House declined to confirm whether it ordered Western European allies to block the diplomatic flight containing Bolivia's president, the affair casts further doubt on promises made by Barack Obama that the US would &quot;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/27/obama-edward-snowden_n_3509070.html\">not scramble jets</a>&quot; to retrieve the whistleblower who has brought so much embarrassment upon his administration.</p> <p>When the issue first threatened to overshadow delicate relations with major powers such as China and Russia, the US president went out of his way to stress that he would not expend political capital on &quot;wheeling and dealing&quot; just to bring a 29-year-old hacker to justice. Whether he was setting expectations low for the likelihood of Snowden's capture, or genuinely trying to put the issue in proportion remains unclear, but events since have shown the White House is willing to act far tougher with smaller nations who might contemplate rebellion.</p> <p>First, Washington successfully leant on Ecuador to reverse it's support for Snowden's asylum claim. Congressional leaders threatened to revoke valuable trade agreements and then vice president Joe Biden followed up with a more diplomatic phone call that led to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/02/ecuador-rafael-correa-snowden-mistake\">marked change in tone from Ecuador's president</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday afternoon, the State Department rejected&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/02/edward-snowden-barack-obama-wikileaks\">allegations by Snowden that it was bullying nations </a>into withdrawing support. Yet the apparent decision by French, Portuguese and possibly Italian authorities to revoke diplomatic overfly rights simply on the suspicion he might be on board the Bolivian flight suggests that Washington's diplomatic arm-twisting does not need to be overt to be effective.</p> <p>Of course, all the drama also has the added benefit of distracting attention from the impact of Snowden's revelations. Obama's top intelligence official, James Clapper, has just&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/02/james-clapper-senate-erroneous\">admitted lying to Congress</a>&nbsp;over whether the US spies on its own people, but you wouldn't know it from watching US TV right now.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51d385f2e4b01fd5ba7fbcca\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-03T03:01:23.332+01:00\">3.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c9db6294-3b6c-4844-a3cc-1b21e8bda9a9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/3/1372807660818/7a99bb38-78d7-4075-875c-cfe0a159ed36-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bolivian Minister of Foreing Affairs, David Choquehuanca, speaks during a press conference in La Paz, Bolivia. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Bolivian Minister of Foreing Affairs, David Choquehuanca, speaks during a press conference in La Paz, Bolivia, Photograph: MARTIN ALIPAZ/EPA</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51d37f7ee4b0e80ab6523a8c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-03T02:33:50.647+01:00\">2.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>AP is reporting that Morales is now spending the night at a Vienna hotel.

        "trailText":"<p><strong>Jürgen Trittin:</strong> The man who revealed that our US and UK allies are spying on us ought to be given shelter in an EU country</p>",
        "headline":"Edward Snowden deserves shelter in Germany",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> has done us all a great service. In the past two weeks Europeans have been made aware of massive data collection from their private and business communications by American and British security services. The extent of this surveillance has been staggering. We have also learned that the US is apparently spying on EU representations in Brussels, Washington and New York, and the embassies of European member states. These practices have nothing to do with the war on terror.</p><p>We can only speculate about the real&nbsp;motivation. What type of information is being extracted, and what&nbsp;is being done with it? The European Commission is supposed to start negotiations with the US on a transatlantic free trade agreement. Should our delegations choose to meet at secret locations in future and prepare meetings using encrypted code, because otherwise the US <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nsa\" title=\"\">National Security Agency</a> will know their every move in advance? On top of that, German and other European businesses' secrets cannot be secure any more. For years the US has been accusing China of stealing intellectual property. Do we need to redirect our attention over industrial espionage?</p><p>If even a few of these revelations are&nbsp;true, our worst Orwellian nightmares have become reality. Already trust between the EU and the&nbsp;US, and between the EU and its member state Britain has been violated. Both governments need to react to these&nbsp;accusations, clarify the activities of their secret services and, if true, stop these programmes immediately. Surveillance without suspicion to this&nbsp;extent constitutes a violation of the&nbsp;right to privacy laid down, for instance, in the international covenant on civil and political rights.</p><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\" title=\"\">UK the Tempora programme</a>, which taps into fibre-optic cables, violates the EU data protection directives, which are binding law in Britain – notwithstanding the reservations and protocols concerning the opt-out of the UK in the Lisbon treaty. The directives clearly state that every infringement for the good of national security has to be \"a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society\". The EU commission should consider treaty violation proceedings.</p><p>As the guardian of the treaties, the&nbsp;commission must act when it comes&nbsp;to&nbsp;such grave attacks on our shared values. Under the circumstances, negotiations on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership cannot and should not begin. First, the&nbsp;US needs to clarify whether it considers the EU a trade partner, or a hostile opponent in international trade wars that has to be spied on.</p><p>Above all, the messenger for all this should not be blamed. Snowden blew the whistle on activities that threaten the very freedom our democracies are built on. If ever a case demonstrated why we need the protection of whistleblowers, this is it. Snowden should not have to rely on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cynical human rights violator such as Vladimir Putin. He should be given shelter in an EU country. Germany, as one of the countries targeted most by the NSA's programmes, should be among the first to offer him refuge.</p><p>Despite the fact that Angela Merkel today denied him asylum, in German law, section 22 of the residence act allows the federal government to grant a residence permit on urgent humanitarian grounds. The government can do so in order to uphold the political interests of the country. According to the law, a request for extradition – which the US might then seek – can be denied because of the political character of the criminal offence the person in question is accused of. Our laws enable us to do so, and Chancellor Merkel should act accordingly.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412026065|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|7b318c9a475919bbc598cfdc67080f92bd9b78d3 -->",

        "headline":"America's whistleblower persecution sullies the US constitution",
        "body":"<p>On 12 October 2012, the European Union won the Nobel Peace Prize for contributing to the \"advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe\". The EU should show itself worthy of this honor and show its will to defend freedom of information, regardless of fears of political pressure from its so-called closest ally, the United States.</p><p>Now that Edward Snowden, the young American who revealed the global monitoring system known as Prism, has requested asylum from 20 countries, the EU nations should extend a welcome, under whatever law or status seems most appropriate.</p><p>Although the United States remains a world leader in upholding the ideal of freedom of expression, the American attitude toward whistleblowers sullies the first amendment of the US constitution.</p><p>In 2004, the UN special rapporteur for freedom of expression, as well as his counterparts in the Organization of American States and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe issued a joint call to all governments to protect whistleblowers from all \"legal, administrative or employment-related sanctions if they act in 'good faith'\". Whistleblowers were defined as \"individuals releasing confidential or secret information although they are under an official or other obligation to maintain confidentiality or secrecy\".</p><p>More recently, the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe resolved in 2010 that \"the definition of protected disclosures shall include all bona fide warnings against various types of unlawful acts\". The assembly's resolution 1729 concluded that member countries' laws \"should therefore cover both public and private sector whistle-blowers, including members of the armed forces and special services\".</p><p>Some are calling for a manhunt for Snowden on the grounds that he is a traitor, and others are trying to cloak the issues he raised in legalistic complexities. But what serious person can deny that Edward Snowden is a whistleblower?</p><p>The digital communications specialist's revelations have enabled the international press, including the <a href=\"www.washingtonpost.com/\">Washington Post</a>, <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/‎\">the Guardian</a> and <a href=\"www.spiegel.de/international/‎\">Der Spiegel</a>, to shine a light on a surveillance system that tracks tens of millions of citizens, Europeans among them.</p><p>Targeted by an apparatus that threatens their sovereignty as well as their principles, the EU countries owe Snowden a debt of gratitude for his revelations, which were clearly in the public interest.</p><p>This young man will remain abandoned in the transit zone of the Moscow airport only if the European countries abandon their principles, as well as a major part of the raison d'etre of the EU. Expressions of diplomatic outrage will be empty gestures if the person responsible for the revelations is left isolated and abandoned.</p><p>Beyond the necessity of providing a legal shield for whistleblowers, the protection of privacy is a matter of clear public interest, especially in the realm of freedom of information. Frank La Rue, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, noted in a report last June that \"arbitrary and unlawful infringements of the right to privacy … threaten the protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression\".</p><p>The confidentiality of written and oral exchanges is essential to ensuring the exercise of freedom of information. But when journalists' sources are compromised, as happened in the case of the <a href=\"www.ap.org/\">Associated Press</a>; when the United States abuses the Espionage Act, a 1917 law that has been invoked a total of nine times against whistleblowers, six of these cases under the Obama administration; when the government tries to silence WikiLeaks by imposing a financial embargo on the organization and by subjecting associates and friends of Julian Assange to abusive searches when they enter the United States, when the site's founder and his colleagues are threatened with US prosecution, more than American democracy is threatened.</p><p>Indeed, the very model of democracy that the heirs of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin are responsible for upholding has been robbed of its essence.</p><p>By what right is the United States exempt from principles that it demands be applied elsewhere?</p><p>In January 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a historic speech in which she defined freedom of expression as a cornerstone of American diplomacy. She reiterated that position in February 2011 in another speech in which she said that \"on the spectrum of internet freedom, we place ourselves on the side of openness.\"</p><p>Eloquent words. They may have brought encouragement to dissidents in Tehran, Beijing, Havana, Asmara, Ashgabat, Moscow and so many other capitals. But how disappointing to find that the skyscrapers of American surveillance have reached a size to match China's technological Great Wall.</p><p>The White House and State Department message of democracy and defence of human rights has lost considerable credibility. One sign of widespread concern – Amazon has reported a 6,000% increase in sales of the George Orwell classic, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/1984-Signet-Classics-George-Orwell/dp/0451524934\">1984</a>.</p><p>Now, with Big Brother watching us from a Washington suburb, the key institutions of American democracy must play their assigned roles of counterweight to the executive branch and its abuses. The system of checks and balances is more than a slogan for avid readers of Tocqueville and Montesquieu.</p><p>American leaders should realize the glaring contradiction between their soaring odes to freedom and the realities of official actions, which damage the image of their country.</p><p>Members of Congress must be capable of holding back the tide of security provisions of the Patriot Act by recognizing the legitimate rights of men and women who sound the alarm. The <a href=\"http://www.whistleblowers.gov/\">Whistleblower Protection Act</a> must be amended to ensure effective protection for whistleblowers who act in the public interest – an interest completely separate from immediate national concerns as intelligence services interpret them.</p><p>• This article was first published in Le Monde and is crossposted by kind permission of <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/why-european-nations-must-protect-03-07-2013,44886.html\">Reporters Without Borders</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412101959|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|307ecdb7219f0612fbde66a8a9a144bdcf36b6e7 -->",

To a chorus of baying indignation from Whitehall to Washington, Brussels to Madrid, heroic special forces would be dispatched to rescue their leader and, as sport, smash up the source of such flagrant international gangsterism. Editorials would cheer them on, perhaps reminding readers that this kind of piracy was exhibited by the German Reich in the 1930s.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/03/edward-snowden-bolivia-plane-vienna\" title=\"\">forcing down of Bolivian President Evo Morales's plane</a> – denied airspace by France, Spain and Portugal, followed by his 14-hour confinement while Austrian officials demanded to \"inspect\" his aircraft for the \"fugitive\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> – was an act of air piracy and state terrorism. It was a metaphor for the gangsterism that now rules the world and the cowardice and hypocrisy of bystanders who dare not speak its name.</p><p>In Moscow, Morales had been asked about Snowden – who remains trapped in the city's airport. \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/02/edward-snowden-bolivia-lifeline-asylum\" title=\"\">If there were a request [for political asylum],</a>\" he said, \"of course, we would be willing to debate and consider the idea.\" That was clearly enough provocation for the Godfather. \"We have been in touch with a range of countries that had a chance of having Snowden land or travel through their country,\" said a US state department official.</p><p>The French – having squealed about Washington spying on their every move, as revealed by Snowden – were first off the mark, followed by the Portuguese. The Spanish then did their bit by enforcing a flight ban of their airspace, giving the Godfather's Viennese hirelings enough time to find out if Snowden was indeed invoking <a href=\"http://www.ichrp.org/en/article_14_udhr\" title=\"\">article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, which states: \"Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.\"</p><p>Those paid to keep the record straight have played their part with a cat-and-mouse media game that reinforces the Godfather's lie that this heroic young man is running from a system of justice, rather than preordained, vindictive incarceration that amounts to torture – ask <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bradley-manning\" title=\"\">Bradley Manning</a> and the living ghosts in Guantánamo.</p><p>Historians seem to agree that the rise of fascism in Europe might have been averted had the liberal or left political class understood the true nature of its enemy. The parallels today are very different, but the Damocles sword over Snowden, like the casual abduction of Bolivia's president, ought to stir us into recognising the true nature of the enemy.</p><p>Snowden's revelations are not merely about privacy, or civil liberty, or even mass spying. They are about the unmentionable: that the democratic facades of the US now barely conceal a systematic gangsterism historically identified with, if not necessarily the same as, fascism. On Tuesday, a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/03/killed-pakistan-cia-drone-strike\" title=\"\">US drone killed 16 people in North Waziristan</a>, \"where many of the world's most dangerous militants live\", said the few paragraphs I read. That by far the world's most dangerous militants had hurled the drones was not a consideration. President Obama personally sends them every Tuesday.</p><p>In his acceptance of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2005/dec/08/theatre.nobelprize\" title=\"\">2005 Nobel prize in literature, Harold Pinter</a> referred to \"a vast tapestry of lies, upon which we feed\". He asked why \"the systematic brutality, the widespread atrocities\" of the Soviet Union were well known in the west while America's crimes were \"superficially recorded, let alone documented, let alone acknowledged\". The most enduring silence of the modern era covered the extinction and dispossession of countless human beings by a rampant US and its agents. \"But you wouldn't know it,\" said Pinter. \"It never happened. Even while it was happening it never happened.\"</p><p>This hidden history – not really hidden, of course, but excluded from the consciousness of societies drilled in American myths and priorities – has never been more vulnerable to exposure. Snowden's whistleblowing, like that of Manning and Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, threatens to break the silence Pinter described. In revealing a vast Orwellian police state apparatus servicing history's greatest war-making machine, they illuminate the true extremism of the 21st century. Unprecedented, Germany's Der Spiegel has described the Obama administration as \"soft totalitarianism\".

        "body":"<p>According to US legislators and journalists, the surveillance whistleblower Edward Snowden actively aided America's enemies. They are just missing one essential element for the meme to take flight: evidence.</p><p>An op-ed by Representative Mike Pompeo (Republican, Kansas) proclaiming Snowden, who provided disclosed widespread surveillance on phone records and internet communications by the National Security Agency, &quot;not a whistleblower&quot; is indicative of the emerging narrative. Writing in the Wichita Eagle on 30 June Pompeo, a member of the House intelligence committee, wrote that Snowden &quot;<a href=\"http://www.kansas.com/2013/06/30/2867981/rep-mike-pompeo-need-nsa-programs.html#storylink=cpy\">has provided intelligence to America's adversaries</a>&quot;. </p><p>Pompeo correctly notes in his op-ed that &quot;facts are important&quot;. Yet when asked for the evidence justifying the claim that Snowden gave intelligence to American adversaries, his spokesman, JP Freire, cited Snowden's leak of NSA documents. Those documents, however, were provided to the Guardian and the Washington Post, not al-Qaeda or North Korea.</p><p>It's true that information published in the press can be read by anyone, including people who mean America harm. But to conflate that with actively handing information to foreign adversaries is to foreclose on the crucial distinction between a whistleblower and a spy, and makes journalists the handmaidens of enemies of the state. </p><p>Yet powerful legislators are eager to make that conflation about Snowden. </p><p>The Twitter account of Representative Mike Rogers (Republican, Michigan), the chairman of the House intelligence committee, on 18 June placed Snowden and accused WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning in the same company as Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen, two infamous CIA and FBI double-agents. (The tweet appears to have been deleted.) </p><p>When I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/attackerman/status/347069637856460800\">asked about the conflation</a>, Rogers' Twitter account responded: &quot;All 4 gave critical national security information to our enemies. Each did it in different ways but the result was the same.&quot;</p><p>Never to be outdone, Peter King, a New York Republican and former chair of the House homeland security committee, proclaimed Snowden a &quot;<a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/10/king-defector-snowden-is-a-danger-to-national-security/\">defector</a>&quot; on 10 June. Days later, Snowden left Hong Kong to seek asylum in an undetermined country – a curious move for a defector to make. </p><p>Once elected and appointed leaders casually conflate leaking and espionage, it is a matter of time before journalists take the cue. For insight into the &quot;fear and isolation that NSA leaker Edward Snowden is living through&quot;, CNN turned to Christopher Boyce – who <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/14/world/asia/hong-kong-boyce-snowden\">sold US secrets to the USSR</a> before becoming a bank robber. </p><p>There are understandable suspicions that Snowden may have aided foreign intelligence services in order to aid in his escape from American criminal justice. While some have speculated that the Russian or Chinese intelligence services might have snuck a look at the highly sensitive intelligence material Snowden is carrying, that material is heavily encrypted. For what it's worth, in a Guardian webchat I asked Snowden directly if he would trade access to his documents for asylum. He <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/17/edward-snowden-nsa-files-whistleblower#block-51bf336ee4b06cdba47d4023\">said he would not</a>. </p><p>Perhaps Snowden lied. Perhaps he might change his mind. But all of that is far off in the realm of speculation. As things stand now, there is no evidence Snowden has aided any US adversary or intelligence service, wittingly or not. </p><p>Even the Obama administration has stopped short of terming Snowden a spy, even in the course of attacking his character. (Yes, he was indicted under the Espionage Act, but the <a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/us-vs-edward-j-snowden-criminal-complaint/496/\">actual charges against him</a> are theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information, and willful communication of classified intelligence information to an unauthorized person.) In an email meant to discredit Snowden in the press, an anonymous &quot;senior administration official&quot; told reporters on 24 June that Snowden's ostensible idealism &quot;is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen: China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela and Ecuador&quot;. That's something to remember the next time Washington wants to talk about its commitment to human rights while cooperating with, say, China and Russia.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-412273373\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/2/1372723266529/Edward-Snowden-010.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Snowden\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Edward Snowden. Photograph: Reuters/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>When asked directly if there was any evidence that Snowden had cooperated with any intelligence service or American adversary, the administration and Congress declined to provide any. The office of the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, declined to comment for this story. The Justice Department and the House intelligence committee didn't even respond to inquiries. </p><p>By all means, consider Snowden a hero, a traitor or a complex individual with a mixture of motives and interests. Lots of opinions about Snowden are valid. He is a necessarily polarizing figure. The information he revealed speaks to some of the most basic questions about the boundaries between the citizen and the state, as well as persistent and real anxieties about terrorism. </p><p>What isn't valid is the blithe assertion, absent evidence, that the former NSA contractor actively collaborated with America's enemies. Snowden made classified information about widespread surveillance available to the American public. That's a curious definition of an enemy for US legislators to adopt.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412214700|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|0a238564d265e8faad7e84082fc3c049a66d771e -->",

        "body":"<p>Two US senators on the panel overseeing the National Security Agency said intelligence officials were \"unable\" to demonstrate the value of a secret surveillance program that collected and analyzed the internet habits of Americans.</p><p>Senators Ron Wyden (Democrat, Oregon) and Mark Udall (Democrat, Colorado), the chief inquisitors of US intelligence officials during the current surveillance scandal, added a sharp warning late Tuesday that senior intelligence officials \"are not always accurate\" in their public statements about the scope and utility of their wide-ranging surveillance efforts. </p><p>Wyden and Udall were specifically reacting to a program, revealed last week by the Guardian, that gathered and analyzed<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/27/nsa-data-mining-authorised-obama\"> bulk internet \"metadata\" records from Americans</a>, such as the subject lines of their email communications and their internet protocol (IP) addresses, detailing where their devices accessed the internet. Senior intelligence officials told the Guardian that the program ended in 2011. </p><p>\"We were very concerned about this program's impact on Americans' civil liberties and privacy rights, and we spent a significant portion of 2011 pressing intelligence officials to provide evidence of its effectiveness,\" Wyden and Udall said in a statement late Tuesday, the first senators to acknowledge the internet metadata collection. \"They were unable to do so, and the program was shut down that year.\"</p><p>Shawn Turner, the chief spokesman for director of national intelligence James Clapper, who is currently<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/02/james-clapper-senate-erroneous\"> under congressional fire over the truthfulness of his testimony </a>on the surveillance efforts, told the Guardian last week that the Obama administration unilaterally ended the program for \"operational and resource reasons\". </p><p>Wyden and Udall held out the bulk internet metadata program as a cautionary tale about intelligence agencies misrepresenting their surveillance programs – a significant escalation of pressure on US intelligence leaders coming after Clapper disclosed on Tuesday a letter apologizing for \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/02/james-clapper-senate-erroneous\">clearly erroneous</a>\" statements made to Wyden. </p><p>\"In our judgment it is also important to note that intelligence agencies made statements to both Congress and the [Fisa] Court that significantly exaggerated this program's effectiveness,\" Wyden and Udall said. They did not elaborate.</p><p>\"This experience demonstrates to us that intelligence agencies' assessments of the usefulness of particular collection programs – even significant ones – are not always accurate. This experience has also led us to be skeptical of claims about the value of the bulk phone records collection program in particular.\"</p><p>In 2011, Wyden and Udall began warning their colleagues and reporters that the breadth of US surveillance efforts authorized under the Patriot Act and a 2008 expansion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) had transgressed the bounds established by the plain text of the laws authorizing them. They were prevented from detailing what they meant by laws preventing the public discussion of classified information. </p><p>Since the surveillance revelations disclosed to the Guardian and the Washington Post by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/edward-snowden\">whistleblower Edward Snowden</a>, Wyden and Udall have declined to call for the resignation of any intelligence leaders. While they have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/13/senators-challenge-nsa-surveillance-terrorism\">challenged the NSA's claims</a> that bulk phone records collection had significantly aided US defenses against terrorism, they have occasionally muted their criticisms. \"I think details about overseas intelligence collection should be kept secret,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-surveillance-lawmakers-disclosure-debate\">Wyden told the Guardian</a> on 9 June.</p><p>Tuesday's statement represents their most pointed criticism to date – about both the value of the NSA's surveillance efforts and the integrity of the men and women in charge of them.  </p><p>\"We believe that the broader lesson here is that even though intelligence officials may be well-intentioned, assertions from intelligence agencies about the value and effectiveness of particular programs should not simply be accepted at face value by policymakers or oversight bodies any more than statements about the usefulness of other government programs should be taken at face value when they are made by other government officials,\" Wyden and Udall said.  </p><p>\"It is up to Congress, the courts and the public to ask the tough questions and press even experienced intelligence officials to back their assertions up with actual evidence, rather than simply deferring to these officials' conclusions without challenging them.\"</p><p>Officials from the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence had no immediate reaction to Wyden and Udall's statement.  </p><p>Echoing an intimation <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/28/senators-letter-james-clapper\">made on Friday in a letter </a>to Clapper that was signed by 26 senators, Wyden and Udall hinted that the true breadth of US surveillance on Americans has yet to come out. </p><p>\"The fact that Patriot Act authorities were used for the bulk collection of email records as well as phone records underscores our concern that this authority could be used to collect other types of records in bulk as well, including information on credit card purchases, medical records, library records, firearm sales records, financial information and a range of other sensitive subjects,\" the two senators said.  </p><p>\"These other types of collection could clearly have a significant impact on Americans' constitutional rights.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412046185|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a08794fb8e27639f62f120702d2d78cba530ccf5 -->",

        "headline":"European firms 'could quit US internet providers over NSA scandal'",
        "body":"<p>European businesses are likely to abandon the services of American internet providers because of the National Security Agency surveillance scandal, the European commission has warned.</p><p>Neelie Kroes, the commission vice-president who speaks on digital affairs, predicted that providers of cloud services, which allow users to store and access data on remote servers, could suffer significant loss of business if clients fear the security of their material is under threat.</p><p></p><p>The warning came as it appeared that the Americans and the Europeans were to start investigating alleged breaches of data privacy in the EU as well as US intelligence and espionage practices.</p><p>Despite threats from France to delay long-awaited EU-US negotiations on a new transatlantic free trade pact, scheduled to open in Washington on Monday, EU ambassadors in Brussels reached a consensus on Thursday to go ahead with the talks.</p><p>They could not yet agree, however, on how to respond to a US offer of parallel talks on the NSA scandal, the Prism and Tempora programmes and issues of more traditional espionage arising from reports of how US agencies bugged and tapped the offices and embassies of the EU and several member states.</p><p>Dalia Grybauskaitė, the president of Lithuania, said on Thursday that she was not seeking an apology from the Americans. Lithuania takes over the rotating six-month EU presidency this week.</p><p>While no decision had yet been taken, she said she hoped the EU-US talks on electronic surveillance would also be launched on Monday and run concurrently. Since much of the alleged US hoovering up of telephone and internet traffic in Europe is assumed to amount to commercial and industrial espionage, the two parallel sets of talks will affect one another.</p><p>Senior EU officials complain that there is no point engaging in sensitive trade talks when the other side has already eavesdropped on you and knows your negotiating position.</p><p>Grybauskaitė emphasised that the American side was keen to come clean on the dispute.</p><p>\"They are open to co-operation. They are open to explain,\" she said. \"I never seek an apology from anyone. I seek information … We don't want to jeopardise the strategic importance of free trade.\"</p><p>Pointing to the potential fallout from the disclosures about the scale of NSA operations in Europe, Kroes, the European commissioner for digital matters, predicted that US internet providers of cloud services could suffer major business losses.</p><p>\"If businesses or governments think they might be spied on, they will have less reason to trust cloud, and it will be cloud providers who ultimately miss out. Why would you pay someone else to hold your commercial or other secrets if you suspect or know they are being shared against your wishes?\" she said.</p><p>\"It is often American providers that will miss out, because they are often the leaders in cloud services. If European cloud customers cannot trust the United States government, then maybe they won't trust US cloud providers either. If I am right, there are multibillion-euro consequences for American companies. If I were an American cloud provider, I would be quite frustrated with my government right now.\"</p><p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the European commission and Grybauskaitė made clear they wanted the trade talks to go ahead as planned on Monday. France appeared to drop its objections despite previously insisting on guarantees that the espionage had been halted before the trade talks could start.</p><p>Grybauskaitė also voiced suspicions of a possible Russian role in the furore, pointing to Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower, being stuck in Moscow at the same time as weekend revelations about US spying on Europe emerged in the runup to the trade talks.</p><p>She insisted that the espionage dispute should not be allowed to derail the trade talks but conceded that \"some countries are very sensitive on this question.\" The Lithuanian finance minister, Rimantas Šadžius, said: \"The French have some problems.\"</p><p>EU diplomats said ambassadors from the 28 member states engaged in \"urgent and tricky\" discussions on Thursday on how to proceed. While the European commission would lead the EU side on issues of data privacy, the talks on intelligence and espionage practices would need to be done by national governments.</p><p>It was not clear where Britain fitted into the picture since it is one of the biggest EU countries but has not been targeted by the NSA, unlike Germany or France, according to the reports, and the UK's GCHQ has itself been collecting vast quantities of European internet and telephone data.</p><p>Kroes warned that US firms could be the biggest losers from the US government's voracious appetite for information.</p><p>\"Concerns about cloud security can easily push European policy-makers into putting security guarantees ahead of open markets, with consequences for American companies. Cloud has a lot of potential. But potential doesn't count for much in an atmosphere of distrust.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412195012|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|710d84a5db6d5aec28b16b7a40d3103f50a1853d -->",

        "body":"<p>France runs a vast electronic surveillance operation, intercepting and stocking data from citizens' phone and internet activity, using similar methods to the US National Security Agency's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/prism?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Prism programme</a> exposed by Edward Snowden, Le Monde has reported.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/07/04/revelations-sur-le-big-brother-francais_3441973_3224.html\" title=\"\">An investigation by the French daily</a> found that the DGSE, France's external intelligence agency, had spied on the French public's phone calls, emails and internet activity. The agency intercepted signals from computers and phones in France as well as between France and other countries, looking not so much at content but to create a map of \"who is talking to whom\", the paper said.</p><p>Le Monde said data from emails, text messages, phone records, accessing of Facebook and Twitter, and internet activity going through sites such as Google, Microsoft or Yahoo! was stocked for years on vast servers on three different floors in the basement of the DGSE headquarters.</p><p>The paper described the vast spying programme as secret, \"outside any serious control\" and illegal.</p><p>The metadata from phone and internet use was stocked in a \"gigantic database\" which could be consulted by six French intelligence and security agencies as well as the police.</p><p>The paper said Bernard Barbier, technical director of the DGSE, had previously described the system as \"probably the biggest information centre in Europe after the English\".</p><p>Referring to the system as a \"French Big Brother\", Le Monde said the French state was able to use the surveillance \"to spy on anybody at any time\". The paper wrote: \"All of our communications are spied on.\"</p><p>Le Monde said that after Snowden's revelations about the NSA's Prism surveillance programme prompted indignation in Europe, France \"only weakly protested, for two excellent reasons: Paris already knew about it, and it was doing the same thing\".</p><p>When revelations about the Prism programme harvesting citizens' data emerged, the French government did not immediately comment. But after fresh allegations about the US spying on the European Union and foreign embassies, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/30/nsa-leaks-us-bugging-european-allies?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">including the French embassy in Washington</a>, the president, François Hollande, said these practices must \"cease immediately\". France demanded the suspension of talks on the EU-US free trade pact until it had received full explanations about surveillance.</p><p>The foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said this week that France did not spy on the US embassy in Paris because \"between partner countries\" these \"were not the sorts of things that should happen\". Asked about the US spying, Fleur Pellerin, the junior minister for the digital economy, told BFMTV this week that she found the \"<a href=\"http://www.bfmtv.com/video/bfmtv/international/fleur-pellerin-attendons-explications-americaines-porter-un-jugement-01-07-133820/\" title=\"\">generalised surveillance of citizens</a>\" was \"particularly shocking\".</p><p>The Guardian revealed last month that Britain's spy agency GCHQ had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\" title=\"\">secretly gained access to the network of cables which carry the world's phone calls and internet traffic</a> and had started to process vast streams of sensitive personal information which it was sharing with its American partner, the NSA.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412202568|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a42a5290d98a0349dfcf9c82eb708047e52dd2ea -->",

        "headline":"Edward Snowden asylum: countries approached and their responses",
        "body":"<p>According to a statement from WikiLeaks, the US whistleblower Edward Snowden has applied for asylum in a total of 21 countries. Snowden, who has been charged under espionage laws in the US after leaking top-secret documents on US surveillance programmes, has been trapped in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since 23 June after flying in from Hong Kong. He has yet to receive a positive response to his applications for asylum. Some countries have yet to respond but a number have already rejected his request.</p><h2>Austria</h2><p>No. The interior minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, said Snowden would have to submit his request for asylum while on Austrian soil. But she added that he would not be deported if he arrived in Austria because \"there is no international arrest warrant\".</p><h2>Bolivia</h2><p>Possible. President Evo Morales said no application has been received, but if it were it would be considered. \"If there were a request, of course we would be willing to debate and consider the idea,\" Morales told Spanish language RT Actualidad.</p><h2>Brazil</h2><p>No. A foreign ministry spokesman said Brazil would not grant asylum, adding that it would leave the request unanswered.</p><h2>China</h2><p>A foreign ministry spokeswoman said she had no information on<br />Snowden's asylum request.</p><h2>Cuba</h2><p>No response.</p><h2>Ecuador</h2><p>No. The president, Rafael Correa, said he was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/02/ecuador-rafael-correa-snowden-mistake\" title=\"\">not considering Snowden's asylum request</a>. In an interview with the Guardian, Correa said Snowden would have to reach Ecuadorean territory before the country would consider any asylum request. The US has cancelled Snowden's passport, and Correa said his government would not give Snowden an authorised travel document to extract himself from Moscow airport. \"The right of asylum request is one thing, but helping someone travel from one country to another – Ecuador has never done this.\"</p><h2>Finland</h2><p>No. The Finnish foreign ministry spokeswoman Tytti Pylkkö said Finnish law required Snowden to be in the country for him to apply.</p><h2>France</h2><p>France said it had not received a request. The president, François<br />Hollande, has called for a common EU stance on the NSA snooping.</p><h2>Germany</h2><p>Unlikely. <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/national/20130702-50633.html\" title=\"\">Foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said it would review the asylum request \"according to the law\", although he \"could not imagine\" that it would be approved</a>.</p><h2>Iceland</h2><p>No response.</p><h2>India</h2><p>No. Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India's foreign ministry, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AkbarMEA/status/352006070367031296\" title=\"\">said on Twitter:</a> \"Following careful examination we have concluded that we see no reason to accede to the Snowden request\"</p><h2>Italy</h2><p>No. The foreign minister, Emma Bonino, told parliament that any asylum request would have to be presented in person at the border or in Italian territory.</p><p>\"As a result there do not exist the legal conditions to accept such a request which in the government's view would not be acceptable on a political level either,\" she said.</p><h2>Ireland</h2><p>No. A spokesman for the department of justice said that under Irish law an asylum application could only be accepted from a person who had landed in or was within the state.</p><h2>The Netherlands</h2><p>No. <a href=\"http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/07/02/reacties-op-asielaanvragen-snowden-voorlopig-negatief/\" title=\"\">Security and justice secretary Fred Teeven told Dutch news agency Novum Snowden's application could not be accepted while he was abroad. </a></p><h2>Nicaragua</h2><p>No response.</p><h2>Norway</h2><p>Unlikely. The Norwegian deputy justice secretary, Paal Loenseth, told<br />the state broadcaster NRK: \"Applying for asylum should be done on<br />Norwegian soil.\" He added: \"The Norwegian authorities can theoretically permit entry to Norway and asylum to a person that we think is important for foreign political reasons but I can't see any such reasons in this particular case.\"<br />Under its right of initiative, Norwegian Pen, which promotes literature and freedom of expression, has demanded that Snowden's application be reviewed. This means that the Norwegian directorate of immigration can no longer dismiss the application merely on the grounds that it was not filed from Norway. But it does not follow that it will be granted.</p><h2>Poland</h2><p>No. The foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, wrote on his Twitter account: \"I will not give a positive recommendation.\"</p><h2>Russia</h2><p>No. Snowden withdrew his request after Vladimir Putin's statement making clear that he would be welcome only if he stopped \"his work aimed at bringing harm\" to the United States.</p><h2>Spain</h2><p>No. The foreign minister, José García-Margallo, told reporters in the Spanish parliament: \"For it [the application] to be legally admissible, it has to be made by a person who is in Spain.\"</p><h2>Switzerland</h2><p>No. Valentina Anufrieva of the Embassy of Switzerland in Moscow <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/07/02/snowden-russia-asylum/2481831/\" title=\"\">told USA Today that Swiss asylum claims can only be filed from within Switzerland itself</a>. \"Only when the person's life is in danger can we make an exception,\" she said. \"But that doesn't appear to be the case here.\"</p><h2>Venezuela</h2><p>Possible. On a visit to Moscow, the president, Nicolás Maduro, said he would consider an asylum request and said the whistleblower \"deserves the world's protection\". But he later told reporters that his country has not received an application for asylum from Snowden and dodged the question of whether he would take Snowden with him when he left.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412001369|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|861c3c2301e2dc1e567354487909d85053af620e -->",

        "headline":"Is Edward Snowden stateless and where can he go?",
        "body":"<h2><strong>Is Edward Snowden stateless?</strong></h2><p>The US whistleblower has accused Washington of revoking his passport, leaving him a stateless person. The Obama administration, however, insists it has only cancelled the validity of Snowden's travel document, not deprived him of citizenship. The US State Department has now offered him a \"one-entry travel document\" to return home – an option unlikely to tempt Snowden to board a US-bound plane.</p><h2><strong>Can he be rendered stateless?</strong></h2><p>Making anybody stateless is formally forbidden by the universal declaration of human rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948. , which declares under article 15 that: \"(1) Everyone has the right to a nationality; (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.\" Individuals can voluntarily renounce their US citizenship – but they have to turn up in person at a US embassy.</p><h2><strong>Are airports outside national territory?</strong></h2><p>States normally retain full control over airside transit areas. Russia appears to be treating Moscow's Sheremetyevo international airport, where Snowden is believed to be hiding, as beyond its control. Gemma Lindfield, a London barrister specialising in extradition and international law, said: \"Russia is taking the view that he has not entered Russian territory. It's finding a reason to do what it wants. The authorities have redefined the space of the airport as international.\"</p><h2><strong>What documents would Snowden require to leave Moscow?</strong></h2><p>Ecuador initially provided him with a <em>laissez-passer</em> (from the French for \"let pass\"), or temporary letter of passage, requesting a country to allow a person without other identity documents to cross international borders. But even with a <em>laissez-passer</em>, Lindfield said, \"Russia would have to agree to accept it. It would also come down to whether the airline carrier would be happy to take him.\"</p><h2><strong>How long can anyone remain in an airport?</strong></h2><p>Mehran Karimi Nasseri, an Iranian refugee, lived in the departure lounge of Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris for 18 years. His story, Terminal Man, was later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/sep/06/features.features11\" title=\"\">turned into a film</a>, The Terminal. Another Iranian refugee, Zahra Kamalfar, spent 10 months at Sheremetyevo airport before flying on to Canada in 2007. Apart from Julian Assange, who is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/jun/17/julian-assange-five-more-years-ecuador\" title=\"\">confined to Ecuador's embassy</a> in London, others trapped in long-term legal limbo have included Archbishop József Mindszenty, the Catholic primate of Hungary, who spent 15 years in the US embassy in Budapest.</p><h2><strong>What are Snowden's other options?</strong></h2><p>Formal requests for asylum have been lodged on Snowden's behalf with 21 states. His initial applications were to Ecuador and Iceland.  The WikiLeaks activist Sarah Harrison has submitted additional letters to Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and Venezuela.</p><h2><strong>How are those requests progressing?</strong></h2><p>Snowden has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/02/edward-snowden-nsa-withdraws-asylum-russia-putin\" title=\"\">withdrawn his asylum request to Russia</a> because it said he would be welcome only if he stopped \"his work aimed at bringing harm\" to the US. Norway, Poland, Germany, Austria, Finland, Spain and Switzerland say that asylum requests can only be made on their soil. Ecuador is reported to have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/02/ecuador-rafael-correa-snowden-mistake\" title=\"\">revoked the safe passage letter</a> written for Snowden to leave Hong Kong because the president, Rafael Correa, was not informed before it was issued.</p><h2><strong>Which country should he choose to escape the reach of US justice?</strong></h2><p>States that do not have extradition treaties with the US are likely to offer the best hope of securing his freedom. But lawyers point out that even the absence of a treaty may not be sufficient protection against extradition. The UK has managed to extradite suspects from Somalia through case-by-case bilateral agreements. In the end his asylum may come down to political will more than international law. \"You would do well to choose a country that has historically terrible diplomatic relations with the US,\" Lindfield suggested.</p><p><strong>Owen Bowcott</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412030063|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|c277c9b50e19b9e4d7c39f055aa46c15e33745af -->",

        "body":"<p>Bolivia's president, Evo Morales, has warned he might close the US embassy in his country, as South America's leftist leaders rallied to support him over the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/03/edward-snowden-bolivia-plane-vienna\">rerouting of his presidential plane</a>.</p><p>Morales again blamed Washington for putting pressure on European countries to refuse to allow his plane to fly through their airspace on Tuesday, forcing it to land in Vienna, in what he called a violation of international law. He had been returning from a summit in Russia during which he had suggested he would be willing to consider a request from the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden for asylum.</p><p>\"Being united will defeat American imperialism. We met with the leaders of my party and they asked us for several measures and if necessary, we will close the embassy of the United States,\" Morales said. \"We do not need the embassy of the United States.\"</p><p>Morales made his announcement on Thursday as the leaders of Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina and Uruguay joined him in Cochabamba, Bolivia, for a special meeting to address the diplomatic row.</p><p>At the end of the summit a statement was issued demanding answers from France, Portugal, Italy and Spain. The United States was not mentioned in the statement.</p><p>\"Europe broke all the rules of the game,\" Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro said shortly after arriving at Cochabamba airport. \"We're here to tell president Evo Morales that he can count on us. Whoever picks a fight with Bolivia, picks a fight with Venezuela.\"</p><p>Maduro said an unnamed European government minister had told Venezuela the CIA was behind the incident.</p><p>\"We are not colonies any more,\" Uruguay's president, Jose Mujica, said. \"We deserve respect, and when one of our governments is insulted we feel the insult throughout Latin America.\"</p><p>Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said on Thursday he and other leaders were offering full support to Morales and called the rerouting of the plane an aggression against the Americas.</p><p>Cristina Fernandez of Argentina said Latin Americans treasured freedom after fighting for independence from Europe in the 19th century and then surviving Washington's 20th-century history of backing repressive regimes in the Americas. She demanded an apology for the plane ordeal.</p><p>\"I'm asking those who violated the law in calm but serious manner, to take responsibility for the errors made, it's the least they can do,\" Fernandez said. \"To apologise for once in their life, to say they're sorry for what they've done.\"</p><p>Morales has said that while the plane was parked in Vienna, the Spanish ambassador to Austria arrived with two embassy personnel and they asked to search the plane. He said he denied them permission.</p><p>\"Who takes the decision to attack the president of a South American nation?\" Maduro asked. Spanish prime minister Mariano \"Rajoy has been abusive by trying to search Morales' plane in Spain. He has no right to breach international law.\"</p><p>Before the meeting, Morales said his ordeal was part of a US plot to intimidate him and other Latin American leaders.</p><p>He urged European nations to \"free themselves\" from the United States. \"The United States is using its agent [Snowden] and the president [of Bolivia] to intimidate the whole region,\" he said.</p><p>France sent an apology to the Bolivian government. But Morales said \"apologies are not enough because the stance is that international treaties must be respected\".</p><p>Spain's foreign affairs minister, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, said his country did not bar Morales from landing in its territory.</p><p>Amid the tensions, the US embassy in La Paz cancelled Independence Day celebrations scheduled for Thursday. In the eastern city of Santa Cruz, Bolivian government sympathisers painted protest slogans on the doors of the American consulate.</p><p>Bolivia has said it will summon the French and Italian ambassadors and the Portuguese consul to demand explanations.</p><p>Morales said he never saw Snowden when he was in Russia, and that Bolivia had not received a formal request for asylum for him. Despite the complaints, there were no signs that Latin America leaders were moving to bring Snowden to the region that had been seen as the most likely to grant him asylum.</p><p>Not all the region's leaders were not expected at the summit.</p><p>Brazil was represented by Marco Aurelio Garcia, President Dilma Rousseff's top international adviser. The presidents of Colombia, Chile and Peru, who have strong ties to the US, were not attending.</p><p>Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, said earlier on Thursday he supported Morales, but asked other leaders to remain cool and avoid an escalating dispute between Latin America and the European Union.</p><p>\"We're in solidarity with Evo Morales because what they did to him is unheard-of, but let's not let this turn into a diplomatic crisis for Latin America and the EU,\" Santos tweeted on Thursday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412220659|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|c40e46280640f084cbec4d52480d832ef2b73f50 -->",

        "body":"<p>Edward Snowden's whistle-blowing activities have not only split America's journalistic community, it appears to have split the Washington Post's staff too. </p><p>In a surprising editorial, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-keep-edward-snowden-from-leaking-more-nsa-secrets/2013/07/01/4e8bbe28-e278-11e2-a11e-c2ea876a8f30_story.html\">\"Plugging the leaks in the Edward Snowden case\",</a> the paper argued that the first priority should be to prevent Snowden \"from leaking information that harms efforts to fight terrorism and conduct legitimate intelligence operations.\"</p><p>It pointed out that Snowden \"is reported to have stolen many more documents, encrypted copies of which may have been given to allies such as the WikiLeaks organisation.\" And then it said:</p><blockquote><p>\"Stopping potentially damaging revelations or the dissemination of intelligence to adversaries should take precedence over US prosecution of Mr Snowden — which could enhance his status as a political martyr in the eyes of many both in and outside the United States.\"</p></blockquote><p>And all this in the paper responsible for publishing Snowden's leaks. No wonder the facing-both-ways leading article moved syndicated newspaper columnist David Sirota <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/07/02/meet_the_journalists_against_journalism_club/\">to comment on Salon.com:</a></p><blockquote><p>\"What sets this Washington Post editorial apart — what vaults it into the annals of history — is how it is essentially railing on the Washington Post's own source and own journalism.\"</p></blockquote><p>He contends that the editorial \"represents the paper's higher-ups issuing a jeremiad against their own news-generating source and, by extension, the reporters who helped bring his leak into the public sphere.\"</p><p>Citing the Post's famed Watergate investigations, he sees it as \"the equivalent of the paper issuing an editorial in 1972 not demanding more information from President Nixon, but instead insisting the Nixon administration's first 'priority should be to prevent Deep Throat from leaking information.'\"</p><p>Then comes his main, serious message:</p><blockquote><p>\"At one level, this is all downright hilarious. But at another level, it isn't because it potentially intensifies a larger chilling effect on investigative journalism that is happening throughout the media.\"</p></blockquote><p>There is, of course, something of a British parallel over Snowden's NSA leaks. The Guardian has been criticised by rival newspapers because of the revelations. Some papers have simply ignored them, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2013/jun/20/theguardian-edward-snowden\">as I wrote here</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412240294|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|0b03dc34480d43e063926c01bb14d3c33a44779a -->",

        "body":"<p>Spain says it and other European countries were told that the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was on board the Bolivian presidential plane that was diverted to Austria this week, causing a diplomatic row.</p><p>The foreign minister, José Manuel García-Margallo, said on Spanish National Television on Friday that \"they told us that the information was clear, that he was inside\".</p><p>The minister did not say who supplied the information and declined to say whether he had been in contact with the United States. But he said European countries' reactions were based on this information.</p><p>The Bolivian president, Evo Morales, claims the US pressured European countries to deny the plane flyover permission on Tuesday on suspicion that Snowden was using the flight as part of his bid to seek asylum.</p><p>Morales has warned <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/05/bolivia-morales-close-us-embassy\" title=\"\">he might close the US embassy</a> in his country over the forced landing, which he called a violation of international law. He had been returning from a summit in Russia during which he had suggested he would be willing to consider a request from Snowden for asylum.</p><p>\"We met with the leaders of my party and they asked us for several measures and if necessary, we will close the embassy of the United States,\" Morales said on Thursday. \"We do not need the embassy of the United States.\"</p><p>Morales made his announcement as the leaders of Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina and Uruguay joined him in Cochabamba, Bolivia, for a special meeting to address the diplomatic row. At the end of the summit a statement was issued demanding answers from France, Portugal, Italy and Spain. The US was not mentioned in the statement.</p><p>Morales has said that while the plane was parked in Vienna, the Spanish ambassador to Austria arrived with two embassy personnel and they asked to search the plane. He said he denied them permission.</p><p>García-Margallo said on Thursday that Spain did not bar Morales from landing in its territory.</p><p>France sent an apology to the Bolivian government. But Morales said \"apologies are not enough because the stance is that international treaties must be respected\".</p><p>Morales said he never saw Snowden when he was in Russia, and Bolivia had not received a formal request from him for asylum.</p><p>Despite the complaints, there were no signs that Latin American leaders were moving to bring Snowden to the region that had been seen as the most likely to grant him asylum.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412236933|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|ba066f42eca3202ca00bbe69569aa82d62fbe2d6 -->",

He is believed to have applied for asylum in 20 countries - thus far without result. In the meantime, his revelations have sparked a diplomatic crisis. In the past few days both the German and French leaders have described the NSA's surveillance program as \"unacceptable\".</p><p></p><p>\"To me Snowden is a hero because he revealed secrets that we should all know, that the United States has repeatedly violated the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" title=\"\">fourth amendment</a>,\" Stone said. \"He should be welcomed and offered asylum. But he has no place to hide because every country is intimidated by the United States.\"</p><p></p><p>Stone, 66, was at the festival to unveil episodes of his new Showtime TV series, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/apr/15/oliver-stone-america-went-wrong\" title=\"\">Oliver Stone's Untold History of the United States</a>, as well as the extended \"ultimate\" cut of his unloved 2004 epic Alexander.</p><p></p><p>The film-maker's vocal support for Snowden is entirely in character. In recent months Stone has also thrown his weight behind <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/apr/11/oliver-stone-julian-assange-wikileaks\" title=\"\">WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange</a>, visiting the activist at his base at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and criticising the depiction of Assange in two upcoming Hollywood pictures. \"Julian Assange did much for free speech,\" Stone has said. \"And he is now being victimised by the abusers of the concept.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412255677|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|2497f47135a2ed6e226c5a3ed0d3f28158956335 -->",

        "headline":"Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia offer asylum to Edward Snowden",
        "body":"<p>Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua have offered asylum to Edward Snowden, the US whistleblower who is believed to have spent the past two weeks at a Moscow airport evading US attempts to extradite him.</p><p>The Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, and his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, made the asylum offers on Friday, shortly after they and other Latin American leaders met to denounce the diversion of a plane carrying the Bolivian president, Evo Morales, due to suspicions that Snowden might have been on board.</p><p>Shortly after, Morales also said Bolivia would grant asylum to Snowden, if asked. On Saturday, Venezuela's offer was given a warm reception by an influential member of the Russian parliament.</p><p>In a tweet, Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the Duma foreign affairs committee, said: \"Asylum for Snowden in Venezuela would be the best solution.\"</p><p>The invitations from South America came as Snowden sent out new requests for asylum to six countries, in addition to the 20 he has already contacted, according to WikiLeaks, which claims to be in regular contact with the former National Security Agency contractor.</p><p>Most of the countries have refused or given technical reasons why an application is not valid, but several Latin American leaders have rallied together with expressions of solidarity and welcome.</p><p>\"As head of state of the Bolivarian republic of Venezuela, I have decided to offer humanitarian asylum to the young Snowden&nbsp;… to protect this young man from persecution by the empire,\" said Maduro who, along with his predecessor Hugo Chávez, often refers to the US as \"the empire\".</p><p>The previous day, Maduro told the Telesur TV channel that Venezuela had received an extradition request from the US, which he had already rejected.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jul/06/us-request-extradition-edward-snowden\" title=\"\">copy of the request</a>, seen by the Guardian, notes that Snowden \"unlawfully released classified information and documents to international media outlets\" and names the Guardian and the Washington Post. Dated 3 July and sent in English and Spanish, it says: \"The United States seeks Snowden's provisional arrest should Snowden seek to travel to or transit through Venezuela. Snowden is a flight risk because of the substantial charges he is facing and his current and active attempts to remain a fugitive.\"</p><p>It adds that he is charged with unauthorised disclosure of national defence information, unauthorised disclosure of classified communication intelligence and theft of government property. Each of these three charges carries a maximum  penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.</p><p>Describing Snowden as \"a fugitive who is currently in Russia\", it urges Venezuela to keep him in custody if arrested and to seize all items in his possession for later delivery to the US. It provides a photograph and two alternative passport numbers – one revoked, and one reported lost or stolen.</p><p>Maduro said he did not accept the grounds for the charges.</p><p>\"He has told the truth, in the spirit of rebellion, about the US spying on the whole world,\" Maduro said in his latest speech. \"Who is the guilty one? A young man&nbsp;… who denounces war plans, or the US government which launches bombs and arms the terrorist Syrian opposition against the people and legitimate president, Bashar al-Assad?\"</p><p>The Bolivian government, which has said it would listen sympathetically to an aslyum request from Snowden, said it too had turned down a pre-emptive US extradition request.</p><p>Ortega said Nicaragua had received an asylum request from Snowden and the president gave a guarded acceptance.</p><p>\"We are an open country, respectful of the right of asylum, and it's clear that if circumstances permit, we would gladly receive Snowden and give him asylum in Nicaragua,\" Ortega told a gathering in Managua.</p><p>So far, the countries that have been most vocal in offering support are close allies of Venezuela. Ecuador has also expressed support for Snowden, though the government there has yet to decide whether it would grant aslyum. It is already providing refuge for the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been in the Ecuadorean embassy in London for about a year.</p><p>Many in Latin America were furious when the Bolivian president's flight from Russia was denied airspace by European countries, forcing it to land in Vienna, where Morales had to spend more than half a day waiting to get clearance to continue his journey.</p><p>Morales said the Spanish ambassador to Austria arrived at the airport with two embassy personnel and asked to search the plane. He said he refused.</p><p>The Spanish foreign minister, José Manuel García-Margallo, acknowledged on Friday that the decision to block Morales plane was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/05/european-states-snowden-morales-plane-nsa\" title=\"\">based on a tip that Snowden was on board</a>.</p><p>\"They told us that the information was clear, that he was inside,\" he told Spanish TV, without clarifying who the tip was from.</p><p>It is assumed the US was behind the diversion, though US officials have said only that they were in contact with the countries on the plane's route.</p><p>France has apologised to Bolivia.</p><p>Morales said when he finally arrived in La Paz: \"It is an open provocation to the continent, not only to the president; they use the agent of North American imperialism to scare us and intimidate us.\"</p><p>At a hastily called meeting of the Unasur regional bloc, many governments condemned the action against Morales plane.</p><p>\"We are not colonies any more,\" Uruguay's president, José Mujica, said. \"We deserve respect, and when one of our governments is insulted we feel the insult throughout Latin America.\"</p><p>The Argentinean president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, was also present, along with a senior representative of President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil.</p><p>Regional support may make it easier for the country offering asylum to resist US pressure for extradition. But whether Snowden can make it to South America remains uncertain, as are his current circumstances. He has not been seen or heard in public since he flew to Russia from Hong Kong. WikiLeaks says it is in touch with him and that he has widened his search for aslyum by adding six new countries.</p><p>In a tweet, the group said it would not reveal the names of the nations \"due to attempted US interference\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412290058|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|3d8f6d76074adb3ea5f821f15bd79b5b3eb7574a -->",
