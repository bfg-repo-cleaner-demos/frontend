        "body":"<p>You probably know that the Boston Red Sox won baseball's World Series this week. You possibly know that they did this with a squad of players many of whom wore luxuriant facial hair that wouldn't have looked out of place in Hoxton on, say, an urban beekeeper or a small-batch, artisanal brewer. Really, it was quite something to behold. On Thursday night at Fenway Park, the home of the Red Sox, bearded team-mates hugged each other, while bearded fans (some with real bristles, others with fake Gandalfs bought from the club shop) went wild in the stands. Even Wally the Green Monster, the team's mascot, stuck on a patch of felt for the occasion.</p><p>The Red Sox's face fuzz received an endorsement from no less an authority than ZZ Top. \"Personally speaking, the style of the beard is perfect for baseball,\" said Dusty Hill, vocalist and bassist. \"Too much longer, it's going to get in your way. Too much shorter, I don't know – it's not really a real beard.\"</p><p>To many, the beards were a silly superstition, a hipster update of the lucky jockstrap. But as the Red Sox lifted the trophy, it was hard not to feel that the facial hair had imbued the players with a Samsonian power. Last season, the team finished bottom of their division, losing 93 of 162 games, their worst return in nearly 50 years. Their manager was sacked, some expensive stars were shipped out and unheralded new players arrived. A couple of these decided to grow beards in pre-season – and it went from there.</p><p>Facial hair is a surprisingly divisive issue in baseball. Over the years, many clubs have insisted that their players compete clean-shaven: the New York Yankees, the great rivals of the Red Sox, do so to this day, although they now have an exemption for a tidy moustache. The Red Sox's bushy beards have cast them as outlaws and renegades in this manicured sport, and – like a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074174/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ql_6\" title=\"\"><em>Bad News Bears</em></a> for 2013 – team spirit has clearly thrived with them.</p><p>\"The beards are part of the camaraderie; it's almost intense,\" said John W Henry, owner of the Red Sox and also Liverpool. \"I, for one, underestimated – potentially have always underestimated – the effect of camaraderie.\"</p><p>Like them or not, Boston's identity and the beards are now entangled. Some have even found parallels between them and the city's efforts to recover from April's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/boston-marathon-explosions\" title=\"\">Boston Marathon bombings</a>, which killed three and injured hundreds.</p><p>\"This team with these beards has the power … to create the impression that all of that work is for the wounded city,\" <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9787889/the-red-sox-baseball-beards\" title=\"\">wrote Wesley Morris in <em>Grantland</em></a>. \"The team's new hair debuted near the time of the bombing and, for me, has always given off a touch of mournfulness.\"</p><p></p><p>Facial hair is not unknown on sportsmen, of course, but examples of really deep shrubbery – the kind you can stick a pencil in, the definitive test – have remained rare. There are a few wrestlers, darts players and <a href=\"http://www.4dfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Socrates1986.jpg\" title=\"\">Sócrates</a>, the Brazilian playmaker. The moustache had a moment in the 1970s and 80s – the great Liverpool era of Graeme Souness, Jimmy Case, Mark Lawrenson and Ian Rush – but even that fell out of fashion.</p><p>In 2003, two friends in Australia got to chatting about which trend was least likely to enjoy a comeback. The answer was not staring them in the face: it was the handlebar, the pencil, the Fu&nbsp;Manchu. They launched Movember, originally corralling a group of 30 men to grow a moustache just for the month of November. The idea caught on, and last year there were 1.1 million \"Mo Bros\" and \"Mo Sistas\" worldwide, raising £92m for men's health, particularly prostate cancer, charities.</p><p>Sport has been well represented in Movember from the start. Merv Hughes – natch – was an early pioneer, while the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/06/rugby-union-australia-england\" title=\"\">Australian rugby union team adopted it en masse</a> in 2009-10 on tour in the UK. Any player who didn't grow a moustache paid a daily fine of £10. A pre-Mobot Mo Farah grew one in 2011, while last year footballers caught on, exuberantly in Michael Owen's case, with <a href=\"http://c1.dmlimg.com/2e5c93fc5fcb277c88837e18ff8cc045a443e08b60667809b75f753d63c63dbe.jpg\" title=\"\">Theo Walcott's</a> more like a rakish World War Two spiv.</p><p>There is still something thrillingly retrogressive about a sportsman with proper facial hair. It shows a wanton contempt for aerodynamics and modern ways, like eating a pork pie and smoking a fag at half-time. I've always had special regard for the hirsute cyclist <a href=\"http://pedalmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Dam-CORVOS_00017572-052.jpg\" title=\"\">Laurens ten Dam</a>: \"Right, I'm going to shave my legs and have a beard,\" his face screams. \"And I'm going to ride my bike with drool and phlegm matted deep in my whiskers.\"</p><p>It's easy, too, to see why Red Sox fans responded to their players eschewing their razors. Very few men look better with a beard, especially long, straggly ones more commonly found on terrorists in Hollywood movies. Watching them play, it was easy to forget that these were professional athletes. They looked too normal and unpolished. The distance between the field and the stands had never been closer.</p><p>It's early days for Movember, but we may see some upper-lip tufts this weekend. Perhaps whole clubs will be inspired by the Red Sox; maybe John W Henry will give a three-line whip to Brendan Rodgers. The take-up has been particularly high at Northampton Saints, led by Dylan Hartley and George&nbsp;North, while Stoke City are perennial supporters.</p><p>One name does stand out on the list of Movember ambassadors: Manchester City's beleaguered keeper Joe Hart. He's \"supporting but not growing\" this year. That's a shame; maybe a moustache is exactly what he needs right now.</p><p></p><p><em>Tim Lewis's book on the Rwandan cycling team, </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780224091763\" title=\"\"><em>Land of Second Chances</em></a><em>, is out now</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421479255|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|6c9e8fd845a1bd839f47be9bae3fbdcea0868a0e -->",

        "body":"<p>The Boston Red Sox are parading from the Green Monster to the Charles River on Saturday to celebrate a most improbable journey.</p><p>The \"rolling rally\" left Fenway Park three days after the team won the World Series with a 6-1 victory over the St Louis Cardinals in Game 6 at their longtime home. It capped a stunning turnaround from 2012 when the Red Sox had their worst record in nearly half a century.</p><p>Players still sporting their beards, manager John Farrell, coaches and team officials boarded 25 amphibious \"duck boats\" on the warning track.</p><p>The vehicles paused when they reached the Boston Marathon finish line, still painted blue and yellow, where three spectators died in the bombings during the 15 April race.</p><p>Outfielder Jonny Gomes placed the World Series trophy on the line and he and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia held Red Sox jerseys with the words \"BOSTON STRONG\" and the number 617, the city's area code.</p><p>Before leaving Fenway, Farrell recalled that the Red Sox had left after their game the day of the Marathon for Logan airport for a road trip. Along the way, they saw emergency vehicles responding to the explosions.</p><p>\"Knowing that we were heading out of town, that's going to bring back a lot, and a lot of uncertainty at that moment,\" Farrell said, \"because no one knew where to turn next. So we were fortunate to be part of maybe a little bit of a healing process.\"</p><p>Second baseman Dustin Pedroia said: \"We played for the whole city, what the city went through.\"</p><p>On a mild, mostly sunny day, the rally route included a ride in the Charles River between Boston and Cambridge.</p><p>Season-ticket holders were allowed into Fenway for a pre-rally ceremony at which team officials, Farrell and several players spoke. Then they all boarded the duck boats.</p><p>The departure was delayed when a flatbed truck carrying Dropkick Murphys, a band which had played at the ceremony, and heavy equipment became stuck in the turf along the first-base line.</p><p>A duck boat drove up in front of it and, with a tow rope between the vehicles, pulled the flatbed out of the ruts.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421518406|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|70c7e5c7d7277d452743fe56c5d0678eb9602a87 -->",

        "headline":"John Lackey's revival mirrors that of the Red Sox",
        "body":"<p>When Boston Red Sox starting pitcher John Lackey left the mound in the 7th inning with a 6-1 lead <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/30/st-louis-cardinals-boston-red-sox-live\">in what turned out to be the deciding game of the 2013 World Series</a>, it was exactly what Red Sox ownership had imagined when they first signed him. What they couldn't have imagined back when they offered him a 5-year $82.5m contract in 2010, was the path it would take to get there. Where once John Lackey represented the worst of the overpaid, under-performing players on the Red Sox roster, he has become a symbol of how these Red Sox turned their fortunes around right when their home city desperately needed to root for something.</p><p>In 2010, the Red Sox were perennial championship contenders, swooping in to give Lackey one of the biggest contracts in team history seemingly simply because they could. The media guide proclaimed Lackey as part of Three Aces along with homegrown left-hander Jon Lester and 2007 ALCS MVP Josh Beckett. When that team failed to make the postseason, the Sox traded for San Diego Padres first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, giving him a seven-year, $158m extension. Then, two days after trading for Gonzalez, they signed Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Carl Crawford to a 7-year, $142m contract just to put an exclamation point on the fact that at least for once Boston, and not the rival New York Yankees, had won the offseason.</p><p>As it turns out the 2011 offseason was the last time the Sox would win for a while. The Best Red Sox Team Ever Assembled, as the hype went, <a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/sports/red_sox_mlb/clubhouse_insider/2011/09/thats_wrap_best_team_ever_suffers_worst_collapse_ever\">went through a historic September collapse</a>, falling out of the playoff mix on the last day of the season. The chief culprit was lousy starting pitching, and John Lackey became public enemy number one in Boston. The former Angels ace put up a 6.41 ERA in 2011, the worst of any Sox starter who had thrown 150 innings or more. </p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.awfulannouncing.com/2011-articles/september/is-john-lackeys-personal-life-fair-game.html\">details about Lackey's personal life began to circulate towards the end of the season</a>, Lackey's attitude both on the field, where he would become visibly upset at fielders who failed to make plays behind him, and with the media made him an easy target of ire from frustrated fans. At season's end, <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2011/10/12/red_sox_unity_dedication_dissolved_during_epic_late_season_collapse/\">reports describing a fractured clubhouse,</a> including the immortal image of Lackey and others eating fried chicken and drinking beer while their teammates were still in games, effectively turned Lackey from overpaid pitcher to season-killing villain.</p><p>The fallout was swift. The Red Sox fired manager Terry Francona, who had led the team to two World Series wins after an 86 year drought. General Manager Theo Epstein left for a higher position with the Chicago Cubs. Boston promoted assistant GM Ben Cherington who received his biggest praise when he announced that Lackey <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/7148697/boston-red-sox-john-lackey-tommy-john-surgery\">would miss the next season after undergoing Tommy John surgery</a>.</p><p>Red Sox fans didn't miss Lackey much in 2012, and Lackey didn't miss much while he was gone. Francona's replacement Bobby Valentine came in to \"change the culture\" and he did. Instead of narrowly missing the playoffs, the Red Sox finished last in the AL East and put up their worst win-loss record in decades. At least the losing made it easy to justify striking a deal that sent Gonzalez, Crawford and Beckett (and their gigantic contracts) to the suddenly cash-flush Los Angeles Dodgers.</p><p>His role as roster laxative no longer necessary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/04/boston-red-sox-bobby-valentine-fired\">the Red Sox let Valentine go</a> and Cherington began what was euphemistically called a \"rebuilding project\". His offseason acquisitions ended up being more puzzling than encouraging to skeptical fans.</p><p>Cherington signed former Phillies outfielder Shane Victorino, perceived to be a platoon player in decline, to a 3-year, $39 million contract, a move some experts tagged as the worst free agent signing of the winter. He also signed nomadic veteran Jonny Gomes despite the fact that he was more of a pinch-hitter than reliable outfielder at this point. The Sox signed strikeout-prone Mike Napoli, catcher-by-trade, to be their starting first baseman despite a degenerative hip condition bad enough to reduce his three-year contract down to a single season. Nobody much noticed the signing of Japanese relief pitcher Koji Uehara, after all the Red Sox had traded for Andrew Bailey and Joel Hanrahan in back-to-back seasons to fulfill the role of closer. The Red Sox even brought in shortstop Stephen Drew on a one-year deal, despite the fact that Boston fans disliked his older brother J.D. almost as much as they did John Lackey.</p><p>The players that returned in 2013 almost all had something to prove as well. The Red Sox brought in former pitching coach John Farrell, after two fairly regrettable years managing the Toronto Blue Jays, partly to see if he could help a struggling Jon Lester regain his ace-status. Designated Hitter David Ortiz, centerfielder Jacoby Ellsbury and starter Clay Buchholz all were question marks thanks to their recent injury histories. Daniel Nava, <a href=\"http://fullcount.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/red-sox/2010/06/12/the-sox-1-investment-in-nava-pays-off/\">the minor league player bought for a dollar who hit a grand slam off the first big league pitch he ever saw</a>, just wanted to show that he belonged in the majors. Above and beyond all that, John Lackey had to prove to a skeptical fanbase that his pitching struggles were because his arm was torn to shreds not because he was an out-of-shape beer-guzzler hated by his fielders.</p><p>Although many predicted the Red Sox would once again finish the year on the bottom of the AL East, there were some optimists out there. There were some who noted that if all of this panned out, maybe the Boston Red Sox could make one of the two Wild Card spots this season and clinch a spot in that one-game playoff. Playing without the usual attention and pressure, the Red Sox started off well, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_04_15_tbamlb_bosmlb_1&amp;mode=box&amp;c_id=bos#gid=2013_04_15_tbamlb_bosmlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=bos\">bringing their record to 8-4 after Mike Napoli hit a game-winning double to beat the Rays on the traditional early morning Patriot's Day game</a> on April 15, the day of the 2013 Boston Marathon. </p><p>Hours later, grim reality overshadowed everything <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/boston-marathon-explosions?guni=Article:in%20body%20link\">when bombs went off at the Boston Marathon</a> finish line at Boylston St, killing three and injuring over 200 others. On April 19th, the greater Boston area effectively shut down as police went on a manhunt for the surviving suspect. The Red Sox postponed that game, which was to be the first game at Fenway Park since the tragedy. The next day, with the surviving suspect in custody, a still shell-shocked city turned to Fenway <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gadX75KeyIM\">which held a solemn ceremony to honor the victims</a>.</p><p>It's easy to make too much out of how organized sports, particularly wealthy professional teams, can help the healing process or provide a temporary sense of normalcy. Still, it didn't hurt to see how the Red Sox players, many of whom were brand new to Boston, <a href=\"http://www.overthemonster.com/2013/10/31/5049800/boston-strong-world-series-2013-red-sox\">embraced the city following the attacks and their violent aftermath</a>. Maybe the coverage was a bit overblown, I'm not sure <a href=\"http://nesn.com/2013/04/red-sox-jonny-gomes-make-regional-cover-of-sports-illustrated-with-strong-headline-photos/\">if even Jonny Gomes thinks that Jonny Gomes should have been on the regional cover of Sports Illustrated,</a> and the Boston Strong slogan has probably lost all meaning outside of Massachusetts, but these things did mean something to the local communities. They still do.</p><p>It didn't hurt that this was a winning team that local fans had not seen in a while, filled with role players taking starring roles, Red Sox veterans seeking to redeem past failures and, quite frankly, a few guys nobody but the hardcore geeks knew. A few failed, but most succeeded beyond anybody's expectations. Koji Uehara had one of the best, and most fun to watch, seasons a relief pitcher has had ever. David Oritz, no longer sidelined by injury, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/30/david-ortiz-boston-red-sox-world-series\">went back to being David Ortiz</a>. Jon Lester looked more like an ace, and at least became less grumpy about home plate umpire calls. Shane Victorino abandoned switch-hitting, a key reason the Sox wanted him, and ended up being Mr. Bases Loaded during the World Series. Jonny Gomes slumped his way out of the postseason starting lineup before hitting the three-run home run that turned the entire Series around. When Mike Napoli, the converted catcher with the bad hip, wasn't nominated for a Gold Glove at first base, it was considered a snub. Daniel Nava had one of the best on-base percentages in baseball. And then there was John Lackey.</p><p>At no point during the season was John Lackey the best starting pitcher on the Red Sox. Clay Buchholz began the year on a Cy Young pace before he was hurt. Jon Lester struggled in the summer before ending the year as the Sox's undisputed number one starter. Even Felix Doubront, one of the less heralded homegrown Red Sox pitchers, had a stretch where he was all but unhittable. </p><p>Yet, it was Lackey who emerged as Boston's most consistent starter. Two years ago he was considered the biggest reason that the Red Sox collapsed but now he was the guy who kept it together. He was the guy who continued to pitch brilliantly even though a lack of run support meant he ended the regular season with a 10-13 record. He was the guy who went 3-1 in the postseason and recorded the biggest win of the entire season. He was <em>the guy</em>.</p><p>When Red Sox fans chanted \"Lackey\" on Wednesday night they weren't forgiving him so much as admitting that they had gotten Lackey wrong. John Lackey had faced some troubled times for most of his Boston career, <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22297882/29253260\">he even once flat out said \"everything in my life sucks right now\" back in the bad days of 2011</a>, but that didn't mean anything anymore. The fans now saw the side of Lackey that they could identify with, he was someone who rebounded right when things seemed the worst. Just like the 2013 Boston Red Sox. Just like Boston.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421344610|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|9671d06374a3b22a339fe012d8ecf5ef321da162 -->",

There was plenty to gush about with this ballclub, and while fans celebrated in the stands, players such as pitcher&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vine.co/v/hDFLJ2qVJ0X\">Ryan Dempster soaked in the moment.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I've been dreaming about something like this since I was a little kid so it shows you that any dream's possible, man. It can happen, it came together with a great bunch of guys, that really pull for one another - we are the World Champs it's amazing. It's amazing, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LengelDavid/status/395684151137144832\">it hasn't happened here in almost 100 years, since 1918.</a> You know, what a special moment.

Players and their families swarmed the infield at Fenway: David Ross explained what the big heavy shiny item was to his children, Shane Victorino and his wife chased down his kids who made a run for the Green Monster, all while <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaGUr6wzyT8\">Bob Marley's “Three little birds”</a>, his at-bat theme music, played on the public address system. <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/hDFL1Xj5r3n\">Even the grounds crew celebrated.</a></p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fenway Park grounds crew\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;vine-embed&quot; src=&quot;https://vine.co/v/hDFL1Xj5r3n/embed/simple&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> <p>The vaunted chemistry of this team was on display even as they celebrated after a long season during which they were supposed to be lucky to compete for a postseason spot, let alone become champions. Even the Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino was surprised by their rapid ascension from a 2012 last place finish in the American League East to World Series champions.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I didn't think we would go all this far this quickly. I didn't know. I knew we'd be better, we'd take a big step in the right direction, I didn't know how fast it would come. Ben Cherington was determined to build the next great Red Sox team and we're all proud of him.</p> </blockquote> <p>It wasn't just brass that were skeptical, fans such as Barry Johns also had major doubts about the ability of this team to come together.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We thought they were dead in the water at the end of last season and they hung together, and they never quit.

Said Sox manager John Farrell:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We couldn't have been more proud about the way they responded.

Photograph: David Lengel/The Guardian</figcaption> </figure> <p>Besides the fact that Ortiz signed a two-year $25m contract last offseason, one of the reasons he stuck around in what was a toxic environment was to try and bring back the good old days of 2004 and 2007, before the September swoon of 2011 led to the firing of manager Terry Francona and Bobby Valentine's Sox lost 93 games in 2012. Mission accomplished. For <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2011/10/jon-lester-red-sox-beer-drinking-chicken-terry-francona/1#.UnImOpRbUdA\">Jon Lester, </a>who was<a href=\"http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2011/10/12/red_sox_unity_dedication_dissolved_during_epic_late_season_collapse/?page=full\"> heavily implicated in the team's dysfunctional implosion</a>, but&nbsp;who this year won<a href=\"http://www.overthemonster.com/2013/10/30/5046074/jon-lester-free-agent-rumors-red-sox\"> two World Series games and is 4-1 with a 1.56 ERA this postseason</a>, it wasn't easy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing my Dad told me is to be accountable for <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2011/10/12/red_sox_unity_dedication_dissolved_during_epic_late_season_collapse/?page=full\">your actions</a>. I screwed up, I told everybody I screwed up, and it took awhile to get those good graces back. 2012 was obviously miserable for everybody involved. Personally, team wise, city wise, everything...you go into the offseason and bust your butt and try to right that ship and now we're 2013 World Series Champions, it's pretty awesome to say.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Red Sox c hampagne\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;vine-embed&quot; src=&quot;https://vine.co/v/hDUWpwamXz5/embed/simple&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> <p>Now the clubhouse stinks of <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/hDUWpwamXz5\">champagne and cigar smoke rather than fried chicken</a> (yes, there was some beer also), and one of the reasons is manager John Farrell, who buoyed a sinking ship and brought together a reworked team and put them in position to win.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We've talked about their characteristics. The thing that stands out, their will to win. We tried to find different ways, so many different guys contributed, players throughout out the course of the year, and we've overcome a lot of individual injuries along the way. but to be able to share this with this group that really cares for one another, it's a special night.</p> </blockquote> <p>For Farrell, his players, everyone involved with the ballclub, and of course, the Fenway faithful,&nbsp;such as Ruth&nbsp;Asadoorian, a Sox fan that was named after Babe Ruth himself:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is the most wonderful thing in the world. My Dad passed and he was a big Red Sox fan and if he was here he would just be so happy. And I've had a wonderful time, I love the Red Sox and Boston Strong!</p> </blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421351036|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|05bbc08c35d2584cd19722ebdbc3b29e19ce80d5 -->",

The Cardinals did not lose this series, the Red Sox won it. It's been a remarkable run, punctuated by tragedy, featuring key contributions from the unlikeliest places. This World Series was a great ending to what's been a exhilarating MLB Playoffs. It's been our pleasure to cover them here at the Guardian, we're so thankful to all of your who have followed along, especially everyone who contributed with tweets and emails.

I love Red Sox fans.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527181d7e4b0bde9b4af6da1\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T22:05:54.510Z\">6.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Sometimes these preambles are difficult to write. This is not the case tonight. It's really simple today: The St Louis Cardinals, fresh off <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/adventures-of-the-cardinals-six-hour-plane-delay-1454453588\">one of the most poorly timed airline delays in MLB history</a>, come into the hostile environment of Fenway Park one game away from elimination thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/28/boston-red-sox-st-louis-cardinals-live\">a 3-1 loss in game five at Busch Stadium on Monday</a>. If they beat the Boston Red Sox tonight, they force tomorrow's game seven. If the Sox beat the Cardinals, the MLB season is officially over and there will be nothing left to do but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/30/david-ortiz-boston-red-sox-world-series\">give David Ortiz his World Series MVP</a> and plan the parade routes.</p> <p>Luckily the Cardinals will have <a href=\"http://www.providencejournal.com/sports/red-sox/content/20131029-rookie-michael-wacha-stands-in-way-of-red-sox-title.ece\">rookie phenom Michael Wacha, who has yet to take a loss this postseason, on the mound tonight</a>. While winning two games in a row at Fenway is a tough task even for a team as good as St Louis, all they need is for Wacha to keep up one of the greatest runs a rookie starting pitcher has ever had in the postseason. Then there's game seven, and anything can happen in a game seven. If that sounds like a tough task, you haven't been paying attention. Meanwhile, the Red Sox will turn to <a href=\"http://www.overthemonster.com/2013/10/30/4860904/world-series-2013-john-lackey-red-sox\">The John Lackey Redemption Story</a>, who, considering the opposition, most likely will be a victim of poor run support for the 118th time this season. This game has 1-0 nail-biter written all over it, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/28/five-weird-endings-sports-events\">but given how wacky this World Series has been</a>, maybe the absolute last thing we should expect is the first thing we expect.</p> <p>This has been such a close series, one where games have been decided on errors and moments of bad judgment more than anything else, that it seems difficult to believe that it possibly could end tonight. It feels like tonight will just be a prelude for an anything-goes game seven, which is what Bud Selig, the networks and most fans (especially Cardinals fans) would love to see. The Red Sox goal tonight is to crush that dream and celebrate their first World Series win at home since 1918. </p> <p>In any case, as far as our MLB liveblogs here at the Guardian go, this could be the last time, I don't know. So we're in an &quot;all hands on deck&quot; situation just like the Cardinals (Adam Wainwright, excepted). If you want to be part of our live MLB coverage, there may not be another time this year. Email <a href=\"mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com\">Hunter.Felt.Freelance@theguardian.com</a> or tweet <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a> and we'll include your thoughts, questions and jokes throughout the night's liveblog. <a href=\"http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/preview?gameId=331030102\">It's game six of the World Series between the St Louis Cardinals and the Boston Red Sox</a>! First pitch is 8:07pm EST/12:07am GMT. We'll be back well before that with starting lineups, predictions and all the really bad puns and obscure references that I couldn't fit in to to the earlier liveblogs.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-30T22:21:00.561Z\">at 6.21pm ET</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421302763|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|16d391cb3d32068ac573fd29749ec228ef47b093 -->",

        "headline":"Boston Red Sox end 95-year wait for World Series win at Fenway Park",
        "body":"<p>The Red Sox are the World Series champions after beating the St Louis Cardinals 6-1 in Game Six in Boston.</p> <p>Everything about this surprise season was a treat for this franchise and its fans, including the way they wrapped up their third title in 10 years &ndash; on home turf. The last time Boston won a World Series at Fenway Park the year was 1918 and Babe Ruth was still a Red Sox player rather than a curse, and fans came primed to party on a cool night in the old yard.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/30/david-ortiz-boston-red-sox-world-series\">David Ortiz capped his MVP performance</a> by reaching base four times in five plate appearances, all on walks. The Cardinals didn't dare pitch to Big Papi, whose historic hitting run nearly singlehandedly saved Boston throughout the Fall Classic, and propelled their lineup all year long.&nbsp;</p> <p>The festivities began in the third inning when the home team did something the Pittsburgh Pirates, Los Angeles Dodgers and these same Red Sox couldn't do until Game Six &ndash; get to Michael Wacha.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the Cards starting pitcher uncharacteristically fighting command issues, and the Fenway crowd serenading the rookie to the tune of \"Wacha&hellip;Wacha&hellip;.\" the pitcher allowed a bases loaded double to Shane Victorino off the green monster in left field, bringing home Jacoby Ellsbury, David Ortiz and Jonny Gomes. Victorino pumped his first at second base as Fenway roared. It wouldn't be the last time the crowd would salute the Hawaiian in Game Six.&nbsp;</p> <p>Stephen Drew saved his fifth hit of the postseason for a big occasion &ndash; his home run over the bullpen in right field added to Wacha's nightmare in the fourth inning . Moments later Ellsbury nearly put another over the wall in right, settling for a double. After Dustin Pedroia flied out, Cardinals manager Mike Matheny elected to walk Ortiz, who wasn't allowed to swing his scorching hot bat. That was all for Wacha &ndash; the 22-year old pitching beyond his years had finally succumbed to Boston's bats and in the biggest of spots.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lance Lynn came on in relief and fared no better. Mike Napoli &ndash; forced to sit on the bench in the three games in St Louis, a victim of the National League rules, to allow designated hitter Ortiz to play first base &ndash;&nbsp;made up for lost time and delivered a run scoring single.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then Victorino returned to the batters-box.&nbsp;The 32-year-old had missed the previous two games with back issues, came through again, dumping a base-hit to left field, driving in his fourth run of the game. Victorino was one of the players who brought a fresh attitude to the clubhouse when the team was overhauled in the offseason after losing 93 games last season and finishing last in its division. Victorino had already become a cult hero in Boston thanks to his timely grand slam home run in Game Six of the American League Championship Series against the Tigers, elevated his status another notch, giving his team a 6-0 lead.</p> <p>From there, the game was in the hands of pitcher John Lackey.&nbsp;One of the many wonders of this Boston season is the 35-year-old hurler, a pitcher way who was way down in the Sox fan dog house after his role in the 2011 September collapse, and then out all last season after Tommy John surgery.</p> <p>Lackey's 2013 turnaround was emblematic of the changes at Fenway this season, and in the seventh inning he left to a standing ovation to the tune of Can't Take My Eyes off You by Frankie Vallie and the Four Seasons, a scene unimaginable just months ago. He deserved it, keeping the Cardinals lineup at bay for 6⅔ innings, allowing a single run despite allowing nine hits.</p> <p>When Lackey ran into trouble in the seventh inning, manager John Farrell came out to get his man, but to the fans' delight, he was rebuffed by Lackey, who won the right to face one more batter. He walked Matt Holliday to load the bases, but the steady Junichi Tazawa came on and got the hobbled Allen Craig to bounce out &ndash; the Cards biggest threat of the game was over.</p> <p>Koji Uehara, another Red Sox savior jogged to the mound to finish off the Cards and finished off Boston's seasons strong, with the three outs that brought the World Series trophy back to Fenway.</p> <p>Just one season removed from losing 93 games, the Red Sox are World Series champions. Seven months after the city was shocked by the marathon bombings, the bearded players of Boston brought a smile to the city's face.</p> <p>As Ortiz collected his MVP award he said: \"This is for you Boston. We've been through a lot this year.\"</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/30/st-louis-cardinals-boston-red-sox-live\">Red Sox 6-1 Cardinals &ndash; as it happened</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421339172|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|a9c4904c0a8bbcfae5e128bf03c3c1d9ac813553 -->",

        "headline":"David Ortiz slugs Boston Red Sox towards World Series redemption",
        "body":"<p>In a sport where reaching first base once every three at-bats is the mark of a good player, David Ortiz's stats in the 2013 World Series are astonishing. Against the St Louis Cardinals Ortiz is 11-of-15. The entire rest of the Red Sox lineup has 22 hits in 146 at-bats. </p><p>The record number of hits in any World Series is 13 and Ortiz is well on pace to pass that number. Ortiz is batting .733. His teammates a combined .151. For the stats-obsessed (and that is what this sport is) <a href=\"http://fullcount.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/red-sox/2013/10/28/closing-time-jon-lester-dominates-pitches-red-sox-within-a-win-of-a-title/\">his full line is .733/.750/1.267</a>. Those numbers would look even better <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llvL6b09LsM\">had Carlos Beltran not stolen a grand slam</a> from the slugger they call Big Papi way back in game one, one of the very few outs he has made. While the baseball world is nearly stunned at his World Series production, for those in Boston the most surprising thing about Ortiz's possibly historic run is how little it surprises anyone.</p><p>With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/29/ortiz-lester-red-sox-one-win-world-series\">Monday night's 3-1 win over the Cardinals</a>, the Red Sox put themselves up 3-2 in the seven game series, giving themselves two chances, at home in Fenway Park, to clinch their third World Series championship in a decade. Although David Ortiz was a big factor in both the 2004 and the 2007 championship runs, he might be playing an even larger role in his team's current October success. <a href=\"http://therotation.sportsonearthblog.com/biggest-papi/\">Not only is he a lock for series MVP should the Sox hold on to win</a>, at this pace Ortiz will have one of the greatest offensive performances in World Series history.</p><p>What shouldn't get lost among the hits, home runs and the intentional and semi-intentional walks is that Ortiz finally seems comfortable with having a leadership role with his team. While he's been the public face of the franchise since that first championship run in 2004, filling a void that opened up when GM Theo Epstein traded iconic shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and Pedro Martinez left for the New York Mets during the offseason, Ortiz was never a leader quite in the same way as catcher Jason Varitek or second baseman Dustin Pedroia.  </p><p>Ortiz, of course, has long been a prominent voice in the clubhouse thanks to his longevity, likable personality and his unimpeachable production. Destroying Yankees pitching in the 2004 American League Championship Series and setting the Red Sox single-season home run record in 2006 will buy a player a lot of success. Still, fans heard less about his influence inside the clubhouse and more about his quixotic attempts to reverse scoring decisions or his twice-a-season complaints about his seemingly always-in-the-air contract situation, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/7958209/david-ortiz-blasts-notion-not-leader-boston-red-sox\">stories that revealed a certain amount of insecurity on his part</a>. Despite his growing Boston legacy, Ortiz has never forgotten how the Minnesota Twins outright cut him in order to save a little money.</p><p>Maybe some of this was just a function of the fundamental loneliness inherent in the Designated Hitter position (batting instead of the pitcher and not fielding), a role that requires you to watch the rest of your teammates take the field while you sit alone with only your numbers for company. Still, it stung him when the media criticized him for not doing more to prevent the fracturing of the Red Sox clubhouse during their 2011 September collapse, and, like nearly all sentient lifeforms, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/8940920/spring-training-2013-david-ortiz-blames-bobby-valentine-problems-2012-boston-red-sox\">he ran into issues with Bobby Valentine</a> in his lone season as the manager of the Red Sox.</p><p>Perhaps it's because he realizes he's the only player still on the roster who was here the last time the Red Sox and Cardinals met in the World Series, but he has never embraced his role as a veteran quite like this before. Should the Sox hold on, not at all a given considering how difficult the St Louis Cardinals are to finish off, fans might not point out a big hit or key play as the turning point of the series. Instead the lasting image might just be <a href=\"http://www.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/red-sox/rob-bradford/2013/10/28/david-ortiz-words-lead-big-red-sox-actions\">David Ortiz holding an impromptu meeting in the dugout in the sixth inning of game four</a>, while the Red Sox were struggling against Cardinals pitcher Lance Lynn. </p><p>Although the details of what was actually said remain in the dugout for now, it at least looked like it lit a spark underneath the team. Shortly thereafter, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/27/boston-red-sox-st-louis-cardinals-live\">Jonny Gomes hit a three-run blast that gave the Red Sox a lead they would never relinquish</a>. Objectively there is almost certainly no correlation between Ortiz's speech and Gomes hitting a home run there, but this is where, if you're a Red Sox fan it's almost impossible not to leave behind the world of the rational and enter the world of faith. There's a part of us, the same part of us that designates certain articles of clothing as being lucky and convinces us never to utter the phrase \"no-hitter\" until the last out is recorded, that believes Ortiz somehow said the right combination of words that inspired Gomes to hit a home run rather than, say, strike out or hit a lazy flyball. There's something about David Ortiz and his uncanny ability to come through at the unlikeliest of times that makes us want to believe.</p><p>Perhaps it's this faith that creates the double consciousness that exists in the minds of most Red Sox fans regarding Ortiz and performance enhancing drugs. Ortiz's name, after all, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/31/sports/baseball/31doping.html?_r=2&amp;ref=sports&amp;\">did appear on a document leaked to the New York Times that listed Ortiz as among those who failed what was supposed to be an anonymous test for PEDs back in 2003</a>. Ortiz denied knowingly taking any banned substances, pleaded ignorance to what it could have been and promised to get \"to the bottom of the matter\". That was essentially the last time the public heard from Ortiz about the subject.</p><p>Unlike many other ballplayers whose reputations have been shattered because of PED allegations (Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Ortiz's Red Sox teammate Manny Ramirez etc), the likable Ortiz has received something close to a pass from fans and the media (although, obviously, not from fans of others teams). While most probably suspect there's something to the allegations, it hasn't much changed how they view him beyond some speculation about Ortiz's resurgence over the last few years after a period of apparent decline.</p><p>Now, Ortiz might be innocent, or might be tainted like Bonds and Rodriguez, but even if he were guilty, it's not entirely certain that it would matter much in Boston. No other Boston athlete, with the possible exception of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, has made Boston sports fans happier than Ortiz has during his long Red Sox career. What he's given them isn't something like the Home Run Chase between McGwire and Sosa, which was retroactively cheapened by later revelations or Barry Bonds' quest to beat Hank Aaron's home run record, which was an utterly joyless pursuit even at the time.</p><p>When the Red Sox were down 0-3 to the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series, Ortiz hit two walk-offs in two consecutive games to bring the series back to New York. After Boston beat New York, David Ortiz hit a home run in the first game of the World Series, and the St Louis Cardinals never had a series lead from that point on. In 2005 he carried a flawed team single-handedly into the postseason. In 2006 he set the Red Sox home run record while getting more walk-off hits than some Hall of Famers hit in their entire careers. In 2007 he helped the Sox win their second World Series title of the 21st century, ensuring that there wouldn't be another 86 year gap. We could argue that the numbers aren't real, <a href=\"http://feelingsarentnumbers.wordpress.com/\">but, as Steve McPherson would put it, feelings aren't numbers</a>. You can't put an asterisk on joy.</p><p><em></em><br />So we watch as Ortiz puts up cartoonish numbers on the biggest stage in baseball and we mute that skeptical voice in the back of our minds. In any case, Ortiz's true great moment this season had nothing to do with stats, wins or dramatic flourishes. While hitting .733 in the World Series is astonishing to the point of absurdity, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7QR7ztZWlU\">and his grand slam against the Detroit Tigers in this year's ALCS</a> might be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/oct/27/world-series-umpires-obstruction-call-cardinals-red-sox-video\">the biggest moment of the entire playoffs that didn't involve umpiring</a>, nothing will top that first Red Sox home game after the manhunt for the Marathon bombing suspects shut down much of greater Boston. Any reservations about Ortiz's local legacy were put to rest when he grabbed the microphone at Fenway Park and announced \"This is our fucking city!\" It was a cathartic moment for a city in desperate need for someone, anyone, to lift our spirits.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421172191|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|61544e4fb8c1af24d67189c8c3f53af3d5c81c3d -->",

        "body":"<p>With the Wild Card games settled, we look at the match-ups in the best-of-five American and National League Divisional Series. The winners will head to the Championship series and from there hope to go to the World Series.</p><h2>NLDS: Los Angeles Dodgers vs Atlanta Braves</h2><p><strong>LA Dodgers </strong></p><p>For two hours last Friday the Dodgers were National League Champions, that is until whoever runs their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Dodgers\">Facebook page dialed back that honor</a> to NL West champs. So the expectations in Los Angeles are clear, at least in their social media department. Of course, that little miscue preceded the news that <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/dodgers/la-sp-0930-dodgers-matt-kemp-20130930,0,2853477.story\">Matt Kemp would miss the playoffs</a> with lingering ankle issues, and that Andre Ethier, who also has a bad ankle, could be relegated to pinch-hitting duty, if he even makes the roster at all. <a href=\"http://www.lawas.com/sports/baseball/mlb/dodgers/la-sp-1001-dodgers-mattingly-20131001,0,5845181.story\">Manager Don Mattingly</a> seems confident with the likes of Yasiel Puig, Adrian Gonzalez, Hanley Ramirez and Carl Crawford still at his disposal, but fact is, removing those bats from the lineup changes the way Braves pitchers will approach Dodger hitters, which is much more aggressively. Even if Kemp was on the sidelines when <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9749807/five-nlds-questions-los-angeles-dodgers-atlanta-braves\">LA ran up a 42-8 mid-season run</a>, now the stuff of legend, the Dodgers now have to face an extremely tough Braves pitching staff with a thinner roster offensively. Now, you never apologise for wins in MLB or in any league, but during that torrid stretch of 50 games, just 16 were against winning teams. Yes, they were 13-3 in those contests, but naturally, the team has slowed down somewhat since then, and now they have to face a team that beat them in five out of seven this season. Is that a problem with these injury issues? Well, thanks to <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/story/_/id/9760838/atlanta-braves-ace-kris-medlen-says-clayton-kershaw-missed-us\">Clayton Kershaw</a> and his ridiculously low 1.83 ERA, along with his sidekick Zack Grienke, not to mention Hyun-jin Ryu, Ricky Nolasco and closer-with-cutter Kenley Jansen, no, not really - even if the offense is making headlines now, LA are still very much about the pitching, which is likely enough to get them to the NLCS.</p><p><strong>Atlanta Braves</strong></p><p>There is a reason that the Braves have gotten <a href=\"http://www.guampdn.com/usatoday/article/2913015&amp;usatref=sportsmod\">little respect</a> around baseball despite winning 96 games and cruising to a National League East title by 10 games. Over the years, the Braves have made a habit of not fulfilling postseason expectations. So now that there really aren't any, one can imagine Atlanta finding their way back to the World Series for the first time since 1999. That would be really something, because in the run up to the NLDS, much the focus was on where their all-star soon-to-be-free-agent catcher Brian McCann will land after the season, and whether or not manager Fredi Gonzalez would bench his two $13m players - B.J. Upton and Dan Uggla <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/jeff-schultz/2013/oct/01/report-braves-may-bench-uggla-dodgers-series/\">(Uggla was left off the roster)</a>, that finished the season with batting averages under .200. Still, this has been the case all season long, and that didn't keep the Braves bats from thriving thanks to their home run power. No NL team has hit more long balls than Atlanta - four players have over 20, including Justin Upton, B.J.'s brother who has 27. If you're a Braves fan concerned about Dodger pitching, it's because your team isn't great at getting on base, and that could be a problem against a stingy LA staff. The Braves have a few arms of their own, even without Tim Hudson who is out for the season with ankle surgery. Mike Minor, Julio Teheran and <a href=\"http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130930&amp;content_id=62249302&amp;vkey=pr_atl&amp;c_id=atl\">Kris Medlen, the NL pitcher of September</a> who will face Kershaw in Game One, are a trio of above average starters, and the bullpen, anchored by Craig Kimbrel is absolutely air tight. Overall, it adds up to the lowest staff ERA in baseball, and you would never know it with all the talk of Clayton Kershaw and Zack Grienke. If the Dodgers are to sneak by Atlanta, it won't come easy.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Dodgers in five</p><h2>NLDS: Pittsburgh Pirates vs St Louis Cardinals</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419634621'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/2/1380739661903/7841b8a9-d840-4ce9-875c-136c15c714fc-460x276.jpeg' alt='Can the Pittsburgh Pirates win their first World Series title since 1979?' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Can the Pittsburgh Pirates win their first World Series title since 1979? Photograph: Justin K. Aller/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><em></em><br /><strong>Pittsburgh Pirates</strong></p><p>There's no need to question whether or not these Pirates can perform in the playoffs - we've already seen what they can do, which judging by their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/01/mlb-playoffs-cincinnati-reds-vs-pittsburgh-pirates-live\">trouncing of Cincinnati in the Wild Card game</a>, is an awful lot. Pittsburgh seem intent on making the most of their first postseason appearance since 1992, and already have the look of a team ripe for a run. Can they beat St Louis? Well, there's no doubt that's a tougher order than ousting the Reds, but many in Pittsburgh point to their beating the Redbirds in four of five games at PNC Park back in July as a point when Bucs fans started to believe this season was more about October and less about finishing .500. However, if we're going down that road, it must be mentioned that the Cards laid down the law in early September, outscoring Pittsburgh <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/PIT/2013-schedule-scores.shtml\">26-10 in a series sweep</a> that put St Louis ahead in the NL Central standings for good. </p><p>Overall, the Bucs won the season series 10-9 despite scoring two fewer runs. In 2013, Pittsburgh pitchers allowed 4.57 runs per game to the Cards, and 3.42 runs a game to everyone else - certainly cause for concern. However, their questionable offense actually scored more against St Louis' arms, scoring 4.47 runs per game compared with what they did against everyone else - 3.83 runs per game. In short, this series will be a war, and if you're in the great pitching beats great hitting camp, then the Pirates, with Gerrit Cole, Francisco Liriano, Jeff Locke, A.J. Burnett, who faces Adam Wainwright in Game One, and that shark tank of a bullpen, are your team here, especially when you consider the Redbirds bats were <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/split.cgi?t=b&amp;team=STL&amp;year=2013\">somewhat cooler in the second half.</a></p><p><strong>St Louis Cardinals</strong></p><p>Considering the success the Cardinals have had recently, two World Series titles, three National League pennants and seven playoff appearances in ten seasons, you may be surprised to learn that their 97 victories represents their highest win total since 2005. And while their bats get most of the publicity, St Louis pitchers have allowed the<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/\"> fewest amount of runs since, wait for it...1985!</a> So, losing starting pitcher <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/sports/baseball/professional/chris-carpenter-not-eyeing/article_65facfb9-d426-52c1-b260-254e919568b5.html\">Chris Carpenter, again</a>, another starter in Jaime Garcia and closer Jason Motte to major injuries doesn't seem to make any difference, and that's just the way it works in St Louis. Nearly everything this franchise does turns to gold, and that includes rookie pitchers such as Shelby Miller and Michael Wacha making major contributions, not to mention what lefty Kevin Siegrist has done out of the pen - a 0.45 ERA - the lowest by a lefty reliever with at least 35 innings pitched in the majors since 1876, according to STATS LLC. And don't forget about the reclamation of former Brewers closer John Axford who has bounced back in 13 appearances since landing in St Louis. Ace Adam Wainwright continues to lead the way and will make the first start against Pittsburgh. If there is an Achilles heel it's the closer position -<a href=\"http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/02/demoted-closer-edward-mujica-makes-cardinals-playoff-roster/\"> Edward Mujica fell off the table in September</a> and Trevor Rosenthal has been working the ninth inning as of late - I'm sure this will work out just fine, as usual. Their bats led the league in runs despite finishing third to last in the NL in home runs - instead, they double you to death, racking up over 300 two-baggers this season, Yadier Molina and Matt Carpenter in particular. The downside? <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/cardinals/2013/09/27/allen-craig-cardinals-out-playoffs-lisfranc-fracture/2886079/\">First baseman Allen Craig,</a> amongst the most productive Cards is out for at least the NLDS with a sprained foot. Not to worry, Matt Adams of the <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/adamsma01.shtml\">baseball factory that is Western Pennsylvania</a> is there to save the day, and he's hit the third most homers for St Louis this season...off the bench. So speaking of bench play, that will no doubt be affected now that Adams is playing at first - score that as a negative for their offense, that and how poorly they hit left handed pitching. Can they handle the Pirates? Definitely, but this one is way too close to call, but I guess I have no choice....</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Pirates in five</p><h2>ALDS: Oakland Athletics vs Detroit Tigers</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419634622'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380782722935/6ff201f0-8cca-4d52-ad46-e2fb4d6e8e27-460x276.jpeg' alt='The Oakland A's won the American League West for the second consecutive season.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Oakland A's won the American League West for the second consecutive season. Photograph: Beck Diefenbach/AP</figcaption></figure><p><em></em><br /><strong>Oakland A's</strong></p><p>We know about the Oakland A's economic miracle, their smelly, <a href=\"http://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/1200*675/coliseum-sewage.jpg\">turd ridden stadium</a> they've been trying to escape for years. We know that few fans go to the games, but that the ones that do provide as colorful atmosphere as you'll ever see. We've <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/\">seen the film</a>, read the book and lauded the General Manager, Billy Beane, for years. It's time to win something.</p><p>This will be the seventh time a Beane club has made it to the postseason, and they've made it to the American League Championship Series exactly once. If their GM Beane says the postseason \"is a crapshoot\" perhaps this is lucky seven for a team with exactly one household name in their lineup, and that's only because he <a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MacYHpAoDks/TlYsMeDagNI/AAAAAAAADlw/gewir0wzBFQ/s400/CocoCrispPuffs.jpg\">shares it with a breakfast cereal</a> (that's probably not fair to Yoenis Cespedes). If you don't know MVP candidate Josh Donaldson, Brandon Moss, Jed Lowrie and the Oakland A's bats then <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/OAK/2013-batting.shtml\">I'd advise you to look here and check out one of the most dynamic groups in the game</a> - what they lack in recognizable names they more than make up for in production. Their pitching is the best in the American League, somewhat hilariously led by a <a href=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.mandatory.com/media/2013/08/bartolo-colon-steroids.jpg\">40-year-old 18 game winner, Bartolo Colon</a> and their Aussie closer, Grant Balfour, who has blown three saves all season. The A's won 94 games last season and 96 games this year. They are not a cute little overachieving joke, rather, they're serious contenders for a World Series title - if they beat Detroit, which is completely possible, <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2013/10/detroit_tigers_jim_leyland_on_46.html\">even if they don't steal signs</a>, no one should act surprised.</p><p><strong>Detroit Tigers</strong></p><p>Despite having their best team since winning their last World Series title in 1984, the Detroit Tigers <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/athletics/ci_24227032/detroit-tigers-have-lost-their-bite-since-playing\">will begin the playoffs on the road</a> for the third consecutive year, heading out to Oakland where they fell to an 0-2 ALDS deficit a season ago before ousting the A's. Jim Leyland convinced Justin Verlander to be the second starter but he probably needed to drop one more slot - <a href=\"http://motorcitybengals.com/2013/10/01/case-anibal-sanchez-detroit-tigers-number-1-playoff-starter/\">Anibal Sanchez</a> has been the 1b to 1a, 21-game winner Max Scherzer this season, but Verlander is Verlander, and if he pitches like Verlander it won't matter. </p><p>But don't worry about their starters, or their offense, which with the best hitter on the planet in Miguel Cabrera (<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/9760412/2013-mlb-playoffs-miguel-cabrera-detroit-tigers-playing-lot-pain-jim-leyland-says\">look what he does when he is hurt</a>) making life cushy for Prince Fielder and everyone else is just fine. No, it's the bullpen that needs to get their act together, fast, after posting a 4.98 ERA in September. That won't work in October, and Drew Smyly and closer Joaquin Benoit need help. Bruce Rondon could fill that need - he's lowered his ERA more than two runs since late July.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting Tigers storyline coming into the postseason is the <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2013/10/01/jhonny-peralta-detroit-tigers-playoff-roster-oakland-as-alds/2905781/\">Jhonny Peralta experiment </a>- back from a 50-game PED suspension, the shortstop, who has been unseated by Jose Iglesias, has been playing in left field - October isn't usually the best time for experiments, just one reason for the forecasting below. </p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Athletics in five</p><h2>ALDS: Tampa Bay Rays vs Boston Red Sox</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419634623'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380782992064/a786ab7d-0279-48bd-be72-e5cfcd5e9af8-460x276.jpeg' alt='The Boston Red Sox are back in the playoffs for the first time since the 2009 season.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Boston Red Sox are back in the playoffs for the first time since the 2009 season. Photograph: Charles Krupa/AP</figcaption></figure><p><em></em><br /><strong>Tampa Bay Rays</strong></p><p>On Wednesday, the Rays beat the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/mlb-playoffs-tampa-bay-rays-vs-cleveland-indians-live\">Indians 4-0 in the American League Wild Card game</a>, and to some, that will represent an enormous disappointment. Who besides Rays and Red Sox fans didn't want to see Terry Francona in the visitors dugout at Fenway Park, primed to stick it to his old bosses, ready to <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rcnu6cz-VMo/Ubx_tLtjO4I/AAAAAAAABaY/O8TGhvHzeik/s1600/Natural+(1984)+18.jpg\">crush the dreams of ungrateful souls in dark offices</a>. That's a big fat juicy steak right there, that's what we wanted. Instead, we get to watch one of the best-run franchises in the history of baseball take on the Sox in the ALDS. Whatever. I wanted Tito In Boston.</p><p>That's negative though right? Look at the bright side you say? Fine. Cleveland are out, and that means that some of us baseball fans out there can finally breathe a bit easier. Remember - the Tribe weren't just a team, they were a formula. \"See what you can do with a few middle of the road free agents,\" said GM's around the league. \"We don't need the big star, we can just load up on Michael Bourns and Nick Swishers, kick the crap out of the bottom feeders, catch a few breaks and make the playoffs - I love it.\" You could hear the murmurs of a new \"Indians\" way, in places like Queens, New York. A filthy, dangerous ideology, ready to set some sheepish organizations back years, maybe even decades. We can only hope Cleveland's loss represents a setback to such thinking.</p><p>And so the Rays, a band of barnstormers who have bounced around the country cheating death reach their latest stop - Boston, where Tampa will finally be able to lose a game and not go home (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/mlb-playoffs-tampa-bay-rays-vs-cleveland-indians-live\">having won two consecutive one-off playoffs</a>). The champagne infused Rays are on a roll, and they are in their sixth city in nine days, basically because of four players - David Price, Alex Cobb, Evan Longoria and Delmon Young, who hit his ninth postseason home run on Wednesday in Cleveland. That's nice and all, but that's not nearly enough, and so there is absolutely no way this Tampa team can begin to compete with a Boston powerhouse that beat them in seven out of 12 contests this season. I mean, they had four hits against Cleveland's Danny Salazar - what are they going to get off Clay Buchholz? </p><p><strong>Boston Red Sox</strong></p><p>How much damage was done to the relationship between the Red Sox organization and their fans during the September of 2011 nightmare and the horror show 93 loss season of 2012? Enough that the Nation have been slow to embrace a team of scrappy rough and tumble hard working bearded ballplayers that won 97 games and crushed opponents with their relentless offense. Attendance dropped for the first time in several seasons, businesses with tickets had trouble giving them away and perhaps most incredibly, on September 18th, the Sox sold tickets for $1 to fans wearing a beard - real or painted. It wasn't long ago that the team was boasting of a <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/9158007/boston-red-sox-820-game-sellout-streak-ends\">controversial sell-out streak,</a> one that continued despite empty seats last season, one of many controversies that dogged an ownership that brought them Bobby Valentine and mega doses of ill will. No wonder their brass has spent most of the season out of sight as they worked behind the scenes to repair their bond with Red Sox Nation.</p><p>Expect the bus to fill up fast now that the playoffs are here, now that the best team in the American League look set to take center stage in their bid for a third World Series title in nine seasons. Yes, a season after nearly everything went wrong in Boston, nearly everything has gone right. John Farrell was the manager everybody wanted, <a href=\"http://www.overthemonster.com/2013/10/2/4793158/red-sox-mvp-debate-david-ortiz\">David Ortiz was an elite power threat at age 37</a>, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/9757214/jacoby-ellsbury-quick-learner-craft-stealing-bases\">Jacoby Ellsbury played over 130 games</a>, Jarrod Saltalamacchia enjoyed a breakout season, new acquisitions, Mike Napoli, Johnny Gomes, Stephen Drew and Shane Victorino were productive inside a revamped lineup. The pitching staff trimmed their ERA by just under a run from the 2012 team, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/9760876/2013-mlb-playoffs-jon-lester-boston-red-sox-start-game-1-alds\">Game One starter</a> Jon Lester turned that trick by over a run. John Lackey revamped his game and his reputation, Clay Buchholz pitched like an ace and is back from injury in time for the playoffs, while the bullpen recovered from losing three stalwarts as <a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/sports/red_sox_mlb/boston_red_sox/2013/10/wit_makes_closer_koji_uehara_a_clubhouse_hit\">Koji Uehara became an elite closer</a> with a WHIP of 0.56 - that is not a misprint.</p><p>That's a whole lot of good right there, and throw in the fact that they're as tight-knit group with tremendous team chemistry and you've got quite a ballclub. Weaknesses? Well, after Buchholz, they don't really have a shutdown starter like a Zack Greinke for example (few in the AL do this season), but they are deep, and with their offense, I'm not sure it really matters. They should handle any of those pesky wild card teams, and match-up well against Detroit or Oakland.</p><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Red Sox in four</p><h2><a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/schedule/ps.jsp\">MLB playoffs schedule</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418927187|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|26e6ea51d760228518ccdfd2b0e96c9db9cfd1a7 -->",

The manner in which confidential information was so freely exchanged is not only a threat to the success and credibility of our jointly administered program; it calls into question the level of trust required to administer such a program.

We also recognize and respect the appeals process. Until the process under the Drug Program is complete we will have no comment. We are confident that the process outlined in the Drug Program will result in appropriate resolution of this matter. In the meantime, the Yankees remain focused on playing baseball. However, we are compelled to address certain reckless and false allegations concerning the Yankees' role in this matter. The New York Yankees in no way instituted and/or assisted MLB in the direction of this investigation; or used the investigation as an attempt to avoid responsibilities under a player contract; or did its medical staff fail to provide the appropriate standard of care to Alex Rodriguez. Separately, we are dissapointed with the news today of the suspension of Francisco Cervelli. It's clear that he used bad judgement.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-05T20:56:22.293+01:00\">at 3.56pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-520000c8e4b089ae4c3594be\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-05T20:45:12.874+01:00\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">A-Rod suspension</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Rodriguez' suspension begins on Thursday and he is expected to appeal. There would be a hearing within 20 days where A-Rod will challenge MLB's findings. Then&nbsp;Fredric Horowitz, baseball's arbitrator, will have 25 games to come to his judgement. So the A-Rod show will be a long, drawn out process that should have plenty of twists and turns, which we are used to seeing with A-Rod.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51ffffbae4b06a6a19e0b7c2\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-05T20:40:43.187+01:00\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tonight</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So all of this means that the A-Rod show is on in Chicago where a turn-back-the-clock Bronx Zoo atmosphere takes shape in the Midwest. Unless he is deemed unhealthy, he will be in the lineup against the White Sox, who should have nothing less than a monstrous walk up crowd drawn by the bizarre situation.

Here it is in full:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Major League Baseball has worked diligently with the Players Association for more than a decade to make our Joint Drug Program the best in all of professional sports. I am proud of the comprehensive nature of our efforts - not only with regard to random testing, groundbreaking blood testing for human Growth Hormone and one of the most significant longitudinal profiling programs in the world, but also our investigative capabilities, which proved vital to the Biogenesis case. Upon learning that players were linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs, we vigorously pursued evidence that linked those individuals to violations of our Program. We conducted a thorough, aggressive investigation guided by facts so that we could justly enforce our rules.</p> <p>Despite the challenges this situation has created during a great season on the field, we pursued this matter because it was not only the right thing to do, but the only thing to do. For weeks, I have noted the many players throughout the game who have strongly voiced their support on this issue, and I thank them for it. I appreciate the unwavering support of our owners and club personnel, who share my ardent desire to address this situation appropriately. I am also grateful to the Professional Baseball Athletic Trainers Society and our club physicians, who were instrumental in the banning of amphetamines and whose expertise remains invaluable to me. As an institution, we have made unprecedented strides together.</p> <p>It is important to point out that 16,000 total urine and blood tests were conducted on players worldwide under MLB Drug Programs in 2012. With the important additions of the hGH testing and longitudinal profiling this season, we are more confident than ever in the effectiveness of the testing program. Those players who have violated the Program have created scrutiny for the vast majority of our players, who play the game the right way.</p> <p>This case resoundingly illustrates that the strength of our Program is not limited only to testing. We continue to attack this issue on every front - from science and research, to education and awareness, to fact-finding and investigative skills. Major League Baseball is proud of the enormous progress we have made, and we look forward to working with the players to make the penalties for violations of the Drug Program even more stringent and a stronger deterrent.</p> <p>As a social institution with enormous social responsibilities, Baseball must do everything it can to maintain integrity, fairness and a level playing field. We are committed to working together with players to reiterate that performance-enhancing drugs will not be tolerated in our game.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-05T20:59:44.365+01:00\">at 3.59pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-51fffa42e4b089ae4c3594bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-05T20:17:22.621+01:00\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Alex Rodriguez</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Alex Rodriguez' suspension is 211 games, a suspension that includes the postseason for 2013 and 2014 and does not start immediately, presumably procedural move, and he will now almost definitely play tonight vs the Chicago White Sox.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-51fff994e4b089ae4c3594bc\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-05T20:14:28.472+01:00\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">50 games</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>All players except for Alex Rodriguez will serve 50 game suspensions.</p> <p>They agreed to accept them without appeal and will begin serving those suspensions immediately.

        "headline":"Alex Rodriguez can only play waiting game as MLB suspension looms",
        "body":"<p>The New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez faces an uncertain future after wrapping up a two-game rehab stint in Trenton, New Jersey with the team's AA affiliate. On Saturday, several sources revealed that the embattled slugger is facing a 214-game suspension from Major League Baseball, starting on Monday, for his part in the performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) scandal surrounding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/10/biogenesis-yankees-rodriguez-brewers-braun-suspensions\">Biogenesis of America, a now defunct Florida based anti-aging clinic that allegedly supplied PEDs to several MLB players</a>. </p><p>According to the Associated Press, Major League Baseball has informed the Yankees that Alex Rodriguez will be suspended on Monday but can play while he appeals the penalty.</p><p>The Yankees were not told the exact length of the suspension, but were left under the impression it will be through the 2014 season, according to AP. Rodriguez could get a shorter penalty for violating baseball's drug agreement if he gives up the right to file a grievance and force the case before an arbitrator, according to the source.</p><p>MLB planned an announcement at noon EDT Monday.</p><p>Yankees manager Joe Girardi said: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I think all of us are curious what's going to happen, and is Alex going to be a player for us Monday, and what's going to happen with the other guys that are involved in this?\"</p></blockquote><p>He added: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"[But] in my mind I have him penciled in there tomorrow...That's just a term. None of us use pencils or pens. We type.\"</p></blockquote><p>Rodriguez, who has been recovering from offseason hip surgery and who stands to lose more than $35m on the remaining portion of his contract should the reported suspension be carried out, has a team of lawyers working to battle the office of the commissioner on any penalties, despite MLBPA union head Michael Weiner reaching out to baseball's brass to try to hammer out a late deal on Saturday, an offer that was rejected by the sport's ruling body. <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/jon-heyman/22991274/gap-still-exists-in-arod-mlb-biogenesis-talks\">CBSsports.com</a> reported that A-Rod would be willing to accept a suspension of around 100 games \"if that.\" </p><p>Any chance of a lessor suspension seemed to be off the table following Rodriguez's comments on Friday night after his game with Trenton, which were said to have infuriated the MLB commissioner, Bud Selig. Rodriguez said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I think it is pretty self-explanatory. I think that is the pink elephant in the room. I think we all want to get rid of PEDs. That's a must. All the players, we feel that way. But when all this stuff is going on in the background and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract and stuff like that, I think that is concerning to me. It's concerning to present players and I think it should be concerning to future players, as well.</p></blockquote><p>Rodriguez' comments suggest that the Yankees are working behind the scenes with MLB to get out of the roughly $95m still owed on his contract, which expires after the 2017 season. A-Rod added:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There are a lot of layers. I will say this: there is more than one party that benefits from me not being on the field. It's not my team-mates and not the Yankees fans … it's not time for me to hang it up. I have a lot more left in me. I will keep fighting.</p></blockquote><p>The big show in Trenton continued on Saturday, when Rodriguez suited up for what could be his last game for some time. Much more tensely, he responded to rumors of the 214-game suspension, saying:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I've been on the field for the last five and a half hours, I haven't heard anything. My focus is to play baseball. I was excited to be playing tonight and even more excited about Monday. I can't wait to see my team-mates. I feel like I can help us win and be a better team and I haven't seen a lot of my brothers in a long time.</p></blockquote><p>So Rodriguez will work out today before heading to Chicago to join the Yankees. He may be in Chicago, but whether or not he will be in the lineup on Monday against the White Sox is the big question. </p><p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/9535752/alex-rodriguez-likely-suspended-2014-season-monday-according-sources?src=mobile\">On Saturday, ESPN's Outside the Lines program</a> pointed out that: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Clause 7G of the Joint Drug agreement that states that PED users can 'only' be hit with a 50-game suspension. Rodriguez has never failed a drug test. </p></blockquote><p>A suspension of that type can be appealed, which would allow Rodriguez to play on Monday. In fact, however long the suspension is – and it would be based on the type of non-analytical evidence that led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/23/ryan-braun-brewers-suspended-ped-drugs\">Ryan Braun's 65-game suspension in late July</a>, rather than a positive test – A-Rod will be able to appeal unless the commissioner uses the \"best interests in baseball clause\", a broad and sweeping power that can be used to ban Rodriguez from the game. That sentence does not allow an appeal and it would keep him off the field on Monday. Baseball does not want A-Rod on the field while other players who receive and accept suspensions on Monday are serving theirs. Monday is also the last day on which a 50-game suspension will not bleed into the 2014 season. Any appeals will land at the feet of baseball's new arbitrator, Frederic Horowitz. </p><p>With all the positive steps baseball has taken to rid the game of PEDs, it is not impossible to imagine a situation in which some players, the players' union and some fans turn against the league – should Rodriguez receive a life ban without evidence of wrongdoing (of which there is said to be \"volumes\") being presented publicly. The charges against him include recruiting other players to the Biogenesis clinic, attempting to obstruct MLB's investigation, and failing to be truthful with MLB in the past. On Saturday, Rodriguez also said \"when the time is right, I'll tell my full story.\"</p><p>It has been a chaotic week of rumors and delays in the handing down of suspensions, but if the latest such rumors are to be believed, the accused players must let MLB know if they intend to accept their penalties on Sunday night; the formal announcements will follow on Monday.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414318275|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|521e769bac072bffba5434205623b92f32442cc9 -->",

        "body":"<h2>The Big Picture</h2><p>When <a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/specialReports/tony-bosch-and-biogenesis-mlb-steroid-scandal-3698782/\">the Miami New Times broke the story in late January</a> that Biogenesis, an anti-aging clinic in South Florida, had supplied human growth hormone and other performance-enhancing drugs to several high-profile players, Major League Baseball got hit with major league scandal.  Among the names in Biogenesis' records were former MVPs Alex Rodriguez and Ryan Braun, as well as sluggers Nelson Cruz and Melky Cabrera. In July, after an extensive investigation (with which Biogenesis founder Tony Bosch cooperated), MLB suspended Braun for the remainder of the 2013 season. Many more suspensions are expected to follow soon. Will this be the PED scandal that finally cleans up baseball? Even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose\">Pete Rose</a> wouldn't bet on that.</p><h2>The Steroid Era</h2><p>Although professional baseball can trace performance-enhancing substances back to the 1880s (when Pud Galvin downed a monkey testicle elixir), the game's historians consider the late 1980s as the beginning of the steroid era. Since then, dozens of the sport's biggest names—including Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, and Roger Clemens—have admitted (or been implicated in) juicing scandals and many of baseball's most hallowed records are tainted because of drug use. Former Oakland A's outfielder Jose Canseco even estimated that \"80 percent of the players\" in his era were using steroids.</p><h2>Biogenesis</h2><p>The Biogenesis scandal would have never become news if Porter Fischer, a former employee of the clinic (which closed in late 2012), had not turned over boxes of documents to the Miami New Times in 2013. While the handwritten records did not definitively connect baseball players to drug use—athletes were often referred to by nicknames—MLB took the allegations seriously and purchased the records. The league then sued founder Tony Bosch and eventually reached a deal with him to cooperate with its investigation. According to whistleblower Fischer, the number of athletes linked to Biogenesis extends far beyond what has been reported. \"In just the four years that I know, it's got to be well over a hundred, easy,\" he told ESPN's Outside the Lines. \"It's almost scary to think about how many people have gone through [Bosch's clinic] and how long he's gotten away with this.\" Fischer told ESPN that athletes from the NBA, boxing, tennis, and MMA had also received drugs from Biogenesis. So far, only baseball has investigated those claims.</p><h2>Crime and Punishments</h2><p>As MLB prepared its punishments, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami opened a federal probe of Biogenesis. The government is interviewing Porter Fischer and investigating whether the clinic sold controlled substances to high school students in addition to baseball players. It is unlikely any athletes would be prosecuted, even if they knowingly purchased controlled substances from the clinic, but when it comes to Tony Bosch, the feds are playing hardball.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414232480|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|e6b184646813b26c681973becb61aae1703745cf -->",

        "body":"<p>Major League Baseball is preparing to hand out suspensions to those involved in the performance-enhancing drugs scandal surrounding the Biogenesis clinic some time after the All-Star break, according to<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9464246/ryan-braun-refused-answer-mlb-questions-biogenesis-clinic-sources-say\"> TJ Quinn and Mike Fish of ESPN's Outside the Lines.</a><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/i-team/mlb-meeting-a-rod-suspensions-loom-article-1.1394132\"> The New York Daily News</a> added that that Ryan Braun met with baseball officials on 29 June and refused to answer questions, a similar tactic, according to sources, to that used by the 10 players under suspicion who have faced similar questioning. Alex Rodriguez is expected to visit Friday – though that was not acknowledged by the Yankees third baseman on Tuesday: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Not that I know of, and if I knew, I couldn't share with you guys. We've been fully instructed to not comment on that case … There's a lot of players involved, I know that.</p></blockquote><p>MLB's response to the ESPN story was to call it \"premature\". Pat Courtney, senior vice president for public relations, said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We are still in the midst of an active investigation. No decisions [on suspensions] have been made.</p></blockquote><p>MLB has been gathering evidence against as many as 20 players <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2013/jun/07/biogenesis-mlb-peds-a-rod\">with the help of Anthony Bosch, the former owner of Biogenesis</a>, and is in the midst of trying to justify 100-game suspensions for both using and lying – a first offence is normally 50 games. Of course, any suspensions would have an appeals process which could drag out for some time.</p><p>Braun <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130709&amp;content_id=53224800&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb\">faced a scrum of reporters on Tuesday</a> before his Brewers beat the Reds 2-0, reiterating his intent to stay silent on the subject. Braun had missed a month with a thumb injury but returned to the lineup on Tuesday and had a hit in three at-bats.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rodriguez is looking awful in every possible way as he attempts to get back to the Bronx following his hip surgery, managing a single hit in 12 at bats, striking out three times and being hit by a pitch for Yankees lower minor-league affiliates Charleston and Tampa Bay. The Daily News reported on 26 June that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/27/alex-rodriguez-new-york-yankees-twitter-injury\">sources believe Rodriguez will say he is unable to perform physically, so he can retire and collect the remaining $114m on his contract</a>. Right now, A-Rod looks bad, but it's still early in a process which consists of 20 rehab games. </p><p>His team-mate Derek Jeter has been playing for the Yankees' AAA affiliate in Scranton and is much closer to returning to the Bronx. Jeter joked with reporters on Monday, albeit with a hint of frustration that he hasn't returned to the big club, saying:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm trying to push to get there today, but I don't think I can make it today. Really, I don't know what else to say. I'd like to be there now, but I'm not, so as soon as I'm allowed to get up there, I'll get up there.</p></blockquote><p>That can't come soon enough – New York have dropped three straight with their punchless lineup generating just three runs in those losses. </p><h2>Matt Harvey gets naked</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-412634246'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/10/1373465767679/New-York-Mets-Matt-Harvey-010.jpg' alt='New York Mets Matt Harvey' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>New York Mets starting pitcher Matt Harvey – wearing clothes. Photograph: Ray Stubblebine/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>Mets pitching phenom Matt Harvey has drawn comparisons to <a href=\"http://home.adelphi.edu/~rh17730/tomseaver.jpeg\">Hall-of-Famer Tom Seaver</a> this season, sharing the \"heart and determination and calming effect in the clubhouse\" and a certain presence that Seaver, who the Daily News reports will throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the upcoming All-Star Game in Queens, brought to the mound. That is according to those who have seen both players pitch. As it happens, those comparisons are somewhat misguided. Now that Harvey has bared all in ESPN The Magazine's Body Issue, it's clear that Harvey is much closer to emulating Broadway Joe than Tom Terrific, at least off the field. <a href=\"http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/001/033/668/namath-farrah_crop_display_image.jpg?1308609467\">Joe Willie Namath</a>, the legendary quarterback and sex symbol who led the Jets to an upset victory in Super Bowl III less than 10 months before Seaver helped guide the Miracle Mets to the 1969 World Series title, was quite happy to be photographed, say, <a href=\"http://blogs.gloobts.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/joe-namath-300x220.jpg\">shaving in the nude</a>, in much the same way as Harvey can be seen <a href=\"http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1392166.1373404505!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/gallery_635/matt-harvey.jpg\">parading into his hotel hallway</a>. Let's just be clear – Harvey may have a 98mph fastball and a 2.35 ERA, but there is <a href=\"http://i.cdn.turner.com/si/multimedia/photo_gallery/0901/superbowl.behind.scenes/images/joe-namath.jpg\">just no way he will ever top Namath</a>, who co-authored the 1970 book I Can't Wait Until Tomorrow …'Cause I Get Better Looking Every Day, in the sex symbol/icon department, in much the same way he will never top Cy Young's wins record. Some things are just not possible.</p><p>Harvey is on much higher ground on the field, especially when on the mound, where the 24-year-old has enjoyed tremendous success in the first half of the season, enough to start the All-Star Game on Tuesday according to Clayton Kershaw, who told <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/dodgers-clayton-kershaw-mets-matt-harvey-should-start-all-star-game-070713\">Ken Rosenthal of Foxsports.com:</a></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There's no reason, especially if it's in New York, that he shouldn't start. That's what the fans will want. I've got no problem with that.</p></blockquote><p>Harvey, who has been battling a blister on his right index finger, auditioned in front of NL manager Bruce Bochy on Monday night in San Francisco, allowing three runs over seven innings and striking out six, getting a no decision in a 16-inning game the Mets won 4-3. Harvey will skip his next start to allow the blister to heal, which means he would be on full rest for the All-Star Game as a starter or a reliever, should there be no further complications that is. Bochy said after the game:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I can't really share. I know which way I am leaning. The kid is [having a] special year. I know he's from New York. Let's leave it at that.</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Harvey's team-mate David Wright has <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/cespedes-completes-home-run-derby-020028358--mlb.html\">announced the NL participants in the Home Run Derby.</a> Captain America will be joined by the Rockies' Carlos Gonzalez, who leads the league in home runs with 24, the Nats' Bryce Harper, who just returned with a knee injury and, wait for it, Michael Cuddyer of the Rox, who is out of the top 10 in homers – a disappointment, considering Carlos Beltran was available. Having the former Met back in Queens for the Monday night event would have made for interesting viewing. It's also somewhat bizarre that <a href=\"http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130708&amp;content_id=53119156&amp;notebook_id=53120480&amp;vkey=notebook_phi&amp;c_id=phi\">Domonic Brown</a>, second in the NL in homers, was passed over, not to mention Pedro Alvarez, Pittsburgh's power threat. <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2013/07/baseball-home-run-derby-captain-wright-picks-cuddyer\">Cuddyer is a childhood friend of Wright's from back in Virginia</a>.</p><p>Yankees slugger Robinson Canó, who is making the selections for the AL, tapped Orioles first baseman Chris Davis, who leads the league in homers with 33, Detroit's Prince Fielder and Yoenis Cespedes of Oakland, who fills in for <a href=\"http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2013/07/detroit_tigers_jim_leyland_cal_2.html\">Miguel Cabrera, who will sit it out with a stiff back.</a> </p><h2>Life begins at 41</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/i/ibanera01.shtml\">Raul Ibanez</a> is on his way to putting up career-best power numbers at the tender age of 41. The Seattle Mariners outfielder and part time DH had already hit 20 home runs before the All-Star break, becoming the first player aged 40 or older to do so, and on Monday, Ibanez just kept on slugging. He <a href=\"http://blog.thenewstribune.com/mariners/2013/07/09/ibanez-just-trying-to-enjoy-this-run/\">whacked his 22nd against the Boston Red Sox </a>at Safeco Field, which is three more home runs than he hit all of last season as a member of the New York Yankees. Ibanez, in his third stint with the Mariners and old enough to remember what it was like to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZkr0A9633Q\">play in the Kingdome, Seattle's previous home</a>, is a bit of a late bloomer. Always somewhat of a power threat, Ibanez didn't hit over 30 homers until he was 34, and did not reach his career high of 34 round trippers until he was in Philadelphia as a 37-year-old. Now, provided age doesn't take his toll and he stays healthy, 40 homers are in sight, which would be a record for a 41-year-old. Actually, no player has ever hit more than 29 at that age –<a href=\"http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/hub_fans_bid_kid_adieu_article.shtml\"> Ted Williams set that mark in his final season.</a> Ibanez told the News Tribune of Tacoma on Monday:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>To be honest with you, I don't really think about numbers. I try to help the team win and try to be the best player I can be every day. At this point of my career, I prepare for every game like it's my last. You never know when that moment's going to come. Just try to enjoy it and soak it in and stay in the moment.</p></blockquote><h2>Making plays</h2><p>Two weeks ago, Sean Foreman, the president of Sports Reference LLC, the company behind the popular, addictive and wildly useful website baseball-reference.com <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/27/alex-rodriguez-new-york-yankees-twitter-injury\">provided the Guardian with a breakdown of the stat known as WAR</a>, which is \"an attempt by the sabermetric baseball community to summarize a player's total contributions to their team in one statistic\".</p><p>One of those components is fielding, and it's the main reason Manny Machado is able to hang in with Miguel Cabrera when it comes to WAR. Well, Machado put those skills on display on Sunday, and this is an excuse to bring you his ridiculous play against the Yankees. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtC9a2ymbA4\"><strong>Reading on mobile? Watch this video here</strong></a></p><p>Carlos Gomez, in the midst of a breakout season for the Brewers, can also thank his fielding skills for his top NL ranking in the WAR position player standings. He has taken away no fewer than four home runs this season in center field and has become one of the most dynamic outfielders in the game. On Monday he robbed Joey Votto of a ninth-inning home run that would have given the Reds a 5-4 lead – instead, the ballgame was over. Gomez makes it look easy, but as we know, it's anything but. </p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjkV7ChMpHw\">Reading on mobile? Watch this video here</a></strong></p><p>So, two examples right there of players who are saving buckets of runs for their teams. As baseball fans we all gawk at plays like these, yet we still aren't prepared to put fielding at a premium when it comes to evaluating position players – most of us tend think offense first, hard to fathom after watching these two.</p><h2>Vote Freddie</h2><p>The National League has an unlikely leader in its Final Vote competition. Atlanta's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreddieFreeman5\">Freddie Freeman</a> is currently in place to reach the All-Star Game in Queens on Tuesday, beating out the Dodgers' Yasiel Puig, who many thought would be a cinch to win. Puig, whose streaking Dodgers have won 14 of their last 17 games, has been a sensation of historic proportions since his career began in early June, but Freeman also has put up some strong numbers and, most importantly, they have come over the course of most of the first half of the season. Freeman has posted an OPS of .843 in 76 games while Puig has an OPS of over 1.000 but has played just 33 games, a fact that may have registered with voters more than many originally thought. Puig's team-mate in LA, Adrian Gonzalez, is also in the running – with the Giants' Hunter Pence and Ian Desmond of Washington. </p><p>In the American League, it's relievers who are looking for votes to reach New York – Steve Delabar of the Blue Jays currently leads a pack that includes Joaquin Benoit of Detroit, New York's David Robertson, Texas' Tanner Scheppers and Koji Uehara of Boston. </p><p>Delabar would be an unlikely All-Star, one with a story – which Canada's <a href=\"http://sports.nationalpost.com/2013/07/07/blue-jays-steve-delabar-continues-his-remarkable-saga-as-all-star-candidate/\">National Post</a> describes as:</p><p>Struggling minor-leaguer throws pitch and fractures elbow. Surgeon installs steel plate and nine screws to fix it. Ex-player becomes substitute teacher and coach at a high school, hears about a shoulder-conditioning program he thinks can help pitchers, tries it out himself and – <em>voila!</em> – discovers he can throw in the mid-90's for the first time in his life. </p><p>To vote <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/events/all_star/y2013/fv/ballot.jsp?tcid=ASG13_News_Story\">click here. </a></p><p>The voting ends on 4pm on Thursday.</p><h2>Extra innings</h2><p>Italy's Marten Gasparini was signed by the Kansas City Royals last week for $1.3m, a European record signing for an amateur – the 16-year-old is ranked 12th-best international prospect by Baseball America. Gasparini's signing is the latest benchmark for a continent that can no longer be considered a baseball backwater, but rather a region producing viable prospects on a regular basis. Josh Chetwynd, who played baseball for Great Britain and is Gasparini's agent, told the Guardian:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The talent just keeps increasing in European baseball, as reflected by the number of players who are earning professional contracts – from a growing number of teams – and the fact that European players like Alex Liddi and Donald Lutz have made it to the Major Leagues. I believe average baseball fans are just starting to catch up to this fact. No doubt, the performances by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/05/taiwan-netherlands-south-korea-world-baseball-classic\">Netherlands</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/14/puerto-rico-italy-world-baseball-classic\">Italy in the World Baseball Classic</a> give some indication of just how competitive teams representing Europe can be.</p></blockquote><p>Gaspirini, a shortstop who counts speed amongst his best attributes, recently made his first trip to the United States, to visit his new organization at Kauffman Field. The switch-hitter may be considered by some to be the best European prospect ever, but he has only been playing organized baseball for a few years, moving from his small hometown of Alture to the Italian Baseball Academy after being identified as a talent. Now he has been rewarded for choosing baseball and begins the long road towards MLB. Gaspirini recently told<a href=\"http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/qa-marten-gasparini-italia-to-royals-prospect/\"> fangraphs.com:</a></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Soccer just doesn't make me feel as good. I think it's kind of boring, because everybody does it. I have a much better feel for baseball. They've told me I could go to [soccer] practices and maybe perform well, but it is more than just [athleticism]. It is technique that makes you go far.</p></blockquote><p>More of his story can be heard below:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUmRcHQkPLI\"><strong>Reading on mobile?

Now MLB will seek to suspend those involved with the clinic for up to 100 games, as first reported by ESPN on Tuesday. </p><p>Dead in the water without a way to acquire records from both the clinic and the Miami New Times, who claimed to have documents which linked Melky Cabrera, Alex Rodriguez, Ryan Braun, Gio Gonzalez and Nelson Cruz to the operation, MLB decided to file a lawsuit against the clinic's owner/operator, Anthony Bosch, and his partners Carlos Acevedo, Ricardo Martinez, Marcelo Albir and Paulo da Silveira. Then they waited for the under pressure operators to fold and do a deal to climb out of the legal jungle they landed in. It couldn't have gone any better for MLB, who seem to be on a mission to rid the game of performance enhancing drugs, taking even further steps to procure information <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9350185/mlb-asks-fedex-phone-records-ped-investigation\">issuing subpoenas on May 23</a> to Federal Express, AT&amp;T Mobility and T-Mobile USA in their bid to gain records for its investigation of players suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs.</p><p>Perhaps Bosch could have held out longer had A-Rod chipped in to help the financially tapped Bosch, but the Yankees third baseman chose not to according to the <a href=\"http://m.espn.go.com/mlb/story?storyId=9347278&amp;top&amp;wjb=\">New York Daily News. </a></p><p>&quot;A-Rod refused to pay him what he wanted,&quot; the source told the New York tabloid. &quot;Baseball was worried about that.&quot; </p><p>Rodriguez released a statement on Thursday:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Myself and others are being mentioned in a media report before the process is even concluded. I would hope this thing would follow the guidelines of our Basic Agreement. I will monitor the situation and comment when appropriate.</p><p>As I have said previously, I am working out every day to get back on the field and help the Yankees win a championship. I am down here doing my job and working hard and will continue to do so until I'm back playing.</p></blockquote><p>Ryan Braun, sometimes known as <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/03/19/ryan-braun-remains-calm-amid-drug-firestorm/2001581/\">&quot;MLB's public enemy number one&quot;</a> for his escape from punishment following a positive test back in December of 2011, said on Tuesday:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>&quot;I'm not answering any further questions regarding the whole situation. I've dealt with it for a long time and aside from that, I don't have anything further to say.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Any suspensions are far from a done deal despite the relentless pursuit of those who allegedly took PED's by Commissioner Bud Selig and company. What kind of a witness Bosch would be is uncertain, although you could certainly argue that he's far from credible, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/sports/brewers/will-tony-bosch-be-credible-enough-to-sink-ryan-braun-others-b9927163z1-210265071.html\">as some have wondered.</a> Either way, <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/yankees/source-mlb-has-a-lot-more-witnesses-than-just-anthony-bosch-for-its-investigation-against-a-rod-others-1.5426574\">reports have emerged that MLB will have a lot more in their anti-drugs arsenal</a> than just Bosch testimony, which is more bad news for offenders of the drug policy. </p><p>Still, anyone who has followed Major League Baseball knows that the Players Union is one of most powerful groups in the country, and if anything is done haphazardly or not to the letter of the collective bargaining agreement, rest assured they will protect their players with force. Having said that, the drug program which is currently in place is a &quot;joint program&quot; between MLB and the MLBPA, so it will be interesting to watch this all unfold. Perhaps the most curious element of this is the timetable for any possible suspensions - would this process be completed during the offseason? Or could any suspensions be handed out earlier which would have an enormous impact on playoff races around baseball?</p><h2>Puig power</h2><p>Like pennies from heaven, Yasiel Puig dropped down from high above the hills of Chavez Ravine and instantly turned what was an injury riddled, blue season of Dodger baseball into something more. It's way too early to tell just what Puig's presence will mean in the end, but you can only imagine the joy that <a href=\"http://www.foxsportswest.com/05/30/13/Scioscia-familiar-with-Mattinglys-hot-se/landing.html?blockID=906979\">under fire Los Angeles manager Don Mattingly</a> was feeling as the young Cuban took to the field and promptly began pummeling San Diego Padres pitchers to a pulp (he also may have been wondering where he has been for the last two months). The 22-year-old made his debut Monday with two hits in the Dodgers 2-1 win, ending the game with his best <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdzM02BgL-k\">Vladimir Guerrero impersonation</a>, doubling up Chris Denorfia at first base from way out in right field. It got even better, a lot better the next night. </p><p><em></em><br />Two home runs, one to left, one to right, five RBI in LA's come from behind 9-7 victory. &quot;Havana Cuba has arrived&quot; proclaimed Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully. Another voice of the Dodgers (but not <em>the</em> voice), Charlie Steiner, wondered aloud, &quot;Who's writing this script?!&quot; with a dose of enthusiasm that can only come from someone who has been watching a team muddle around for two months. It was a historic two days for the rookie, one that resulted in two victories. Unsustainable play of course, and he came down to earth in the series finale with an 0-4 effort. Then he shot right back up to whatever planet he came from on Thursday, lofting a grand slam against Atlanta as Dodgers beat the Braves 5-0 for their third win in four games. Pitchers will eventually adjust to the kid from Cienfuegos, but for now, Dodgers fans are enjoying that very fresh breath of air that is Yasiel Puig. </p><h2>Brown bagging it</h2><p>Just when you thought the Angels were turning the corner they're right back in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0XzE0qKJvA\">50 feet of crap</a> that is their 2013 season. The Halos won eight straight, split the freeway series against the Dodgers, and then ran into the buzzsaw known as the Houston Astros. Anaheim were swept by a team that came into their series with 17 measly wins and a payroll of $24m, and in their own ballpark to boot. It's no wonder some fans are afraid to show their faces - on Tuesday, Halos fan Henry Bouldin <a href=\"http://larrybrownsports.com/baseball/angels-security-orders-fan-take-off-paper-bag/190710\">was asked to remove a paper bag from his head</a> that read &quot;$127 million [the Angels payroll] + all I got was this bag. Go Angels?&quot;. The team insists that it's just policy to not allow covered heads in the stadium and that it would have been the same if it just said &quot;Go Angels&quot; - I think I actually believe them. Larry Brown Sports reported that last week a fan wearing a monkey suit was asked to remove his mask. This makes me wonder what would happen if a Muslim fan came to the ballpark wearing a burqa or niqab, but that's a probably a discussion for another time.</p><p>The point is, this team stinks, and have stunk for quite some time. They owe Albert Pujols and Josh Hamilton and even their manager Mike Scioscia a lot of money for many years to come, and it's time to panic. Consider this - the <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dudalu01.shtml\">Mets outfielder Lucas Duda</a> is just one of many ordinary players who are outproducing both of those former behemoths by big chunks. Duda has a .792 OPS and is making $519,240 this season compared to the $16m Pujols is being paid for a .732 OPS (down from .859 last season) and the $17m Hamilton is getting for his .660 OPS (down from .930 last season). Those numbers are breathtaking, and there's no sign right now of them improving. Despite Mike Trout's best efforts <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/troutmi01.shtml\">(good, but not as good as last season)</a>, the teams overall pitching and hitting numbers indicate that they are an average team at best and their record is even worse than that. Baseball fans have been watching and waiting LA and their massive payroll to turn it around for what seems like forever, and they are going to wait some more. </p><h2>Dodging draft day</h2><p>I know that Major League Baseball is trying to turn the amateur draft into a relevant event but, well, it's just not for me - certainly not on a night when the<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/07/nba-finals-san-antonio-spurs-miami-heat-game-1\"> Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs are duking it out</a> in Game One of the NBA Finals. MLB Network has pulled out all the stops, again, trying to convince us that if we don't sink our teeth into the draft then there is no way we call ourselves baseball fans. Don't worry, if you can't recite the first three picks of the draft you won't lose your fan license, I promise. </p><p>Still, without a draft, there would be no players from Canada or the USA, which includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and any other Commonwealth, Territory or Possession of the United States of America, and so, it is important, you can't argue that. Incidentally, just days before the draft, it was decided by MLB and the MLBPA (who both must agree on the terms) that there would be no draft for <em>international</em> players in 2014 or at least until after the current collective bargaining agreement expires on December 1st 2016. Latino players lobbied to not have a draft citing the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/sports/baseball/puerto-rico-traces-decline-in-prospects-to-inclusion-in-the-baseball-draft.html?pagewanted=all\">downturn in Puerto Rico's baseball pipeline</a> since the Commonwealth's players became eligible for the draft in 1990. MLB has been determined to install an international draft, feeling that it would help stamp out some of the corruption rife in the development of young players in countries such as the Dominican Republic. Now teams will be allocated with a dollar value based on their record to sign international players with the worst teams being allocated the most money to spend. </p><p>The Astros had the first draft pick last season, <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2013/06/05/carlos-correa-astros-first-pick-in-2012-remains-on-target/\">Carlos Correa</a> (who is, guess what, Puerto Rican), and had the top pick again in 2013. Correa is doing well down in A-ball, one reason why the Astros organization has posted a 137-98 record, the best combined record of minor league affiliates in all of baseball. That only figures to improve with the arrival of Stanford pitcher <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130606&amp;content_id=49804508&amp;notebook_id=49805272&amp;vkey=notebook_hou&amp;c_id=hou\">Mark Appel</a>, a pitcher they considered drafting instead of Correa a season ago. Since he could not agree to a deal with the Pirates after being selected by Pittsburgh, Houston had a second shot at drafting the right hander this time around and they got their man. If you need more than a few lines of draft coverage, you can <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130607&amp;content_id=49890754&amp;c_id=\">eat your heart out here. </a></p><h2>Capital loss</h2><p>In his first full season following Tommy John surgery, Washington Nationals GM Mike Rizzo<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/wp/2012/09/08/stephen-strasburg-shut-down-for-the-season/\"> shut down his young ace pitcher Stephen Strasburg</a> in order to protect him from another arm injury and set him up for long term health. Now every time Strasburg is injured, regardless of whether or not he suffers an arm ailment or something else, like, say the strained muscle in his back which <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9346479/washington-nationals-put-stephen-strasburg-dl-lat-strain\">put him on the DL this week</a>, Rizzo is going to be plowing through second guessing stories where the theme is something like &quot;see, I told you it was stupid.&quot; Whether Rizzo was right or wrong in taking that serious precaution, one that could have, at least in theory, kept his team from advancing to the 2012 NLCS, is hard to say. One thing we do know is that this sort of repetitive analysis is annoying for Strasburg, who is already prickly around the media. It's also <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/post/mike-rizzo-medias-strasburgharper-obsession-boggles-my-mind/2012/09/06/e0e797e2-f836-11e1-8b93-c4f4ab1c8d13_blog.html\">a nuisance (a self created one) for the organization</a>, who are under the microscope in their first year of playing under high expectations. This season hasn't been as good to the Nats - a year ago they were 10 games over .500 with a two game lead in the NL East, and <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings#20120606\">today they are a game under, eight games behind the Atlanta Braves</a> - the doubts are slowly creeping in.</p><p>Now their ace pitcher joins the other franchise cornerstone on the sidelines - Bryce Harper is on his way to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/wp/2013/06/06/bryce-harper-to-visit-dr-james-andrews-about-left-knee-injury/\">visit Dr James Andrews</a> about that swollen left knee, the opposite of good news. My two cents, and you've read this before in this space (and you will likely read it again) so apologies for any repetition - anytime you have a chance to win a World Series you try to win a World Series because <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/wp/2013/06/06/mets-announcers-revisit-strasburg-shutdown/\">you never ever know if you're getting back</a>, regardless of how stacked you think your organization is. </p><h2><a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings\">MLB standings</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410293024|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|4174795849a01c9cfedc3ced12877fa7eabbaad3 -->",

        "body":"<h2>Mo-town</h2><p>I don't know why <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130528&amp;content_id=48874066&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb\">Mariano Rivera was asked by the Mets to throw out the first pitch</a> before the Yankees final game in Queens this season. I mean I know why but I am not sure I understand it. I mean I understand it but I really don't get it. Rivera is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/04/mariano-rivera-torn-acl-new-york-yankees\">the best modern closer of all-time</a>, that we all know for sure - a classy player who dominated the sport at his position, no doubt. Now in his final season he is enjoying a goodbye tour across baseball, meeting fans from other teams, challenged children, groundskeepers, things like that. It's good stuff, and he has earned the right to do it - I don't have to tell you. There's a limit of course, and that is throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in the Queens ballpark, which he was asked to do by Mets management - naturally he obliged. It's not on Rivera that he took them up on it, who would turn down such a gesture, one from <a href=\"http://www.northjersey.com/sports/Yankees_Mariano_Rivera_asked_to_recall_final_out_of_2000_World_Series.html\">a team he helped bury in the 2000 World Series</a>, picking up two saves, while playing for a franchise that Mets fans were forced to sit and watch as they dominated, won titles, pennants, made playoff appearances, season after season. <a href=\"http://metsmerizedonline.com/2011/05/mets-fans-and-yankee-fans-have-a-mutual-dislike-for-each-other.html\">Mets fans don't like the Yankees, at all,</a> not a little bit, but Mets management seemed to forget that. Gifts are fine, maybe a few videos on the scoreboard, something like that. They <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/sep/11/philadelphia-phillies-milwaukee-brewers-new-yok-yankees-chipper-jones?CMP=twt_gu\">did it for Chipper Jones </a>who tortured the Mets so much he named one of his kids Shea, so why not do it for Mo? That makes sense, but they couldn't help themselves, rolling out the welcome wagon, going one step further than many Mets fans want to see, bestowing a first pitch honor onto him. </p><p>The problem with the Mets ownership is that they seem to do the details very well. For their opponents that is. Why it was just a few years ago that their brand new stadium opened up with a rotunda that looked like the former home of the <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/baseball-insider/assets_c/2009/04/ebbetsciti-thumb-425x239.jpg\">Brooklyn Dodgers </a>and it barely had a stitch of Mets stuff inside it. The ushers even wore Phillies-esque colors: a nice touch, especially if you're from Philadelphia. It's hard to build a stadium, it takes a long time to design, and there's a lot to consider - a challenge for sure. You know what's easy? <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5347844/why-your-stadium-sucks-citi-field\">Putting some Mets stuff in it. </a>They didn't do that until <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mets-new-hall-fame-museum-citi-field-gallery-1.54224\">forced by their own fans. </a></p><p>Here's another thing, the Mets have retired<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mvWOkUsAe1A/SeZ4iioxZGI/AAAAAAAACZU/17qalgk1QMk/s320/Mets_numbers.jpg\"> exactly one Mets players' number</a> in 50 years of existence, Tom Seaver's 41 (Gil Hodges did play for the Mets but his number is retired for his managing, as is Casey Stengels'). You want to have an ultra strict policy on retiring numbers and limit it to home grown Hall-of-Fame players, which seems to be the case? That's a decision a fan can respect. Here's what you don't have to do - take three of the franchise's most cherished player numbers, the 16 Dwight Gooden wore, the 17 of Keith Hernandez, the 18 of Darryl Strawberry, and routinely throw it <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/uniform-numbers.shtml#num_17\">onto the backs of nobodies, the latest being Rick Ankiel, who is donning Doc's digits</a>. Fans notice, and it leaves a bad taste. It's easy just to not issue the number at all, and fans will respect you for it. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-409873801'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/30/1369879433295/4036619d-19ce-45af-8f4d-31448e16173d-160x240.jpeg' alt='On Tuesday, Mariano Rivera started and finished the game for the New York Yankees.' width='160' height='240' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>On Tuesday, Mariano Rivera was the first and last man on the mound in Queens. Photograph: Ray Stubblebine/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p><em></em><br />One more easy thing to do, or in this case, not to do. Jeff Wilpon, son of owner Fred Wilpon, doesn't need to stand up next to Mariano Rivera during a press conference and say \"Wish we could see you in the World Series but I'm not sure if that's going to happen.'' It took Rivera, the Yankee, to try and save Wilpon saying \"You never know.'' Unfortunately for Mets fans, it's <a href=\"http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/take-my-team-please/\">not the first time ownership has spoken up in a negative way about its players,</a> which can sometimes make them wonder whether they actually like the Mets or they like owning the Mets?</p><p>Fortunately for Mets fans, the above and beyond kindness the organization showed Rivera did not filter down to the players. On the night that Mo threw out that first pitch, he returned to get hammered in the ninth inning,<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/blog/_/name/stark_jayson/id/9321743/the-great-mariano-rivera-blows-save\"> blowing a save while failing to retire a batter for the first time in his career,</a> as the Mets swept the Queens portion of their home and home four game series. Ownership will have one more chance to honor Rivera, when he returns to Flushing for his final All-Star Game appearance in July. </p><h2>Rising sun</h2><p>Once upon a time being a Mariners fan meant cheering for future Hall-of-Fame ballplayers. Ken Griffey Jr. <a href=\"http://www.sportable.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/griffey.jpg\">climbed walls,</a> <a href=\"http://seattlesportscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/randy-johnson-fastball.jpeg\">Randy Johnson</a> blew away batters, a <a href=\"http://boydwonder.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/alg_alex_rodriguez.jpg\">young and (possibly) innocent </a>Alex Rodriguez became one of the brightest stars in the game. There was a spanking new ballpark, an Ichiro, a hell raising manager, a boom time for a Boone, and a <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SEA/2001.shtml\">116 win season.</a> Then the tumbleweeds blew in, and for the last few seasons, all their faithful have had to hang their hats on is Felix Hernandez (once the declining Ichiro was dealt). It could be worse, except that he doesn't have much help. </p><p>Yes, the losing has continued in 2013, but there is at least some light shining on the front of Seattle's rotation with the emergence of <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/fantasy/news/20130430/fantasy-baseball-pitching-report-hisashi-iwakuma/\">Hisashi Iwakuma</a>, with whom Hernandez has formed a formidable one-two punch. The Japanese hurler, a star in his home country, who put up some of the best pitching numbers in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, is lesser known in these parts despite his current status as one of the more valuable players in the league. Iwakuma is leading the American League in WHIP and ranks fifth in baseball on the pitching <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2013-pitching-leaders.shtml\">WAR charts</a> - compared with the four pitchers above him, Clay Buchholz, Matt Harvey, Clayton Kershaw and Cliff Lee, he is by far the least recognizable.</p><p>Perhaps Iwakuma would have had more time to earn a rep in the bigs had he <a href=\"http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/11/24/history-suggests-as-are-right-to-balk-at-japanese-ace-hisashi-iwakumas-asking-price/\">been able to come to an agreement with the Oakland A's</a> when they won the right to negotiate with him after the 2010 season. Instead Iwakuma suffered through another losing season with his Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of the NPB Pacific League before signing with the Mariners for 2012 for peanuts. Iwakamura told the Seattle Times before making his 2012 MLB debut:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"...I'm not a strikeout pitcher, so I'm not going there thinking I can blow those guys away. I'm a control pitcher who likes to challenge batters low in the zone and make them hit the ball on the ground to the infielders. That's how I plan to attack them.\"</p></blockquote><p>His plan worked to a tee and Iwakuma had a successful season as both a starter and reliever before signing a two-year $13m deal with a $7m club option for 2015 in the offseason, joining the rotation full-time. Now the 32-year-old import is 5-1 with a 2.35 ERA and 69 strikeouts in 72.2 innings of work, bolstering a rotation that's struggling after the top two while the Mariners flounder yet again. On Sunday, Iwakuma' value was once again on display. After eight straight losses, with the bullpen burned out and the team needing a starter to go deep, he <a href=\"http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20130527/SPORTS/705279953\">pitched eight innings vs the Rangers,</a> allowing just two runs, putting them in position to win in 13 innings 4-3. Mariners pitching coach Carl Willis told the Seattle Times earlier in the season:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The thing about it is, he's doing it under the radar. So much of the baseball world gets caught up on power and velocity. But if you can command pitches the way he does and provide the unpredictability of changing speeds, you can be just as effective. That's what Iwakuma does. He's a diligent worker. And he has come a long way.</p></blockquote><h2>The Running Man</h2><p>Back when Angel Pagan was a member of the New York Mets, one of the main criticisms against him was his base running. It's a big reason why GM Sandy Alderson and his crack team of talent evaluators <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/mets/index.ssf/2010/02/ny_mets_outfielder_angel_pagan_1.html\">traded Pagan to San Francisco </a>for <a href=\"http://www.lotustalk.com/forums/attachments/f68/90005d1220492322-costco-needs-bring-back-big-bags-popcorn-popcorn_10000.jpg\">a big bag of popcorn</a> and a case of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Set-Desert-Storm-Trading/dp/B000CQ36VC\">unopened Desert Storm playing cards</a>. The Mets got their goodies and the Giants got a core part of their 2012 World Series Championship team. Now, even though the base running gaffes he made as a Met have nothing to do with the kind of base running he did on Tuesday night, when he hit a walk-off inside the park home run to beat the Rockies, you can imagine that fans of the Amazin's were thinking \"yeah, his base running looks awful\" as he completed the most exciting play in baseball in dramatic fashion. </p><p><em></em><br /><a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/paganan01.shtml\">Pagan has become quite important</a>since leaving Flushing behind for another Bay, an exciting outfielder, who isn't shy about showing emotion, and who enjoys playing before a full house every night in San Francisco. The most notable aspect of this play is the way he busted out of the box, when many big leaguers may have taken a nice long look at the ball before strolling into second or third base. Not Pagan, who flew out of the gate like he could smell the first first walkoff inside-the-park home run since 2004, and that's exactly what he got. </p><h2>Interleague, shminterleague</h2><p>Is the novelty of Interleague Play a thing of the past? It would certainly seem to be the case based on attendance figures from the games this season. Mets fans have become used to seeing <a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3327/3673440349_a664a72f42_b.jpg\">empty seats in their ballpark in Queens,</a> but you'd expect a flow of Yankees fans to plug some of those holes, and they did, but not as much as usual. A similar trend was on display at other ballparks which were featuring the biggest Interleague games. The fact that Interleague games are now seen around North America on a daily basis must be the reason why baseball attendance has dropped by 2.6%, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/sports/baseball/interleague-overload-weather-baseball-fans-are-staying-home.html?ref=baseball\">according to the New York Times. </a>It's a sensible theory. The isolated May and June periods which brought us National vs American League games is history, and those April Oakland vs Atlanta match-ups aren't as charming when you can see them all the time, never mind the Tigers vs Marlins games we can expect in September. Perhaps it would have been better to cut the Interleague schedule in half, at least to restore some of the rivalries lost to the 1994 realignment. In the AL, having 14 teams meant ballclubs that did not play in the same division would have more opportunities to play each other, but in the 16 team old NL, teams only saw outer-division clubs but twice a year,  playing a set in each ballpark. That means Phillies vs Pirates, Mets vs Cardinals, Mets vs Cubs, Braves vs Giants, Dodgers vs Reds - teams that used to be divisional rivals in the <a href=\"http://baseball.about.com/od/seasonstructur1/a/What-They-Are-Saying-Mlb-Division-Realignment-Proposals.htm\">old days</a> rarely play each other anymore, and playing those teams meant something to fans. Starting this year the AL will experience the same phenomenon, with the Yankees seeing Detroit just twice a year for example. Instead there's Seattle vs San Diego and other similar match-ups, ones which may have raised a hair or two when they were played in a condensed period but now just make up the everyday slate. The Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig has chosen to blame the lower attendance on the bad weather we had in the beginning of the season, and perhaps he's right. We'll find out in the years to come whether or not this latest realignment turns out to be a mistake for the league.</p><h2>Extra Innings</h2><p>• What was supposed to be a clash of the titans out in Los Angeles turned out to be vital games for two teams on the brink. <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/28/sports/la-sp-simers-angels-dodgers-20130528\">The Dodgers</a> came into the Freeway series in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/sports/baseball/josh-hamilton-endures-free-agent-pains-with-angels.html\">worse shape than the Angels</a>, who had won eight straight and looked to be finally turning the corner. The Halos would see their streak snapped, with LA taking the first two games at Chavez Ravine, the Dodgers second victory coming courtesy of a Hyun-jin Ryu two-hit complete game shutout. Jered Weaver, out since April 7, made his comeback as the series shifted to Angels Stadium, going six innings (the first four were perfect), allowing a run and striking out six as the Halos got one back on Wednesday. </p><p>• The Mets have won four straight games for the first time this season, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/05/29/new-york-mets-yankees-9-4/2371233/\">a streak that includes three consecutive wins against the Yankees</a> - a pair in Queens and the first of two in the Bronx. Cracks can finally be seen in the Bombers lineup, one that had been propped up admirably by retreads such as Lyle Overbay and Vernon Wells while the teams stars heal in Florida. Kevin Youkilis and Mark Teixeira are finally expected back on Friday, while Derek Jeter is out of a walking boot, although there is no timetable for his return as of yet. Andy Pettitte could also return from the DL at the end of the week, but Curtis Granderson, who has missed most of the season already,<a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130529&amp;content_id=48984896&amp;notebook_id=48985090&amp;vkey=notebook_nyy&amp;c_id=nyy\"> had surgery after breaking his knuckle.</a> The Pinstripes have lost four straight for the first time in 2013. </p><p>• You would figure that <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_05_29_wasmlb_balmlb_1&amp;mode=video&amp;content_id=27555325&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_27555325\">Ryan Zimmerman's three home runs</a> would be enough to earn a victory for the Washington Nationals but that was not the case in their 9-6 defeat to Baltimore on Wednesday. The O's <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_05_29_wasmlb_balmlb_1&amp;mode=video&amp;content_id=27558469&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_27558469\">Chris Davis hit his 18th and 19th home runs</a> as the teams combined to hit eight round trippers as Baltimore won for the second time in three nights against their \"regional rivals\". Meanwhile, Bryce Harper has missed the last three games with bursitis and remains day-to-day. </p><p>• Dioner Navarro also hit three homers, but his Cubs did get the win over the White Sox at Wrigley field, which makes a lot more sense. In other news, mock-ups of a would be 6000 square foot scoreboard were built to demonstrate what sort of impact they would have on fans watching Cubs games from the rooftops of nearby buildings. </p><p><em></em><br />• The Kansas City Royals continue to find new lows, dropping the first three games of the I-70 series against the St Louis Cardinals (who have the best record in baseball) and have now dropped 11 of 12 games. <br /> <br />• The Pittsburgh Pirates closer Jason Grilli is now 22 for 22 in save opportunities as his 33-20 Pirates shut down the Tigers for the second straight evening on Wednesday. </p><p>• Boston Red Sox ace Clay Buchholz missed Monday's start against the Phillies \"because of collar bone soreness that stemmed from falling asleep while cradling his daughter in his arm.\" His next scheduled start has been pushed from Friday against the Yankees, but he could return for the series finale. Meanwhile, Ian Kennedy had his Monday start for the Arizona Diamondbacks pushed thanks to his <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/27/sports/la-sp-0527-baseball-notes-20130527\">cutting up a finger while washing dishes. </a></p><p>• Shane Victorino got a standing ovation in Philadelphia after returning to Citizens Bank Park with the Red Sox but did not throw out the first pitch. A feel good moment after a week in which he was <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=27364913\">attacked by his own teammate in Chicago. </a></p><p><em><a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings\">MLB standings</a></em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409740206|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|b262ef45860cde2ec0c0049f148f218034735189 -->",

        "headline":"MLB: Five things we learned this week",
        "body":"<h2>Royals humbled</h2><p>This was supposed to be the breakout season that fans in Kansas City had been waiting forever for, and for the first 27 games of the season, that prospect seemed like a distinct possibility. However, after a 17-10 start, their best early effort in recent history, the upstart Royals have faltered, winning just four of their previous 16 games. Whether or not this is just a bump in the road for a young KC team ready to rip it up is a question that will need more time to answer, but for now, the Royals have reverted to their doormat status, recently <a href=\"http://www.kshb.com/dpp/sports/baseball/royals/royals-lose-6-5-in-houston-for-4th-straight-1-run-loss\">dropping four straight one-run games</a>, including a sweep at the hands of the Oakland A's and a pair of losses to the lowly Astros. </p><p>Veteran outfielder Jeff Francoeur told mlb.com:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"At Spring Training, Ned [manager Yost] said you're going to hit a couple of rough patches. This is obviously our first big rough patch. The key is to get out of it as fast as we can as a team offensively.\"</p></blockquote><p>Frenchy has <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3476648\">been an enigma since his Atlanta days,</a> regularly posting some ungodly on base percentages - he's at .264, which will surprise no one. More frustrating to watch has been their youthful tandem of <a href=\"http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/eric-karabell/post?id=1363\">Eric Hosmer</a> and Mike Moustakas, who lie at the core of an offense that's shaking at the knees, struggling to put up runs. </p><p>Moustakas has been seen as a <a href=\"http://www.minorleagueball.com/2011/6/10/2216441/prospect-of-the-day-mike-moustakas-3b-kansas-city-royals\">can't miss player</a> for some time, but that's all he's been doing lately - his sub-.200 batting average has plummeted nearly 50 points in just 12 days thanks to an extended slump. It's something the Royals' face-of-the-franchise and fellow third baseman George Brett knows a thing or two about.  </p><p>\"We all know what he's capable of doing,\" the Royals Hall-of-Famer<a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/2013/05/20/4246222/george-brett-moustakas-isnt-the.html\"> told the Kansas City Star.</a> \"But I just think he has to relax, see the ball and hit it. Breathe, smile, have fun. The game's no fun when you're on a one for 34.\"</p><p>The Kansas City Star points out that Brett struggled as a young prospect, taking a .205 average into the All-Star break before coming around in the second half of the season, something that Moustakas can take solace in, even if the 23-year old has already experienced success in the Bigs, hitting 20 jacks last season. Still, he needs to show progress sooner rather than later in order to become an anchor of KC's lineup as was expected.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Hosmer has just one home run in a position where power is mostly seen as mandatory - first base. As a rookie in 2011, Hosmer hit 19 homers and slugged close to .800, but that pop fizzed somewhat last season and has been non-existent this time out. There are <a href=\"http://www.rantsports.com/mlb/2013/05/21/kansas-city-royals-continue-to-slide-away-from-first-place/\">other holes on the team including second base,</a> a position that the Royals have failed to fill adequately in at least 20 years - Chris Getz has completely fallen off the shelf since his strong start. All these struggles with the bats come in a season in which their pitching has come to fruition, with James Shields, the reclamation of <a href=\"http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=20464\">Jeremy Guthrie</a> and Ervin Santana leading the way. Even Luke Hochevar, a total bust as a starter, has found a home in the pen, and so all these Royals need to compete are a few runs. </p><p>On Tuesday, they got some. Staring a second straight defeat to the Astros in the face, the Royals rallied from three runs down, busting out for seven runs in the late innings. <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_05_21_kcamlb_houmlb_1&amp;mode=video&amp;content_id=27329351&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_27329351\">Moustakas came through with the key hit</a>, a bases loaded single that snapped that four-game losing streak. They had momentum, but only for an evening. On Wednesday the Royals were back to their losing ways, dropping yet another game to Houston, putting just a single run on the board against one of the worst pitching staffs in baseball. </p><h2>Pitchers' mistakes wind up in the lake</h2><p>The Cleveland Indians, who came into 2013 with a new manager, a handful of new recruits and <a href=\"http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=25614109&amp;topic_id=26659630&amp;c_id=cle\">slightly higher expectations</a> than a season ago had just suffered their latest defeat - <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_04_28_clemlb_kcamlb_1&amp;mode=wrap&amp;c_id=cle\">a 9-0 beating by their AL Central rivals, the Kansas City Royals</a>, in the first game of a late April doubleheader. Pitcher Justin Masterson had struck out nine, but that didn't begin to make up for his seven run shellacking. Still, Masterson had enjoyed a solid start to the year, and Cleveland's offense was of much greater concern - they'd scored three or fewer runs in 14 of their first 21 games during which they posted an 8-13 record. </p><p>Indians first baseman Nick Swisher told mlb.com during the doubleheader intermission:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"We're trying to get things rocking. It's still early. We're 21 games in. It's obviously not the start we wanted. But hey, that's going to happen, bro. We're going through some growing pains right now, and we need to figure this out and turn it around.\"</p></blockquote><p><em></em><br />Sometime in between those two games at Kauffman Stadium the Indians figured it out and began tearing up baseball. Cleveland have <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2013-schedule-scores.shtml\">won 18 of their previous 24 games</a> thanks to a ferocious power surge during which they've averaged close to six runs a contest. In their first 21 games Cleveland averaged 1.16 home runs a game, and since that nightcap in KC the Indians have hit 36 homers or 1.5 per game. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/may/17/st-louis-cardinals-texas-rangers-james-loney\">Infielder/DH Mark Reynolds</a> has led the way with 12 big flies, while virtually every player in Cleveland's lineup is capable of hitting the ball out of the park - from catcher Carlos Santana who has hit eight out, to a part timer like Yan Gomes who has five dingers in just 18 games. Perhaps the most impressive number coming out of Cleveland's first quarter of the season is seven - that's how many former Cy Young Award winners their bats have beaten to a pulp. Now, if manager Terry Francona can rustle up some starting pitching to join starters <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/masteju01.shtml\">Masterson</a>, the<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mcallza01.shtml\"> young Zach McCallister</a> and a lethal bullpen that's putting up some of the strongest numbers in the AL, perhaps they'll be able to do what the White Sox couldn't do in their surprise season of 2012 - hold off the Detroit Tigers. </p><h2>A pastry pasting</h2><p>On Monday it emerged that Cuban pastries may have been responsible for Aroldis Chapman's ninth inning meltdown a day earlier in the Reds defeat to Philadelphia at Citizens Bank Park. The Phils Spanish-language broadcaster Rickie Ricardo told local radio that he had bought 100 of the sweet treats to the Holguin born hurler, discovering before the game that around <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9298109/aroldis-chapman-cincinnati-reds-sunk-sweets-sunday-rickie-ricardo\">18 of them were gone.</a> Hours later, Fredie Galvas and Erik Kratz had taken Chapman deep back-to-back in a surprise 3-2 walkoff Phillies win. Apparently Ricardo likes to visit a Cuban bakery in <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-gran-via-bakery-union-city\">Union, New Jersey to buy specialty pastries</a> that feature a \"flaky-crust ... with cream cheese and guava and it's baked, and it's absolutely delicious,\" to give to Cuban ballplayers from around the league.</p><p>\"Now, if you eat more than two of these you're clogging up your arteries -- you're a stroke waiting to happen,\" Ricardo said on <a href=\"http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/station/94wip/\">94WIP radio</a>, adding that the pastries are the \"equivalent of the Krispy Kreme donuts when they come right out of the oven, it's that kind of a thing.\"</p><p>Now, <a href=\"http://cincinnati.com/blogs/reds/2013/05/20/notes-chapman-available-and-getting-to-the-bottom-of-pasty-gate/\">did the pastries really lead to Chapman serving up two tasty treats to Phillies hitters?</a> Who knows, but the speculation, most of which was tongue and cheek, is actually a bit of good fun, especially during a long season that can at times seem daunting. Reds manager Dusty Baker refused to buy into the humor, choosing instead to continue his touch and go relationship with the media. Baker told MLB.com:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"That has nothing to do with what he did. Look at him -- does he look fat? I don't pay any attention to that.... Sometimes that locker room is too open for everybody, which makes it too open for alibis and excuses if something happens.\"</p></blockquote><p>While chewing on \"pastry gate\" with my friend David Travers, he summed up what a good humored Dusty might have said in response to the affair:</p><p>\"Sorry Dusty, you may be a good manager, but you're a lousy comedian. If he would have said something like \"Tell Ricardo to<a href=\"http://hecklingsanta.blogspot.com/2012/06/ryan-howard-is-fat.html\"> buy 300 for Ryan Howard</a> next time we are in town\" then that would have made me your fan for life - opportunity missed.\"</p><h2>NL gets a Pat down</h2><p>Any baseball fans who either hadn't caught (desert) wind of the Patrick Corbin show taking place out in Arizona or ignored it altogether can do so no longer, certainly not after his latest feat. Taking on the Rockies in Coors Field, the second year Diamondbacks hurler<a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_05_20_arimlb_colmlb_1&amp;mode=video&amp;content_id=27301017&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_27301017\"> threw a three-hit complete game</a>, baffling Rockies hitters, while taming a ballpark that is <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_20843984/sports\">back to being a pitchers' nightmare. </a>Colorado Communications/Public Relations man, Jay Alves, told the Guardian that the Rox hadn't seen a slider like that in a long time. <a href=\"http://www.foxsportsarizona.com/mlb/arizona-diamondbacks/story/Todd-Helton-Patrick-Corbin-has-best-slid?blockID=904275&amp;feedID=3801\">Todd Helton went further than that</a>, saying that it's the best slider he's ever seen in his life, and that comes from a player who faced another D'Back, future <a href=\"http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/p480x480/543194_10151806837675005_1111115592_n.jpg\">Hall-of-Famer Randy Johnson</a>, regularly. </p><p>Speaking of the Big Unit, Corbin's victory in the Mile High City means that he joins Johnson as the first D'Backs pitcher to start a season with seven straight victories - a run that's only just starting to garner headlines outside of Phoenix. Corbin hasn't gone fewer than six innings in each start and given up a grand total of 10 earned runs in nine appearances for an ERA of 1.44, helping Arizona to a strong start in the NL West, and is up there with the likes of Clayton Kershaw and Matt Harvey as the top pitchers in baseball right now - quite a jump from his mediocre rookie season. He's certainly finding his feet after years of working on his game - the lefty from <a href=\"http://goo.gl/maps/7KEZA\">Clay, New York</a>,<a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/20130520arizona-diamondbacks-pat-corbin-throws-complete-game-in-series-opener-against-colorado-rockies.html\"> recently told AZcentral.com</a> that he didn't even begin focusing on pitching until his junior year of high school.</p><p>\"I feel like when I was drafted I was still growing into my body,\" Corbin said. \"I always knew that the bigger I got, the harder I would throw. I always thought that. I don't know if that's what (scouts) thought.\"</p><p>Odds are scouts didn't think much, considering that his own organization saw  him as a back-of-the-rotation starter, which is exactly what he showed last year going 6-8 with a 4.54 ERA. </p><p>Now he's jumped into the mix as a possible starter for the NL at the All-Star Game in July despite playing at Chase Field, which, like Coors, is no bowl of cherries for pitchers.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I think in the spring, I came in with the same mind-set that I have now. I wanted to go out there and make sure I was ready for every start. I try to go out there and pound the strike zone, and so far I've been able to do that. I know there are a lot of starts left, and I just want to make sure that I can keep it going.\"</p></blockquote><h2>Je me souviens</h2><p>Hall of Fame catcher Gary Carter, who starred for the Montreal Expos for 12 seasons and who <a href=\"http://jonahkeri.com/2012/02/17/gary-carter-memories/\">died of brain cancer in February of 2012</a>, had a street named after him on Monday near the site of <a href=\"http://www.circuitclouts.com/images/Stade%20Parc%20Jarry%204.jpg\">Stade Parc Jarry</a>, where the 1969 expansion team first played upon entry into the National League. It's the latest baseball murmur coming out of a city that lost its team after the 2004 season to Washington D.C. after a long decline that featured a number of culprits, ultimately leading to the demise of baseball's first entry outside of the United States. Former Expos outfielder Warren Cromartie announced earlier this year that he is leading the <a href=\"http://montrealbaseballproject.com/\">Montreal Baseball Project</a> and conducting feasibility study on whether or not the city with a metropolitan area population approaching four million people could support a Major League Baseball team again. </p><p><em></em><br />There are two teams still seeking a new stadium, Tampa Bay and Oakland, and at least in theory, they are a threat to move. The Rays are suffering in the attendance department much like the Expos did as the situation spiraled in Montreal, but have a <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/the-powerful-piece-of-paper-that-is-the-tampa-bay-rays-lease/1223089\">lease with the city of St Petersburg</a> that expires in 2025 and is so tight it prevents the team discussing a franchise move with other cities. Oakland would have an easier time leaving town, although their ownership have had their eye on San Jose as a future home for some time, with <a href=\"http://www.murraychass.com/?p=5255\">baseball failing to come to a resolution</a> regarding the Giants rights to the territory. </p><p>Landing a new team is the longest of longshots, especially without stadium funding in place. Still, it is still <a href=\"http://ballparkdigest.com/201304256229/major-league-baseball/features/mlb-returning-to-montreal-temporarily\">not 100% out of the question.</a> As for whether or not baseball could work again in the city, just take a look at the success of the Giants, a team that was close to abandoning San Francisco for Tampa in 1992 after averaging less than 20,000 fans per game. Over 20 years later, baseball couldn't imagine a league without one of the strongest franchises playing in one of its most beloved ballparks. There's an argument that <a href=\"http://nesn.com/2013/04/montreal-could-get-mlb-team-if-city-approves-downtown-stadium-video/\">Montreal is more than capable</a> of duplicating their achievement, and there are a few souls in Quebec <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ExposNation?fref=ts\">still fighting</a> for a second chance to prove it.</p><h2>NYY + MCFC = NYCFC</h2><p>With Manchester City and the New York Yankees <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/may/21/manchester-city-new-york-yankees-major-league-soccer\">joining forces to create NYCFC</a>, the MLS' 20th team and second club in the New York metropolitan area, reports have surfaced that the Blues would open up their doors at the Etihad Stadium to the Bronx Bombers. Major League Baseball has been playing both exhibition games and regular season contests oversees for some time, but have yet to test the waters in Europe. Over the years MLB International always considered The Oval to be the preferred site of any games taking place in the UK, but with the new partnership between two of the biggest clubs in their respective sports, perhaps the north of England is where baseball will finally land in Europe, although details and practicalities concerning  just how a baseball diamond would be carved out of the ground have yet to be discussed. More realistically, Holland seems the ideal place for MLB to make it's trans-atlantic debut, with the new <a href=\"http://www.mister-baseball.com/mlb-regular-season-games-hoofddorp-stadium-2014-2015-possibility/\">Hoofddorp Stadium</a> opening up in March of 2014 that could cater 30,000 fans with temporary seating.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409352090|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|738acd54783354280ede65e463ceb0f77d9bc4cb -->",

What do you want to hear? That even though they lose starters Chris Carpenter again to injury (<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/why-chris-carpenter-only-return-st-louis-cardinals-184200117.html\">for now</a>), and Cy Young candidate Kyle Lohse to free agency, and then lose closer Jason Motte to a season-ending injury, that it doesn't make a damn bit of difference to their pitching staff, which is now even better than a year ago by well over a half a run? That they can just dip into their farm system and pick up a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/05/11/shelby-miller-st-saint-louis-cardinals-one-hitter/2151959/\">Shelby Miller</a> who goes 5-2 with a 1.62 ERA (0.44 ERA in three May starts) and that there's a lot more like him where that came from? That somehow Jake Westbrook (he's the new Kyle Lohse but better) can knock two-and-a-half runs off his portly 4.24 career ERA and breakout after 13 years in the league? That Edward Mujica can close down a game like he's been doing it forever? That the team can still score the third most runs in the NL while their starting third baseman David Freese couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat? That <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/fantasy-roto-arcade/matt-adams-ownership-dilemma-183243006--mlb.html\">the giant Matt Adams</a> can post an OPS of 1.376 (so what if it's only in 13 games)...off the bench!? That their divine catcher, Yadier Molina, is hitting .333?  That Carlos Beltran is putting up some of the best numbers of his career at the age of 36? That they can lose one of the best manager/pitching coach combos in the history of baseball and the franchise doesn't blink? That they've won 12 out of their last 15 games and 16 out of their last 22 and that two of those victories were nearly<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/05/11/st-louis-cardinals-adam-wainwright-one-hitter-colorado-rockies/2152677/\"> back-to-back no hitters?</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.thecubsbrickyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/mcdrinkin.jpg\">Are you happy now? </a></p><h2>Z is for Zettlein</h2><p>Part of the fun of poring over baseball statistics is discovering things you weren't necessarily looking for. Recently I was on <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/\">baseball-reference.com</a> checking out Joey Votto's stats to see how many times he's walked (<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2013-batting-leaders.shtml\">35 times</a> for the Reds, tops in baseball), but while doing so, I stumbled upon an oddity that also involves bases on balls. </p><p>This <a href=\"http://www.kffl.com/gnews.php?id=849184-athletics-bartolo-colon-not-issuing-walks\">can't be news to A's fans</a>, but following Tuesday's start against Texas, Bartolo Colon had issued exactly two walks in 47.1 innings of work. Incredible command of course, enough to warrant a few basic calculations and further exploration. Should Colon manage to stay in the rotation, clean (he was suspended for PED's last season) and free of injury, he'll stay on pace to walk just eight batters in 188 innings. That puts his walks per nine innings at exactly 0.382, which flirts with the single-season record in the category - Colon would be fifth all-time if the season ended today. Now, setting records happens regularly enough in baseball, but I found this one intriguing because a) - we're talking about Bartolo Colon, who has had something of an interesting career (<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/colonba01.shtml\">16 seasons on seven teams</a>, an undeserved Cy Young award, a comeback <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/bartolo-colons-stem-cell-treatment-opens-a-new-can-of-worms?urn=mlb,wp6130\">boosted by stem cell injections</a> that was halted by <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/jon-heyman/19867752/bartolo-colon-fails-mlb-drug-test-in-line-for-50game-suspension\">testosterone injections</a> and now this walks business that comes out of nowhere because his career BB/9 is 2.85) and b) it's a category dominated by 19th century ballplayers, not unlike <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/3B_season.shtml\">the record for triples. </a></p><p>With baseball stats, looking for one stat can easily lead to another, and the next thing you know you're researching players that wore a uniform well over 100 years ago, in this case <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/z/zettlge01.shtml\">George Zettlein</a>. He set the record for walks per nine innings pitched way back in 1876, walking just .2308 batters per nine innings or six over 234 frames for the Philadelphia Athletics during the very first season of National League baseball. That A's franchise went 14-45 and were never heard from again - Colon's Athletics franchise began play in 1901, also in Philly. You would think that a pitcher with control like that would have at least a decent record but no, Zettlein was 4-20. A year before that, <a href=\"http://www.hallofstats.com/player/zettlge01\">Zettlein</a> pitched 462.1 innings without giving up a home run - another record. Apparently, the Brooklyn born pitcher, who also played outfield and first base, served in the Union Army and Navy during the Civil War, was nicknamed \"Charmer\" and had somewhat of a reputation for \"being a hard-headed \"Teutonic\" fellow rather than a thinker.\" See what can happen when all you wanted to know is how many walks Joey Votto has this season?</p><p>Zettlein is surrounded by his peers in the walks per nine innings category. Just seven of the top 50 played in the 20th or 21st century. Cliff Lee's command in 2010 puts him at 50th on the list, Hall-of-Fame hurler Christy Mathewson appears twice (his 1913 is 27th and his 1914 ranks 34th), Brett Saberhagen's 1994 performance ranks 32nd, Cy Young's effort in 1904 ranks 37th, while somewhat amazingly, <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=silvaca01&amp;t=p&amp;year=2005\">Carlos Silva is seventh all time</a>, walking just .4301 batters per nine innings in 2005. Nearly everyone else on the list is long gone, unknown to fans of the game today, <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/bases_on_balls_per_nine_season.shtml\">until now that is. </a></p><p>Colon has a real shot at history, ancient history, should he ratchet up his command another notch. It's still possible for him to break Zettlein's record - heading into his last start, Colon had walked just one batter, and was alone at the top. Unfortunately for Colon, his command has not translated to success, something Zettlein would have identified with - the 39-year-old has been wild in the strike zone, posting an ERA of 7.25 over his previous four starts. </p><h2>Rompin' Rangers</h2><p>Speaking of Colon, he took a no decision on Tuesday as Texas earned a come from behind 10-inning victory against his A's in Oakland. The Rangers would then take the series thanks to a 6-2 Wednesday victory behind Alexi Ogando's six strong innings and a three-run blast by Nelson Cruz. Texas taking two of three off an A's team that beat them in five of seven games during their late season collapse represents a significant psychological hurdle for the Rangers. <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/TEX/2012-schedule-scores.shtml\">Blowing a five game division lead</a> and being ousted from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/06/baltimore-orioles-texas-rangers-al-wildcard-live?CMP=twt_gu\">playoffs early</a>, a season after a World Series collapse against the Cardinals is enough to send most franchises into a deep dark hole. The Rangers seem determined to put it all behind them, winning nine out of their last 12 games, flying out of the gate to the healthiest lead in baseball, seven games up in the AL West. While the Josh Hamilton <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hamiljo03.shtml\">(horror) show</a> plays out slightly above the Mendoza line in LA, the Rangers have transformed from an offensive juggernaut to a team where pitching leads the way. Texas scored the most runs in baseball a season ago but are hovering around the league average in 2013, while the bullpen has helped the team go 9-2 in one-run games and the starters put up the fourth best ERA in the AL. The organization hasn't felt the absence of Neftali Perez, Colby Lewis and Matt Harrison thus far this season (all hope to return later in the season), while a pair of serviceable 24-year-olds, Nick Tepesch and Justin Grimm hold the fort in the rotation, Yu Darvish competes for a Cy Young and <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=18156291\">Derek Holland ads dominant pitching to his impersonations. </a>Meanwhile, middle reliever <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/texas-rangers/post/_/id/4899326/buzz-tanner-scheppers-wants-to-start\">Tanner Scheppers</a> has emerged as a likely successor to closer Joe Nathan whose $9m contract for 2014 can be bought out for $500k. Scheppers has been nothing short of dominant, carrying a 0.45 ERA through 20 innings in which he has struck out 12 and walked four - Nathan is 12 for 12 in save opportunities. All this pitching has made everyone forget about the constant drama surrounding Hamilton's tenure in Dallas, even if his 43 homers from last year are missed somewhat. Mitch Moreland may not be able to keep up the .905 OPS he's rocking right now, even if he did help Texas pound Justin Verlander on Thursday in a 9-4 win, but it may not matter thanks to that staff depth. </p><h2>Loney's lightning in a bottle</h2><p>The Rays are on the move. Despite getting their clocks cleaned for the first time in six games, a 9-2 loss to struggling Boston on Wednesday, they have been playing better as of late thanks to an unlikely source. Before we get into that however, the caveat. </p><p>David Price, the reigning AL Cy Young award winner, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_05_15_bosmlb_tbamlb_1&amp;mode=video&amp;content_id=27152331&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_27152331\">left that game </a>against the Sox in the third inning, a frame in which Boston would put eight runs on the board. The initial diagnosis was <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/injury-adds-to-prices-rays-struggles/2121230\">left triceps tightness</a>, and Price landed on the DL on Thursday. While the Rays hold their breath to see if there's any more to this injury, there's time to focus on some bright spots. How about that James Loney? That's right James Loney. The man is playing posessed down in Tampa, hitting .370, forming a formidable one-two punch with Evan Longoria. The duo are basically carrying the Rays offense right now, while Longoria won AL Player of the Week for 6-12 May, Loney kept up his ridiculousness, prompting questions such as <a href=\"http://www.draysbay.com/2013/5/15/4333120/is-james-loney-really-this-good\">\"Is James Loney this good?\"</a> Let me save you the trouble - no, of course not. Even Loney will tell you that (OK, maybe not). What goes up must come down, and when those big numbers come down, they will plummet, fast, because Loney ain't hitting .370 this season, and it doesn't take a<a href=\"http://sports.nyhistory.org/steve-hirdt/\"> Steve Hirdt</a> to know that. Still, Rays fans should enjoy it while it lasts, like Mets fans enjoyed John Buck's early season offense show, because when it stops, and you're sitting in that dome in August thinking, \"hey, remember back when Loney was playing like Ty Cobb?\" it will mostly feel like it never happened at all. </p><p>At some point the Rays pitching will get a lot better (they're a whopping 10th in AL ERA) and their offense will get worse, which is normal for them. For now, six wins in eight games and a move to .500 has helped the team move past their dismal start to 2013 as normal service gets set to resume in that crowded AL East where it's anyone's game, and that may even include Toronto.  </p><h2>Desperate Dodgers</h2><p>If you don't think Dodgers manager Don Mattingly is feeling the heat out in Los Angeles just look at this number - 132. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/35903/dont-freak-out-over-kershaws-132-pitches\">That's how many pitches Clayton Kershaw threw against Washington</a> in a tight game he had to have on Tuesday at Chavez Ravine. His team snapped an <a href=\"http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_05_11_miamlb_lanmlb_1&amp;mode=recap_home&amp;c_id=la\">eight game skid</a> on Saturday night and is desperate for wins to keep in touch in the NL West. Knowing there was a chance to get a pair of w's in two nights with Zack Greinke set to make an early return from a broken collarbone on Wednesday, Mattingly stuck it out with Kershaw, some 15 pitches longer than he had all season long. Following a two-out 10-pitch war in the Washington ninth with Adam LaRoche, one that ended in a single for the Nats slugger, the Dodgers skipper finally came out to get his man, bringing in Kenley Jansen to shut the door on D.C. to secure a 2-0 win for the home team. On a night where Kershaw threw 8.2 innings of shutout ball, striking out 11 batters, the lefty passed the 1000 career innings threshold, holding the lowest ERA, 2.70, among live ball era starters with that many innings. </p><p>The next night <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-dodgers-nationals-zack-greinke-20130515,0,4447085.story\">Greinke was back and looking determined</a> on the hill, allowing just a single run in 5.1 innings in his first start since the injury on April 11th. Greinke, who came back a full month earlier than expected, was wincing after swinging and missing at a ball out of the strike zone, but hit an RBI single in the same at-bat to give LA a 2-0 lead. Why he was swinging with a rod in his clavicle I have no idea but it was the difference in the game as Los Angeles were victorious in their second straight air-tight game, one that helped to reboot of the Kershaw-Greinke combo just as they drew it up.</p><p>Elsewhere in Los Angeles or Anaheim, or which ever you'd like to call it, Angels owner Arte Moreno announced that there was zero chance that under fire Halos skipper Mike Scioscia would be fired. The Angels are amongst the most disappointing teams in baseball in previous seasons and rumors have ben rife that Scioscia could be on his way out, and possibly over to the Dodgers in order to replace Mattingly if he were fired. Moreno told <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/los-angeles-angels-manager-mike-scioscia-job-not-in-danger-says-owner-arte-moreno-051613\">FOXsports.com</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Mike has zero problems, OK? This is his 14th year. Mike goes beyond what he does on the field. He's a good person. He's a good person in the community. A very good baseball guy. You don't have to ask me. You just ask other managers, other baseball people.\"</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/\">MLB standings</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/408967173|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|be6b50099fad81d1bdd0791af937b9388bac0b77 -->",

        "body":"<h2>Chew on this</h2><p>Did you hear the one about the Cubs <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-wrigley-upgrades-20130501,0,4919937.story\">leaving Wrigley Field?</a> That's not a joke actually, at least according to their owner, Tom Ricketts, who threatened to leave the storied ballpark should the Cubs not gain government approval for the proposed <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-0501-wrigley-stadium-20130501,0,1930407.story\">$300m renovation</a>, one which he is paying for privately. It's a bizarre statement considering the cooperation the city and the Cubs seemed to be enjoying in negotiating the<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=wrigley+field+renovation+photos&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bvGBUYLIEqSn0QWo0oHgDA&amp;ved=0CC4QsAQ&amp;biw=1309&amp;bih=708\"> scope of work in and around the 99-year-old iconic park.</a> It includes an enormous scoreboard that would dominate left field and additional signage in right field. According to the Cubs, the 6000 square foot screen would allow the Cubs to earn tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue. It could also block the view of fans watching their Cubbies from on the rooftops overlooking the old park. Owners of the buildings that host fans have a deal with the team to provide them with <a href=\"http://3639wrigleyrooftop.com/\">17% of their revenue -</a> blocking that vista could result in lawsuits.</p><p>Said Ricketts:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"All we really need is to be able to run our business like a business and not a museum.\" </p></blockquote><p>He's half right, it's a business, a business that's as good as it is today precisely because it's a museum, a beautiful, one-of-a-kind baseball museum. </p><p>Ricketts is doing a public service by keeping the people out of these costly renovations, but the museum comment is a bit inflammatory and thus leads to this follow up question for Chicago's owner -  if Wrigley Field wasn't a museum, do you think anyone would turn up to watch the misery that has been Cubs baseball for a significant portion of the 100 plus years they've been seeking a World Series title? Do you think they would <a href=\"http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/cubsatte.shtml\">draw as well as they would</a> if they played in some corporate pseudo-throwback shopping mall in <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/9111997/rosemont-mayor-brad-stephens-ready-talk-chicago-cubs\">Rosemont, the town that has offered the Cubs enough free land</a> to house as big a scoreboard as needed? Those loveable losers lost 101 games last season, and yet, they still drew over 2.8m fans. The Astros lost 107 games and couldn't even fill up half their park. Now, why do you think that is? I don't have an Elias supercomputer at my fingertips, but if I did, I would be willing to gamble that it would reveal that 2.8m in attendance is either a record for teams that have lost 100 games, or pretty close to it. </p><p>That Ricketts is willing to shoulder the $300m costs of the <a href=\"http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2013/5/1/4289478/wrigley-renovations-restoration-cubs-tom-ricketts\">renovation</a> and an additional $200m for around the ballpark is a tremendous story considering the way most owners have fleeced taxpayers for stadium upgrades over the last 20 years (*see Miami), and Ricketts should be celebrated for that. However, he shouldn't lose sight of the secret to the Cubs' charming existence - it's the field, stupid.</p><h2>A National scare</h2><p>Washington have endured a difficult start to their 2013 season, and for a period on Monday night, it looked to be getting worse, a lot worse. Stephen Strasburg spooked Nats fans as they watched the team ace pitch in Atlanta - the 24-year-old pitcher who was shut down in September of last season in an attempt to protect his long term health was on the mound,<a href=\"http://mlb.si.com/2013/04/30/stephen-strasburg-nationals-forearm-tightness/\"> shaking out his arm</a>, struggling with his control. In the end he gave up just two runs in six innings, striking out eight, walking four in a no-decision that extended his winless streak to five, but his body language was of much greater concern than his line. After the game, Strasburg said he wouldn't miss a start, while Davey Johnson looked like he'd seen a ghost. </p><p>As it happens, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/wp/2013/04/30/stephen-strasburg-structurally-perfect-not-expected-to-miss-a-start-after-forearm-tightness/\">Strasburg seems to be just fine</a>, physically that is. It's the tightness of his personality that may be more of a detriment to the pitcher in the long term, which is one reason why skipper Johnson has urged his ace to chill out a bit: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I just wish he would get to the point where he doesn't put so many high demands on himself. That he just goes out and has a little more fun. That may take a while.\"</p></blockquote><p>More revealing was Johnson saying \"He's awfully good. If he didn't have this kind of media coverage he would be better off.\"</p><p>Maybe, but the press aren't going away anytime soon, and when the hurler walks away from reporters muttering \"what a joke\", as he did on Monday, it's not a good sign. </p><p>Neither was the wince on the face of Bryce Harper, Washington's other franchise piece,<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals/bryce-harper-leaves-with-apparent-injury-in-nationals-2-0-win-over-braves/2013/05/01/ac3d796a-b2c8-11e2-9a98-4be1688d7d84_story.html\"> who grimaced after a check swing on Wednesday</a> night against the Braves. Harper finished the at-bat, grounding out, but was pulled from the game. Luckily for the struggling Nats, the pain was not coming from a dreaded lat, but rather, pain left over from a bruise he suffered a night earlier. Once again, Washington, the team that finished with a losing April had bitten the bullet, and were able to win their first game in May to boot - a 2-0 victory over first place Atlanta. Perhaps a flip of the calendar is just what the Nationals need to get their season going. </p><h2>Russell muscle</h2><p>The Yankees<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/sports/baseball/yankees-lose-russell-martin-to-the-pirates.html\"> didn't have the money</a> to meet Russell Martin's financial demands but the Pittsburgh Pirates did. Talk about role reversals, usually the road leads out of Western Pennsylvania to bigger and brighter destinations, but not with Martin, whose departure left the suddenly pauper-like Yankees without a number one catcher. Not that Martin was something to be excited about for Bucs fans - we're talking about a <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/martiru01.shtml\">bat that hit .211,</a> even if he did manage 21 homers. Today, Martin is an unlikely spark plug in the Bucs lineup, one that helped Pittsburgh recover from a 1-5 start to climb to within a half game in the bumper-to-bumper NL Central division despite dropping two of three to first place Milwaukee. The catcher who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/sports/baseball/yankees-russell-martin-banged-up-worn-down-and-heading-home.html?pagewanted=all\">grew up in Montreal </a>has an OPS of over .900, by far a career high, and was just named National League Player of the Week thanks to a .958 slugging percentage and 23 total bases. It's hard to believe, especially for a fan base that was confused (a polite way of describing it) by the two-year $17m deal he was signed to, but Martin is Pittsburgh's <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=f&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.rantsports.com/mlb/2013/05/01/pittsburgh-pirates-team-mvp-after-april-is-russell-martin/&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;ei=OmmCUYSsIIuT0AXN5oCACA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFUt07bqIFIc3MIoNGD6ve7PqNM6w\">April MVP</a>, if there is such a thing. If you don't buy such a notion just consider that defensively, Martin has also managed to go from throwing out just six percent of base runners in 2012 to 38 percent this time around. Most importantly, Martin is a believer that his Buccos are a capable group that can do more than just eclipsing .500 for the first time in 20 years. </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We have power, we play good defense and the key is to be consistent and do it every day and we've been doing it every day...The key is to just keep on doing what we're doing right now.</p></blockquote><h2>Tater Tuesday</h2><p>Visit a ballpark on any given night and there's a good chance you'll see at least one home run. Heading into Tuesday's play, Major League Baseball was averaging just under a dinger a game, or <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2013.shtml\">0.97 to be exact,</a> a paltry number that was knocked <em>way</em> out of the park as stadiums around North America became full fledged launch pads that night. Hitters piled up no fewer than 50 round trippers, or an average of 3.33 a game, more than three times the norm. Cleveland had seven of the nine home runs in their game against Philadelphia, one in which the Tribe's Ryan Rayburn <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_04_30_phimlb_clemlb_1&amp;mode=video&amp;content_id=26729659&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_26729659\">hit a pair of long balls</a>, bringing his two day (and season) total to four. <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_04_30_bosmlb_tormlb_1&amp;mode=video&amp;content_id=26728753&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_26728753\">Edwin Encarnacion</a> also had two shots for the Blue Jays against the Red Sox, including this one to the upper reaches of the Rogers Centre, a place where <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb5_TPBHF0k\">Manny Ramirez once visited in 2001. </a></p><p>Encarnacion is tied for the American League lead with Chris Davis of the Orioles and Mike Morse of Seattle who have all hit nine homers. On baseball's big bopping night,  Justin Upton was actually held in the park, a rarity these days with the newly acquired Braves slugger leading the NL with 12 homers. <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_04_30_colmlb_lanmlb_1&amp;mode=video&amp;content_id=26739423&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_26739423\">Hanley Ramirez, on his bobblehead giveaway night,</a> did have a big fly however, as his Dodgers beat the Rockies with the help of his first tater since his fast track return from thumb surgery. Only one game failed to yield a home run - the Mets and Marlins, who combined to score just three runs on a night where eight teams hit at least three balls into the outfield seats. </p><h2>No fork in New York</h2><p>The Yankees finished April with a 16-10 record, two games behind Boston in second place in the AL East, and they have to be absolutely ecstatic. Their injury issues are well documented - Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, Mark Teixeira and <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/9232833/new-york-yankees-get-curtis-granderson-kevin-youkilis-back-middle-may\">Curtis Granderson </a>were out when the season began, and now Francisco Cervelli, Ivan Nova and the latest, Kevin Youkilis (<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/yankees/2013/04/did-yankees-make-a-mistake-with-youk-injury\">whose back situation was mismanaged by management</a>) are also on a DL that features $95,590,950 worth of idle Yankees. There are 16 Major League teams that <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/mlb--mlb-opening-day-team-payrolls--infographic--172007462.html\">count lower payrolls</a> than the Yanks DL roster, and of those teams, three are either in first place - Atlanta, Kansas City and Colorado - plus Oakland, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and Arizona within 2.5 games or less of first. Outside of fun stats like that, the Yankees have to be commended after getting contributions from unlikely sources such as Travis Hafner and <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130410&amp;content_id=44407966&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb\">Vernon Wells</a>, left for dead by almost everyone except Yanks GM Brian Cashman, combining for 13 homers. Lyle Overbay is playing his usual quality first base and while providing pop, Youkilis and Cervelli made major contributions before going down, and are getting a bit more than the usual from Cano, who is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/apr/02/yankees-jay-z-robinson-cano-roc-nationhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/apr/02/yankees-jay-z-robinson-cano-roc-nation\">making the most of his contract year</a>, tearing it up and posting a .988 OPS. The pitching hasn't been spectacular, but they've gotten the usual from Andy Pettitte (minus his last start when he was shelled by Houston of all teams), a steadying C.C. Sabathia, an ace-like Hiroki Kuroda, and the standard from Mariano Rivera. The back of the rotation needs some help and David Robertson hasn't been quite up to speed, but they're more than hanging around - New York are tied for the third best record in baseball. Let's see how they hold up with three at home to Oakland before heading out on a long trip to Colorado, Kansas City and Cleveland.</p><h2><a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings#20130430\">Major League Baseball standings</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/408177998|2013-11-05T11:03:58Z|559d8c7c08263ff81fa73086c0875c7604daf6d9 -->",
