        "trailText":"<strong>Paul Rees:</strong> With the future of European rugby still far from certain, Wales's four regions are running out of time to secure their better out-of-contract players for next season",
        "headline":"Wales regions in limbo and pondering future without prime assets",
        "body":"<p>These may be taxing times for the Welsh regions, struggling to keep their heads above water despite liquidity problems, but there could be no excuses for the abject display of Cardiff Blues in the opening half at Exeter on Sunday, opponents with considerably less Heineken Cup experience who are in the middle tier of the Premiership.</p><p>The regions are concerned, with the future of European club rugby still to be settled, that they will lack the means to make realistic offers to players who are out of contract at the end of the season, including Leigh Halfpenny, Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Jonathan Davies.</p><p>They will need to tie them down before the end of the year, when they will be able to speak to potential new employers, but with the market value of those who were an integral part of the Lions' success in Australia in the summer increasing by at least 50%, they need an increase in revenue just to stand still: if there is no Heineken Cup, or a replacement, they will be some £1.5m worse off each.</p><p>The regions had hoped to resolve the contract issues before the start of next month's internationals: Warburton and Davies have publicly said that they want to stay with the Blues and the Scarlets respectively, but they are in limbo, not far from the point when they will have to look at other options.</p><p>The Blues fielded 13 internationals, five of whom were Lions, at Sandy Park but they looked a team of novices, 41–3 down before they found it in them to respond. They showed no spirit in adversity and neither, more surprisingly, did Ospreys at home to Leinster on Saturday night.</p><p>Alex Cuthbert, the Wales and Lions wing, scored two tries for the Blues and was their one player who rose above the mess, wearing such a look of disbelief in the first-half that if it as if he were asking himself why he last season signed a three-year contract extension with the region.</p><p>Similarly the Ospreys captain, Alun Wyn Jones, had to suppress his anger when discussing the defeat to Leinster a few minutes after the final whistle.  Jones has played for Ospreys all his senior career and the region regards him as the central figure in the squad, someone worth even as much off the field as he is on it, but whereas his heart will tell him to sign a new deal, once figures are attached  his head may tell him that, at the age of 28, it may be time to leave.</p><p>While the Blues had no excuses for their abject start against Exeter, Ospreys had a bench made up largely of emerging players against Leinster, a consequence of injuries and a budget that is lower than their French, English and Irish rivals. They had no one to turn a game that was ebbing from them and the fear of all four regions is that, if there is a European settlement, they will play no part in it and could end up poorer  in relative, if not real, terms.</p><p>The Welsh Rugby Union, which in recent years has been more of a rival than a support to its regions, has said it alone will be involved in whatever form negotiations take, with European Rugby Cup Ltd's survival prospects looking more remote by the day. The regions will remain on the outside.</p><p>The WRU's policy has been to find an ERC solution, that is to perpetuate the Heineken Cup, but the obduracy of the French and English clubs, who are adamant they will not after this season play in a tournament organised by ERC - and unlike previous disputes over Europe, in 1998 and 2006–07, they have not gone into the conference room naked, having armed themselves with what they describe as a lucrative television deal - has prompted it to consider an alternative.</p><p>Premiership Rugby has not specified exactly how much its BT television deal would add to the £44m shared by the six nations from the Heineken Cup. A figure of £70m has been quoted, but that would leave the four Welsh regions barely better off if the English and French clubs' demand for a three-way split between the leagues that feed into the European tournaments is accepted.</p><p>Currently, the four RaboDirect Pro 12 unions have 52% of the pot with the English and French clubs each banking 24%. If the pot increased to £70m and was divided three ways, the Rabo nations would have £23.33m, barely more than the £23m they had last season. It is understood that there is a proposal that 15% of the total should be apportioned on a merit basis: if that happened, the £70m would shrivel to less than £60m, meaning the basic sum for all three leagues would be less than £20m.</p><p>The Rabo unions share their money disproportionately, with Italy and Scotland receiving more per team than Ireland and Wales. The ideal for the four regions would be a division by 12, the number of teams in the Pro 12, which would give them a similar increase to the English and French clubs.</p><p>They will have no say in the carve-up, being reliant on the WRU, and the governing body has yet to say that it will be looking to secure the best possible deal for its professional sides. Its priority is to get the regions to sign a participation agreement with the union to replace the one that runs out at the end of the season, with the offer of an extra £1m to help retain players if they do.</p><p>The fear of the regions is that the WRU is waiting for the day when they collapse and the union will then set up its own sides, two or three in number and run them in the manner of Ireland's provinces.</p><p>It is a reason why the mood in the regions is so down, notwithstanding the Scarlets' ebullient display at Harlequins. They feel they will be worse off whatever the European outcome, losing not just their Lions but the next wave of Wales internationals. Their destiny will be decided by others and they need to find a way to get involved in the discussions.</p><p></p><p>• <a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/email/subscribe?emailListId=219\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Breakdown, our free weekly take on the world of rugby union.

        "headline":"Talking Horses: Final entries for Champions Day, Thursday's best bets",
        "body":"<h2>Today's best bets, by Chris Cook<br /></h2><p>The final declarations are out for Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday, with the immediate point of interest being the fact that Ryan Moore is aboard Ruler Of The World in the Champion Stakes, rather than Hillstar. It appears that Sir Michael Stoute has let him off Hillstar, so that he can maintain his association with the Aidan O'Brien-trained Derby winner. If you'd backed Hillstar, you'd have to be worried about that, though Richard Hughes is a pretty darned good substitute.</p><p>Perhaps it's a one-off arrangement that has no significance for future riding contracts. Moore has yet to offer public comment but I don't imagine for a moment that he would be rash enough to do a Dettori and jump ship without making sure the boss was OK with it.</p><p>The fields for Champions Day have held up pretty well, despite the prospect of soft going, with an average of 11 runners in the Group races. The withdrawals were widely predicted: Toronado, Sky Lantern, Declaration Of War, Magician, Sole Power and Trading Leather are the most significant.</p><p>There has been a further 1mm of rain at Ascot this morning and the going remains soft all round. The rest of today is expected to be dry but showers are forecast tomorrow and on Saturday.</p><p>Here are the declared runners for the <strong>Queen Elizabeth II Stakes</strong>:</p><p>Burwaaz<br />Caspar Netscher<br />Gordon Lord Byron<br />Gregorian<br />Maxios<br />Soft Falling Rain<br />Dawn Approach<br />Elusive Kate<br />Kingsbarns<br />Leitir Mor<br />Olympic Glory<br />Top Notch Tonto</p><p>And here are those entered for the <strong>Champion Stakes</strong>:</p><p>Cirrus Des Aigles<br />Farhh<br />Hunter's Light<br />Main Sequence<br />Mukhadram<br />Parish Hall<br />Hillstar<br />Morandi<br />Ruler Of The World<br />Triple Threat<br /><a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings/0,14906,17-10-2013%5E2,00.html\"><br />You can see declarations for all Saturday's Flat races here</a>.</p><p>I like the look of the QEII. The Champion Stakes, I'm afraid, has not attracted the sort of field that the prize money deserves. Still, that's what happens when the ground turns at this time of year: the fast, flashy animals don't turn up.</p><p>But it seems there is no prospect of moving Champions Day to an earlier point in the year, so we're just going to have to keep hoping for unseasonably dry weather for Ascot in mid-October. Jumps fans will simultaneously be hoping for plenty of rain in the West Country, so that Cheltenham's first autumn fixture can offer safe, spongey ground on the same weekend.</p><p>Cheltenham's two-day meeting starts tomorrow. To tide us over, there's Wincanton this afternoon, when I think <strong>Sugar Hiccup (2.20) </strong>has an excellent chance of extending her winning run to four.</p><p>Sugar Hiccup is another of those Jim Best-trained beasts who showed nothing in novice hurdles, was given a break and then showed dramatic improvement in handicaps. Best is not uniformly popular among punters but at least we should all be familiar with the fact that his horses do sometimes follow this kind of career arc.</p><p>Eventually, arcs return to earth, of course, and Sugar Hiccup will be beaten one day soon. She has been raised 33lb, more than two stones, since the first of her three recent wins, on 22 August, and it is hard to believe she can still have anything in hand.</p><p>But she has had a month off since her last outing and should again be ready to put in her maximum effort. The runner-up that day has since won from a 5lb higher mark, while the third was beaten 20 lengths.</p><p>Sugar Hiccup really might be able to win again from a mark 8lb higher than last time. The market will be wary because Tony McCoy, who has such a great record for Best and was aboard for all three of the mares' wins, has gone to Uttoxeter today. The ride passes to Tom Scudamore, but he also has a good record for the yard (nine winners at 19% over five seasons) and I like their chances at the current 5-1.</p><p>The favourite is Buckthorn Tom, from the Colin Tizzard yard that has yet to hit its stride. Tizzard is 0/16 in October so far.</p><p>McCoy has a couple of good rides at Uttoxeter, notably <strong>Foundation Man (4.30)</strong>, making his chase debut in a novice handicap. He has always had the look of a chaser and has the family connections for this game, as well, being a half-brother to Captain Chris and a son of Function Dream, who won the Victor Chandler and beat Flagship Uberalles in the Game Spirit.</p><p>Foundation Man has been handicapped on his hurdles form and should have plenty in hand if ready to go today. Still, at 5-2, the bookies are not giving much away and it's a pity the going has gone soft.</p><h2>Flat racing tips, by Greg Wood<br /></h2><p>The going will be soft for the final afternoon of the season at Brighton and one of the shortest-priced horses of the year, too, in the opening maiden, but the bulk of the card is competitive, with a couple of very open handicaps later in the afternoon.</p><p><strong>Compton Bird (3.40)</strong> is up 8lb since winning over course and distance last week but did so in a style which suggested she stands every chance of following up.

        "body":"<p>When Peter Morgan wrote Rush <a href=\"http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/rush-screenwriter-peter-morgans-10-year-rule-for-biopics.php\">he didn't include any motor racing in the screenplay</a> as he assumed that, even if the film was ever made, it would not be backed with a budget large enough to afford F1 cars. Morgan should have shown a little more faith in his creation.</p><p>Rush took over £2m on its opening weekend, climbed to the top of the UK box office charts on its second week in cinemas, and audiences have scored it 93% on Rotten Tomatoes and 8.3 on IMDB. Even Niki Lauda approved. \"When I saw it the first time, I was impressed,\" said the driver whose rivalry with James Hunt is captured onscreen. \"It was very accurate. There were no Hollywood changes. I wish James had been here to see the movie. It would have been the best.\"</p><p>The success of Rush may have surprised Morgan, but we are now living in the era of the credible sports films. A few years ago Ron Howard would have struggled to find the $50m required to make a feature film about a sport that remains of niche interest to American viewers. The suits would probably not have thrown their money behind a story about two drivers who contested an F1 season 37 years ago until one of them stopped racing due to heavy rain. </p><p>But sports films have moved on from the days when down-and-out sportsmen came back from the brink to overcome the odds and bore their viewers with a tale of rags-to-riches success. Gone are the clichéd days of Goal! III, Mike Bassett and There's Only One Jimmy Grimble. </p><p>Instead we are now treated to serious films made by serious film-makers. Alex Gibney, who has previously shot documentaries about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron:_The_Smartest_Guys_in_the_Room\">Enron</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Steal_Secrets:_The_Story_of_WikiLeaks\">WikiLeaks</a> and the death of an Afghan taxi driver who was beaten by American soldiers, will show his new film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=ukOJ_1b-8lQ\">The Armstrong Lie</a> at the London Film Festival this week. Stephen Frears, whose documentary about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/04/muhammad-ali-vietnam-draft-richard-williams\">Muhammad Ali's refusal to fight in the Vietnam War </a> aired on Sky Atlantic last weekend, is reportedly lined up to shoot a feature film about Armstrong. For viewers without access to the London Film Festival and Sky Atlantic, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/oct/17/why-the-crash-reel-is-the-one-film-you-should-see-this-week-video\">this week's must-see cinema release, The Crash Reel,</a> is about a champion snowboarder laid low by a traumatic brain injury. </p><p>Howard was attracted to Rush – and was able to fund his movie – on the back of the worldwide success of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/ayrton-senna-alain-prost\">Senna</a>, which broke <a href=\"http://edendale.typepad.com/weblog/2011/07/senna-breaks-uk-box-office-records-for-documentary.html\">UK box office records on its release</a> and went on to win the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9M_o9INS_o\">Bafta for best documentary in 2012</a>. </p><p>The success of films such as Rush, Senna and The Damned United has made sports movies a legitimate genre again. If films about Brian Clough's six weeks with Leeds United can bring in viewers and Oscar-winning directors want to tell the story of the 1976 F1 World Championship, what could come next? The forgotten story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/14/forgotten-story-reading-1985-86-season\">Reading's record start to the 1985-86 season</a>?

        "body":"<p>Only one of three Burgess brothers will start for England in their World Cup warm-up game against Italy in Salford on Saturday. Sam Burgess, the eldest and most established of the three siblings included in the squad, has been named at loose-forward with George, one of the 21-year-old twins, on a seven-man interchange bench.</p><p>Tom Burgess, who only forced his way into the South Sydney team late in the National Rugby League season and was therefore a surprise inclusion in the England squad, is one of two players, along with Zak Hardaker of Leeds, who drop into a Knights team to face Samoa in the first part of a double header at the City of Salford Stadium.</p><p>Perhaps significantly, Hardaker is listed at centre, rather than at full-back, where he has played all season for Leeds – suggesting that the England coach, Steve McNamara, sees him as a possible contender for that position, which has become a problem area since the loss of the Yorkshire-born Brisbane Broncos centre Jack Reed through injury.</p><p>McNamara has switched Carl Ablett, another Leeds player who has spent most of the season in the second row, to the centre against Italy, where he will be partnered by Huddersfield's Leroy Cudjoe, with the fourth centre contender, Kallum Watkins, on the interchange bench.</p><p>Other eye-catching and potentially significant selections are Tom Briscoe ahead of Josh Charnley on the wing and Michael McIlorum ahead of James Roby at hooker. But McNamara will be anxious to avoid giving too much away to Australia's coach, Tim Sheens, who has chosen not to arrange a warm-up game in the run-in to the tournament opener, between England and the Kangaroos, at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on Saturday week.</p><p>Two members of England's 24-man squad were not considered – Sean O'Loughlin, the Wigan captain who has played only two matches in the past two months because of achilles problems, and the Warrington second-row Ben Westwood, who is suspended.</p><h2>England team to play Italy, Saturday 4.30pm</h2><p>S Tomkins (Wigan); Briscoe (Hull), Cudjoe (Huddersfield), Ablett (Leeds), Hall (Leeds); Chase (Castleford), Sinfield (Leeds, capt); Graham (Canterbury), McIlorum (Wigan), Mossop (Wigan), Hock (Widnes), Farrell (Wigan), S Burgess (South Sydney).

One of the games between these two offensive powerhouses was going to be a high-scoring affair, unfortunately for the Red Sox it was on their watch. So tomorrow night's game five becomes vitally important. We'll continue with our MLB Playoffs coverage here at the Guardian tomorrow, but that will wrap things up for today. Thanks for following along with us tonight. especially everyone who contributed tweets and emails.

Avila fouls off Peavy's next pitch to keep the count the same. Comerica gets <em><strong>loud</strong></em>, they want to see runs too it seems.</p> <p>And Avila fouls one off of his foot, which always looks painful. Still 3-2 here.

David Lengel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/st-louis-cardinals-la-dodgers-live\">has the blow-by-blow right here</a>. Interestingly enough, the big blasts were from Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez, the big contract players the Red Sox sent to L.A. in last year's Nick Punto Trade. That still seems to be working for both teams, doesn't it. The Dodgers are still one loss away from elimination, but they have Clayton Kershaw going for game six and, well, we know how game sevens can go.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525f1ba6e4b0760efba2ae7f\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T00:06:40.395+01:00\">7.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Just as all the experts predicted, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/15/boston-red-sox-detroit-tigers-live\">Boston Red Sox pitcher John Lackey outdueled the Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander in Comerica Park to pick up a 2-1 lead in the American Championship Serie</a>s. Okay, maybe nobody really expected that. After all, it was just 2011 when John Lackey, in year two of a mega contract, had one of the worst seasons a Boston starter had ever had and was nearly run out of Boston for his role in the whole &quot;chicken and beer&quot; clubhouse controversy. Well, a year removed from Tommy John surgery, Lackey has been very good for the Red Sox, <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/alcs-game-3-john-lackey-boston-red-sox-gem-detroit-tigers-justin-verlander-miguel-cabrera-prince-fielder-mike-napoli-101513\">none better than yesterday's outing where he limited a potent Tigers lineup to four hits, no walks and no runs throughout 6 2/3 innings</a>. The Red Sox held on to win 1-0, with the only real blemish on two-time Cy Young winner Justin Verlander's box score being a solo home run from Boston's first baseman Mike Napoli, who had yet to put a ball into the play during the series when he launched his 7th inning blast.</p> <p>While no team wants to be down 1-2 in a seven game series, especially when those two losses waste incredible performances by their top two pitchers (Verlander, game two starter Max Scherzer), this series is far from over. Now if Detroit doesn't win tonight, that might be a different story, as the Tigers can't realistically afford to drop to 1-3 and expect to win two games at Fenway Park. This puts some pressure on tonight's s starter Doug Fister, who had been their number two pitcher before Scherzer's breakthrough and the arrival of Anibal Sanchez. The Red Sox counter with Jake Peavy, the former San Diego Padres ace most recently a veteran rotation anchor for the Chicago White Sox.</p> <p>The Red Sox acquired Peavy in a trade that also sent defensive wizard Jose Iglesias to, interestingly enough, the Detroit Tigers. For whatever reason, perhaps the same reason that people don't believe in climate change or dinosaurs (hello Carl Everett), <a href=\"http://www.lucidsportsfan.com/2013/07/why-im-not-fan-of-jose-iglesias-for.html\">many Red Sox fans hated the move to trade a defense-first shortstop/nine-hole hitter for a starting pitcher who stabilized a rotation that lacked Clay Buchholz for most of the season</a>. If Peavy has a poor game, and Iglesias does anything special (he's normally good for one Web Gem every week or so) we should expect a lot of second guessing and &quot;why can't we get players like that&quot; rants emitting from Boston.</p> <p>While good, Peavy's still a tick below Lester, Lackey and Buchholz-if-healthy, combine that with Fthe fact that Fister pitches to contact more than his strikeout-machine teammates in the Tigers rotation. So, tonight might end up being a more of an offensive battle than the first three games of the context. Don't expect any no-hitter alerts, in other words. As much as we love pitcher's duels, and yesterday's was one for the ages, it would be nice to see the bats awaken a bit tonight. No matter how the game goes, we'll still be using your emails (send them to <a href=\"mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com\">Hunter.Felt.Freelance@theguardian.com</a>) and tweets (to <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a>) throughout the game.

        "body":"<p>David Warner has found form at just the right time, blasting a ruthless century for NSW against Queensland in the Ryobi Cup.</p><p>Warner has endured a lean spell at both international and domestic level, and was dropped from the Australian one-day side because of poor form.</p><p>He enjoyed a brilliant innings on Thursday though, taking advantage of the batsman-friendly North Sydney Oval. Warner smashed 139 off 126 balls to reassert himself in the minds of selectors. In all, he hammered 13 fours and six sixes in his innings.</p><p>Warner's animated celebration upon bringing up his century from 96 balls, gave an indication of how much he needed a big score. However, his jubilation later turned to disgust, when he spooned one down the ground off Michael Neser.</p><p>Nonetheless, it was a major personal victory for Warner. To start the Ryobi Cup the left-hander had fallen for 4, 0 and 17, with pressure beginning to mount on his Test spot.</p><p>Warner missed the opening two Tests of the Ashes series in England after he was stood down for the Champions Trophy for punching Joe Root in a nightclub. He forced his way back into the team for the third Test at Manchester, after scoring a massive ton for Australia A in South Africa, but despite a 71 in the fourth Test at Chester-le-Street his place at the top of the Australian order was far from secure in a batting line-up that was struggling for consistency.</p><p>Warner was given a slap on the wrist for missing a Sydney grade match, and was warned by NSW chief executive Andrew Jones to cut out off-field distractions. Thursday, though, saw Warner return to his free-hitting best, as he scored his runs all around the ground.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420208790|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|1163d61dea3f5e9d5290cca7e9165628d43e3c62 -->",

        "body":"<p>The former Test bowler Craig McDermott will return as Australian bowling coach ahead of the Ashes series.</p><p>McDermott shocked Cricket Australia when he quit his post in May 2012 after a successful 12 months in the role.</p><p>He returns in a revised role specialising as Test bowling coach, with the incumbent Ali de Winter moving into a new position overseeing the limited overs' pace bowlers.</p><p>\"There is obviously a huge focus on regaining the Ashes this summer and I'll work as hard as possible to prepare our bowlers for the challenge ahead,\" McDermott said.</p><p>De Winter said he enjoyed coaching the T20 and 50-over formats and was excited by the \"challenge\" of his new role.</p><p>During his previous tenure, McDermott was credited for revitalising Peter Siddle and Ben Hilfenhaus and he was also behind the introduction of James Pattinson, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc into Test cricket. His philosophy was simple, wanting Australia's pace attack to bowl full and swing the ball.</p><p>McDermott said on Thursday he will work with Siddle on his consistency. \"I would like to get him [Siddle] up just a little bit higher with his consistency,\" said McDermott. \"We've got to have four-to-six guys bowling well from a fast bowling point of view to bowl in conjunction with our spinners ... we've got to make sure they're all firing.</p><p>\"I'd just like to talk to [Siddle] about a few things I've noticed over the last couple of months, and the same with a number of the other bowlers I've been watching on TV around the place.\"</p><p>McDermott added he would be taking a look at Mitchell Johnson. \"He's changed his run up, he's well balanced ... he's getting through the crease and his arm is higher than what it used to be,\" McDermott said. \"He's bowling anywhere between 145 and 153kph over the last couple of months ... and, if you're up around those figures and moving the ball a little bit either way, it's a handful and certainly his bouncer will be a handful as well.</p><p>\"We've got some good young guys in behind the scenes, who have been on some tours of late in Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Coulter-Nile. Obviously there's Ben Hilfenhaus who is back in the fray, fully fit.\"</p><p>In 2012, McDermott said he was quitting because of the impact of touring life on his young family. However, the narrowed role means McDermott won't have to spend as much time on the road and can work with the state and BBL teams in Australia.</p><p>\"Appointing coaches to specific roles is something the team performance department has been considering for some time,\" said the general manager of team performance, Pat Howard. \"Given the amount of cricket played now in all three forms of the game, we've been considering our coaching structure to get the best out of the players across the varied formats.\"</p><p>The Australia head coach, Darren Lehmann, said with the ICC World Twenty20 and the 50-over World Cup coming up over the next two years, it was important to specialise the assistant coaching role.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420200477|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|e141d9855ad437d35f614e02b29b60f87f0c4d74 -->",

Fail to garner a victory against the St Louis Cardinals in Game Five of the National League Championship Series, and their playoffs will be over. It's that simple.</p> <p>Back in June, with the Dodgers languishing in last place of the NL West, their wheels spinning, a squad chock full of injured players and their manager,<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/dodgers/la-sp-dodgers-notes-20131016,0,5763829.story\"> Don Mattingly, on the verge of being fired</a>, the Dodgers were also badly in need wins. LA responded with <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130818&amp;content_id=57367754&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb\">a once in a generation run - 42 wins in 50 games</a>, a stretch inspired by the emergence of the 22-year-old Cuban, Yasiel Puig, whose five tools and raw enthusiasm helped to propel Los Angeles to the playoffs.</p> <p>That they reached the postseason helped validate the work done by the Dodgers new owners,&nbsp;Guggenheim Baseball Management, whose public face is former LA Lakers hall-of-fame Magic Johnson. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303404704577309850685211084\">After purchasing the team for a whopping $2.15b,</a> the group set about undoing the damage of former hated Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who did his best to cripple the franchise. That they were able to dramatically turn their season around meant that the over <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/2013-payrolls-and-salaries-for-every-mlb-team-462765594\">$200m committed to players</a> on the field was money well spent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately for their ownership and fans, the playoffs are a crap shoot where payroll means nothing. And so here they are, months later, back in a desperate situation with health issues that ring familiar. The Dodgers winning percentage is above .600 with shortstop Hanley Ramirez in the lineup, below .500 without him, so it's a good sign that he's playing tonight&nbsp;vs the Cardinals - but after striking out three time in Game Four, how much can he contribute? Andre Ethier is still not healthy enough to play near his capabilities in center field, while Matt Kemp, his season long over, can only watch - yes, Dodger fans have seen this show before, and it doesn't end well. Even if Zack Greinke is on the mound tonight and Clayton Kershaw pitches a potential Game Six back in St Louis, LA will still need to <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2013_NLCS.shtml\">catch more than their share of breaks to rip off three straight games against these Cardinals.</a></p> <p>St. Louis are a deserving team, loaded with talent, also benefiting from facing these Dodgers at just the right time - but don't take anything away from them. Their league leading offense is also missing a vital cog in Allen Craig, but what they have put on the field is showing signs of regaining hitting form. Matt <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/15/st-louis-cardinals-la-dodgers-live\">Holliday's monster two-run home run in Game Four</a> is proof of that, the slumping Matt Carpenter also had himself a double last night. If that hitting spreads down to through the lineup, to Yadier Molina and David Freese, the Dodgers chances for a comeback grow even slimmer.&nbsp;</p> <p>St Louis brings back one of their prized young pitchers to face Greinke in Game Five. Dodgers fans remember that Joe Kelly hit Ramirez with a pitch in the ribs in Game One, and a hostile afternoon crowd at Chavez Ravine will remind him all game as he looks to topple the Cy Young award winning Greinke yet again. Should he succeed his Cardinals will reach their fourth World Series in nine seasons.</p> <p>I'll have lineups in a moment, but in the meantime, why not send your predictions and any other sentiments you may have to:</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com\">david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com</a></p> <p>Or via twitter:</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LengelDavid\">@lengeldavid</a></p> <p>This is your blog, a two way baseball conversation, and we look forward to getting your thoughts from wherever you're reading around the globe.&nbsp;</p> <p>Playoff baseball is coming your way soon, with first pitch coming a touch past 4PM EST, please stand by.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T20:02:12.275+01:00\">at 3.02pm ET</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420167440|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|af8730333bb46a52cff2746444b0301df4543c5a -->",

It is not going to be a gentle ramble towards suburban Twickenham. Take the expectation on the shoulders of Roy Hodgson this week, stir it in with the demands of satisfying a host nation still in thrall to Jonny Wilkinson and co and you begin to get some idea of the unique pressures awaiting Stuart Lancaster and his players in two years' time.</p><p>That is partly why Lancaster has invited Hodgson to attend one of this autumn's QBE internationals, a series of games that should reveal whether <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/16/wales-england-six-nations\" title=\"\">last season's Six Nations collapse against Wales in Cardiff</a> was a blip or a longer-term problem. Either way, Hodgson and Lancaster sound like men on a broadly similar wavelength, particularly when it comes to big games. If there is an oval-ball version of Andros Townsend hiding out there, Lancaster will certainly be backing him.</p><p>That may not necessarily seem the obvious conclusion to draw from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/joel-tomkins-england-rugby-squad\" title=\"\">England's largely predictable squad announcement</a> at Lloyds of London on Wednesday, a place which knows all about striking a balance between risk and reward. As expected, three uncapped centres – Joel Tomkins, Henry Trinder and Luther Burrell – and the Exeter back-rower Tom Johnson have been drafted in for the injured Manu Tuilagi, Brad Barritt and Tom Croft. Lancaster, though, made it clear he will be challenging everyone, regardless of age or experience, to aim high and abandon their comfort zones. \"I don't think you'll win big games without having a mindset to attack and players who can create things,\" he said, looking ahead to the  Australia, Argentina and New Zealand.</p><p>Rather than making sweeping personnel changes following the Millennium Stadium mauling, Lancaster is also seeking to harden minds. He wants players such as Billy Twelvetrees, set to be paired at centre against the Wallabies by either Tomkins or Trinder, to show they have matured into internationals and for more leaders to emerge in adversity than did so in Cardiff. Above all he wants calm-headed decision makers not scared to express themselves when it matters, as Hodgson's England ultimately did in their final two group games.</p><p>\"Credit to the footballers for dealing with the expectation and the pressure,\" Lancaster said. \"One of the challenges we're about to face is the expectation and pressure of being a home team at a World Cup. New Zealand faced it in 2011 and I thought they had the maturity and experience to deal with it and still deliver. Our challenge is to be ready for that. This series – three games at Twickenham against three big southern hemisphere sides – is great preparation.\"</p><p>It is certainly a prime opportunity for whoever of Tomkins or Trinder impresses most at training in Leeds next week. The powerful Burrell, for now, is behind them in the reckoning, with this weekend's Heineken Cup games between Saracens and Toulouse and Munster and Gloucester set to have a direct bearing as Lancaster continues to seek well-matched successors to Jeremy Guscott and Will Carling or Will Greenwood and Mike Tindall. \"Ideally, Brad and Manu would be involved but who says that Henry Trinder or Joel Tomkins can't force our hand? Rarely have we promoted someone and they've not dealt with it.\"</p><p>There is, in that respect, a barely concealed excitement about the promise of Billy Vunipola, set to start at No8 against Australia behind his front-row brother Mako because of an injury doubt over Alex Corbisiero. Fears the Lions and Northampton prop will miss the entire autumn series have been denied but the player will be out for at least a couple of weeks after having fluid drained from knee. \"He's not out of the series by any stretch of the imagination,\" Lancaster said. \"Everyone is hoping he will be available for some, if not all, of the games.\"</p><p>In the short term that suggests a double dose of Vunipola trouble for the Wallabies – \"As ball-carrying threats you could probably build quite a lot around them,\" murmured Lancaster – with Northampton's in-form Lee Dickson also pushing Ben Youngs and Danny Care for the scrum-half jersey. The captaincy announcement is due next Wednesday but Lancaster remains more concerned with the blend of his XV. \"At the moment there are very few clear-cut decisions in our team. Whether it is 7,6, 8, second-row, hooker, scrum-half, we have a lot of competition for places. The priority is to get that bit right. Then you assess your leadership group and you appoint your captain on top of that.\"</p><p>It is collective leadership under pressure, too, that has absorbed Lancaster in the wake of the defeat by Wales. \"At international level, if you're missing critical moments, they can hurt you. It's all part of your development. No team, even New Zealand, go in a straight line upwards all the time.\" To accelerate that maturation process, Lancaster has already undertaken a  fact-finding mission to Australia and New Zealand to see what else England can learn from their southern hemisphere counterparts, with three Tests and a potential midweek game against Super 15 opposition in New Zealand planned for next June, too.

        "body":"<p>There will be no tears or fears for England in Australia, according to Jimmy Anderson. In the face of expected hostility from fiery crowds, England's second-highest wicket-taker insists the squad are well prepared for another Ashes tour full of drama, tension and \"pommy-bashing\".</p><p>Alastair Cook's side depart for the southern hemisphere on Wednesday in search of a fourth successive Ashes series win for the first time since the 19th century. Three years have passed since the start of England's last campaign down under, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/07/the-ashes-2010-11-england-australia\" title=\"\">which ended in a 3-1 victory for the tourists and a first series win on Australian soil since 1986-87</a>, and since then tensions between the two teams have simmered gently below boiling point.</p><p>For Anderson, who on Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/england-james-anderson-new-deal-lancashire\" title=\"\">signed a one-year contract extension with Lancashire until 2015</a>, he will embark on his third tour of Australia having played in the 2002-03 one-day international series. A number of other players in the squad have featured twice in Ashes series on Australian soil and Anderson believes they already know what to expect from the home crowds.</p><p>\"In 2006-07 when we played there it was very apparent that they were not our greatest fans, so I don't think what has happened [since] will make it any worse. I think it will be a very partisan crowd, it always has been and it always will be,\" Anderson says.</p><p>\"It can't really get more hostile than when we've played there before. Australia in general is a quite intimidating place to play, they are very passionate and very vocal. It's something that thankfully we have experienced in the team, having played there before in good times and bad times. Hopefully we have enough experience to cope with it well.</p><p>\"I think the focus this time will be on Pommy-bashing. The best way to shut them up is to perform well, certain players cope with it in their own way. First and foremost it's important to win and hopefully that will silence the crowd.\"</p><p>The Australia coach, Darren Lehmann, stated in August that he wanted home fans to \"give it\" to Stuart Broad and make him cry following his decision not to walk in the opening summer Test at Trent Bridge when edging to slip.</p><p>Broad may be the prime target for abuse from spectators but Anderson has no concerns about his team-mate's ability to handle the pressure.</p><p>\"He got quite a lot in 2010-11 and dealt with it brilliantly,\" Anderson says. \"We all get stick when we go there, some more than others, and I think if you accept that, prepare for it and have a plan of how to deal with it, that goes a long way to dealing with it once you are there.\"</p><p>Anderson points to the change of management in 2009 as a key moment when the players' ability to handle abuse improved. During the ill-fated 2006 tour he admits the squad were too \"guarded\" but after Andy Flower's appointment as team director he says there was a fresh approach when confronted with hostility.</p><p>\"In 2006 I definitely felt that, and I certainly know that a number of wives and girlfriends felt that, walking down the street we were getting abuse,\" he says. \"But I think in 2010 we dealt with it better, we tried to interact more with the public and embrace their culture. In 2006 we were quite guarded and tried to stay in our own little bubble. I think we did things slightly wrong, we learned from that and last time we went there and tried to embrace it.</p><p>\"I remember a situation where we played golf and there were some people in the clubhouse by the tee, a couple of our guys duffed it and they said: 'I bet you're cricket is the same,' something like that. It was light-hearted and we had some interaction, rather than getting our heads down and shooting off.\"</p><p>The players <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/10/hot-spot-england-ashes-australia\" title=\"\">will not have the benefit of Hot Spot when reviewing decisions during the upcoming series after Channel Nine opted to drop the infrared camera system</a> because of funding reasons – something Anderson describes as \"frustrating\".</p><p>However, the 31-year-old is relishing the opportunity to move closer to Ian Botham's record of 383 Test wickets and is hoping more consistency across the board will see England return victorious.</p><p>\"Australia are going to be fairly confident, I imagine, that they can beat us,\" Anderson says. \"We're going to have to improve on our performances throughout the summer if we are going to have a chance of winning out there.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420189401|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|d794f98cab9d0ae5ff8ed03a82d2e9fd051b7395 -->",

        "body":"<p>The PGA of America is considering staging the US PGA Championship, one of golf's four majors, outside the United States. A report in Golf Digest states that a committee is studying the impact of holding the event around the world, with the earliest possible date in 2020.</p><p>The 2019 championship was awarded to Bethpage Black on Long Island last month. \"This is an exercise we are going through, an analysis,\" PGA of America chief executive Pete Bevacqua told Golf Digest. \"It is far from a fait accompli that we are going to take the PGA Championship international. When we sat down to map our strategic plan to service our members and grow the game the question arose as to what impact it would have to take the PGA Championship to an international location once or twice a decade.</p><p>\"It would be something we would only do if we had the co-operation of quite a few groups. It would need to work for the PGA Tour and it would need to work for the PGA Tour players.</p><p>\"Another would be the PGA in the particular area we would consider. We would want the international PGAs to be a part of this and share in this. Many pieces would have to fall in place.\"</p><p>Adam Scott fired a course-record 64 to storm past Justin Rose and claim victory at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda. Rose had led by a single stroke with three holes to play but he had no answer to Scott in the closing stages as the Australian won the 36-hole tournament – which gathers the season's four major champions – by two shots on eight under.</p><p>The Masters winner took control on the penultimate hole when his six-iron landed within inches to allow him a tap-in eagle three. The US Open champion Rose had given up his single-shot lead at the previous hole, forced to take a drop after a wayward tee shot, before par on the 17th left him two shots adrift as Scott accelerated.</p><p>Scott's win means that he was able to add the winner's pink jacket to the green one he dramatically secured after a play-off against Angel Cabrera at Augusta in April.</p><p>Jason Dufner finished third on three under while Padraig Harrington, who replaced the Open champion Phil Mickelson, was well off the pace on three over after a 71 on Wednesday.</p><p>Harrington was the defending champion after he stepped in for Ernie Els last year.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420185397|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|de965948f3603a3067b01a4ee1f8e5c25c623ec0 -->",

        "body":"<p>The going at Ascot turned soft all round on Wednesday after a midday downpour dropped 6mm of rain on the course. That news will be unwelcome for a number of trainers who would like to have Champions Day runners at the Berkshire track on Saturday, but are unhappy about the prospect of a testing surface.</p><p>The first Champions Day, in 2011, was blessed with fine weather and good going but there was a feeling at the time that it would not normally be the case for a mid-October fixture. This will be the second time running that the card, offering £3.4m in prize money, will be held on a surface with plenty of give.</p><p>Asked to predict the likely going for Saturday, Chris Stickels, Ascot's clerk of the course, said: \"I think it'll be a mixture of good to soft and soft.\"</p><p>He reported a forecast predicting \"occasional showers\" for Thursday, Friday and Saturday but added: \"It's hit and miss stuff, very difficult to predict how much we're likely to get, but I would say [Thursday] is quite likely to be dry. It's an unclear picture after that. I think we've seen the worst of it.\"</p><p>Soft Falling Rain is, ironically, one of the horses whose connections would rather see plenty of sun in the Ascot area. A Group One winner in his native South Africa, he was a comfortable winner on fast ground at Newmarket last month, on the strength of which he is joint second-favourite for Saturday's QEII Stakes, worth £1m.</p><p>While that prize money is plainly tempting, Soft Falling Rain could yet be withdrawn, should his trainer, Mike de Kock, decide the ground is too testing. \"If it becomes a bog, Mike has said that he'll have to talk it over with [the colt's owner] Sheikh Hamdan,\" said Steve Jell, De Kock's assistant trainer. \"So we're training him for the race but we'll have to keep an eye on the weather, just as a lot of other people are doing.</p><p>\"He's such a good-actioned horse on fast, firm ground. Will he be effective on both [types of going]? We're not too sure.\"</p><p>Jell takes some comfort from the fact that the QEII is due to be run up Ascot's straight mile, which drains more quickly than the round course. He reported a lot of enthusiasm within the camp for Soft Falling Rain's chance. \"He upped his game in quite an impressive manner last time,\" Jell said. \"He's got to do that again but he's a fighter who doesn't give up easily.\"</p><p>De Kock is also due to run Igugu in the Fillies &amp; Mares Stakes, newly raised to Group One status, and Jell hopes that, as a daughter of Galileo, she will be able to cope with some cut underfoot. Igugu has not been able to reproduce her best form since leaving South Africa last year, which Jell explained was in part because she had not enjoyed her experiences of travel, but he added that she was showing signs of coming back to herself after five months in Newmarket.</p><p>There appears to be confusion in the Sky Lantern camp over whether the grey will run on Champions Day, with her trainer, Richard Hannon, appearing to rule it out just one day after his son and assistant, Richard Jr, had enthused about her chance of running in quotes reported by the Racing Post. Her jockey, Richard Hughes, used the Hannon website yesterday to say: \"I'd be inclined to give it a miss … It would not surprise me if it rode heavy.\"</p><p>Hughes revealed that the Hannon-trained Olympic Glory will wear blinkers for the first time when he runs in the QEII. \"We gave him&nbsp;a spin in them earlier in the week and there was a positive reaction. I would envisage it could make three lengths difference, which would put him in&nbsp;there with a big shout,\" the jockey said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420181668|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|2210e44cca8c6583ebda6b948a5174c89cae3163 -->",

        "body":"<p>The India trio Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan put on a batting masterclass as they chased down a huge target of 360 to win the second one-day international against Australia by nine wickets. Australia had looked set to take a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series after compiling 359 for five at Jaipur, with all of their top five contributing half-centuries and captain George Bailey leading the way with a brilliant unbeaten 92.</p><p>However, those knocks were all overshadowed by India's top three as  Sharma (141 not out), Kohli (100 not out) and Dhawan (95) saw the host nation romp home with more than six overs to spare.</p><p>Kohli's 52-ball knock, which included seven sixes and eight fours, was the fastest ODI century by an Indian and the seventh fastest ever, while Sharma was similarly destructive as he hit 17 fours and four maximums in his 123-ball innings.</p><p>Dhawan was no slouch either as he collected 14 boundaries before falling just short of his century when he edged the 86th ball he faced, bowled by James Faulkner, behind to Brad Haddin, who had earlier dropped the opener off a steepling leading edge when he was on 18. That wicket brought an end to an opening stand of 176 in 26 overs but was the only success Australia's bowlers enjoyed on what was a batsman's day.</p><p>Earlier, it was the India attack who found themselves on the receiving end of some brutal batting as Australia, who won the first ODI by 72 runs after scoring 304, again set what had appeared to be a tough target.</p><p>Their captain, Bailey, led the from the front with 92 off 50 balls, including five sixes and eight fours, while Phil Hughes (83), Shane Watson (59), Glenn Maxwell (53) and Aaron Finch (50) were also among the runs. The  total proved to be nowhere big enough as India chased it down in style to level the series.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420177686|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|1674bd09c7d78e3c51a11f703c08e120c0945fc2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Moving day at the England and Wales Cricket Board, a cabinet reshuffle if you like. First came a surprise in the announcement of the former England wicketkeeper Paul Downton as the new managing director of England cricket in succession to Hugh Morris, thereby simultaneously giving headline writers a field day and securing the populist vote.</p><p>Then hot on the heels came a further announcement that Geoff Miller, the national selector, and a good diligent one at that, had, during the Ashes series this summer, asked to stand down at the end of the year. He will be replaced by James Whitaker, a natural progression for him as he has been one of three selectors for the past five years.</p><p>Downton, 56, who kept wicket first as a young prodigy for Kent and then, following a frustrating time as understudy to Alan Knott, Middlesex, as well as playing 30 Test matches for England, is an intriguing choice. His cricket career came to an abrupt end when a bail deflected into his eye while standing up to the stumps, severely damaging it in much the same way as was to happen to the South African keeper Mark Boucher last year.</p><p>He was, though, already pursuing a career in the City, and he went into this full time with JP Morgan Cazenove, the investment bankers with whom he has been for 17 years. His business experience will sit alongside a law degree from Exeter University as well as his playing and coaching qualifications. In addition to international success, which included playing in the 1981 and 1985 Ashes wins, the 1984-85 winning tour of India and the 1987 World Cup final, he won six county championship titles with Kent and Middlesex, and played in six winning finals at Lord's. He has for many years been an active committee member with Middlesex, the MCC and the ECB.</p><p>It is quite a CV and certainly he would appear to have the multifarious qualities that none of the numerous names mentioned in connection with the job could match and will be well received by both Andy Flower and England's one-day coach, Ashley Giles, both of whom were consulted and met Downton as part of the appointment process. On top of that he is an extremely decent fellow, which was not part of the job description but will stand him in good stead nonetheless.</p><p>The task he faces might well be seen as a different one to that of Morris, who came into the job - indeed was a party to creating it as part of the committee that produced the Schofield Report following the 2006-07 Ashes debacle. Most if not all of those recommendations are in place now, including the upgrading of the academy to a performance centre of excellence, and a beefing-up of the coaching structure. There has been a feeling that in the past year or so the system, if not stagnating exactly, had lost some dynamism. The new broom might just pep it up.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420174650|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|60150751bb1600594f4442972724e9ed8532ddb3 -->",

        "body":"<p>The anti-racism group Kick It Out has called on the Football Association to investigate a joke about a monkey in space made by Roy Hodgson despite the England winger Andros Townsend's attempts to play down the issue.</p><p>The England manager has apologised to anyone offended by the joke made at half-time during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/15/england-poland-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Poland at Wembley</a>, which was intended to convey the need for England to play the ball more regularly to Townsend. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/17/roy-hodgson-apologises-space-monkey-joke\" title=\"\">The Tottenham Hotspur player says no offence was meant or taken</a>, but Kick It Out's chairman Lord Herman Ouseley has called on the FA to investigate the incident.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.kickitout.org/news.php/news_id/6083\" title=\"\">A statement said</a>: \"Kick It Out, football's equality and inclusion campaign, recognises and shares the concerns of the parties who felt mindful to bring the comments into the public domain.</p><p>\"The matter has been raised by the chair, Lord Herman Ouseley, directly with the Football Association, who acknowledges the apology made by Roy Hodgson, and now seeks an investigation to ascertain the full facts and ensure a similar situation does not arise again.\"</p><p>Townsend, whose father, Troy, works for Kick It Out as its mentoring manager, insists he was not offended and cannot understand why it has generated so much coverage, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andros_townsend/status/390770514849181696\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> the player said:  \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p>In a statement, Hodgson said: \"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p>The joke is one that became popular at Nasa, the US space agency, in the 1960s and 1970s after it sent monkeys into space before humans. One version of the joke is that the first time Nasa sends a man up into space a monkey goes with him and does all the skilled technical jobs inside the rocket. Finally the astronaut gets frustrated and radios Nasa to ask what he should do.</p><p>Nasa replies: \"Don't touch anything – just feed the monkey.\"</p><p>It is believed Hodgson was trying to illustrate the need for England's defenders to play the ball early to Townsend while he was in space on the flanks.</p><p>Piara Powar, executive director of the European anti-discrimination group Fare, said the England manager should be more careful. \"Hodgson used a very silly term within a diverse team environment. He should know better,\" said Power on Twitter.</p><p>Wayne Rooney insists Hodgson did \"nothing wrong\" and that the incident had been blown out of all proportion. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WayneRooney/status/390737351326306304\" title=\"\">The England striker tweeted</a>: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Stan Collymore said the row undermined efforts to tackle racism in football. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StanCollymore/status/390608021111726080\" title=\"\">The former England striker  tweeted</a>: \"Demeans every anti racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH who said NOTHING WRONG. Makes campaigners seem over PC &amp; petty. They're not.\"</p><p>The FA has been especially sensitive to any allegations of racism after John Terry was stripped of the England captaincy and later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/27/john-terry-verdict-chelsea-guilty\" title=\"\">banned for four matches</a> for racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand in a Chelsea match in October 2011.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246078|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|69c8a12781d595e1f97fdf9f59d266038e62ce32 -->",

        "body":"<p>Moving day at the England and Wales Cricket Board, a cabinet reshuffle if you like. First came a surprise in the announcement of the former England wicketkeeper Paul Downton as the new managing director of England cricket in succession to Hugh Morris, thereby simultaneously giving headline writers a field day and securing the populist vote.</p><p>Then hot on the heels came a further announcement that Geoff Miller, the national selector, and a good diligent one at that, had, during the Ashes series this summer, asked to stand down at the end of the year. He will be replaced by James Whitaker, a natural progression for him as he has been one of three selectors for the past five years.</p><p>Downton, 56, who kept wicket first as a young prodigy for Kent and then, following a frustrating time as understudy to Alan Knott, Middlesex, as well as playing 30 Test matches for England, is an intriguing choice. His cricket career came to an abrupt end when a bail deflected into his eye while standing up to the stumps, severely damaging it in much the same way as was to happen to the South African keeper Mark Boucher last year.</p><p>He was, though, already pursuing a career in the City, and he went into this full time with JP Morgan Cazenove, the investment bankers with whom he has been for 17 years. His business experience will sit alongside a law degree from Exeter University as well as his playing and coaching qualifications. In addition to international success, which included playing in the 1981 and 1985 Ashes wins, the 1984-85 winning tour of India and the 1987 World Cup final, he won six county championship titles with Kent and Middlesex, and played in six winning finals at Lord's. He has for many years been an active committee member with Middlesex, the MCC and the ECB.</p><p>It is quite a CV and certainly he would appear to have the multifarious qualities that none of the numerous names mentioned in connection with the job could match and will be well received by both Andy Flower and England's one-day coach, Ashley Giles, both of whom were consulted and met Downton as part of the appointment process. On top of that he is an extremely decent fellow, which was not part of the job description but will stand him in good stead nonetheless.</p><p>The task he faces might well be seen as a different one to that of Morris, who came into the job - indeed was a party to creating it as part of the committee that produced the Schofield Report following the 2006-07 Ashes debacle. Most if not all of those recommendations are in place now, including the upgrading of the academy to a performance centre of excellence, and a beefing-up of the coaching structure. There has been a feeling that in the past year or so the system, if not stagnating exactly, had lost some dynamism. The new broom might just pep it up.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420174650|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|60150751bb1600594f4442972724e9ed8532ddb3 -->",

        "body":"<p>There will be no tears or fears for England in Australia, according to Jimmy Anderson. In the face of expected hostility from fiery crowds, England's second-highest wicket-taker insists the squad are well prepared for another Ashes tour full of drama, tension and \"pommy-bashing\".</p><p>Alastair Cook's side depart for the southern hemisphere on Wednesday in search of a fourth successive Ashes series win for the first time since the 19th century. Three years have passed since the start of England's last campaign down under, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/07/the-ashes-2010-11-england-australia\" title=\"\">which ended in a 3-1 victory for the tourists and a first series win on Australian soil since 1986-87</a>, and since then tensions between the two teams have simmered gently below boiling point.</p><p>For Anderson, who on Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/england-james-anderson-new-deal-lancashire\" title=\"\">signed a one-year contract extension with Lancashire until 2015</a>, he will embark on his third tour of Australia having played in the 2002-03 one-day international series. A number of other players in the squad have featured twice in Ashes series on Australian soil and Anderson believes they already know what to expect from the home crowds.</p><p>\"In 2006-07 when we played there it was very apparent that they were not our greatest fans, so I don't think what has happened [since] will make it any worse. I think it will be a very partisan crowd, it always has been and it always will be,\" Anderson says.</p><p>\"It can't really get more hostile than when we've played there before. Australia in general is a quite intimidating place to play, they are very passionate and very vocal. It's something that thankfully we have experienced in the team, having played there before in good times and bad times. Hopefully we have enough experience to cope with it well.</p><p>\"I think the focus this time will be on Pommy-bashing. The best way to shut them up is to perform well, certain players cope with it in their own way. First and foremost it's important to win and hopefully that will silence the crowd.\"</p><p>The Australia coach, Darren Lehmann, stated in August that he wanted home fans to \"give it\" to Stuart Broad and make him cry following his decision not to walk in the opening summer Test at Trent Bridge when edging to slip.</p><p>Broad may be the prime target for abuse from spectators but Anderson has no concerns about his team-mate's ability to handle the pressure.</p><p>\"He got quite a lot in 2010-11 and dealt with it brilliantly,\" Anderson says. \"We all get stick when we go there, some more than others, and I think if you accept that, prepare for it and have a plan of how to deal with it, that goes a long way to dealing with it once you are there.\"</p><p>Anderson points to the change of management in 2009 as a key moment when the players' ability to handle abuse improved. During the ill-fated 2006 tour he admits the squad were too \"guarded\" but after Andy Flower's appointment as team director he says there was a fresh approach when confronted with hostility.</p><p>\"In 2006 I definitely felt that, and I certainly know that a number of wives and girlfriends felt that, walking down the street we were getting abuse,\" he says. \"But I think in 2010 we dealt with it better, we tried to interact more with the public and embrace their culture. In 2006 we were quite guarded and tried to stay in our own little bubble. I think we did things slightly wrong, we learned from that and last time we went there and tried to embrace it.</p><p>\"I remember a situation where we played golf and there were some people in the clubhouse by the tee, a couple of our guys duffed it and they said: 'I bet you're cricket is the same,' something like that. It was light-hearted and we had some interaction, rather than getting our heads down and shooting off.\"</p><p>The players <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/10/hot-spot-england-ashes-australia\" title=\"\">will not have the benefit of Hot Spot when reviewing decisions during the upcoming series after Channel Nine opted to drop the infrared camera system</a> because of funding reasons – something Anderson describes as \"frustrating\".</p><p>However, the 31-year-old is relishing the opportunity to move closer to Ian Botham's record of 383 Test wickets and is hoping more consistency across the board will see England return victorious.</p><p>\"Australia are going to be fairly confident, I imagine, that they can beat us,\" Anderson says. \"We're going to have to improve on our performances throughout the summer if we are going to have a chance of winning out there.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420189401|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|d794f98cab9d0ae5ff8ed03a82d2e9fd051b7395 -->",

We have come a long way, with the debt being paid down, commercial revenues are increasing. We have more [deals] coming and are confident. However, nothing works unless we have success on the pitch.\"</p><p></p><p>Some fans had earlier staged a small protest outside the stadium entrance. The Black Scarf Movement carried a banner reading \"kick greed out of football – where has our Arsenal gone?\" and handed out leaflets highlighting the differences between the running of Arsenal and European champions Bayern Munich, plus copies of a letter sent to Kroenke in September calling for direct meetings with the American tycoon.</p><p>Wenger also spoke to the shareholders, where he focused on how the current side would build on impressive displays to deliver long-term success.</p><p>Wenger highlighted how last season's victory over Bayern Munich in the away leg of their Champions League tie, which they lost on aggregate, proved pivotal in developing the belief of the squad.</p><p>\"From the end of March to today, we have lost just one match, that created a huge emotion,\" Wenger said.</p><p>\"We have huge ambition to win the league this season. We were restricted financially and had to be strict, but we have come out of that.</p><p>\"However, we have to defend our style of play and values, that comes from developing our own players, with youth policy and that should be core of our club.\"</p><p>\"We will also look to buy proven quality – we did not need to scout to buy Özil, it was just money. I am pleased we have shown you we are not afraid to spend.\"</p><p>Wenger concluded his speech by adding: \"We are top [of the table] in a very strong position, but the end of November will give a much clearer indication of where everyone lies. I am confident that at the end of May we will all be happy.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420255256|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|b12f40a9487655cc77072e0cc3c109c6073506e1 -->",

        "trailText":"<strong>Paul Rees:</strong> With the future of European rugby still far from certain, Wales's four regions are running out of time to secure their better out-of-contract players for next season",
        "headline":"Wales regions in limbo and pondering future without prime assets",
        "body":"<p>These may be taxing times for the Welsh regions, struggling to keep their heads above water despite liquidity problems, but there could be no excuses for the abject display of Cardiff Blues in the opening half at Exeter on Sunday, opponents with considerably less Heineken Cup experience who are in the middle tier of the Premiership.</p><p>The regions are concerned, with the future of European club rugby still to be settled, that they will lack the means to make realistic offers to players who are out of contract at the end of the season, including Leigh Halfpenny, Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Jonathan Davies.</p><p>They will need to tie them down before the end of the year, when they will be able to speak to potential new employers, but with the market value of those who were an integral part of the Lions' success in Australia in the summer increasing by at least 50%, they need an increase in revenue just to stand still: if there is no Heineken Cup, or a replacement, they will be some £1.5m worse off each.</p><p>The regions had hoped to resolve the contract issues before the start of next month's internationals: Warburton and Davies have publicly said that they want to stay with the Blues and the Scarlets respectively, but they are in limbo, not far from the point when they will have to look at other options.</p><p>The Blues fielded 13 internationals, five of whom were Lions, at Sandy Park but they looked a team of novices, 41–3 down before they found it in them to respond. They showed no spirit in adversity and neither, more surprisingly, did Ospreys at home to Leinster on Saturday night.</p><p>Alex Cuthbert, the Wales and Lions wing, scored two tries for the Blues and was their one player who rose above the mess, wearing such a look of disbelief in the first-half that if it as if he were asking himself why he last season signed a three-year contract extension with the region.</p><p>Similarly the Ospreys captain, Alun Wyn Jones, had to suppress his anger when discussing the defeat to Leinster a few minutes after the final whistle.  Jones has played for Ospreys all his senior career and the region regards him as the central figure in the squad, someone worth even as much off the field as he is on it, but whereas his heart will tell him to sign a new deal, once figures are attached  his head may tell him that, at the age of 28, it may be time to leave.</p><p>While the Blues had no excuses for their abject start against Exeter, Ospreys had a bench made up largely of emerging players against Leinster, a consequence of injuries and a budget that is lower than their French, English and Irish rivals. They had no one to turn a game that was ebbing from them and the fear of all four regions is that, if there is a European settlement, they will play no part in it and could end up poorer  in relative, if not real, terms.</p><p>The Welsh Rugby Union, which in recent years has been more of a rival than a support to its regions, has said it alone will be involved in whatever form negotiations take, with European Rugby Cup Ltd's survival prospects looking more remote by the day. The regions will remain on the outside.</p><p>The WRU's policy has been to find an ERC solution, that is to perpetuate the Heineken Cup, but the obduracy of the French and English clubs, who are adamant they will not after this season play in a tournament organised by ERC - and unlike previous disputes over Europe, in 1998 and 2006–07, they have not gone into the conference room naked, having armed themselves with what they describe as a lucrative television deal - has prompted it to consider an alternative.</p><p>Premiership Rugby has not specified exactly how much its BT television deal would add to the £44m shared by the six nations from the Heineken Cup. A figure of £70m has been quoted, but that would leave the four Welsh regions barely better off if the English and French clubs' demand for a three-way split between the leagues that feed into the European tournaments is accepted.</p><p>Currently, the four RaboDirect Pro 12 unions have 52% of the pot with the English and French clubs each banking 24%. If the pot increased to £70m and was divided three ways, the Rabo nations would have £23.33m, barely more than the £23m they had last season. It is understood that there is a proposal that 15% of the total should be apportioned on a merit basis: if that happened, the £70m would shrivel to less than £60m, meaning the basic sum for all three leagues would be less than £20m.</p><p>The Rabo unions share their money disproportionately, with Italy and Scotland receiving more per team than Ireland and Wales. The ideal for the four regions would be a division by 12, the number of teams in the Pro 12, which would give them a similar increase to the English and French clubs.</p><p>They will have no say in the carve-up, being reliant on the WRU, and the governing body has yet to say that it will be looking to secure the best possible deal for its professional sides. Its priority is to get the regions to sign a participation agreement with the union to replace the one that runs out at the end of the season, with the offer of an extra £1m to help retain players if they do.</p><p>The fear of the regions is that the WRU is waiting for the day when they collapse and the union will then set up its own sides, two or three in number and run them in the manner of Ireland's provinces.</p><p>It is a reason why the mood in the regions is so down, notwithstanding the Scarlets' ebullient display at Harlequins. They feel they will be worse off whatever the European outcome, losing not just their Lions but the next wave of Wales internationals. Their destiny will be decided by others and they need to find a way to get involved in the discussions.</p><p></p><p>• <a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/email/subscribe?emailListId=219\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Breakdown, our free weekly take on the world of rugby union.

Johnson offers Lancaster cover for Tom Wood on the blindside flank with Tom Croft ruled out for the season with a knee injury.</p><p>Alex Corbisiero is included in the squad despite also picking up a knee problem that could rule him out of the start of the series, which begins against Australia on 2 November at Twickenham followed by games on successive weekends against Argentina and world champions New Zealand. Lancaster expects the prop, who has had fluid drained from the knee that has troubled him in recent seasons, and will not be able to put weight on it for another week, to be back in action in a few weeks.</p><p>\"We have not ruled out Alex from any of next month's internationals,\" said Lancaster. \"He has to put his knee up this week as part of his rehab. I hope he will come through and be available for some if not all of the matches. I am optimistic about his long-term prospects: with good management, we can see him through beyond 2015.\"</p><p>Lancaster will decide his captain when the squad gathers next week having refused to answer speculation that he would be replacing one back rower, Chris Robshaw, for another, Tom Wood. He said he was happy with the form of his players, but nearly half the squad, 16, are playing for clubs who were wither poor or fickle in the first five weeks of the season, including Robshaw's Harlequins.</p><p>The squad will assemble in Leeds next Monday after this weekend's Heineken Cup games for a pre-series camp.</p><p>Speaking at Lloyd's of London, Lancaster said: \"We have been looking forward to this QBE Internationals series ever since we got back from Argentina. As a coaching group we have watched a lot of rugby and we are pleased with the form of the squad. The camp is an important part of our preparation and we are looking forward to meeting up.</p><p>\"Inevitably there have been some injuries and there is still a big European weekend ahead. But injures always create opportunities and we are pleased to call up Tom Johnson, Joel Tomkins, Henry Trinder and Luther Burrell into the senior EPS, with Luther joining us as injury cover. We have three major Tests ahead of us and we are looking forward to the challenge.\"</p><h2>England's EPS squad for the QBE autumn internationals</h2><p><strong>Forwards</strong> David Attwood (Bath), Dan Cole (Leicester), Alex Corbisiero (Northampton), Tom Johnson (Exeter Chiefs), Dylan Hartley (Northampton), Matt Kvesic (Gloucester), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Ben Morgan (Gloucester), Geoff Parling (Leicester), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Billy Vunipola (Saracens), Mako Vunipola (Saracens), David Wilson (Bath), Tom Wood (Northampton), Tom Youngs (Leicester )</p><p><strong>Backs</strong> Chris Ashton (Saracens), Mike Brown (Harlequins), Freddie Burns (Gloucester), Luther Burrell (Northampton), Danny Care (Harlequins), Lee Dickson (Northampton), Kyle Eastmond (Bath), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Toby Flood (Leicester), Ben Foden (Northampton), Alex Goode (Saracens), Henry Trinder (Gloucester), Joel Tomkins (Saracens), Billy Twelvetrees (Gloucester), Christian Wade (Wasps), Marland Yarde (London Irish), Ben Youngs (Leicester)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420117519|2013-10-17T12:53:11Z|8ce65fec3731c38c6f23df2199921b9bbed1b293 -->",

        "body":"<p>Only one of three Burgess brothers will start for England in their World Cup warm-up game against Italy in Salford on Saturday. Sam Burgess, the eldest and most established of the three siblings included in the squad, has been named at loose-forward with George, one of the 21-year-old twins, on a seven-man interchange bench.</p><p>Tom Burgess, who only forced his way into the South Sydney team late in the National Rugby League season and was therefore a surprise inclusion in the England squad, is one of two players, along with Zak Hardaker of Leeds, who drop into a Knights team to face Samoa in the first part of a double header at the City of Salford Stadium.</p><p>Perhaps significantly, Hardaker is listed at centre, rather than at full-back, where he has played all season for Leeds – suggesting that the England coach, Steve McNamara, sees him as a possible contender for that position, which has become a problem area since the loss of the Yorkshire-born Brisbane Broncos centre Jack Reed through injury.</p><p>McNamara has switched Carl Ablett, another Leeds player who has spent most of the season in the second row, to the centre against Italy, where he will be partnered by Huddersfield's Leroy Cudjoe, with the fourth centre contender, Kallum Watkins, on the interchange bench.</p><p>Other eye-catching and potentially significant selections are Tom Briscoe ahead of Josh Charnley on the wing and Michael McIlorum ahead of James Roby at hooker. But McNamara will be anxious to avoid giving too much away to Australia's coach, Tim Sheens, who has chosen not to arrange a warm-up game in the run-in to the tournament opener, between England and the Kangaroos, at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on Saturday week.</p><p>Two members of England's 24-man squad were not considered – Sean O'Loughlin, the Wigan captain who has played only two matches in the past two months because of achilles problems, and the Warrington second-row Ben Westwood, who is suspended.</p><h2>England team to play Italy, Saturday 4.30pm</h2><p>S Tomkins (Wigan); Briscoe (Hull), Cudjoe (Huddersfield), Ablett (Leeds), Hall (Leeds); Chase (Castleford), Sinfield (Leeds, capt); Graham (Canterbury), McIlorum (Wigan), Mossop (Wigan), Hock (Widnes), Farrell (Wigan), S Burgess (South Sydney).
