        "headline":"England and Stuart Lancaster are spoilt for choice for autumn internationals",
        "body":"<p>Decisions, decisions. Coaching and management demands a range of skills but good selection can make or break a developing team. The trick is to pick just ahead of the curve rather than just behind it, to have a sixth sense of when a particular side has reached its limit and needs reinvigorating. Injuries clearly play a part and a bit of luck helps, too.</p><p>But what happens when just about everyone is fit and eager and, as with England, you have 90-odd players to consider? Welcome to Stuart Lancaster's world as he prepares to unveil his autumn international squad this week.</p><p>If old-style England trials were to be reintroduced \"The Rest\" would fill three dressing rooms. To illustrate the fact here are four XVs, plus a further list of standby candidates and the currently injured. The first side will not be a million miles away from the team to face Australia on 2 November. Fourteen members of the \"second XV\" have already been capped this year. The last two contain a host of names – George Ford, Jonny May, Sam Hill, Dave Ewers, Jack Nowell, Will Fraser – who are rising swiftly up the ranks. Throw it all into one giant sorting hat and it becomes apparent that identifying England's best team – as opposed to their best squad – remains an ongoing struggle.</p><p>The same old questions keep recurring. What is England's best midfield combination? Who should be playing at half-back? What is the most complementary back-row blend? What about the second row? Hooker? By this stage, two years out from a World Cup, most international coaches should ideally know the answers to the majority of those questions. England probably only have about half a dozen individuals inked in, if that.</p><p>It explains why Lancaster is trying to downplay the profile of the captaincy. Tom Wood, Chris Robshaw, Dylan Hartley and Geoff Parling could all do the job and may end up sharing it between now and 2015. Yet none of them, for assorted reasons, are absolutely nailed on as the best player in their position for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Parling was the only one who actually went on the last Lions tour but he and Joe Launchbury are under some pressure from Courtney Lawes and Dave Attwood. Tom Youngs is currently starting ahead of Hartley, a fit Tom Croft would be a strong contender at No6 instead of Wood and Matt Kvesic is seen as the way forward as a specialist No7, the shirt Robshaw has been wearing.</p><p>And, while we are at it, how many of those four would make the current pre-eminent All Black team? What about the likes of Ben Youngs, Chris Ashton, Mike Brown or Owen Farrell? All good players but would New Zealand choose them ahead of, respectively, Aaron Smith, Julian Savea, Israel Dagg and Beauden Barrett? It is around this point that you begin to sympathise with Lancaster and realise just how vital the next eight months will be in terms of identifying not just his best team, but a potentially world-beating unit.</p><p>This week's autumn international squad announcement, oddly, has been complicated by the relative lack of injuries around. At the last count 30 of the 33-strong senior EPS squad named in August are fit and available, with only Manu Tuilagi, Brad Barritt and Croft sidelined.</p><p>That means choosing two centres from Joel Tomkins, Luther Burrell, Jonathan Joseph, Henry Trinder and Sam Hill – Tomkins and Burrell appear the best fit – and promoting a back-rower from the Saxons. On the shimmering evidence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/exeter-chief-cardiff-blues-heineken-cup\" title=\"\">Sunday's win over Cardiff Blues</a> it should be Exeter's Tom Johnson, still under-rated by many but perfectly suited to the all-court game England are aspiring to play.</p><p>Then again, at what stage does Ford's obvious promise eclipse Toby Flood's experience? Why would you not want a spectacular finisher of May's ability at least in your squad? And are Ewers and Northampton's Sam Dickinson not both performing with more elan at this precise moment than Ben Morgan? What about Anthony Watson, Henry Slade and Luke Cowan-Dickie, all of whom look potential internationals of the future? In theory it is a nice position to be in, to have a squad with plenty of depth. But there is a difference between a good squad player and someone capable of winning a World Cup semi-final with one game-changing intervention. Lancaster needs to separate his Woods from his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/billy-twelvetrees-gloucester-stuart-lancaster-england\" title=\"\">Twelvetrees</a> and keep in mind that steadiness will get England only so far.</p><h2>Too many cooks? Four potential England XVs</h2><h2>1st XV<br /></h2><p>M Brown; C Ashton, J Tomkins, B Twelvetrees, M Yarde; O Farrell, B Youngs; A Corbisiero, T Youngs, D Cole, G Parling, J Launchbury, T Wood, M Kvesic, B Vunipola.</p><h2>2nd XV<br /></h2><p>A Goode; C Wade, L Burrell, K Eastmond, B Foden; F Burns, D Care; M Vunipola, D Hartley, D Wilson, D Attwood, C Lawes, T Johnson, C Robshaw, B Morgan.</p><h2>3rd XV<br /></h2><p>M Tait; C Sharples, J Joseph, S Hill, J May; T Flood, L Dickson; J Marler, R Webber, Henry Thomas, G Robson, G Kruis, E Slater, W Fraser, D Ewers.</p><h2>4th XV</h2><p>C Pennell; J Nowell, H Trinder, S Geraghty, D Strettle; G Ford, Haydn Thomas; M Mullan, C Whitehead, P Doran-Jones, G Kitchener, K Myall, C Clark, L Wallace, J Crane.</p><h2>On standby<br /></h2><p>D Paice, R Buchanan, J George, P Doran-Jones, N Catt, N Wood, A Waller, C Matthews, T Savage, J Gibson, S Dickinson, R Wigglesworth, J Simpson, S Myler, H Slade, E Daly, J Elliott, U Monye, A Watson, N Abendanon.</p><h2>Injured<br /></h2><p>T Croft, M Tuilagi, B Barritt, J Haskell, L Cowan-Dickie.</p><h2>MATT FINISH</h2><p>Did anyone out there manage to watch all 50-plus hours of rugby union coverage on Sky Sports over the weekend? By the time Racing Métro and Clermont Auvergne started limbering up late on Sunday evening, you suspect relationships in hundreds of households across Europe were under significant strain. Too much of a good thing? Probably, but the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/exeter-chief-cardiff-blues-heineken-cup\" title=\"\">Exeter-Cardiff Blues</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/jonny-wilkinson-toulon-glasgow\" title=\"\">Toulon-Glasgow</a> fixtures produced some particularly striking action.</p><p>Man of the week? If there is one player in the Toulon team who you would currently pay to watch, live or on screen, it is Matt Giteau, the Australian centre whose Wallaby career seems to have petered out.</p><p>England and Wales will hope it remains that way; as underlined by the sharpness of his performance against Glasgow, there are few better creative second five-eighths out there.</p><h2>PREDICTION OF THE WEEK</h2><p>Curses. Our resident result-predicting rabbit Thumper 2 has struck back and cut the autumn deficit to 3-2, courtesy of Castres' victory over Northampton. This week we head to Scotland; old lop ears, who must have a bit of Caledonian blood somewhere, has plumped for the food bowl marked \"Glasgow\" while I think Exeter will continue their current hot streak.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419951899|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|4a8b8960705cd69860c1ffe8a864795e1e5e77cf -->",

        "body":"<p>Rory McIlroy summed up his comeback performance as \"pretty good so far\" after the second round of the Kolon Korea Open finished with the world No6 two shots off the lead.</p><p>McIlroy, who is playing his first tournament after a month-long break, is in a tie for fifth on three under par having shot a two-under 69 on day two at the Woo Jeong Hills Country Club course near Cheonan that could have been even better had he not made bogey on the 9th, his last.</p><p>McIlroy had a topsy-turvy opening nine, with two birdies and a bogey in his first four holes and him then dropping a shot on three holes in a row from 14 to 16.</p><p>However, the former world No1 bounced back to score five birdies in the next 10 holes.</p><p>Giving his reflections, McIlroy said: \"Pretty good so far. There was a few sloppy shots, or sloppily played holes. I made the bogeys on the back nine [his first nine] which wasn't great but most of the other stuff was actually pretty solid. I hit some good shots and made some good birdies so it was good.</p><p>\"I'm driving the ball very well and for the most part my iron play is pretty good, but I definitely missed a few opportunities out there. I definitely could have been a few shots better, but I'm in a good position going into the weekend and that's all you can ask for.</p><p>\"After that stretch [of bogeys] today on the back nine I turned it around and played the last 10 holes in four under, so it was a pretty good effort. I was a little disappointed to bogey the last there, but it was good for the most part.\"</p><p>Asked about his strategy for day three, the 24-year-old added: \"Just to keep playing the way I am, stay patient. I don't need to go out there and be overly aggressive, but I just want to get myself into a good position for Sunday if possible.\"</p><p>The four players ahead of McIlroy are all South Korean, with Hong Soon-sang carding a bogey-free three-under-par 68 to top the leaderboard.</p><p>He is on five under overall, one stroke ahead of compatriots Kang Sung-hoon, Kim Hyung-tae and Hwang In-choon, while tied fifth with McIlroy are two more home favourites – Yu Gyoung-yoon and first-round leader, Jang Ik-jae.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420386589|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|55513acd5912683fc0b0972e98ecf4afb0b14fa3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Rory McIlroy blew his chances of breaking his 2013 drought after a four-over-par third-round 75 left him 10 shots behind at the Kolon Korea Open.</p><p>The Northern Irishman began the day two off the pace in a share of fifth place but after a frustrating front nine, in which he missed a number of chances, he went backwards quickly after the turn.</p><p>He went out in level par at the Woo Jeong Hills Country Club course near Cheonan after his only birdie of the day – at the par-five fifth – was cancelled out by a bogey at the next. A double-bogey six at the 10th was the first of four dropped shots in five holes as McIlroy, who has not won since changing his clubs at the start of the year, fell further behind to finish the day one-over for the tournament.</p><p>Although the overnight leader, Hong Soon-sang, could manage only a level-par 71, dropping him into second on five under, Kim Hyung-tae shot a 66, the joint-best round of the week, to take a four-shot cushion into the final day. McIlroy has not given up hope of staging a miraculous recovery but was left to rue missed opportunities to strengthen his position on day three.</p><p>\"Last time here [in 2011] I shot 64 in the last round, so it would need something probably similar or a little better to have a chance,\" he told oneasia.asia.</p><p>\"A frustrating day because I was in contention after two days and if you shoot a solid score you're right in there. I've just got to go out there tomorrow and shoot the best score that I can. I just think the story of the day is that I missed a lot of putts, missed a lot of chances for birdies at the start of the round and then missed a few short ones for pars in the middle and end of the round. That's really what it was. It's a struggle, especially where they've put some of the pin positions.</p><p>\"It's tough to get yourself to commit to a certain line because you'll hit a few and they'll go through the break, and some turn more than others. It's just tough to commit to the line you choose.</p><p>\"I wanted to come here and play. It's nothing about trying to build confidence or anything like that. I guess more than anything else I wanted to shake the rust off this week and try and get into contention – and obviously try to win.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420428283|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|ed7244caee192958ece28194cd95080a763b3d98 -->",
