        "headline":"Which sport stories and characters should be developed into films?",
        "body":"<p>When Peter Morgan wrote Rush <a href=\"http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/rush-screenwriter-peter-morgans-10-year-rule-for-biopics.php\">he didn't include any motor racing in the screenplay</a> as he assumed that, even if the film was ever made, it would not be backed with a budget large enough to afford F1 cars. Morgan should have shown a little more faith in his creation.</p><p>Rush took over £2m on its opening weekend, climbed to the top of the UK box office charts on its second week in cinemas, and audiences have scored it 93% on Rotten Tomatoes and 8.3 on IMDB. Even Niki Lauda approved. \"When I saw it the first time, I was impressed,\" said the driver whose rivalry with James Hunt is captured onscreen. \"It was very accurate. There were no Hollywood changes. I wish James had been here to see the movie. It would have been the best.\"</p><p>The success of Rush may have surprised Morgan, but we are now living in the era of the credible sports films. A few years ago Ron Howard would have struggled to find the $50m required to make a feature film about a sport that remains of niche interest to American viewers. The suits would probably not have thrown their money behind a story about two drivers who contested an F1 season 37 years ago until one of them stopped racing due to heavy rain. </p><p>But sports films have moved on from the days when down-and-out sportsmen came back from the brink to overcome the odds and bore their viewers with a tale of rags-to-riches success. Gone are the clichéd days of Goal! III, Mike Bassett and There's Only One Jimmy Grimble. </p><p>Instead we are now treated to serious films made by serious film-makers. Alex Gibney, who has previously shot documentaries about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron:_The_Smartest_Guys_in_the_Room\">Enron</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Steal_Secrets:_The_Story_of_WikiLeaks\">WikiLeaks</a> and the death of an Afghan taxi driver who was beaten by American soldiers, will show his new film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=ukOJ_1b-8lQ\">The Armstrong Lie</a> at the London Film Festival this week. Stephen Frears, whose documentary about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/04/muhammad-ali-vietnam-draft-richard-williams\">Muhammad Ali's refusal to fight in the Vietnam War </a> aired on Sky Atlantic last weekend, is reportedly lined up to shoot a feature film about Armstrong. For viewers without access to the London Film Festival and Sky Atlantic, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/oct/17/why-the-crash-reel-is-the-one-film-you-should-see-this-week-video\">this week's must-see cinema release, The Crash Reel,</a> is about a champion snowboarder laid low by a traumatic brain injury. </p><p>Howard was attracted to Rush – and was able to fund his movie – on the back of the worldwide success of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/ayrton-senna-alain-prost\">Senna</a>, which broke <a href=\"http://edendale.typepad.com/weblog/2011/07/senna-breaks-uk-box-office-records-for-documentary.html\">UK box office records on its release</a> and went on to win the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9M_o9INS_o\">Bafta for best documentary in 2012</a>. </p><p>The success of films such as Rush, Senna and The Damned United has made sports movies a legitimate genre again. If films about Brian Clough's six weeks with Leeds United can bring in viewers and Oscar-winning directors want to tell the story of the 1976 F1 World Championship, what could come next? The forgotten story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/14/forgotten-story-reading-1985-86-season\">Reading's record start to the 1985-86 season</a>?

David Lengel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/st-louis-cardinals-la-dodgers-live\">has the blow-by-blow right here</a>. Interestingly enough, the big blasts were from Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez, the big contract players the Red Sox sent to L.A. in last year's Nick Punto Trade. That still seems to be working for both teams, doesn't it. The Dodgers are still one loss away from elimination, but they have Clayton Kershaw going for game six and, well, we know how game sevens can go.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525f1ba6e4b0760efba2ae7f\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T00:06:40.395+01:00\">7.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Just as all the experts predicted, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/15/boston-red-sox-detroit-tigers-live\">Boston Red Sox pitcher John Lackey outdueled the Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander in Comerica Park to pick up a 2-1 lead in the American Championship Serie</a>s. Okay, maybe nobody really expected that. After all, it was just 2011 when John Lackey, in year two of a mega contract, had one of the worst seasons a Boston starter had ever had and was nearly run out of Boston for his role in the whole &quot;chicken and beer&quot; clubhouse controversy. Well, a year removed from Tommy John surgery, Lackey has been very good for the Red Sox, <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/alcs-game-3-john-lackey-boston-red-sox-gem-detroit-tigers-justin-verlander-miguel-cabrera-prince-fielder-mike-napoli-101513\">none better than yesterday's outing where he limited a potent Tigers lineup to four hits, no walks and no runs throughout 6 2/3 innings</a>. The Red Sox held on to win 1-0, with the only real blemish on two-time Cy Young winner Justin Verlander's box score being a solo home run from Boston's first baseman Mike Napoli, who had yet to put a ball into the play during the series when he launched his 7th inning blast.</p> <p>While no team wants to be down 1-2 in a seven game series, especially when those two losses waste incredible performances by their top two pitchers (Verlander, game two starter Max Scherzer), this series is far from over. Now if Detroit doesn't win tonight, that might be a different story, as the Tigers can't realistically afford to drop to 1-3 and expect to win two games at Fenway Park. This puts some pressure on tonight's s starter Doug Fister, who had been their number two pitcher before Scherzer's breakthrough and the arrival of Anibal Sanchez. The Red Sox counter with Jake Peavy, the former San Diego Padres ace most recently a veteran rotation anchor for the Chicago White Sox.</p> <p>The Red Sox acquired Peavy in a trade that also sent defensive wizard Jose Iglesias to, interestingly enough, the Detroit Tigers. For whatever reason, perhaps the same reason that people don't believe in climate change or dinosaurs (hello Carl Everett), <a href=\"http://www.lucidsportsfan.com/2013/07/why-im-not-fan-of-jose-iglesias-for.html\">many Red Sox fans hated the move to trade a defense-first shortstop/nine-hole hitter for a starting pitcher who stabilized a rotation that lacked Clay Buchholz for most of the season</a>. If Peavy has a poor game, and Iglesias does anything special (he's normally good for one Web Gem every week or so) we should expect a lot of second guessing and &quot;why can't we get players like that&quot; rants emitting from Boston.</p> <p>While good, Peavy's still a tick below Lester, Lackey and Buchholz-if-healthy, combine that with Fthe fact that Fister pitches to contact more than his strikeout-machine teammates in the Tigers rotation. So, tonight might end up being a more of an offensive battle than the first three games of the context. Don't expect any no-hitter alerts, in other words. As much as we love pitcher's duels, and yesterday's was one for the ages, it would be nice to see the bats awaken a bit tonight. No matter how the game goes, we'll still be using your emails (send them to <a href=\"mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com\">Hunter.Felt.Freelance@theguardian.com</a>) and tweets (to <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a>) throughout the game.

Fail to garner a victory against the St Louis Cardinals in Game Five of the National League Championship Series, and their playoffs will be over. It's that simple.</p> <p>Back in June, with the Dodgers languishing in last place of the NL West, their wheels spinning, a squad chock full of injured players and their manager,<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/dodgers/la-sp-dodgers-notes-20131016,0,5763829.story\"> Don Mattingly, on the verge of being fired</a>, the Dodgers were also badly in need wins. LA responded with <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130818&amp;content_id=57367754&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb\">a once in a generation run - 42 wins in 50 games</a>, a stretch inspired by the emergence of the 22-year-old Cuban, Yasiel Puig, whose five tools and raw enthusiasm helped to propel Los Angeles to the playoffs.</p> <p>That they reached the postseason helped validate the work done by the Dodgers new owners,&nbsp;Guggenheim Baseball Management, whose public face is former LA Lakers hall-of-fame Magic Johnson. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303404704577309850685211084\">After purchasing the team for a whopping $2.15b,</a> the group set about undoing the damage of former hated Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who did his best to cripple the franchise. That they were able to dramatically turn their season around meant that the over <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/2013-payrolls-and-salaries-for-every-mlb-team-462765594\">$200m committed to players</a> on the field was money well spent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately for their ownership and fans, the playoffs are a crap shoot where payroll means nothing. And so here they are, months later, back in a desperate situation with health issues that ring familiar. The Dodgers winning percentage is above .600 with shortstop Hanley Ramirez in the lineup, below .500 without him, so it's a good sign that he's playing tonight&nbsp;vs the Cardinals - but after striking out three time in Game Four, how much can he contribute? Andre Ethier is still not healthy enough to play near his capabilities in center field, while Matt Kemp, his season long over, can only watch - yes, Dodger fans have seen this show before, and it doesn't end well. Even if Zack Greinke is on the mound tonight and Clayton Kershaw pitches a potential Game Six back in St Louis, LA will still need to <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2013_NLCS.shtml\">catch more than their share of breaks to rip off three straight games against these Cardinals.</a></p> <p>St. Louis are a deserving team, loaded with talent, also benefiting from facing these Dodgers at just the right time - but don't take anything away from them. Their league leading offense is also missing a vital cog in Allen Craig, but what they have put on the field is showing signs of regaining hitting form. Matt <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/15/st-louis-cardinals-la-dodgers-live\">Holliday's monster two-run home run in Game Four</a> is proof of that, the slumping Matt Carpenter also had himself a double last night. If that hitting spreads down to through the lineup, to Yadier Molina and David Freese, the Dodgers chances for a comeback grow even slimmer.&nbsp;</p> <p>St Louis brings back one of their prized young pitchers to face Greinke in Game Five. Dodgers fans remember that Joe Kelly hit Ramirez with a pitch in the ribs in Game One, and a hostile afternoon crowd at Chavez Ravine will remind him all game as he looks to topple the Cy Young award winning Greinke yet again. Should he succeed his Cardinals will reach their fourth World Series in nine seasons.</p> <p>I'll have lineups in a moment, but in the meantime, why not send your predictions and any other sentiments you may have to:</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com\">david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com</a></p> <p>Or via twitter:</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LengelDavid\">@lengeldavid</a></p> <p>This is your blog, a two way baseball conversation, and we look forward to getting your thoughts from wherever you're reading around the globe.&nbsp;</p> <p>Playoff baseball is coming your way soon, with first pitch coming a touch past 4PM EST, please stand by.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T20:02:12.275+01:00\">at 3.02pm ET</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420167440|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|ca7ce2febc99a45b269b1d14f1dd97e02d02827a -->",

        "body":"<p>The PGA of America is considering staging the US PGA Championship, one of golf's four majors, outside the United States. A report in Golf Digest states that a committee is studying the impact of holding the event around the world, with the earliest possible date in 2020.</p><p>The 2019 championship was awarded to Bethpage Black on Long Island last month. \"This is an exercise we are going through, an analysis,\" PGA of America chief executive Pete Bevacqua told Golf Digest. \"It is far from a fait accompli that we are going to take the PGA Championship international. When we sat down to map our strategic plan to service our members and grow the game the question arose as to what impact it would have to take the PGA Championship to an international location once or twice a decade.</p><p>\"It would be something we would only do if we had the co-operation of quite a few groups. It would need to work for the PGA Tour and it would need to work for the PGA Tour players.</p><p>\"Another would be the PGA in the particular area we would consider. We would want the international PGAs to be a part of this and share in this. Many pieces would have to fall in place.\"</p><p>Adam Scott fired a course-record 64 to storm past Justin Rose and claim victory at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda. Rose had led by a single stroke with three holes to play but he had no answer to Scott in the closing stages as the Australian won the 36-hole tournament – which gathers the season's four major champions – by two shots on eight under.</p><p>The Masters winner took control on the penultimate hole when his six-iron landed within inches to allow him a tap-in eagle three. The US Open champion Rose had given up his single-shot lead at the previous hole, forced to take a drop after a wayward tee shot, before par on the 17th left him two shots adrift as Scott accelerated.</p><p>Scott's win means that he was able to add the winner's pink jacket to the green one he dramatically secured after a play-off against Angel Cabrera at Augusta in April.</p><p>Jason Dufner finished third on three under while Padraig Harrington, who replaced the Open champion Phil Mickelson, was well off the pace on three over after a 71 on Wednesday.</p><p>Harrington was the defending champion after he stepped in for Ernie Els last year.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420185397|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|3a0085f5414687bbf20681bf2b465002d4e1f2d0 -->",

And yet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/10/mexico-v-panama-world-cup-2014-qualifier\">El Tri were unable to score at the Azteca, dropping points like flies and on the brink of finishing fifth in the group and missing out</a>.</p><p>On the last night, with Mexico losing in Costa Rica, who had already qualified for Brazil 2014, and Panama 2-1 up against USA, it seemed like the Mexicans would miss the finals for the first time since 1990 (and that was because El Tri were suspended for fielding ineligible players in a youth tournament).</p><p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/15/panama-vs-usa-live\">two US goals in injury time in Panama broke Panamanian hearts and allowed Mexico back in</a>.</p><p>And so, this is how Mexico reacted:</p><p><em></em></p><p>It was a night of strange emotions. Panamanians crying. Americans wondering whether their team should perhaps have tried a little less hard. Mexicans grateful to the USA. Centuries of historical antipathy congealed into a few minutes of football. Eighty years of soccer rivalry overturned in injury time.</p><p>Mexico's rollercoaster ride had only been possible thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/12/mexico-world-cup-qualification-panama-concacaf\">a spectacular late winner against Panama on Friday</a>.

        "headline":"Marco Di Vaio: still scoring after all these years",
        "body":"<p>Plenty of star players have great presence. The joint-top goalscorer in MLS has magnificent absence.</p><p>As the regular season comes to a climax, Marco Di Vaio is a leading contender for the league's two top individual honours, the Golden Boot and the Most Valuable Player award.</p><p>Yet he is not a showman in the manner of Thierry Henry and Robbie Keane, whose Los Angeles Galaxy host the Impact on Wednesday night. It's the opposite: Di Vaio is a spectre. He knows that elite scorers are at once predator and prey, hunting goals yet stalked by defenders who track their every step. Shooting is a science, elusion is an art.</p><p>So he lurks in the interstices of the back four, then melts from plain sight into the blurry hinterlands of a defender's peripheral vision. Now you see him, now he's gone. And within a couple of seconds he might well be celebrating.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The Italian has 19 MLS goals this season, level with the Chicago Fire's Mike Magee and one ahead of Camilo Sanvezzo of the Vancouver Whitecaps. </p><p>This without scoring from the spot, while Magee and Camilo each have three penalties. Only two of Di Vaio's goals have come from outside the box, and only one was a header. Two-thirds of his shots hit the target, and one-quarter beat the goalkeeper.</p><p>The most remarkable statistic is that he turned 37 in July. Unlike Henry, he has not drifted deeper to find more space and time as his legs have slowed, becoming as much a creator as a finisher. Di Vaio still leads the line, still plays like he did a decade earlier: rudely bumping up against his marker like they're rush-hour commuters, then peeling away to receive the ball and fashion an attempt on goal.</p><p>His movement deserves a sound effect and shimmering light, as if he's been beamed from A to B by Scotty. He even ghosted from nowhere into our interview, arriving late and almost unnoticed into the hotel lobby in downtown Houston ahead of the team's defeat by the Houston Dynamo earlier this month.</p><p>With so many close-range finishes he is a utilitarian goalscorer, and admits as much. \"The most important thing is to score goals that help the team. If I score and I don't help my team, for me [it's pointless]. I feel bad because I want to help the Impact go to the playoffs. It's very, very important for the team, the club, our fans. When I score, I want to score goals that help,\" he said.</p><p>Di Vaio left Bologna for Montreal in July last year, arriving as the franchise's first Designated Player during their maiden MLS season. He will earn $1.9m this year, according to MLS players union figures, making him the sixth-highest-paid player in the league.</p><p>In 2012 he scored five times in 17 matches and the Impact missed out on the playoffs. \"Now my teammates know me, know my movement, we feel very good at this moment and we can find ways to score,\" he said.</p><p>Montreal are fourth in the Eastern Conference, set for a post-season berth despite subsiding out of contention for first place after a strong start. They are an aberrant bunch: 17th out of the 19 MLS clubs in shots taken, yet fifth-equal in goals scored. Fewest fouls conceded; second-most fouls awarded. Only the wretched Chivas USA have taken fewer corners. Thanks to Di Vaio, no team has been given offside more often.</p><p>If a Golden Flag award existed it would be on Di Vaio's mantlepiece. He gives assistant referees repetitive strain injury. The striker has been judged offside 72 times in 30 MLS games this season, according to Opta. That is more often than 10 MLS teams. The least-flagged club, the Los Angeles Galaxy, has been given offside only 41 times. The runner-up on the individual list, the Seattle Sounders' Eddie Johnson, has been caught on 37 occasions.</p><p>It reveals plenty about Di Vaio's playing style, as well as an awareness that those aging legs need a head-start. \"I'm tired, I'm old,\" he grinned. \"It's not easy for me to play now but when I have a goal like this close to me, I want to push, because my objective is for the team to be in the playoffs for the first time.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420183525'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/9/1381344574801/Marco-Di-Vaio-at-Parma-in-001.jpg' alt='Marco Di Vaio at Parma in 2000' width='220' height='350' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Di Vaio left Europe seeking a fresh experience after a career spanning 20 years, 14 for Italy and 10 clubs in the Italian, Spanish and French leagues, among them Juventus, Parma and Valencia. Strangely peripatetic for a player who has been a consistently reliable goalscorer, though strikers who are pure finishers depend heavily on the creative ability of their team-mates. Montreal have three gifted assist-mongers: Patrice Bernier, Felipe Martins and Justin Mapp. </p><p>\"Over here there are new people and everything's a new challenge. It's a blank page that we can write how we want,\" he said. \"They said there'd be a new team, everything new, and I wanted to share this moment with them.\"</p><p>He finds Quebec both exotic and familiar. \"Montreal is a European club in North America,\" he said. As well as the city's cultural and architectural heritage, the Impact's transfer strategy has helped make Di Vaio feel comfortable.</p><p>He is one of five Italians along with two former Bologna teammates, Andrea Pisanu and Daniele Paponi; one-time Everton loanee Matteo Ferrari and the 37-year-old Serie A and <em>azzurri</em> great Alessandro Nesta.</p><p>Heavy recruitment from Italy was perhaps not surprising, given the background of the club's president, Joey Saputo, the son of an Italian immigrant who built a dairy empire. It was also logical for a Europhile fanbase, and is proving a smart decision on the field, where Nesta and Di Vaio's savvy compensates for their lack of speed and can make opponents look naive.</p><p>\"We bring a lot of experience from Europe and share it with the American players, with the South American players,\" Di Vaio said. \"If MLS pays a lot of money for players from Europe or South America, the ideas are different, because we're 100 years ahead in soccer. Now they have to improve at the technical and tactical level. [Then] they'll be one of the best leagues in the world.\"</p><p>The Impact parted company with their American head coach, Jesse Marsch, in the off-season, replacing him with an older man from Switzerland, Marco Schällibaum.</p><p>Di Vaio thinks that more coaches with international experience could help raise the league's standard and be adept at handling increasingly cosmopolitan squads. \"Now the whole world knows MLS, a lot of players want to come here to play, but they have to find a coach who understands everybody. With new coaches with new experiences and new ideas, MLS could be one of the best leagues in the world,\" he said.</p><p>For now, <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/10/15/marco-di-vaio-return-montreal-impact-2014-after-club-exercises-option\">Di Vaio has decided to remain with Montreal for at least another year</a>, despite what he termed \"a family problem in Italy\" that made him seriously consider retiring and returning to find a front-office job, possibly with Bologna.<br /> <br />Even after two decades, evading opponents and finding the ball, gliding like a phantom and filling those blank pages with goal after goal. That never gets old.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419521584|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|b7ae6df8e3e9f36146e93090ca553262c8e7a43c -->",

Now Los Angeles are back to digging out of a two game hole.</p> <p>The Dodgers will have Zack Greinke going for them tomorrow afternoon, but will they have Hanley Ramirez? LA might have been better off with Greinke throwing this game and Ramirez, who struck out three times and is in obvious pain, sitting on the bench. Still, you've got to like their chances to get this series back to St Louis - can the Cards really win games started by Grienke or Kershaw on three occasions?

Those sirens were back on moments later, signaling hot pursuit of Yasiel Puig, guilty of flipping flip his bat after thinking he hit a home run when in fact the ball didn't leave the yard - he eventually landed on third base with a triple. Early celebrating is a serious violation of baseball protocol to some purists.&nbsp;</p> <p>Naturally, some Cardinals players are not at all pleased, especially Carlos Beltran:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a player, I just think he doesn't know [how to act]. That's what I think. He really doesn't know. He must think that he's still playing somewhere else. He has a lot of passion, no doubt about that -- great ability, great talent. I think with time he'll learn that you've got to act with a little bit more calm.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Cards Adam Wainwright took issue with Gonzalez'&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;according to the USA Today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I didn’t see Puig’s reaction. I saw Adrian doing some Mickey Mouse stuff at second, but I didn’t see Puig.</p> </blockquote> <p>Adrian Gonzalez had an answer for that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are in LA. So Mickey Mouse does go. Mickey Mouse is only an hour away. So, you know, it fits us.</p> </blockquote> <p>Good stuff. Here's an even better quote from our own Steve Busfield, Guardian sports blogs editor:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They should be thanking the bat flip - he's probably have got an inside the park HR without it - and that would really have embarrassed them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bravo, and quite right. Another bravo goes to <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/why-dont-the-st-louis-cardinals-respect-the-game-1445679050?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_facebook&amp;utm_source=deadspin_facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">Deadspin, who point out that Yadier Molina did his share of fist pumping</a> after tagging out Mark Ellis in Game One of the NLCS after tagging out the Dodgers Mark Ellis at the plate in the 10th inning. They also show several other Cardinals &quot;disrespecting the game&quot; in a fabulous piece. It just goes to show you that all this &quot;respect the game&quot; junk that keeps popping up is just a load of horse&nbsp;patootie.</p> <p>Heck, we have a big game tonight, and if the Cards want to stop the Dodgers from celebrating in a &quot;wildly offensive manner&quot;, perhaps they'll consider winning in Game Four, because we all know that will do the trick. The big question in Dodger camp was if manager Don Mattingly would resist the temptation to use Zack Greinke, who pitched in Game One, on just three days rest, a day short of the usual break for starting pitchers. In the NLDS, Mattingly <a href=\"http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20131009&amp;content_id=62742136&amp;c_id=la\">did use ace Clayton Kershaw on short rest in Game Four </a>against the Atlanta Braves so that he could line up his pitching the way he wanted - that gamble worked. Tonight however, he'll bring out Ricky Nolasco, in what really is another must win for LA. That's a move that also comes with questions, such as, how much rest is too much rest? Nolasco hasn't pitched in a game since September 29th, and that was a relief appearance of one inning. The California native has done his best to stay sharp, pitching in simulated games and keeping on a throwing program, but there ain't nothing like the real thing. Will Nolasco, also making his postseason debut tonight, be sharp?&nbsp;</p> <p>He'll face Cardinals starter Lance Lynn, who actually came out of the bullpen and threw two scoreless frames in that 13 inning Game One encounter. In his only other start this October, he surrendered five runs to the Pirates.&nbsp;</p> <p>The most important thing you need to know about tonight is that <strong>you</strong>, the reader, have a clear understanding that this live blog is for you, and that it's a two way conversation.

The US certainly took the game to Panama in the second half, but once again for a few moments Panama dared to dream after Saborio's goal in Costa Rica and Tejada's goal here put them within an injury time of a World Cup playoff. Instead two USA injury time goals gave Mexico the most unlikely of lifelines.

Beckerman slides a lovely ball past a dummying Kljestan to Castillo on the outside, but his poked in pass is just in front of Boyd on the edge of the six yard box and Penedo grabs it.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525e04dfe4b0010b6627a82d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T04:17:28.996+01:00\">11.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">88 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Henriquez wants a penalty as he's bundled over on the edge of the box, but nothing given, then at the other end Boyd has a couple of glimpses of goal, but can't force a clean touch for a shot or header on either of them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mexico last missed a World Cup in 1990 when they were suspended. but haven't failed to qualify since 1982.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525e046de4b0bbc67cfff2f7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T04:15:39.299+01:00\">11.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">86 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Well then...for a brief period the USA were keeping Mexico in the World Cup with Orozco's goal, but the defender was nowhere on Tejada's goal, as the veteran evaded the US defense with his run into the box.

PANAMA 2-1 USA (TEJADA!)</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>OH my. In round about four minutes time we might see a Mexico goal. Because Panama have the lead here in Panama City! A low cross from Chen is palmed by Guzan only as far as Tejada on the edge of the six yard box and he bundles home. <strong>As it stands Mexico are out of the World Cup!</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525e036be4b0bbc67cfff2f3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T04:10:44.839+01:00\">11.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">82 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Davis picks out Castillo on the left and his cross is decent enough, but Boyd can't get anything on target and Panama go up to the other end, where Tejada (on for Sanchez by the way), can't get&nbsp;<em>his&nbsp;</em>header on target after a lovely cross from Torres to the back post.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525e0312e4b0bbc67cfff2f2\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T04:09:26.742+01:00\">11.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">80 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The US break out of some Panama pressure and move the ball from left to right with first time movement, but Johannsson can't quite get to the final cross as Penedo dives on it gratefully. Always a danger for Panama as they push for the win. Still <strong>Panama 1-1 USA</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525e0290e4b0bbc67cfff2f1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T04:07:58.102+01:00\">11.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">78 mins</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Kljestan jumps in midfield to intercept a dangerous looking ball over the top, targetting that vulnerable US right flank again.

Torres, L. Henr&iacute;quez; G&oacute;mez, A. Henr&iacute;quez, S&aacute;nchez, Quintero; Blas, G. Torres.</p> <p>So Castillo gets the start his cameo against Jamaica earned him, as does Zusi and the other sub who impressed, Kljestan. Diskerud, who looked much more effective further forward in the 4-2-3-1 is in there as well. That line of Zusi, Diskerud and Bedoya looks a pretty aggressive one behind Altidore.</p> <p>LA Galaxy’s Penedo remains in goal for Panama. He’s an excllent shotstopper (standing stock still as bicycle kicks fly past him notwithstanding). Dallas’s Blas Perez is up front and it looks like rather than 4-5-1, Panama will go 4-4-2 at home, as he’s listed alongside Gabriel Torres.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525dea02e4b0bbc67cfff2d4\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T02:23:54.101+01:00\">9.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Thankyou for following with the Guardian MBM</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>We realize that you have a choice of newspapers* and appreciate your support.</p> <p>*Newspapers such as Panama’s CRITICA, which greeted the news of Raul Jimenez’s bicycle kick goal, or <em>chilena</em>, <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/epic-headline-panama-paper-critica-react-to-late-mexico-defeat-with-fucking-chilena-front-page-banner/\">like this</a>&nbsp;(thanks to George Flowers for pointing this out)</p> <p>We’re grateful you prefer the gentle whimsy of Guardian hackery, though I might get a bit irritable later on. This is late for me.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T03:27:10.542+01:00\">at 10.27pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-525de940e4b0010b6627a813\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T02:20:46.044+01:00\">9.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">USA</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So expect a changed look US team tonight, as Landon Donovan and Jermaine Jones have gone home with injuries, and Tim Howard and Matt Besler have left too as part of a “planned rotation” according to US Soccer. That should mean a start for Brad Guzan in goal, who’s been pushing Howard hard of late for the number one spot and will want to impress in a rare start. And Clarence Goodson will be coming in to take Besler’s place, so expect Panama to want to try and test whatever the new look center back pairing is, early.</p> <p>Interesting to see if Graham Zusi did enough with his goal and lively cameo against Jamaica to get a start — with Donovan out he should be the obvious choice, and he has previous form against Panama — scoring his first international goal against them in July of last year. And after some public praise for Kyle Beckerman we should see the Real Salt Lake defensive midfielder coming in, probably for the injured Jones.</p> <p>As for the rest, Edgar Castillo looked lively as a sub on the left when he came on and the US switched to 4-2-3-1 on Friday, while Aron Johannsson had a mixed debut, creating a few first half shooting chances, and then not doing a lot with them. Interesting to see if and how he figures alongside Jozy Altidore.</p> <p>Meanwhile Twitter is feeling conflicted...</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bussruckley/statuses/390284647835643904\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KidWeil\">@KidWeil</a> I don't *want* the US to lose tonight, but I wouldn't be against it as long as Mexico does too</p>— Rusty (@bussruckley) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bussruckley/statuses/390284647835643904\">October 16, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525de7b4e4b0760efba2add7\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T02:14:47.108+01:00\">9.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Panama</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Panama are a dangerous team, albeit one that the US have coped with comfortably enough in qualifying and Gold Cup action already this year. Certainly the US can’t afford any of the same sort of complacency they showed up with in the first half against Jamaica, with the Panamanians desperate for a win.</p> <p>The reason they’re so desperate? Well after 84 minutes against Mexico on Friday, Panama had been level for three minutes and were dreaming of leaving the Azteca with what every other team in the group had done — namely, at least a point. Mexico looked stunned, the crowd was turning and the collective El Tri nightmare looked to be continuing. And then Raul Jimenez did this:</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPh2nPfUZXc\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LPh2nPfUZXc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>And everybody in Mexico went into a really, really good mood.</p> <p>The loss meant that Panama have it all to do tonight, but in their favor, for the part of it that they can control, the USA have not been great on the road in qualifying, despite a 100% home record. And having already qualified at the top of the table and fielding a team that’s likely to include some fringe players, the visitors may not be totally focused on the job.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525dce49e4b0bbc67cfff2cc\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T02:06:26.952+01:00\">9.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Good evening, and welcome to Panama vs USA — the final game for both teams in this year's World Cup qualifying. First off, quick quiz. Can anyone tell me what this sound is?</p> <p>Grrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnd...crunch. YAY! (silence)</p> <p>That's the grind of Concacaf qualifying, in all it's two-staged, hurled-bags-of-batteries-and-unmentionable-fluid-ed glory, coming to a halt. The Hex stage finishes tonight, with the USA already confirmed as table toppers, but their hosts, Panama needing a win and a large dose of good fortune as Mexico go to second place Costa Rica. Mexico in turn will be hoping Jamaica can do&nbsp;<em>them</em> a favor against Honduras, so that they can sneak into that third automatic qualification slot and avoid a two-legged playoff against New Zealand.</p> <p>I'll try to keep you up to date with events elsewhere as the evening goes on, and will be back shortly with a little more build up and team news.

Panama's two late collapses – against Mexico on Friday and USA on Tuesday – meant that they were the big losers from the drama. Panama have never qualified for the World Cup finals.</p><p>Now it is Mexico who will face New Zealand in home-and-away playoffs in November.</p><p>Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon summed it up (with a touch of political one-upmanship thrown in):</p><p><em></em></p><p><em></em></p><p>Roughly translated:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Playoff courtesy of the gringos</p><p>I received the national team World U17 champion, gold medal at the Pan American, Olympic gold medal.

Omar Infante is up with bases loaded and no outs. Infante takes ball one. Right now you gotta think they'd settle for a run scoring double play. Infante swings and misses at pitch two.

Peavy gets ahead of Avila 1-2, but he doesn't offer at Jake's next two pitches out of the zone. So it's a full count with nobody out, runners on first and second. This feels like a bit of jam. Avila fouls off Peavy's next pitch to keep the count the same. Comerica gets <em><strong>loud</strong></em>, they want to see runs too it seems.</p> <p>And Avila fouls one off of his foot, which always looks painful. Still 3-2 here. And Peavy's next pitch is a ball, to load up the bases with nobody out. </p> <p>Email from Adam Michelini:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One game in this series has to be a shoot out.

Peavy's up for his second inning of work to face Victor Martinez and Jhonny Peralta who have been the most dangerous Detroit hitters this go around. He gets Martinez on a 1-2 count and then, after Peavy brief consultation with his catcher, hits a fastball the other way for a leadoff single.

David Lengel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/st-louis-cardinals-la-dodgers-live\">has the blow-by-blow right here</a>. Interestingly enough, the big blasts were from Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez, the big contract players the Red Sox sent to L.A. in last year's Nick Punto Trade. That still seems to be working for both teams, doesn't it. The Dodgers are still one loss away from elimination, but they have Clayton Kershaw going for game six and, well, we know how game sevens can go.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525f1ba6e4b0760efba2ae7f\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T00:06:40.395+01:00\">7.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Just as all the experts predicted, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/15/boston-red-sox-detroit-tigers-live\">Boston Red Sox pitcher John Lackey outdueled the Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander in Comerica Park to pick up a 2-1 lead in the American Championship Serie</a>s. Okay, maybe nobody really expected that. After all, it was just 2011 when John Lackey, in year two of a mega contract, had one of the worst seasons a Boston starter had ever had and was nearly run out of Boston for his role in the whole &quot;chicken and beer&quot; clubhouse controversy. Well, a year removed from Tommy John surgery, Lackey has been very good for the Red Sox, <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/alcs-game-3-john-lackey-boston-red-sox-gem-detroit-tigers-justin-verlander-miguel-cabrera-prince-fielder-mike-napoli-101513\">none better than yesterday's outing where he limited a potent Tigers lineup to four hits, no walks and no runs throughout 6 2/3 innings</a>. The Red Sox held on to win 1-0, with the only real blemish on two-time Cy Young winner Justin Verlander's box score being a solo home run from Boston's first baseman Mike Napoli, who had yet to put a ball into the play during the series when he launched his 7th inning blast.</p> <p>While no team wants to be down 1-2 in a seven game series, especially when those two losses waste incredible performances by their top two pitchers (Verlander, game two starter Max Scherzer), this series is far from over. Now if Detroit doesn't win tonight, that might be a different story, as the Tigers can't realistically afford to drop to 1-3 and expect to win two games at Fenway Park. This puts some pressure on tonight's s starter Doug Fister, who had been their number two pitcher before Scherzer's breakthrough and the arrival of Anibal Sanchez. The Red Sox counter with Jake Peavy, the former San Diego Padres ace most recently a veteran rotation anchor for the Chicago White Sox.</p> <p>The Red Sox acquired Peavy in a trade that also sent defensive wizard Jose Iglesias to, interestingly enough, the Detroit Tigers. For whatever reason, perhaps the same reason that people don't believe in climate change or dinosaurs (hello Carl Everett), <a href=\"http://www.lucidsportsfan.com/2013/07/why-im-not-fan-of-jose-iglesias-for.html\">many Red Sox fans hated the move to trade a defense-first shortstop/nine-hole hitter for a starting pitcher who stabilized a rotation that lacked Clay Buchholz for most of the season</a>. If Peavy has a poor game, and Iglesias does anything special (he's normally good for one Web Gem every week or so) we should expect a lot of second guessing and &quot;why can't we get players like that&quot; rants emitting from Boston.</p> <p>While good, Peavy's still a tick below Lester, Lackey and Buchholz-if-healthy, combine that with Fthe fact that Fister pitches to contact more than his strikeout-machine teammates in the Tigers rotation. So, tonight might end up being a more of an offensive battle than the first three games of the context. Don't expect any no-hitter alerts, in other words. As much as we love pitcher's duels, and yesterday's was one for the ages, it would be nice to see the bats awaken a bit tonight.

        "headline":"Marco Di Vaio: still scoring after all these years",
        "body":"<p>Plenty of star players have great presence. The joint-top goalscorer in MLS has magnificent absence.</p><p>As the regular season comes to a climax, Marco Di Vaio is a leading contender for the league's two top individual honours, the Golden Boot and the Most Valuable Player award.</p><p>Yet he is not a showman in the manner of Thierry Henry and Robbie Keane, whose Los Angeles Galaxy host the Impact on Wednesday night. It's the opposite: Di Vaio is a spectre. He knows that elite scorers are at once predator and prey, hunting goals yet stalked by defenders who track their every step. Shooting is a science, elusion is an art.</p><p>So he lurks in the interstices of the back four, then melts from plain sight into the blurry hinterlands of a defender's peripheral vision. Now you see him, now he's gone. And within a couple of seconds he might well be celebrating.</p><p><em></em></p><p>The Italian has 19 MLS goals this season, level with the Chicago Fire's Mike Magee and one ahead of Camilo Sanvezzo of the Vancouver Whitecaps. </p><p>This without scoring from the spot, while Magee and Camilo each have three penalties. Only two of Di Vaio's goals have come from outside the box, and only one was a header. Two-thirds of his shots hit the target, and one-quarter beat the goalkeeper.</p><p>The most remarkable statistic is that he turned 37 in July. Unlike Henry, he has not drifted deeper to find more space and time as his legs have slowed, becoming as much a creator as a finisher. Di Vaio still leads the line, still plays like he did a decade earlier: rudely bumping up against his marker like they're rush-hour commuters, then peeling away to receive the ball and fashion an attempt on goal.</p><p>His movement deserves a sound effect and shimmering light, as if he's been beamed from A to B by Scotty. He even ghosted from nowhere into our interview, arriving late and almost unnoticed into the hotel lobby in downtown Houston ahead of the team's defeat by the Houston Dynamo earlier this month.</p><p>With so many close-range finishes he is a utilitarian goalscorer, and admits as much. \"The most important thing is to score goals that help the team. If I score and I don't help my team, for me [it's pointless]. I feel bad because I want to help the Impact go to the playoffs. It's very, very important for the team, the club, our fans. When I score, I want to score goals that help,\" he said.</p><p>Di Vaio left Bologna for Montreal in July last year, arriving as the franchise's first Designated Player during their maiden MLS season. He will earn $1.9m this year, according to MLS players union figures, making him the sixth-highest-paid player in the league.</p><p>In 2012 he scored five times in 17 matches and the Impact missed out on the playoffs. \"Now my teammates know me, know my movement, we feel very good at this moment and we can find ways to score,\" he said.</p><p>Montreal are fourth in the Eastern Conference, set for a post-season berth despite subsiding out of contention for first place after a strong start. They are an aberrant bunch: 17th out of the 19 MLS clubs in shots taken, yet fifth-equal in goals scored. Fewest fouls conceded; second-most fouls awarded. Only the wretched Chivas USA have taken fewer corners. Thanks to Di Vaio, no team has been given offside more often.</p><p>If a Golden Flag award existed it would be on Di Vaio's mantlepiece. He gives assistant referees repetitive strain injury. The striker has been judged offside 72 times in 30 MLS games this season, according to Opta. That is more often than 10 MLS teams. The least-flagged club, the Los Angeles Galaxy, has been given offside only 41 times. The runner-up on the individual list, the Seattle Sounders' Eddie Johnson, has been caught on 37 occasions.</p><p>It reveals plenty about Di Vaio's playing style, as well as an awareness that those aging legs need a head-start. \"I'm tired, I'm old,\" he grinned. \"It's not easy for me to play now but when I have a goal like this close to me, I want to push, because my objective is for the team to be in the playoffs for the first time.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420183525'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/9/1381344574801/Marco-Di-Vaio-at-Parma-in-001.jpg' alt='Marco Di Vaio at Parma in 2000' width='220' height='350' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Di Vaio left Europe seeking a fresh experience after a career spanning 20 years, 14 for Italy and 10 clubs in the Italian, Spanish and French leagues, among them Juventus, Parma and Valencia. Strangely peripatetic for a player who has been a consistently reliable goalscorer, though strikers who are pure finishers depend heavily on the creative ability of their team-mates. Montreal have three gifted assist-mongers: Patrice Bernier, Felipe Martins and Justin Mapp. </p><p>\"Over here there are new people and everything's a new challenge. It's a blank page that we can write how we want,\" he said. \"They said there'd be a new team, everything new, and I wanted to share this moment with them.\"</p><p>He finds Quebec both exotic and familiar. \"Montreal is a European club in North America,\" he said. As well as the city's cultural and architectural heritage, the Impact's transfer strategy has helped make Di Vaio feel comfortable.</p><p>He is one of five Italians along with two former Bologna teammates, Andrea Pisanu and Daniele Paponi; one-time Everton loanee Matteo Ferrari and the 37-year-old Serie A and <em>azzurri</em> great Alessandro Nesta.</p><p>Heavy recruitment from Italy was perhaps not surprising, given the background of the club's president, Joey Saputo, the son of an Italian immigrant who built a dairy empire. It was also logical for a Europhile fanbase, and is proving a smart decision on the field, where Nesta and Di Vaio's savvy compensates for their lack of speed and can make opponents look naive.</p><p>\"We bring a lot of experience from Europe and share it with the American players, with the South American players,\" Di Vaio said. \"If MLS pays a lot of money for players from Europe or South America, the ideas are different, because we're 100 years ahead in soccer. Now they have to improve at the technical and tactical level. [Then] they'll be one of the best leagues in the world.\"</p><p>The Impact parted company with their American head coach, Jesse Marsch, in the off-season, replacing him with an older man from Switzerland, Marco Schällibaum.</p><p>Di Vaio thinks that more coaches with international experience could help raise the league's standard and be adept at handling increasingly cosmopolitan squads. \"Now the whole world knows MLS, a lot of players want to come here to play, but they have to find a coach who understands everybody. With new coaches with new experiences and new ideas, MLS could be one of the best leagues in the world,\" he said.</p><p>For now, <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/10/15/marco-di-vaio-return-montreal-impact-2014-after-club-exercises-option\">Di Vaio has decided to remain with Montreal for at least another year</a>, despite what he termed \"a family problem in Italy\" that made him seriously consider retiring and returning to find a front-office job, possibly with Bologna.<br /> <br />Even after two decades, evading opponents and finding the ball, gliding like a phantom and filling those blank pages with goal after goal. That never gets old.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419521584|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|b7ae6df8e3e9f36146e93090ca553262c8e7a43c -->",

        "headline":"Line brawl during USA vs Canada women's ice hockey international",
        "body":"<p><em></em></p><p>The Canada and USA women's hockey teams fought a line brawl at the end of their game Monday in Burlington, Vermont – which Canada won 3-2.</p><p>The game was just an exhibition affair, but renews the rivalry between women's hockey's biggest giants. The U.S. and Canada had a similar donnybrook in 2009, ahead of the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, so perhaps it's as Canada's Hayley Wickenheiser summed it up for the Canadian Press: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I guess we have one every Olympic cycle to get it out of our systems.\"</p></blockquote><p>Four of the players involved were handed roughing majors. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/feb/27/canada-ice-hockey-winter-olympics\">The Canadian team landed in trouble after the last winter Olympics when the players drank and smoked cigars on the ice after winning gold</a>.</p><p>No doubt the next few days will be rife with discussions about whether the men's style of play has now transferred itself fully to the women's game, and/or – again – where, when or whether fighting needs to be part of the game at all. Though I've done plenty of my own hand-wringing on the subject, this tussle doesn't strike as the kind that necessarily needs to be eliminated. It wasn't a set-up brawl. The two teams weren't sending out the goons in the dying minutes to make a point. It's not necessarily something that's worthy of condoning, but it seems more legitimate a fight than others – those planned affairs that have become infamous and, thankfully, slightly less frequent recently. </p><p>Maybe that line between which fights are worthy and which are not is for many too fine a distinction to draw, but it does seem to be the most rational approach at the moment. It's this line of thinking, anyway, that Boston Bruins great and hockey legend <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/there-is-a-place-for-fighting-in-hockey-bobby-orr/article14850429/?page=all#dashboard/follows/\">Bobby Orr articulated this weekend at the Globe and Mail</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\"I would say this about the place of fighting in hockey. I believe that especially at the pro level you need to be held accountable for your actions, and the threat of a fight can accomplish that. The truth is, you couldn't pull the gloves off certain players if a fight was in their future, yet many of those same players in the modern game take liberties with others simply because they can. That is not right, and players should not be allowed to have it both ways. It leads me to the notion of what is commonly referred to as the 'enforcer.'</p></blockquote><p>Next scheduled debate: how do we define 'enforcer'? Just kidding (maybe).</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420030602|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|69c5e56fd25560ea402045a3edfc51d1b281690f -->",

A report in Golf Digest states that a committee is studying the impact of holding the event around the world, with the earliest possible date in 2020.</p><p>The 2019 championship was awarded to Bethpage Black on Long Island last month. \"This is an exercise we are going through, an analysis,\" PGA of America chief executive Pete Bevacqua told Golf Digest. \"It is far from a fait accompli that we are going to take the PGA Championship international. When we sat down to map our strategic plan to service our members and grow the game the question arose as to what impact it would have to take the PGA Championship to an international location once or twice a decade.</p><p>\"It would be something we would only do if we had the co-operation of quite a few groups. It would need to work for the PGA Tour and it would need to work for the PGA Tour players.</p><p>\"Another would be the PGA in the particular area we would consider. We would want the international PGAs to be a part of this and share in this.

Rose had led by a single stroke with three holes to play but he had no answer to Scott in the closing stages as the Australian won the 36-hole tournament – which gathers the season's four major champions – by two shots on eight under.</p><p>The Masters winner took control on the penultimate hole when his six-iron landed within inches to allow him a tap-in eagle three. The US Open champion Rose had given up his single-shot lead at the previous hole, forced to take a drop after a wayward tee shot, before par on the 17th left him two shots adrift as Scott accelerated.</p><p>Scott's win means that he was able to add the winner's pink jacket to the green one he dramatically secured after a play-off against Angel Cabrera at Augusta in April.</p><p>Jason Dufner finished third on three under while Padraig Harrington, who replaced the Open champion Phil Mickelson, was well off the pace on three over after a 71 on Wednesday.</p><p>Harrington was the defending champion after he stepped in for Ernie Els last year.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420185397|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|3a0085f5414687bbf20681bf2b465002d4e1f2d0 -->",

        "headline":"Ben Ainslie aiming for first America's Cup win for Britain after US victory",
        "body":"<p>Sir Ben Ainslie, the greatest Olympic sailor and now surely the undisputed king of the comeback following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2013/sep/26/america-cup-ben-ainslie-oracle-dramatic-victory-video\" title=\"\">his team's stunning victory in the America's Cup</a>, is vowing to win the oldest competition in world sport again, this time in a British boat.</p><p>Ainslie was celebrating an extraordinary win but, as is his wont, was already turning his thoughts to his new challenge. \"It would be great to get out a British boat next time,\" said Ainslie on Thursday. \"We have the sailors; it's just about getting the money together.\"</p><p>Ainslie, 36, was drafted in as tactician on Oracle Team USA to help reverse a losing streak that looked terminal. His skill – and his legendary steel – helped Oracle claim an amazing last-gasp 9-8 victory over Emirates Team New Zealand, having trailed 8-1.</p><p>Ainslie said he hoped the excitement would generate interest in his next goal. \"We've got a very proud maritime heritage in the UK. In terms of the sailors and the designers, we have the talent in the UK, that's for sure.\"</p><p>It has been an incredible 12 months for Ainslie, who won his fourth Olympic gold medal at London 2012. His comeback then was remarkable enough – he had trailed the genial Danish sailor Jonas Høgh-Christensen throughout the regatta and a lesser man would have pulled out with the awful back pain he was suffering.</p><p>Somehow Ainslie hung in and engineered the result he needed in the final race of the series, unfurling a union flag and letting off a red flare after crossing the finishing line off the Dorset coast – creating one of the most memorable images of the Games.</p><p>Again a lesser man would have spent days celebrating in the bars of Weymouth. But by then he already had the America's Cup in his sights. He made one last appearance in his beloved Finn class dinghy, Rita, sailing in front of Big Ben on the Thames. And then it was off to try to fulfil his boyhood ambition of winning the America's Cup.</p><p>The cup is a complicated competition. Ainslie spent the winter in California and Italy taking part in an event called the <a href=\"http://bar.americascup.com\" title=\"\">America's Cup World Series</a>, a sort of testing ground for sailors with ambitions of competing in the America's Cup proper, with his own Ben Ainslie Racing team.</p><p>The team did well, finishing on the podium in third place.</p><p>Then came possibly the biggest test of his career, the call-up to try to turn around Oracle Team USA's fortunes in the series with its New Zealand rival. Even the biggest of Ainslie's supporters could be forgiven for thinking that not even he could pull that one off.</p><p>But race by race Oracle got better and better. The New Zealand team stuttered and in the final contest, the Oracle team won on San Francisco Bay by a reasonably comfortable 44 seconds.</p><p>Ainslie, who has made his name competing in single-handed boats, clearly relished the team effort that went into this most dramatic of comebacks. \"We just grew and grew and in the end we were too strong for the Kiwis,\" he said. \"Everyone had written us off. \"The opposition had written us off. The experts had written us off.</p><p>\"I never gave up hope but I knew it would be hard. When I came in everyone was a bit down but I was a new face and that gave everyone a lift. I tried to be Mr Positive and we gelled well.\"</p><p>The stunning finish could not have been better for the sport. Even before the turnaround the series had won handsome audiences around the world, drawn by the sight of huge, powerful catamarans locked in combat with impressive Californian backdrops. Coverage on BBC2 has helped bring a new British audience to sailing.</p><p>There was sadness, too, in Ainslie's win, after the death in May of the British sailor Andrew \"Bart\" Simpson, who was killed in an accident during America's Cup training. Ainslie dedicated his part in the win to his friend. \"I looked up to the stars after it all settled down at the end and thought of Bart. In some ways this was for him. He loved sailing and he loved the America's Cup. He would have been so excited about this series.\"</p><p>After his Olympic win last year Ainslie recalled how he started sailing, on the creeks around Falmouth in Cornwall as an eight-year-old in a duffel coat and wellies. His America's Cup win prompted him to recall watching an America's Cup team off Falmouth in 1987. \"I remember as a kid watching them training and preparing and thinking about maybe one day being involved with the America's Cup. To be part of a winning America's Cup team is for me personally part of a lifelong dream.\"</p><p>But he is also a patriot. The America's Cup was first staged off the Isle of Wight in 1851 – but Britain has never won it. \"It's about time we changed that,\" he said.</p><p>Of course, Ainslie is realistic. Funding an America's Cup challenge costs millions. \"It takes a lot to bring us together in terms of the commercial support, financial support, to run one of these teams,\" he said.</p><p>Still his website puts it simply: \"Ben Ainslie Racing has a long-term aim to be a competitive challenger for the 35th America's Cup as Ben aims to win the oldest trophy in sport and bring the cup back to Britain where it all began over 160 years ago.\"</p><p>The course will be long and hard, but it would foolish to write Ainslie off.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418386095|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|9b102df30c7baa6c8fdccdd42c9a47dd3779a489 -->",

Just a week ago the America's Cup, a plutocratic sailing tournament that everyone loves to hate, was sinking into pre-ordained ignominy.</p><p>Accidents, boycotts and bickering marred the build-up, then the defending champion, Oracle Team USA lost eight of the first nine races in a desultory surrender to the challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand. Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who sponsored the team and brought the tournament to San Francisco bay, was gleefully trashed for his hubris. This cup would be remembered, if at all, as a damp squib.</p><p>Then the script changed. Oracle, a zephyr from defeat, rejigged its crew and mounted a spectacular comeback which electrified the contest and set the scene for a climactic, winner-take-all duel on Wednesday.</p><p>\"We're not going to stop – we're going to keep going all the way to the end,\" said skipper Jimmy Spithill after winning two races, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/25/oracle-team-new-zealand-americas-cup\">evening the score</a> at 8-8 on Tuesday. \"We really want this. You can sense it on board.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418278454'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/25/1380112338698/fb89d760-a668-44c5-9bac-71341ec0b673-460x276.jpeg' alt='Oracle Team USA leads Emirates Team New Zealand during race 18 of the America's Cup.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Oracle Team USA leads Emirates Team New Zealand during race 18 of the America's Cup.

Downcast Kiwis bemoaned another lost chance to take the cup to Auckland.</p><p>The drama of the greatest comeback in the cup's 162-year history has saved it, regardless who prevails. Gripes have turned into wonder at the spectacle of two huge catamarans, specially built for this event and crewed with elite sailors, duelling at more than 50mph.</p><p>\"Just when you thought it was safe to leave the water, the America's Cup has blossomed into a fantastic affair,\" marvelled <a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/americascup/2013/09/23/americas-cup-oracle-team-usas-amazing-comeback/\">the San Francisco Chronicle</a>. Oracle, it said, was on the cusp of the most improbable nautical victory since Nelson at Trafalgar.</p><p>Just a few weeks ago, the paper had floated a rather different comparison during the preliminary Louis Vuitton Cup: \"Perhaps the worst nautical launch since the Titanic set off across the North Atlantic.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418278453'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/25/1380112452376/58f6e12b-e820-4963-87f8-16ba3b45f02f-460x276.jpeg' alt='Oracle Team USA crosses the finish line during the 18th race of the America's Cup sailing event against Emirates Team New Zealand.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Oracle Team USA crosses the finish line during the 18th race of the America's Cup sailing event against Emirates Team New Zealand. Photograph: Ben Margot/AP</figcaption></figure><p>The about-turn came after Oracle's superstar sailors lost eight of the first 11 races. Ellison, who famously hates to lose, was going to lose. In a bold move the team replaced personnel, notably the tactician John Kostecki, a Bay Area native, with <a href=\"http://benainslie.com/\">Ben Ainslie, a Briton who has won four Olympic gold</a>. To widespread astonishment, Oracle then won nine of 13 races, including the two wins on Tuesday which tied the contest. Even when the Kiwis started with an advantage, the Oracle crew found a way to overtake.</p><p>\"The boat is just getting faster and faster,\" said Spithill. \"The boys are really starting to believe now. There's a lot of good energy on board.\" Wednesday's final, which is due to start at 1.15pm Pacific time, will be the most exciting day in their lives, he said.</p><p>The Team New Zealand skipper, Dean Barker, who may be about to enter the record books for the wrong reasons, called Tuesday's latest losses \"an absolute shocker\" and faulted himself for making a premature approach to the line, incurring a penalty.</p><p>The American side has actually won 10 of 18 races, having begun two races down because of a penalty for cheating in the America's Cup world series.</p><p>Ellison missed a keynote speech he was due to deliver at the Oracle OpenWorld conference to watch Tuesday's race, a scene Hollywood will surely mine should it make a movie.</p><p>A few months ago the America's Cup <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/11/americas-cup-disaster-san-francisco\">was in deep trouble</a>. What was billed as a glory of California's summer – 15 teams competing for sailing's most prestigious prize, generating $1.4bn in the process – had shrivelled into a bickering rump of just four teams. Accidents destroyed or damaged two catamarans and killed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/10/andrew-simpson\">Andrew Simpson, a British Olympic gold medallist with Sweden's Artemis Racing team</a>, prompting rule changes.</p><p>Italy's Luna Rossa Challenge team sat out some Louis Vuitton races – the warm-up contest to select the challenger – in protest. A major sponsor demanded a refund and San Francisco braced for a financial loss instead of a promised bonanza.</p><p>Oracle's initial rout deepened the sense of debacle as the main event got underway. Then began the comeback, and a cup dismissed as a tycoons' bauble became nail-biting drama.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418239774|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|11d1bd6cb3769e9143f9dcdf0b974cf43c10c931 -->",

        "body":"<p>The head of NBC Sports has responded to calls for the TV network to put a spotlight on Russia's draconian new anti-gay laws in its coverage of the upcoming Winter Olympics, saying there would be reporting of the issue but only if it should emerge as a problem during the games.</p><p>Mark Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Sports division, told an audience at the Television Critics Association in Beverly Hills that the issue of Russia's clampdown on gay men and lesbians had already been dealt with by the International Olympic Committee. \"The IOC has addressed it with the Russian government and has assured athletes, fans and media that there won't be any issues,\" he said, adding that should the new laws impacted any part of the Winter Olympics \"we will make sure we are acknowledging it and recognising it\".</p><p>The comments from Lazarus are unlikely to tamp down calls from the LGBT community for NBC to highlight Russia's aggressively anti-gay laws in its coverage of the Winter Olympics that is begin in Sochi on 6 February and run for 18 days. There have been widespread calls for protests and a boycott of the games.</p><p>Last week the Washington-based LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/ChadGriffin_NBCUniversal_07242013.pdf\">wrote to the NBC parent company</a> urging the network to use its broadcasting reach to expose \"this inhumane and unjust law to the millions of American viewers who will tune in to watch the games\". Specifically, HRC called on the network to refuse to air the opening ceremony of the games.</p><p>The new law, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/30/russia-passes-anti-gay-law\">signed by President Vladimir Putin last month</a>, imposes fines on those who spread propaganda \"directed at forming nontraditional sexual setups\" or that gives the \"distorted understanding\" that homosexuals are \"socially equivalent\" to heterosexuals. The \"homosexual propaganda\" penalised under the legislation includes wearing a rainbow flag or tweeting positive messages about gays or lesbians.</p><p>The law also provides for the arrest of foreigners engaging in such activities for up to 15 days followed by deportation. The IOC said last week that it had been given assurances from the Russian government that the sanctions for foreign nationals would not be applied to those participating in the games.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413821717|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|416ee2bf049af9b1ea88fc175e1eb03b9f6ce81c -->",

        "headline":"USA v Honduras: five things we learned",
        "body":"<h2>Right now, the US is edging Mexico</h2><p>The balance of power in Concacaf has tended to edge back and forward between the US and Mexico over the last 20 years, with Mexico generally held to be in the ascendancy – owing primarily to the superiority of their domestic league and the emphasis on youth development, which bore fruit with last year's stunning Olympic win.</p><p>This year, though, has been an ugly one for El Tri. They've struggled through the Hex phase of qualifying, and since the USA's symbolic win in the Azteca last summer, that stadium has hardly been the fortress of yore. The only surprise about their opening loss to Panama in the Gold Cup group stages was that it wasn't that big a surprise. Even after steadying and going through to the knockout stages, they were pushed all the way by Trinidad and Tobago, before being found wanting yet again by Panama in the semi-finals, as the Panamanians reached their first final since 2005 and ended any hope of a Mexican threepeat over the US.</p><p>And while Fifa rankings that regularly assert England as world-beaters need always be taken with a pinch of salt, the fact that the US overtook Mexico in the rankings felt about right as an assessment of where both squads are – regardless of the skewing of the stats caused by largely B teams playing in the Gold Cup. Whether they stay there through next year is perhaps not down so much to the US, who are playing as well as could be expected, but how much ground a floundering Mexico can make up with the talent at their disposal.</p><p>Certainly expect a very awkward inquest for José Manuel 'Chepo' de la Torre on his return to Mexico. Being pelted with cups, as he was after the first Panama loss, may be the least of his worries. There was doubt about him keeping his job even had Mexico retained the Gold Cup. The chances of him being on the sidelines in Brazil look very slim indeed.</p><p><em></em></p><h2>Can we now regard Honduras part I as a blip?</h2><p>It all seems so long ago now — the opening game of the Hex in Honduras, where the US went down to a defeat that prompted a spiral of soul-searching that reached its nadir just before the infamous Costa Rica snow game. At that point the prospect of a 10-game winning streak for this side looked remote indeed, and the Klinsmann project was being subjected to critical scrutiny and off-the-record briefings to journalists that suggested all was far from well.</p><p>Not so, insisted Klinsmann this week, calling the first game against Honduras \"a blip\" on what had otherwise been a steadily upward trajectory over the past two years. The US won the return in a tight game in Utah last month, and on Wednesday night they blew past the Hondurans in imperious style, suggesting there was substance to Klinsmann's claims.</p><p>The latter game of course was a game largely between players who may be on the fringes of their national teams' first XI (though the incumbent Graham Zusi may have been exhaling particularly hard while watching Landon Donovan's displays in this Gold Cup). And while it seems prudent to take some of the best and worst performances of the national team as outliers when considering where they truly stand, the improvement of those depth players since the particularly awful game against Canada in MLS pre-season is a definite marker for progress.</p><p>The passing is crisper, the understanding greater, and perhaps most impressively the midfield personnel are able to be rotated without a noticeable loss of fluidity. Beckerman, Holden and Diskerud have all played their part at the base of the midfield, while Bedoya came in for Corona against Honduras and had one of his best games for the US. The ability to change pace and spring defenses is night and day, as both the first two goals against Honduras perfectly illustrated.</p><p>That idea of players not just as stopgaps, but as active and serviceable depth with an individual understanding of their role and responsibility in the system, is where we can fairly talk about real progress in the US team. It doesn't make the USA world-beaters, but it does mean that compared to just six months ago, or even some of their turgid midfield slogs of 2012, they are certainly a team.</p><p><em></em></p><h2>Goodson makes a case for himself</h2><p>The consensus at the end of the most recent round of World Cup qualifiers was that the first choice center-back pairing was now Gonzalez and Besler, after the latter had played his way into contention at the start of the year and apparently solved one of the longstanding questions over Klinsmann's selection choices. And when Klinsmann exercised his right to exchange four squad players after the group stages, it was perhaps no surprise to see those two brought in to the squad, presumably to slot straight into the side.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly though, only one of those players went into the team – and it wasn't the (barely) more experienced Gonzalez, but the more thoughtful Besler who has stepped in. The other center-back role has been filled by Clarence Goodson, who followed up his first international goal in two years against Guatemala in the tune-up game for the tournament, with the opener against El Salvador in the quarter final – in both cases showing an unlikely predator's instincts in the box.</p><p>He kept his place against Honduras and continued another trait of recent performances – looking up and trying to get the ball forward quickly.</p><p>It's precisely what Klinsmann wants from his team, and precisely what they've lacked during the formative part of his reign – players willing to play the percentages and trust that possession per se means less than the number of chances created by forward movement. Goodson has been doing his chances of being one of the four central defenders for Brazil no harm at all.</p><h2>Eddie Johnson has put down a marker </h2><p>It's not exactly \"watch the throne\" – maybe more \"watch the third or fourth in line for the throne\", but Klinsmann must be delighted at the heating up of competition for striker spots in his squad. First of all it was Chris Wondolowski who responded to his heels being held to the fire by Jack McInerney's MLS form and inclusion in the Gold Cup squad, by opening his international account with a flurry of goals at the start of this tournament, to keep the young pretender in his place.</p><p>And then when Eddie Johnson was called into the squad after the group stage, he too wasted no time in sending a message to Wondolowski in turn. Jogging onto the field and heading a goal within seconds to better the efforts of the man he'd replaced was one thing, but having duly claimed the starting spot for the semi-final, Johnson quickly sent another finish with his burst through on goal and emphatic finish to open the scoring.</p><p>The goal was more than just one that gave the US an early lead – it was a sickener for Honduras. They'd already come out playing with their instinctive conservatism – dropping deep to counter US balls over the top and hoping to spring on the counter to snatch a goal to defend.</p><p>Johnson's goal confirmed their worst fears about what the game might bring and saw them sink deeper and deeper in the wake of the goal, to the extent that the US defensive midfielders were able to have potshots from near the edge of the box, and the Honduran attack looked negligible.</p><p>It's possible that Wondolowski would have taken that goal, though when he did eventually come on to the field with a two goal cushion in place, it was hard to escape the feeling that that was about the right order of things – a now proven poacher, with the ability to constantly move and occupy defenses so that they can't commit to helping chase the game, replacing a man more likely to get goals for this team against stronger opposition.</p><h2>'Overboiling'</h2><p>Jurgen Klinsmann's English is a million times better than my German, and he speaks as he asks his teams to play – without fear. </p><p>And as Clint Dempsey can testify, occasionally he has harsh words for his own players, though usually within the frame of expecting the absolute best from them. Even after Donovan's standout performances in this tournament Klinsmann was keen to emphasize that he expected more, and had told the player as much:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Your benchmark is the best Landon Donovan ever. I'm not taking anything less than that — and he's trying to catch up with that.</p></blockquote><p>It's the kind of statement that looks harsher in transcript than it does when delivered in Klinsmann's usual affable manner, where even the most critical comments are delivered with indulgent chuckles. </p><p>With his self-deprecating interview persona it's easy to forget sometimes that Klinsmann is a fierce competitor, though we got a glimpse of it against Honduras when a furious Klinsmann was ejected after vehemently protesting a foul on Beasley just in front of his technical area. The coach should have known better given the whimsical nature of concacaf refereeing — indeed his outburst had been prompted by it — but after the game he was back to his even self in apologizing (\"I just kind of overboiled it\"). </p><p>Under Concacaf Gold Cup rules there isn't an automatic suspension for Klinsmann for the final, and it's possible he will be allowed to take his seat on the bench, depending on the results of a disciplinary enquiry. If he isn't on hand however, this will be an interesting test for the cohesion of the team and possibly an unwelcome distraction from what's been an absolute procession of a tournament so far.</p><p>But if Klinsmann's claims about the steady upward trajectory of the team are correct, and if the level of understanding is truly what the Gold Cup performances have suggested it is at, then it might perhaps be intriguing to watch this side on autopilot for one game.</p><p><em></em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413634557|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|87a43821d2b10b57215fefbe17158cf3c142d474 -->",

        "headline":"Wichita State's Cinderella run takes them to the Final Four over Ohio State",
        "body":"<p>For a while on Saturday, March Madness had subsided into, at best, mere March Irrationality. Halfway through the second game of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament doubleheader, it felt the first day of Elite Eight action was a complete bust. The opening game, Syracuse's low-scoring win over Marquette, had been something of a dud, and it looked as though ninth-seeded Wichita State was headed towards a surprisingly easy victory over second-seeded Ohio State. In the end, the Wichita State Shockers would pull out the victory, securing a Final Four appearance that few saw coming, but nothing about it would be easy.</p><p>At times during the West Regional finals, not even a struggling Ohio State looked like it believed that Ohio State were capable of a final push against Wichita State. At halftime the score was 35-22 in favor of Wichita State, who would push the lead up to as many 20 points for stretches during the second half. At times at the Staples Center, it looked all the world like Ohio State were the inexperienced lower-seeded Cinderella team and Wichita State were the favorites. </p><p>Coming out of the half, however, officials did start calling the game significantly tighter, and this changed the match's entire flow. Ohio State were able to adjust while Wichita State weren't. While the Buckeyes were having trouble getting shots to fall, especially three-pointers (5-25),<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/31/ohio-state-lost-wichita-state-ncaa_n_2986751.html\"> they were able to go 19-for-22 on the free throw line in the second half</a>, a big reason they were able to cut into Wichita State's lead. The nonstop whistles for fouls and the cavalcade of timeouts used by both teams, not to mention the network, may have also disrupted Wichita State's offensive rhythm as much as they irritated the television audience. Not even counting fouls and other breaks of action, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaolaBoivin/status/318166024837009408\">including a pause for a player to recover his contact lens</a>, there were nine official timeouts in the last 6:30 of game time. It felt like hundreds.</p><p>So Ohio State, coming off back-to-back games won on last second shots thanks to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/25/florida-gulf-coast-sweet-sixteen-upset\">Aaron Craft</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/29/march-madness-indiana-eliminatied-by-syracuse\">LaQuinton Ross</a>, looked as if they were making a comeback and Wichita State apparently knew it. Late in the game, an obviously rattled Wichita State began making bad fouls and unforced errors. With less than three minutes left on the clock, Ohio State cut the once insurmountable 20 point lead down to 3, it looked like Wichita State were re-enacting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/30/march-madness-michigan-defeats-kansas-fgcu-eliminated\">Kansas's collapse against Michigan the day before</a>. Then Wichita State's Tekele Cotton responded with this key three:</p><p>With the Wichita State lead now doubled, the Buckeyes responded with a Deshaun Thomas layup to cut it closer, but then Fred Van Vleet essentially the iced the game with a jumper, making it 67-61 Shockers with exactly one minute to spare. The Ohio State Buckeyes were not going to get a chance to make a last second game-winner this night. When the game ended, the Permanent Timeout so to speak, Wichita State had beaten Ohio State 70-66. Wichita State was heading to its first Final Four since 1965. As Fox Sports Radio's Ben Maller <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benmaller/status/318139571655307264\">pointed out on Twitter</a>: \"Last time Wichita State was in Final Four, gas cost 31 cents, St. Louis Gateway Arch was completed, Lyndon B. Johnson was President\".</p><p>Wichita State's run through the tournament makes them a spiritual successor, in a way, of 2006's George Mason whose Final Four appearance <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/-college-basketball-mens-tournament/news/20130330/wichita-state-ncaa-tournament/\">redefined what so called mid-majors could accomplish</a>. Much like George Mason, Wichita State might be a Cinderella team, but that doesn't mean that they were relying on any magic tricks to get there. To make it to the Final Four, the Shockers had to win four straight games, along the way eliminating both a one-seed in Gonzaga and a second-seed in Ohio State. Nothing they accomplish from here on out, no matter their initial seeding, will truly count as an upset because they've proven themselves to be a flat-out good basketball team. Which is a good thing, because Saturday's hard won victory means that head coach Gregg Marshall gets to prepare his team to face the winner of Sunday's game between overall top-seeded Louisville and dangerous second-seeded Duke. </p><p>So the West Regional final ended up being thrilling, way more thrilling than Wichita State fans probably wanted, especially compared to the East Regional final that came before it. The Elite Eight opened on Saturday afternoon with third-seeded Marquette facing fourth-seeded Syracuse, and the game continued with this year's tradition of starting every new round of the NCAA tournament with an absolute snoozer. The Syracuse Orange defeated the Marquette Golden Eagles in a 55-39 game that was even less enthralling than the score indicates.</p><p>After their blow-out win against Miami Hurricanes, Marquette reverted back to the inconsistent team that probably should have lost to either Davidson or Butler in its first two games. Meanwhile Syracuse brought the same smothering defense that the brought during their shocking upset of Indiana. The results? The Marquette Golden Eagles hit 12-53 from the field, a staggeringly ridiculous statistic that questions how much of it was great defense on Syracuse's part and how much was just Marquette incompetence. Syracuse's offense wasn't exactly easy on the eyes either, with, as usual, the very notable exception of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/michael-carter-williams-is-the-point-man-of-syracuses-run.html?_r=0\">star guard Michael Carter-Williams</a> who scored 12 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists. Carter-Williams most likely will declare for the 2013 NBA Draft, and it's absolutely frightening to imagine this Syracuse offense without him.</p><p>The highlight for those watching the game at Washington DC.'s Verizon Center might have been spotting <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2013/03/30/president-obama-robert-griffin-iii-are-at-the-syracuse-marquette-game/\">the most influential man in the city</a>. Yes, Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III was there watching the game, along with noted Chicago politician Barack Obama. It was actually rather brave of the president to show considering <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/mar/21/president-obama-march-madness-ncaa-bracket\">that he had predicted this would be an Indiana-Miami matchup</a>. When the score was 18-7 a full six and a half minutes into the game, I'm sure he could even the staunch Republicans in the crowd were wishing Obama's predictions were right.</p><p>Not that the Syracuse Orange and their fans cared at all that they hadn't been involved with the most entertaining 40 minutes of basketball in tournament history. Cheering head coach Jim Boeheim as he was cutting down the nets was all the excitement they needed. Boeheim has now made <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/blog/eye-on-college-basketball/21978251/boeheim-orange-back-in-final-four\">four Final Four appearances in four different decades</a> and has a change to take Syracuse even further next weekend when he faces the winner of Saturday afternoon's game between No. 4 Michigan and No. 3 Florida.</p><p>Even if this is the end of the road for Wichita State or Syracuse, they have in many respects, already won. As Mike Pesca <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pescami/status/318131772443480065\">put it succinctly</a>: \"Syracuse now in the Final 4 in NCAA B-ball, the only sport where we care more about semi finalists than finalists\". It's a joke, but there's some truth there, making the Final Four isn't just advancing to the next round in the tournament, it's a validation for an entire program. Considering the challenges of advancing in such a crowded field, consisting of either 64 or 68 teams depending on how one classifies the First Four play-in games, being among the last four standing is almost as impressive as winning the championship in another playoff system. </p><p>That \"almost\" qualifier is huge though. Saturday night, Wichita State and Syracuse both cut down their respective nets and celebrated an accomplishment that few had expected from either of them. Sunday, one imagines will be less fun, as they will learn, at the same time as the rest of the college basketball world, which team will be all that's between them and an appearance in a national championship game. Neither of them will be thinking very much about settling for an \"almost\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/406480792|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|f9bad760efbdafdbc63afd1ba1da6086310c95fb -->",

        "body":"<p>Spencer Hawes had 18 points and career highs with 16 rebounds and seven blocked shots to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 98-91 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday night.</p><p>Jrue Holiday added 27 points and 12 assists to help the Sixers win for only the third time in 15 games. While the Sixers are one of the worst road teams in the league, they are 19-17 at home.</p><p>The Sixers led by one at the end of the third quarter, then opened the fourth on a 19-4 run to put away the Pacers. Evan Turner and Thaddeus Young each contributed some lead-stretching buckets in the fourth to put all five starters in double figures.</p><p>Roy Hibbert had 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers.</p><p>The 76ers had enough this time to finish off one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. They had a late lead and the Heat on the ropes until they blew it and lost by four Wednesday night.</p><p>Just like they did against Miami, the Sixers got into an early groove in the quarter to put the upset alert on notice. Dorell Wright hit a 3-pointer and Lavoy Allen came off the bench to score his first two baskets to get a big run going. They forced turnovers on consecutive possessions at one point during the spurt and built a 10-point lead.</p><p>Somehow, Hawes, the much-maligned 7-1 center, outplayed Hibbert. Hawes has settled in nicely as a starter after an erratic first 42 games as a reserve. He had a fantastic one-handed rebound right over Hibbert's head in the third that put the crowd of 18,587 on their feet. Hawes had six blocked shots through the first three quarters and made the Pacers think twice about going inside.</p><p>At San Antonio, Tim Duncan had 30 points and 12 rebounds, Kawhi Leonard added 24 points and 13 boards, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-113.</p><p>Manu Ginobili added 14 points and 10 assists, Nando De Colo had 11 points and Tiago Splitter had 10 for San Antonio, which is 1½ games ahead of Oklahoma City in the Western Conference.</p><p>Wayne Ellington had 21 points and fellow reserve Marreese Speights added 19 for Cleveland. Shaun Livingston had 16 points, and Alonzo Gee and Dion Waiters added 15 apiece.</p><p>Neither offense was slowed by the loss of its starting All-Star point guards. The Spurs' Tony Parker is expected to miss another two weeks with a Grade 2 left ankle sprain and Cleveland will be without Kyrie Irving (shoulder) for another three weeks.</p><p>In Portland, Oregon, LaMarcus Aldridge had 31 points and 12 rebounds, and the Portland Trail Blazers handed the Detroit Pistons their eighth straight loss with a 112-101 victory.</p><p>Rodney Stuckey had a season-high 32 points for the Pistons, who have yet to win a game in March.</p><p>After trailing by as many as 11 points in the first half, the Blazers took a 90-81 lead on Nicolas Batum's 3-pointer with 8:33 remaining in the game. Portland extended the lead to 99-87 on J.J. Hickson's dunk.</p><p>In other games Saturday, Martell Webster scored a career-high 34 points in the Washington Wizards 127-105 win over the Phoenix Suns, Paul Pierce had 14 points, eight assists and six rebounds as the Boston Celtics powered past the Charlotte Bobcats 105-88 and Gordon Hayward scored 17 points in the Utah Jazz's 90-84 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405732009|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|1307fa0fd6929b512974550cf8fd512e23dea07b -->",

        "body":"<p>The best season start in NHL history was ended on Friday as the Chicago Blackhawks lost 6-2 at the Colorado Avalanche.</p><p>It was Chicago's first loss in regulation time this season and ended a remarkable run in which they earned at least one point in their first 24 games, an NHL record.</p><p>Elsewhere, Anaheim shored up its hold on second place in the standings with a win over Calgary, while Ottawa ended a four-game skid by edging the New York Rangers.</p><p>Colorado's Matt Duchene scored four points and Ryan O'Reilly got his first goal since his contract dispute was resolved more than a week ago. O'Reilly assisted on another goal in a four-goal onslaught in the second period that turned a 1-1 tie into a no-contest.</p><p>The Blackhawks' previous loss in regulation on the road came more than a year ago. Dating back to last year's regular season, their points streak was 30 games, still five short of the all-time record held by the 1979-80 Philadelphia Flyers.</p><p>Anaheim's Daniel Winnik ended an 18-game goal drought on the first shot of the game, setting up the Ducks' 4-0 win over the Calgary Flames.</p><p>Viktor Fasth posted his second career shutout with 29 saves, while Bobby Ryan and defenseman Sheldon Souray scored less than 2½ minutes apart in the second period for Anaheim, who have won 16 straight at home against Calgary.</p><p>Ryan Getzlaf notched his 500th NHL point on the same day he signed an eight-year, $66m contract extension.</p><p>Ottawa's Jakob Silfverberg broke a tie with 4:41 left to give the Senators a 3-2 win over the New York Rangers.</p><p>Zack Smith and Patrick Wiercioch scored in the first period for the Senators, who improved to a surprising 12-1-1 record in their past 14 visits to Madison Square Garden.</p><p>Rick Nash and Brad Richards scored in the opening period, but the Rangers had a season-best, four-game winning streak broken.</p><p>Nashville's Colin Wilson had a career-high two goals and two assists, as the Predators thrashed the Edmonton Oilers 6-0 to snap a three-game skid.</p><p>Winnipeg's Dustin Byfuglien scored with 40.5 seconds left in overtime to give the Jets a 3-2 win over the Florida Panthers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405310713|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|d4a864e540d66a018599c511ca5e4f4658b52fb0 -->",
