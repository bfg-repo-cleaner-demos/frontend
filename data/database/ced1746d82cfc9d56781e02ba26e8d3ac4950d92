        "body":"<p>England are likely to play all five Australia-based members of their World Cup squad in Saturday's warm-up match against Italy, including the three Burgess brothers, as the coach, Steve McNamara, finalises his plans for the opening match of the tournament against the Kangaroos in Cardiff seven days later.</p><p>McNamara confirmed from the team's training camp in South Africa that one of the main reasons he was keen to organise a competitive fixture before the tournament proper – in contrast to Australia, whose coach Tim Sheens will be an interested spectator at the City of Salford Stadium on Saturday afternoon – was to accelerate the assimilation process for Sam, George and Tom Burgess, plus the Canterbury prop James Graham and the Melbourne Storm stand-off Gareth Widdop.</p><p>Graham, Widdop and 24-year-old Sam Burgess have not played for England since the 2011 Four Nations series and the 21-year-old Burgess twins are both uncapped. The Italy game could be especially significant for Widdop, who has made an unexpectedly quick recovery after suffering a dislocated hip in June but has made only two appearances in four months. \"I was there at the game when he suffered the injury and I didn't think he had a cat in hell's chance,\" said McNamara. Now he has the chance to press his claims either as a half-back option or possibly at centre.</p><p>McNamara will select 20 of his 24-man squad to be used in a game likely to be played with unlimited interchanges, meaning it will not have full international status.</p><p>Two more players are likely to drop into the England Knights team who will face Samoa in a potentially intriguing curtain-raiser, along with Brett Ferres, the Huddersfield forward who was taken to South Africa as cover in case any members of the original 24 are injured before the tournament.</p><p>Sean O'Loughlin, the Wigan captain who played his first match in more than a month in the Super League Grand Final on 5 October, was not considered, to give him an extra week to ensure a full recovery from his achilles problems, and the Warrington forward Ben Westwood is serving a one-match suspension for punching Blake Green at Old Trafford.</p><p>\"None of our Australian-based players were available for the tournament we had at the end of last year [against Wales and France] or the Exiles match we had in June, so it is important that we fit them back in,\" said McNamara. \"We're excited about playing a game. We don't play enough games as England as it is and Italy will be completely new opposition for us.</p><p>\"We've done some quality work out here in South Africa. That was the whole purpose of getting away. But it was important for us to play a game.</p><p>\"Each international team has their own way of preparing – Australia's is different from quite a few countries but that's not saying it's right or wrong. It's important for us that we come back from South Africa and play on the Saturday afternoon, because that gives us a seven-day turnaround before Cardiff and our whole tournament is based around Saturdays, so we can get into that routine.\"</p><p>The England squad will fly back into Manchester on Wednesday, with the Kangaroos due 24 hours earlier. They have not organised a warm-up match, with Sheens happy that an intense practice session will prove as valuable as England's game against an Italy team who will be making their World Cup debut – also at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday week, against Wales in the second match of the opening double-header – and who McNamara admits are very much an unknown quantity.</p><p>They include several recognisable and high-calibre names, led by Anthony Minichiello, the Sydney Roosters full-back who was a Grand Final winner against Manly last weekend and won 19 Australia caps between 2003-05. He is relishing the opportunity of playing alongside his younger brother Mark, a second-row with the Gold Coast Titans, and Italy also include the St Helens forward Anthony Laffranchi and the Newcastle Knights prop Kade Snowden in a team boasting plenty of senior experience.</p><p>But they have suffered a major blow to what was already fragile credibility, given their almost total reliance on Australians and a corresponding lack of authenticity – partly as a result of a split between two domestic competitions in Italy – with the late withdrawals of Terry Campese, Vic Mauro and Craig Gower, the latter a former Italy rugby union international.</p><p>Other warm-up games next weekend include New Zealand against the Cook Islands in Doncaster, with a possible appearance by Sonny Bill Williams following his late decision to make himself available for the Kiwis' title defence; Scotland versus Papua New Guinea in Featherstone; and France against the United States in Toulouse.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419929973|2013-10-16T10:54:20Z|d38727ae1bf616c32a85917aa56e8bfd64160954 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sonny Bill Williams has confirmed he is hoping to return to rugby union in 2015 after another season in league with the Sydney Roosters. </p><p>Williams this week turned down an offer from the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) and Waikato Chiefs, opting instead to stay another year in the NRL. </p><p>The 28-year-old made it clear, though, that he had not given up on a return to play for New Zealand in 2015 when they attempt to retain the World Cup he helped them win 2011. </p><p>\"It's been a tough couple of days but I am happy to have my future sorted,\" Williams told reporters at a training camp for the New Zealand rugby league World Cup squad in Sydney on Sunday. </p><p>\"I will go back to the New Zealand Rugby Union to try and put my foot in the door for a franchise in New Zealand, hopefully the Chiefs. But I understand, with the situation of staying in league, that might not be an option. </p><p>\"But it's good to have made my intentions clear for the next three years. I wanted to put it all out there as I am overhearing what I am going to do as everyone else.\" </p><p>Controversy is never far from Williams and even his decision to play in the upcoming league World Cup involved a backflip on his original plan and another player being dropped.</p><p>With Williams also hoping to feature in the New Zealand sevens team at the 2016 Olympics, he said he had decided to put his boxing career on hold. </p><p>\"I won't have the time to box in the next three years,\" he said.  The NZRU had better luck in their negotiations with All Blacks No8 Kieran Read and lock Sam Whitelock, who on Sunday announced they had committed to playing on with the national team and Canterbury Crusaders until 2017.<br /> <br />\"The fact that two world-class players in Kieran and Sam have re-signed for four more years is a huge positive for the All Blacks,\" All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said in a news release. </p><p>\"Not only are they part of the current success of the team, but it means we have a nucleus of experienced players to take the team into the future beyond 2015, which is fantastic.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419814857|2013-10-16T10:54:20Z|41527bc6f20c96307afd82e70adc3a9e10db2fb3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Wigan have welcomed suggestions from Australia that they will be offered the chance to become the first British team to play a World Club Challenge fixture in Sydney for almost 40 years.</p><p>The Super League champions have enjoyed home advantage in each of the 14 games against Australasia's champion club team since the challenge was revived in 2000. But now the Sydney Roosters, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/sydney-roosters-win-nrl-grand-final\" title=\"\">won the National Rugby League Grand Final by beating Manly last weekend</a>, are said to be receptive to the idea of hosting the fixture.</p><p>\"We would love to go to Sydney,\" said Wigan's chairman, Ian Lenagan. \"Wigan were the last British club to play in Australia, with that great win against the Broncos in Brisbane in 1994, so this would be an elegant way to celebrate the 20th anniversary. The practicalities aren't marvellous, but we would be delighted to find a way around them.\"</p><p>The Roosters were the last Sydney team to stage the challenge, when they were known as Eastern Suburbs and beat St Helens 25-2 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in June 1976.  That was the first World Club Challenge, and since then it has been held only once in Australia – when Wigan claimed their famous victory in Brisbane in 1994.</p><p>English clubs – most often Leeds, who have played in five of the last six games – have regularly urged the Australian authorities to show more enthusiasm for the concept, rather than complaining about the odds being stacked against them when they swapthe southern-hemisphere summer for a one-off game in February in the north of England.</p><p>That has not stopped Australian dominance of the fixture, with four wins in the last five years. But Andrew Hill, the NRL's general manager, told the Sydney Daily Telegraph: \"There is a strong consideration for the game to be played in Australia.\"</p><p>Hull have made a rare signing from English rugby union, recruiting Tom Biggs, a Bath wing who has played for the England Saxons and Sevens team but was born in east Yorkshire, on a three-year contract.</p><p>Sam Burgess has welcomed the surprise inclusion of Sonny Bill Williams in New Zealand's World Cup squad. The South Sydney forward, who is currently in South Africa with his younger twin brothers Tom and George at England's training base in Potchefstroom, has relished <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-dhEcvkY7U&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">two clashes with Williams in derbies between the Rabbitohs and the Roosters this season</a>.</p><p>\"He's one of the best players in the world so I'm certainly looking forward to that,\" said Burgess. \"I'll stick within the structure here and hopefully not go stray far out and go looking for him. But if it arises in the middle of the game, I'm sure neither me nor him will shy away from the confrontation.\"</p><p><em>• England will kick off their Rugby League World Cup 2013 campaign against Australia on 26 October at the Millennium Stadium.

        "body":"<p>Hull have made a rare signing from English rugby union by recruiting Tom Biggs from Bath on a three-year contract. The  29-year-old wing, who has played for the England Saxons and Sevens teams, fits with the declared intention of the club's chairman, Adam Pearson, and newly promoted coach, Lee Radford, to emphasise homegrown talent in the squad, following the successful models of Wigan and Leeds.</p><p>Biggs, who is from Beverley, attended Hymers College in Hull, and has supported the black and whites all his life, said: \"I think it is a big challenge in a sport that I've never played before, but it's one that I'm really excited about.\"</p><p>Radford, who has taken over from Peter Gentle after the Australian was sacked following an emphatic play-off defeat at Huddersfield, said: \"Tom looked very comfortable and competent playing in rugby union, but it was his enthusiasm about the prospect of leaving that to join Hull FC and the challenge in store that excited me.</p><p>\"He could quite easily remain set on his current deal in union, but he was keen to have the opportunity to test himself in rugby league and play for us.</p><p>\"He is a local lad and an FC supporter, which you can see means a lot to him, and we're hoping we can nurture that enthusiasm to help him make a positive transition into our sport, which I am sure he will excel in.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419533795|2013-10-16T10:54:20Z|3bd014c4eac06c9c9c3f78c6c3fa9e3b19f37081 -->",

        "body":"<p>Rugby league's rift deepened on Wednesday when the players' union backed the revolt led by the Wigan owner, Ian Lenagan, whose actions were then roundly condemned by a rival chairman as \"self-centred\".</p><p>Evidence that the game is in danger of tearing itself apart over plans for a major restructuring surfaced when the Halifax chairman, Michael Steele, launched a stout defence of the Rugby Football League, while 1eagu3, the body representing Super League players, gave its robust support to the rebellion.</p><p>Ernie Benbow, the chief executive of 1eagu3, welcomed the decision of the governing body to postpone Wednesday's extraordinary general meeting which was expected to ratify a convoluted proposal to introduce two divisions of 12 teams, dividing into three of eight after 23 rounds, from 2015.</p><p>The RFL bowed to pressure from a majority of disgruntled Super League clubs, led by Lenagan, to put off any decision on restructuring until after the World Cup.</p><p>In a statement, 1eagu3 said: \"We are delighted that sense has prevailed and the EGM to vote in the RFL's preferred restructuring proposal has been postponed following a revolt by a majority of the Super League clubs.</p><p>\"The league structure is not the central problem. There is nothing inherently wrong with the wonderful, simple yet totally enthralling, compelling and thrilling sport of rugby league.</p><p>\"Given the expertise delivering clear commercial success at some of the games' top clubs we would urge those Super League clubs in that category to show leadership, take charge of the commercial strategy, grasp the opportunity and move the game forward with vision.\"</p><p>A poll of Super League players overwhelmingly rejected the RFL's preferred restructuring option and 1eagu3 says it detailed its opposition in a formal written submission on 5 September, arguing that the extra matches would increase the burden on players.</p><p>Benbow said: \"The game as a whole is seriously under-sold and undervalued.</p><p>\"The players, our members, are often neglected but are indeed the crown jewels in the process of moving the game to a level at which it deserves to be.</p><p>\"We welcome this pause for further debate and consultation. On the main issue within the game, the lack of revenue, almost all [97% of members in a recent player poll] felt that the marketing of the game is simply not good enough.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Steele said his club were ready to vote for the RFL's proposals after being fully consulted throughout the review process and claimed Lenagan demonstrated a lack of understanding in claiming in a letter to other Super League clubs that they were being undermined by the process.</p><p>In a statement, Steele said: \"At all times, throughout that process, we have been aware of, and supported, the purpose of the exercise which is to create a vibrant, player-focused structure which serves the whole game from children playing in community clubs to the outstanding professional athletes in the English national side.</p><p>\"As such, we were content to support the adoption of the review conclusions and move on from the EGM to their implementation in time for the 2015 season.</p><p>\"There is nothing in Mr Lenagan's letter of objection which leads us to alter that conclusion. Indeed, we find his analysis self-centred and wrong.</p><p>\"Contrary to his assertions, rugby league does not belong to a minority of successful Super League clubs, neither is the review over-hasty or misdirected. It represents a genuine attempt to secure long-term growth of the greatest game to the benefit of all who play it, support it or watch it.</p><p>\"We find it surprising that an active chairman of a leading club can have reached this point with as little understanding as Mr Lenagan claims.</p><p>\"We look forward to the reconvening and successful conclusion of the EGM after the delivery of a memorable RLWC 2013.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419530126|2013-10-16T10:54:20Z|96fb4ba71ad67cd7feb7ffa09601a2fd7dd1061f -->",

        "headline":"Sonny Bill Williams makes U-turn on playing for New Zealand in World Cup",
        "body":"<p>They were the three little words that the organisers of rugby league's 14th World Cup have been dreaming of including in their pre-tournament promotion for months, but which seemed increasingly likely to remain forbidden fruit. But hours before each of the 14 competing nations was required to submit a 24-man squad, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonnyBWilliams/status/387699474321399808/photo/1\" title=\"\">Sonny Bill Williams confirmed on his Twitter feed</a> that, having previously informed the New Zealand selectors that he was not available for their title defence, he had changed his mind.</p><p>So the 28-year-old, a rugby union World Cup winner with the All Blacks on home territory in 2011, will now aim to make another slice of history in a remarkable, controversial career at Old Trafford next month by becoming the first player to be crowned a world champion in each code.</p><p>It made for an awkward telephone call for the New Zealand coach, Stephen Kearney, and heartbreak for Tohu Harris, a 21-year-old Melbourne Storm second-row whose World Cup dreams lasted less than 24 hours. Harris was deselected to make way for Williams as a result of Sonny Bill's late change of heart. \"As you would expect, I'm very disappointed,\" he said.</p><p>Williams responded on the BBC World Service: \"I actually feel like shit, to tell you the truth. I'm really sorry about the Tohu situation, it was never my intention. I just followed my heart, now I promise I'll play with all of it.\"</p><p>That left an open goal for the many who have been disgusted by the previous behaviour of a man occasionally dubbed Money Bill, most infamously when he walked out on the Canterbury Bulldogs in 2008 to begin his rugby union career with Toulon. <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11137645\" title=\"\">A New Zealand Herald columnist called Williams's \"flip flop\" \"a day of shame for Kiwis league\"</a>. Even Richie Barnett, the former New Zealand and London Broncos full-back who is now on the selection panel, admitted Williams had \"probably disrespected\" the rest of the squad by making such a late decision.</p><p>\"But we are here to win a World Cup, not to please people on moralistic grounds,\" Barnett added.</p><p>There will be few complaints about the decision in Warrington, Leeds or Avignon, where the Kiwis play their three group matches against Samoa, Papua New Guinea and France respectively – and certainly none from those tournament organisers, or from the television networks who have paid to screen it, including the BBC and Channel Seven in Australia.</p><p>Williams insisted in that BBC interview that the chance to make more history was not part of his motivation. For months his \"sole focus\" had been on marking his return to rugby league with the Sydney Roosters at the start of the year with a Grand Final victory, secured against Manly last weekend. Then he had been looking forward to \"the chance to chill out and rest\" – a first lengthy break since that dramatic departure for Toulon in 2008, since when he has combined rugby with boxing, winning six professional heavyweight bouts. \"I guess it took 24 hours and the team to be named for it to sink in,\" he added. \"But a gut feeling … in 10 years would I have regrets about not making myself available? I've got a lot of time after I'm retired. It can be played off as selfish, but I just left it in the coach's hands.\"</p><p>That left Kearney with no other realistic option. The presence of Williams, who was named the Roosters' player of the year this week, greatly enhances the prospects of the Kiwis retaining the title they won so surprisingly in 2008 – months after he had quit the Bulldogs.</p><p>History is not on their side – remarkably, Williams has yet to win in seven appearances in a New Zealand league jersey. But at their pre-tournament training camp in South Africa, the England squad will appreciate that his presence makes the Kiwis an even more formidable force – and raises the stakes for their opening game against Australia in Cardiff, where victory would probably condemn the Kangaroos to facing the Kiwis in the semi-finals at Wembley, opening up a theoretically more straightforward path to Old Trafford for Kevin Sinfield's team.</p><p>However, the most striking feature of the 14 squads when they were confirmed at 3pm, other than the inclusion of Williams, was the potential of the less-established league nations, reflecting the growing Polynesian influence on the NRL. Tonga, Samoa and Fiji, who will be captained by the former Brisbane Broncos and Australia prop Petero Civoniceva and include three sets of brothers, all look formidable, and even the tournament newcomers Italy, despite the late withdrawals of Terry Campese and Craig Gower, promise to be thoroughly awkward opening opponents for Wales at the Millennium Stadium on 26 October.</p><p>Perhaps the most mouthwatering of the early matches, however, will be New Zealand's clash with Samoa, for whom Williams was also eligible through ancestry, at Warrington's tight and atmospheric Halliwell Jones Stadium the following night. Then, as now, he will be the centre of attention. Those three little words could dominate the World Cup.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419520410|2013-10-16T10:54:20Z|d8ded15bed6e37152710ab53416879b3921464b4 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sonny Bill Williams has been confirmed in New Zealand's official squad for the Rugby League World Cup. </p><p>It had been expected the 28-year-old would miss the Kiwi's defence of their title after selectors said he had \"other commitments\", and he was not in the 24-man party named on Monday. </p><p>The New Zealand coach, Stephen Kearney, indicated there had been a change of heart on Tuesday, though, and on Wednesday morning the NZRL confirmed Williams had replaced Tohu Harris in its squad. </p><p>Kearney admitted the decision to stand Harris down had been a tough one, but felt Williams – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/sydney-roosters-win-nrl-grand-final\">fresh from an NRL title with Sydney Roosters in his return season in league</a> – offered things which could not be overlooked. </p><p>\"It's been a tough situation, but Sonny brings things to the group that we couldn't ignore,\" Kearney said.  \"He has had time since his NRL grand final win to clear his head and he wants to represent the Kiwis on the world stage. He missed our 2008 World Cup win and his inclusion will be a great asset in trying to repeat that success this year. It's not only his footballing ability, but also what he brings off the field which will benefit the team. </p><p>\"Tohu handled the situation as well as anyone could. It was a conversation no coach would like to have, but he's a terrific young man and I'm sure he'll have many more opportunities to pull on the black jersey. It's been a unique set of circumstances for all involved, but for now our focus is getting set to defend the World Cup with the team we have.\" </p><p>The selection caps a remarkable year for Williams, who was a key figure for the Roosters in their run to the NRL grand final and subsequent win over Manly. </p><p>He originally left league for the 15-man code in 2008, going on to win the World Cup with the All Blacks while winning the Super Rugby title with the Chiefs in 2012. </p><p>He had been expected to return to union this winter, but his participation in the World Cup suggests he may now have other plans.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419452922|2013-10-16T10:54:20Z|564d5ed85312c6c2dc6b103a084c902788e01555 -->",
