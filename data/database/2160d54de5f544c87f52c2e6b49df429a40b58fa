        "headline":"Food waste report shows UK families throw away 24 meals a month",
        "body":"<p>The average UK family is wasting nearly £60 a month by throwing away almost an entire meal a day, according to <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/household-food-waste\" title=\"\">a new report</a> that reveals the scale of the ongoing challenge to reduce household food waste.</p><p>Britons are chucking out the equivalent of 24 meals a month, adding up to 4.2 million tonnes of food and drink every year that could have been consumed. Almost half of this is going straight from fridges or cupboards into the bin. One-fifth of what households buy ends up as waste, and around 60% of that could have been eaten.</p><p>There has been no progress in reducing meat and fish wastage, with Britons still throwing away the equivalent of 86 million chickens every year. The top three foods being thrown away uneaten in British homes are  bread, potatoes and milk. The equivalent of  24m slices of bread, 5.8m potatoes and 5.9m glasses of milk are being wasted daily, while even cakes and pastries make it into the top 10 most wasted items.</p><p>The study by the government's waste advisory body, the Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme (Wrap), shows that since 2007, avoidable household food waste has been cut by 21% to 4.2m tonnes, saving consumers almost £13bn.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422024556'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/6/1383758580237/UKfoodwastebyfoodgroup.png' alt='UK food waste by food group' width='460' height='434' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Wrap said that such waste should be cut a further 1.7m tonnes a year by 2025, saving up to £45bn.  Its chief executive, Dr Liz Goodwin, called on retailers, manufacturers, governments and consumers to agree to a \"major combined effort\".</p><p>\"Consumers are seriously worried about the cost of food and how it has increased over recent years. Yet as Wrap's research shows, we are still wasting millions of tonnes and billions of pounds,\" she said.</p><p>The main reasons for the waste are shoppers buying more than they need, lack of clarity around storage and labelling and over-estimating portions, Wrap said. The carbon associated with  avoidable household food waste is equivalent to taking one in four cars off UK roads.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422024557'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/6/1383758658327/Householdfoodwastebyitems.png' alt='Household food waste by items' width='460' height='468' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Last month the UK's largest retailer, Tesco, agreed to reduce its multi-buy items and other promotions after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/21/food-waste-tesco-reveals-most-bagged-salad-and-half-its-bread-is-thrown-out\" title=\"\">revealing</a> that 35% of its bagged salad is being thrown out. It also found that 40% of apples were wasted, and just under half of bakery items.</p><p>Andrew Opie, British Retail Consortium director of food and sustainability, said: \"There's plenty to be pleased about in these figures.  Avoidable household food waste has been reduced by 21% since 2007 and the progress is all the more impressive if one accounts for the growth of 1 million new households within that time.  Cutting food waste in the home needs to be one of the UK's biggest environmental priorities.\"</p><p>He said retailers know they are judged by the value they offer consumers \"which means not only selling food at the right price but also making sure we can make the most of it. A range of approaches, including giving clear storage advice and recipe ideas, offering a wider range of portion sizes, and developing innovative packaging that extends the shelf life of products, has helped to drive significant reductions in the amount of food and drink we throw away.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 8 November 2013. The number of chickens thrown away was amended, from 96 million to 86 million. The saving of £13bn is over a five year period, not one year, as the article originally stated.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421833042|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|15ededfef5a1d6540871129d8f9f2e68c1c09231 -->",

        "body":"<p>The average UK family is wasting nearly £60 a month by throwing away almost an entire meal a day, according to <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/household-food-waste\" title=\"\">a new report</a> that reveals the scale of the ongoing challenge to reduce household food waste.</p><p>Britons are chucking out the equivalent of 24 meals a month, adding up to 4.2 million tonnes of food and drink every year that could have been consumed. Almost half of this is going straight from fridges or cupboards into the bin. One-fifth of what households buy ends up as waste, and around 60% of that could have been eaten.</p><p>There has been no progress in reducing meat and fish wastage, with Britons still throwing away the equivalent of 86 million chickens every year. The top three foods being thrown away uneaten in British homes are  bread, potatoes and milk. The equivalent of  24m slices of bread, 5.8m potatoes and 5.9m glasses of milk are being wasted daily, while even cakes and pastries make it into the top 10 most wasted items.</p><p>The study by the government's waste advisory body, the Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme (Wrap), shows that since 2007, avoidable household food waste has been cut by 21% to 4.2m tonnes, saving consumers almost £13bn.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422024556'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/6/1383758580237/UKfoodwastebyfoodgroup.png' alt='UK food waste by food group' width='460' height='434' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Wrap said that such waste should be cut a further 1.7m tonnes a year by 2025, saving up to £45bn.  Its chief executive, Dr Liz Goodwin, called on retailers, manufacturers, governments and consumers to agree to a \"major combined effort\".</p><p>\"Consumers are seriously worried about the cost of food and how it has increased over recent years. Yet as Wrap's research shows, we are still wasting millions of tonnes and billions of pounds,\" she said.</p><p>The main reasons for the waste are shoppers buying more than they need, lack of clarity around storage and labelling and over-estimating portions, Wrap said. The carbon associated with  avoidable household food waste is equivalent to taking one in four cars off UK roads.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422024557'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/6/1383758658327/Householdfoodwastebyitems.png' alt='Household food waste by items' width='460' height='468' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Last month the UK's largest retailer, Tesco, agreed to reduce its multi-buy items and other promotions after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/21/food-waste-tesco-reveals-most-bagged-salad-and-half-its-bread-is-thrown-out\" title=\"\">revealing</a> that 35% of its bagged salad is being thrown out. It also found that 40% of apples were wasted, and just under half of bakery items.</p><p>Andrew Opie, British Retail Consortium director of food and sustainability, said: \"There's plenty to be pleased about in these figures.  Avoidable household food waste has been reduced by 21% since 2007 and the progress is all the more impressive if one accounts for the growth of 1 million new households within that time.  Cutting food waste in the home needs to be one of the UK's biggest environmental priorities.\"</p><p>He said retailers know they are judged by the value they offer consumers \"which means not only selling food at the right price but also making sure we can make the most of it. A range of approaches, including giving clear storage advice and recipe ideas, offering a wider range of portion sizes, and developing innovative packaging that extends the shelf life of products, has helped to drive significant reductions in the amount of food and drink we throw away.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 8 November 2013. The number of chickens thrown away was amended, from 96 million to 86 million. The saving of £13bn is over a five year period, not one year, as the article originally stated.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421833042|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|15ededfef5a1d6540871129d8f9f2e68c1c09231 -->",

        "body":"<div id=\"block-527cba63e4b0541f62c72ca1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-08T10:31:42.166Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Late reaction</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>I asked Martin Taylor, managing director of plastic packaging manufacturer <a href=\"http://en.sharpinterpack.com/\">Sharpak</a>, whether he felt the supermarket industry was driving innovation in packaging. Not surprisingly he told me his clients were:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;Committed to reducing food waste and they realise that packaging plays a large role in ensuring food is maintained at the highest quality. Without the support of the retail industry we would not be able to manufacture meat packaging which has the potential to counteract the large scale waste of food across Britain.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>For those interested in how packaging is evolving, Sharpak says they are focussing on developing anti-microbial packaging, which &quot;eradicates the harmful surface bacteria present on raw meat products&quot;.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He said:&nbsp;“The packaging industry must demonstrate exactly how it can drive home the importance of reducing food waste. For example, offering packaging which enables consumers to reseal their fresh meat products will drastically increase fridge life, and tray design which allows easier freezing of meat packaging can offer simple portion control measures.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527bbfdae4b08521f0cfb361\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T18:00:49.177Z\">6.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">My verdict</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>On the surface, this issue seems like a true unifier of opinion. It's hard to imagine anyone being openly against food waste reduction. Speaking to politicians from the Greens, Labour and Conservatives today, I sometimes found it hard to remember which party I was talking to.&nbsp;Consumer groups, supermarkets, consumers, NGOs and scientists toe the same line. All agree it is good that food waste appears to be declining, but terrible that it is still so high.</p> <p>Key issues contributing to food waste include supermarket promotions and packaging, poverty, a&nbsp;diminished cultural focus on the preparation and management of food&nbsp;and household size.</p> <p>On the upside, the problem is gaining an increasingly high-profile and this is leading to the reduction of waste.&nbsp;While the environmental impact of food waste is concerning, it is clear this renaissance of conscience has been driven by back pocket interest in a time of austerity.</p> <p>Poverty's effect on food waste is complicated. On one hand, it creates an environment in which consumers are compelled to cut down on waste. But deprivation, especially at the extreme end of the scale, can drive consumers to buy bulk or spoiling food. Social housing may lack the equipment to successfully manage and prepare food. Long hours and low wages can exacerbate this as workers lack time and energy to plan shopping and meals in advance.</p> <p>Cooking education for adults and children could not only reconnect Britons with one of the great joys of life, it could also give them the skills to save money and reduce waste.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this audit we focussed specifically on the consumer end of the supply chain. There is a conflict of interests for supermarkets in this area. Waste in the home is waste that has already turned a profit.</p> <p>In my opinion, Tesco's statement that their supermarkets are responsible for less than 1% of the waste in their supply chain is slightly disingenuous. Across the industry, supermarkets may actively throw out only a tiny percentage of the overall waste (although we wouldn't know because, apart from Tesco, transparency is lacking). But the larger point is the shifting of responsibility onto both farmers and consumers. We know consumers buy too much because of supermarket packaging and promotions. So while the retailer does not actually bin the bread, they are complicit in the squander.</p> <p>Incidentally, I asked every supermarket whether they had conducted any research into how effective their mitigation measures are at reducing household waste. None of them replied. Indicating their concern is probably more about being seen to have the policies in place, rather than if they work.</p> <p>Rather than seeking to bash supermarkets, who, after all, have shown the intent to change. What this highlights is the point made to me by Niki&nbsp;Charalampopoulou from Feeding the 5000. She said the onus must be on consumers to articulate their desire for waste reduction to retailers. Enough consumer pressure will create a corporate responsibility race as supermarkets compete to help consumers buy food more intelligently. Without this impetus, supermarkets will simply pay lip service to the problem.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T18:13:19.762Z\">at 6.13pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-527bc4fce4b08521f0cfb367\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T17:02:47.287Z\">5.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Industry experts</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Letsrecycle.com editor Steve Eminton says supermarkets and consumer culture had colluded to create a situation where food waste is almost inevitable.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;It is very difficult for people to manage their food waste, partly because it's almost impossible for supermarkets to get the sizing right.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>He said people struggling economically found waste particularly difficult to control.</p> <p>&quot;Sometimes it's cheaper to buy something large because you get a lot of it for a low price, but of course there will be food waste, but you've almost got to accept that.&quot;</p> <p>Eminton said British dining culture lent itself to cooking too much per meal, which led to a lot of scraps being thrown away.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But: &quot;It's easy to knock the supermarkets...

Eight in 10 of us (78%) are worried about rising food prices with nearly half (45%) saying they’re spending a larger proportion of their income on food compared to 12 months ago.</p> <p>In the past 12 months, nearly half of shoppers said they freeze food (47%) or cook with leftovers (47%) to avoid waste. The survey also found that two in five (39%) said they are cooking smaller portions, so there is less chance of meals going in the bin.</p> <p>We found that consumers are changing their shopping habits in an effort to reduce food waste, with a third (35%) saying they are buying less food and a quarter (26%) doing more frequent top-up shops rather than one main food shop.</p> <p>Four in 10 (43%) say they have started to check the ‘use by’ or ‘best before’ dates more frequently and, worryingly, a third (35%) have even stopped adhering to use by dates on food packets.</p> <p>Separately, our monthly&nbsp;<a href=\"http://consumerinsight.which.co.uk/\">consumer insight tracker</a>&nbsp;shows there has been a significant increase over the last year in the number of people dipping into their savings to pay for their groceries, with around a third (36%) now compared to a quarter (25%) last year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd,&nbsp;said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Rocketing food prices are changing consumers’ habits, with more people helping themselves by cooking with leftovers and preparing smaller portions to avoid chucking expensive food in the bin.</p> <p>“Our research shows that, with more people feeling the squeeze, they are also buying less food and even paying for it with their savings.</p> <p>“We want supermarkets to help people find the best deal by displaying simpler pricing and ensuring that special offers are genuinely good value for money.”</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527b88f0e4b0e869ab0fb88a\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T13:06:47.184Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Political reaction</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.nataliebennett.co.uk/\">Natalie Bennett</a>, Leader of the Green Party, tells me lecturing people on their behaviour is not the way to fix the problem. Rather, she says, the focus must be on building social structures which support people in their endeavours to waste less food.</p> <p>On a broad level, she said, alleviating poverty would help reduce food waste because one of the causes of wastage was the impulse to buy cheap, ageing food. Low income household's struggling with energy bills may be forced to turn off fridges or use inefficient appliances in order to save money.</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;People are just making the best choices they can in the circumstances available to them.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Bennett&nbsp;said the culture of long working hours also contributed as tiredness undermined our ability to plan and spend time on food management.</p> <p>On top of these broad social issues, Bennett said practical measures such as education in cooking and gardening would give people the skills to reduce their waste.</p> <p>Finally she said supermarkets must take responsibility for promoting waste reduction.</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;We really do have to tackle the supermarket model of heavily over-packaged sale things that don't give you a&nbsp;choice&nbsp;of what quantity you buy.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.kerrymccarthymp.org/\">Kerry McCarthy</a>, Labour MP and author of the Food Waste Bill sent me her thoughts:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This report from WRAP is very welcome, giving us a clear picture of the current level of household waste, those foods we persist in throwing away and what steps we can take to reduce it. It's also very welcome that household food waste has continued to drop, although the rate of reduction has slowed more recently. This reduction has been driven by much more consumer awareness – and the success of Wrap’s<a href=\"http://www.lovefoodhatewaste.com/\"> Love Food Hate Waste</a> campaign – but it is also a consequence of rocketing food prices and the cost of living crisis.</p> <p>I feel that government policies have largely ignored the contribution of supermarkets to food wasted by consumers – through offers such as Buy One Get One Free on food with a short shelf life – and the failure by the food industry to reduce the waste it generates throughout the supply chain, from farmer and manufacturer to back of store. Indeed half of all food wasted is generated by the food industry. Even in small ways, in the face of industry resistance, the government failed to honour its promise to abolish the use of &quot;sell by&quot; and &quot;display until&quot; labels, instead opting to include them in voluntary Food Standards Agency &quot;advice&quot;.<br />The industry has set itself a very low voluntary target - under the <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/category/initiatives/courtauld-commitment\">Courtauld Agreement</a>, which is facilitated by Wrap - to reduce household food waste by 5% by 2015 (as well as to reduce their own manufacturing and retail waste by just 3%).</p> <p>I am concerned that these targets simply aren’t ambitious enough to drive the level of reduction needed, eg, in order to meet the target set by Wrap to reduce avoidable food waste by 50% by 2025, which is also the target set by the European Parliament. Nor is it possible to see how well individual supermarkets and manufacturers are performing against these targets – which could help to name and shame have been particularly slow to act, or to showcase those which are achieving significant reductions and showing what is possible to achieve in a short space of time.</p> <p>We have started to see some very welcome developments taken voluntarily by the industry. Just recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/tesco-cut-food-waste\">Tesco published</a> its audited food waste figures, which showed that its annual food waste is over four times the total amount of surplus food donated last year to redistribution charities in Britain. Publishing this data is an important first step towards the industry publicly reporting on its food waste and ultimately taking much more ambitious action to reduce it throughout its supply chain.</p> <p>But I think that if the industry cannot drive the level of change which is actually needed, then there may be a need for government action. We know that the landfill tax, for example, was one of the most successful waste policies ever for driving behaviour change and for creating markets in more environmental forms of disposal such as anaerobic-digestion. Something similar may be needed to reduce industry food waste. Whether it’s a requirement on large retailers and manufacturers as proposed in my Food Waste Bill of last year, or a ban on sending food waste to landfill or a system of financial incentives or penalties.</p> <p>I hope in the run up to 2014, which has been declared “the European Year of fight against food waste”, we may start to see real strides towards meeting the European Commission’s aim of halving food waste by 2025.</p> </blockquote> <p>Conservative MP <a href=\"http://telllaura.org.uk/home/\">Laura Sandys</a>&nbsp;said one of the wards in her constituency had 80% privately rented accommodation.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;Some of these properties are institutionally and structurally creating huge challenges for families to manage food effectively. Some have got microwaves, they haven't got proper cookers in them. That means that you're trapped in firstly expensive food but secondly have very very little resilience when it comes to making leftovers work for you and eating more healthily. Because you can eat healthily on whatever budget, but you've got to have a) the skills and b) the equipment to do it. So some poor families are absolutely disadvantaged by the structure in which they are in.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Sandys said all consumers, rich and poor, were being encouraged by promotions that encouraged over-buying.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;Often these promotions are driving certain behaviours that are in the interests of the supermarket, not necessarily the interests of the consumer.&quot;</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T16:18:37.166Z\">at 4.18pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-527b806de4b0f1cce82090b2\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T12:15:08.531Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">NGO reaction</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a> Food campaigner Vicki Hird said the problem, and its impact on the environment, must be tackled by supermarkets and consumers together:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“The figures on food waste are staggering.

It’s clear there are barriers that need to be tackled by strong Government and business action – consumers have a major role to play, but blaming them will not help.</p> <p>“Supermarkets must help consumers by taking a good look at their supply chains and stopping multi-buy promotions which encourage unnecessary purchases.”</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.feeding5k.org/\">Feeding the 5000</a> campaign director Niki Charalampopoulou said the Wrap figures were good news, but there is still much work to do.&nbsp;She said consumers needed to actively pressure supermarkets to develop policies that make it easy for them to further reduce food waste.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;As consumer we have the power to tell our food businesses that we care about food waste and we want them to reduce food waste... There's definitely a lot more that can be done and there's a lot of shared responsibility between consumers and retailers.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Charalampopoulou&nbsp;said the issue of consumer food waste was only part of the bigger picture in the food waste supply chain.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;It's important not only to look at consumer waste but asking retailers to also report in detail how much food they waste because I think that's going to help reduice food waste dramatically because it will increase competition between different retailers so they compete to show ho is least wasteful.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.eating-better.org/\">Eating Better</a>&nbsp;made this comment:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The good news from the WRAP report is that we're wasting 21% less food in the home since 2007. Less good news is that there has been no reduction in the amount of meat and fish we waste. WRAP says we're still throwing away the equivalent of 96 million chickens a year. Eating Better's message of valuing our food - as well as the people and animals that produce it - means we'd also waste less. That means people buying 'less and better' meat and supermarkets stopping piling it high and selling it cheap.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:58:19.567Z\">at 3.58pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-527b80e0e4b0ebad08ff9d0a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T12:03:59.823Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Your comments</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28653316\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/3906611\" title=\"View vespacat’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/09/02/cta_262190_10/ee20eb59-5eb0-4502-939c-5a9ebe2b77c8/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for vespacat\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/3906611\" title=\"View vespacat’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">vespacat</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28653316\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">07 November 2013 10:20am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I suspect there is no one single easy answer.

The idea of transporting large quantities of food to a large warehouse, which thousands of people then drive to to collect is disturbing. When the system is massively inefficient, the consumers of that system see no issue in being wasteful. The faux &quot;packed shelves&quot; of the supermarket system, burgeoning with shite food - 90% of which comes from about 10 suppliers (unilever etc etc.) draws in the customer. The known tricks of packaging to get the purchaser to buy the &quot;now even chocolatier chocolate&quot; or the huge bargain of &quot;33% extra free&quot;, move the person away from the product's quality - in fact product quality seems to be derived entirely from a product's brand these days; insane, given that most people would have no idea from where the core ingredients came. Added together, we now have a public that are so far removed from the process of food creation, that they have no idea what they're eating, where it came from, the energy used in its production, or even what's in it - in short, we're a nation of food illiterates. If you don't understand the process, then the waste won't be a concern.</p> <p>How is this solved? We have an education system that can see a child forced to read Shakespeare and Burns (in Scotland, anyway), but not give the child the basic abilities of nutrition and, indeed, survival. We need to give a large part of the curriculum over to the growing and cooking/eating of our own foods. We need to move to a system where supermarkets are used to supplement our existing food supply, not provide it in its entirety. It could be argued that this education should happen at home, but an entire generation of people in the UK are already food-illiterate and don't possess the basic skills to teach their kids proper nutrition and an understanding of where their food comes from.</p> <p>The paradox of a system where not all the food is eaten, while the consumer still becomes obese proves that it is deep-rooted. We've lost the ability to understand our food. The supermarket does not work.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28656109\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10061344\" title=\"View NorthernHills’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/09/02/cta_262190_05/f4dc03d6-56cb-4752-ac66-a64a6efe7da3/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for NorthernHills\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10061344\" title=\"View NorthernHills’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">NorthernHills</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28656109\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">07 November 2013 11:50am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I think Supermarkets are responsible for a lot of the wastage. </p> <p>Also as posted elsewhere I think the hectic nature of People's lives make it difficult. I used to buy food for a full week with planned meals. Being single this meant sharing the&quot;standard&quot; family size boxes of fresh food over several days. However my work hours are unpredictable and a couple of times a week I often end up working past 21:00 meaning I don't have the time or the energy to make a full meal. This often ended up with me throwing away some food. Now I only really buy a day or so in advance... which is more expensive for me but prevents the same levels of food wastage.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28657822\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4295223\" title=\"View riveness’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for riveness\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4295223\" title=\"View riveness’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">riveness</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28657822\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">07 November 2013 12:35pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>For household food waste the main routes to waste I think are</p> <p>1. Children. How many times is a plate of food left unfinished only to be replaced by some sweet thing after dinner? When I was growing up dessert was never prepared so if the food on the plate was not finished, no sweets. </p> <p>2. Measures. When cooking for multiple people and different meals every day, it can be hard to ascertain how many grams of food 'x' eats. We are not programmed to measure food but rather cook it based on judgment. That often leads to a couple of extra spuds for example.</p> <p>3. Re-cooking waste. Already mentioned above but those left over potatoes can be very taste if people actually cooked them for tea.</p> <p>4. Variety. I cook my dinner for the week ahead for work. That typically means that I eat the same thing for 4 or 5 days in a row. It means that I do not have to waste money on stupid food portion sizes that are not good for the single person. Is that boring? No as it allows me to try a new dish every week and actually remember if I really liked it or not. However if you go to the other extreme and want different home cooked meals every day at work or after work, you will build up a fair amount of extra ingredients even if cooking for two. Canned vegetables are a good way of minimizing but canned food is considered inferior to fresh food nowadays.</p> <p>5. Shelf life. Eggs are the classic example but these stay fresh for quite a long time after their use by date (never mind sell by) if refrigerated. </p> <p>6. Shopping habits. Even though you threw away 5 potatoes on last Sundays dinner, you still buy the kilo bag instead of buying loose even though the latter can be cheaper. The consumer does not change rapidly.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28658678\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/1971995\" title=\"View Furbian’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/Furbian/f0e1655b-baea-41dc-afdf-3a6e2c0ef935/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Furbian\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/1971995\" title=\"View Furbian’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Furbian</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28658678\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">07 November 2013 12:58pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>As a South Asian (racially, not by birth) I've never been get over how casually food is thrown away.

Religious indoctrination against food waste has helped play its part and I'm in no way ungrateful for it. Admittedly the two month old frozen Wensleydale is not as nice as it was when fresh, but put it on some toast and melt it, comes out fine. </p> <p>If someone, usually one of the children, doesn't finish their food, someone else can finish it, and if worse comes to worse, it will go in the fridge, and be eaten over the next day or so.

It's pretty much the opposite of the generation that lived through WW2 and the Great Depression. The current financial crisis might actually do a lot of good to educate people about the value of food and how to be frugal and not wasteful.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p>Late last night, I received this lovely email from Beatrice which I think helps to chart some of the cultural aspects of this debate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We in our household waste very little food. We have never had the money to waste food. So every bit gets eaten. If (and that was always a big if when the lads were growing up) there was any food left over, I cooked it a different way. Roast on Sunday followed by stew on Monday then add a pie crust for Tuesday. People have forgotten how to do this so they believe the adverts that you should have a completely different meal every day of the week. The adverts are just for selling more food. People have also forgotten how to cook. I do not like cooking, I am not very domesticated but I did teach my lads how to cook. If parents have forgotten how to cook then how can the pass on this knowledge to the next generation. The budget for domestic science in schools was cut saying that it was the parents' responsibility. Well if the parents cannot cook then it is impossible. My next door neighbours were like that. Lovely people but mum could not cook so her daughter cannot cook now.</p> <p>The belief which is coming across that you can only have perfect meals if you buy it ready made is wrong. Cooking your own food from scratch puts you more in tune with what you are eating. If you are living further away from farms and in towns and cities you cannot know where your food is coming from. If you buy all your food from the supermarket you are one more further step away from where your food comes from. If you buy food ready prepared then it is one more step away. You have children now where if you tell them that carrots are grown in the ground then do not believe you. They cannot handle that fact. The soil is dirty and you want me to eat food that has been in the ground. No they cannot handle that fact as they are so far away from the reality that it is an alien concept.</p> <p>So why would they believe that to waste food is wrong? Why would anyone believe that to waste food is wrong? Most people have never had to dig the soil, produce compost, plant seeds, raise these seedlings, transplant them, water them, weed the beds, harvest the crop. Such a lot goes into growing the food. But that is never seen. We buy it all from the supermarket and it comes gift wrapped in plastic. So it is not really important. The shelves are always packed full and there is never any shortages. Waste does not matter.</p> <p>I cannot understand this mentality. I have not brought my children up to believe in this either. But I have seen and heard it. Waste is morally wrong but educating people to understand that and then doing something about it is a really big task.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28669859\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11588415\" title=\"View notthefactory’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for notthefactory\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11588415\" title=\"View notthefactory’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">notthefactory</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28669859\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">07 November 2013 9:09pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><blockquote> <p>Why do we still waste so much food at home?</p> </blockquote> <p>'We' do not waste much food at all. 4.2m tonnes is absolutely nothing on a population basis.

The major initiatives include the cessation of buy-one-get-one-free promotions, customer education and culinary advice, changing labelling and innovation in packaging to keep food fresher for longer.</p> <p>A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Customers expect Sainsbury's to lead the way on cutting waste and we support all efforts to reduce food waste, whether it be in the food retail supply chain or in the home. We stopped ‘buy one get one free’ promotions on produce over a year ago when we began offering ‘mix &amp; match’ across our produce range, which allows customers to receive the value of a multi-buy without causing waste.</p> </blockquote> <p>Quentin Clark, Head of Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing, Waitrose:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;It's such a shame for food to be going in the bin - it's a waste of both money and environmental resources. Within our business we do everything we can to prevent food going to waste - and we now send no food at all to landfill. We've been trying to help our customers prevent food waste in the home too, through simple steps such as changing our packaging or providing tips and advice.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>In their half yearly report for 2013, Tesco said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Food waste is an urgent global challenge.&nbsp;A recent report showed that 1.3 billion tonnes of food are wasted each year. This costs producers around &pound;460 billion annually. It also puts extra pressure on the environment.</p> <p>We want to lead in tackling this challenge and galvanise change across the value chain: the&nbsp;supply web through which we operate.</p> </blockquote> <p>In October, for the first time Tesco published their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/tesco-cut-food-waste\">waste figures</a>. They posted this infographic that seems to shift most of the blame for food waste on to farmers and consumers:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen/statuses/398472257690796032\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Tescos food waste infographic.

We use skin-pack packaging on all our fresh British steaks, which eliminates the oxygen from the packs and keeps the meat fresher for longer, and, earlier this year, we worked with our tomato supplier to extend the life of our fresh tomatoes by two days, simply by changing the size of the holes in the packaging.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>A Morrisons spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“We understand how important it is to tackle the issue of food waste and make an effort to do so in every area of our business – from our manufacturing facilities right through to store.</p> <p>“We don’t currently offer buy one get one free offers on our fruit and vegetables, have relaxed our specifications on this produce to accept more ‘wonky’ crops and offer clear labelling for customers.”</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T17:13:37.645Z\">at 5.13pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-527b6f0be4b0e869ab0fb881\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T11:27:01.457Z\">11.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Expert reaction</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Tim Fox was the lead author of <a href=\"http://www.imeche.org/knowledge/themes/environment/global-food\">Global Food, Waste Not, Want Not</a>, which was published by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in January 2013.</p> <p>He told me there were two main factors in household food waste. First was over-purchasing in stores. He said this was caused by confusion over labelling and sales offers that encourage shoppers to buy items they don't need, or can't consume. Consumers confuse sell-by dates with use-by dates. The sell-by date is used by shops to know when they can display a product. It does not indicate the food is inedible. But consumers often throw food away on this date and purchase unnecessary extra items to replace them.</p> <p>Retail practices such as buy-one-get-one-free (Bogof), says Fox, are used by supermarkets to push products onto consumer that they hadn't planned to buy.</p> <p>&quot;People go into the shopping environment, they see opportunities to buy two for the price of one, half price offers or radically reduced offers and they take too much stuff away and they actually never get around to using it.&quot;</p> <p>Fox says the second major cause of household food waste is cultural. There has been a widespread disconnection with culinary skills. People don't know how to deal with food as it goes through various stages of decomposition (but still remains edible). Instead of cutting away rotten parts of vegetables, or making older items into a soup. People are hypersensitive to older food and throw in into the bin because they are &quot;scared&quot;, says Fox.</p> <p><a href=\"http://theprospectory.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/reactions-to-food-waste-expt.pdf\">A study&nbsp;</a>by&nbsp;The Prospectory found that &quot;on average people find only 2 forms of food attractive&nbsp;– raw ingredients and food which is cooked and ready to eat&quot;. All other forms of food elicited a strong emotional repugnance.</p> <p>Fox said our reaction to food and the loss of food management skills was compounded by a long decline in concern about waste.&nbsp;&quot;In recent decades, clearly on a generational basis, there's been a shift in the perception of waste.&quot;</p> <p>But he said this trend appeared to be reversing, possibly because of austerity and pressure on household budgets. This was illustrated by the Wrap figures, he said, which showed a reduction in waste figures since 2007. Fox said it was his feeling that the issue had become even more prominent in 2013 and a further study (Wrap's ended in 2012) would see even more improvement.</p> <p>In the past, supermarkets have been motivated by selling as much food as possible to consumers, regardless of actual need.</p> <p>&quot;The marketing sales and promotional practices that have been practised by retailers and supermarkets in recent years would indicate that increasing sales has been a prime objective,&quot; says Fox.</p> <p>But recently, big retailers were becoming more aware of the marketing advantages in helping consumers reduce their waste.</p> <p>&quot;From a supermarket positioning point of view the issue is whether taking on corporate social responsibility will drive business in a similar way to straightforward sales promotion. That's the elephant in the room.&quot;</p> <p>Fox said it was not yet clear whether recent supermarket measures to reduce waste were being effective or cosmetic.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T11:58:50.607Z\">at 11.58am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-527b6eaae4b0ebad08ff9cf6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T11:05:15.166Z\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Twitter reaction</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GGSparkes/statuses/398392550228127744\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianeco\">@guardianeco</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen\">@KarlMathiesen</a> encouraging people to use smaller shops <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23shoplocal&amp;src=hash\">#shoplocal</a> would help, less temptation to buy 3 for price of 2 etc :-)</p>— GG Sparkes Butchers (@GGSparkes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GGSparkes/statuses/398392550228127744\">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ecofunkytravel/statuses/398401056104665088\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen\">@KarlMathiesen</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WRAP_UK\">@WRAP_UK</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen\">@KarlMathiesen</a> We explored digust levels to food at diff stages of prep, consumption etc <a href=\"http://t.co/QQieDrORN8\">http://t.co/QQieDrORN8</a></p>— Eco Funky Travel (@ecofunkytravel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecofunkytravel/statuses/398401056104665088\">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MirandaFrance1/statuses/398477825025376257\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen\">@KarlMathiesen</a> Buy good quality food from local shops, little and often, with minimal packaging.

But the gap between what we buy and what we eat is still huge.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;The average UK household throws away the equivalent of six meals every&nbsp;week, costing us as a nation &pound;12.5 billion a year, or almost &pound;60 a&nbsp;month to the average family, despite a significant drive to reduce&nbsp;food waste a new report reveals.<br />The ground-breaking report into UK food waste by WRAP, also reveals&nbsp;that since 2007 we have cut avoidable household food waste by an&nbsp;impressive 21%, which saved cash strapped consumers almost &pound;13<br />billion. Yet we still throw away a staggering 4.2 million tonnes&nbsp;(Mt) of household food, which could have been eaten. Almost half of&nbsp;this food goes straight from our fridges or cupboards to the bin and&nbsp;doesn’t even make it onto our dinner plates.<br />WRAP has also carried out work which shows it could be possible to&nbsp;reduce avoidable household food waste by a further 1.7 million tonnes&nbsp;a year by 2025.&nbsp;<br />The top three foods that Britons are throwing away uneaten include&nbsp;every day essentials: bread, potatoes and milk.</p> <p>The equivalent of a&nbsp;staggering 24 million slices of bread, 5.8 million potatoes and 5.9&nbsp;million glasses of milk are wasted daily. Chicken also made the&nbsp;top ten with the equivalent of 86 million chickens thrown away each&nbsp;year.</p> <p>Buying more than we need, lack of clarity around storage and labelling&nbsp;and over-estimating portions are just some of the reasons for the&nbsp;waste.&quot;</p> <p>The improvements have been &quot;supported by a number of factors including local&nbsp;authority initiatives and changes to packaging, including clearer date&nbsp;labels by retailers and brands.

As a result of these findings, the supermarket chain is going to introduce new measures to help reduce the amount that is thrown away.</p> <p>It's very easy to forget about food in the fridge, so we'd like to find out what's inside your fridge, what you will definitely eat and what may be thrown away. It's only fair of course, if we're asking to see yours, that we confess just how much food we waste, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/21/going-off-fridge-food-waste\">some Guardian writers have done just that</a>. </p> <p>You can share your photos by clicking on the blue 'Contribute' button or downloading the free <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/apps\">GuardianWitness app</a> for smartphones.

        "body":"<h2><strong>Zoe Williams</strong>: furry beans</h2><p>I am not too bad on the obvious rot candidates: meat rarely goes off in my fridge, because I will eat anything, in any condition, whatever it smells like. I have a household hierarchy: the children get the fresh food; food that is past its sell-by date but doesn't yet smell goes to other adults; then I step in for the wilting, the precarious, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/26/food-mould-safe-or-toxic\">mouldy-at-the-edges-but-otherwise-fine</a> … I'm like Dusty Bin. I have a blindspot around cans, however, and have never finished a tin of beans.</p><h2><strong>Stuart Heritage</strong>: stinky chicken</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420603938'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/21/1382371301069/Stuart-Heritages-mouldy-i-009.jpg' alt='Stuart Heritage's mouldy items' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Stuart Heritage's mouldy items. Photograph: Stuart Heritage for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>I hate waste, to the extent that I'll usually keep stuff until it no longer resembles food (I once found <a href=\"http://www.iphoneogram.com/p/230185459259606928_30592112/\" title=\"\">a pepper with a full beard</a> in my fridge, much to the delight of my Instagram followers) but, by chance, the contents of my fridge are largely edible today. The only vaguely disgusting things are a chicken thigh that has been left uncovered for five days, a hard lime, a dodgy banana and something that might have once been a strawberry. The chicken stinks, so I'll throw it out – but I could still get juice out of the lime and eat the banana without much fuss. And the strawberry? I can't rule out the chance of me eating that at some point. Well, everyone loves strawberries, don't they?</p><h2><strong>Marina O'Loughlin</strong>: liquefying cabbage</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420603935'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/21/1382371634457/Marina-OLoughlins-fridge-001.jpg' alt='Marina O'Loughlin's fridge' width='220' height='310' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Marina O'Loughlin's fridge. Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Hideous, post-weekend car crash of a fridge, all vodka and experimental Japanese ingredients, trip souvenirs (the Black Forest ham) and a million chilli sauces. The big bowl contains celeriac remoulade, which is going in the bin. And there, lurking on the bottom shelf, are some liquefying carrots and red cabbage designed to get kids to eat vegetables – they'll always eat an Asian-spiced coleslaw – but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/20/is-compost-harmful-to-our-health\">destined for the composter in the garden</a>. There's also some chicory, sell-by well past, never liberated from its packaging, that will end up there too. I try not to throw out any food – a legacy from my Italian mother who would freeze single egg whites – but inevitably eyes are bigger than stomachs. Hence the composter, which provided a decent crop of tomatoes this year – some of which are heading back in there as we speak. Which has a certain symmetry, I suppose.</p><h2><strong>Tim Dowling</strong>: rotting apples</h2><p>I'm not afraid of limp celery or a bendy carrot, but I do have a strong aversion to a past-its-best apple. Thanks to poor rotation, there are always a few gently deliquescing at the bottom of the fruit bowl, threatening to speed up the rot of everything else in there. We have a tortoise who enjoys rotting fruit; unfortunately we have enough rotting fruit to feed nine tortoises. It all gets tossed out periodically, generally when my view of the TV becomes occluded by fruit flies.</p><h2><strong>Lucy Mangan</strong>: ancient haddock</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420603933'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/21/1382371399318/Lucy-Mangans-fridge-001.jpg' alt='Lucy Mangan's fridge' width='220' height='310' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Lucy Mangan's fridge. Photograph: Lucy Mangan for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>All these plastic boxes are filled with bits of meat, fish, potato and pasta of uncertain age and provenance. Some I remember cooking, some I don't. This is how I have lived ever since I had a child. Before that, meals were either spaghetti bolognese, chicken in a Campbell's Condensed soup or takeaways. It wasn't tasty, nutritious or edifying in any way, but it was efficient. I ate one option til it was gone, then made a batch of the other and did likewise. Then got takeaways until I had time and inclination to begin the cycle again.</p><p>Now I have to try to feed the child properly, meals are a bit more varied but my efficiency has gone to cock. You can judge me. I'm too tired to care.</p><p>The chicken is three days out of date, but that's well within cookable range here. As I took the picture, I noticed at the back of the fridge some smoked haddock that should have been eaten by 29 June. I deduce that I once had plans for kedgeree. To be honest, I'd still give it a whirl, but my husband insisted on binning it. Probably wise. Christ knows what state the eggs are in. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-26086,00.html\">We don't even keep them in the fridge</a>.</p><h2><strong>Matthew Fort</strong>: no waste</h2><p>I very, very rarely throw anything away. I'm not a food miser, but I can't think of the last thing I chucked out. It's against my religion. I never, ever buy bags of salad. I buy fruit and veg in small quantities. If I see something going off, I cut out the going-off part and eat the rest. I keep old bits of cheese to put into soups. The other day I combined some yoghurt and buttermilk far past their use-by dates, strained them through some muslin and used the resulting novel dairy product on stewed plums, which were also looking a bit tired and emotional. Bloody lovely. The contents of my fridge at the moment are all in perfectly acceptable condition. God's truth.</p><h2><strong>Hugh Muir</strong>: decaying burgers</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420603939'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/21/1382371235916/Hugh-Muirs-out-of-date-bu-009.jpg' alt='Hugh Muir's out-of-date burgers' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hugh Muir's out-of-date burgers. Photograph: Hugh Muir for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The problem is not a propensity to waste food, rather a determination not to waste anything. And so there they sit in the freezer: a four-pack of Tesco burgers. Tomato and basil. Slightly greyed, massively unappealing, in their opaque plastic box. They were smuggled in for a teenager's barbecue many months ago, but they weren't nice then and certainly wouldn't be now. So there they sit, decay retarded by ice, but decaying nonetheless. Won't eat 'em, can't bin 'em. Help!</p><h2><strong>John Crace</strong>: soggy cucumber</h2><p>Today the fridge is at its most virtuous. Monday is dustbin day, so every Sunday night I have a quick rootle round to look for stuff that has gone off. A usual haul throws up some manky bits of lettuce, rotting veg and the odd bit of meat that may or may not have salmonella. Last night's haul was below average. A cucumber that had gone completely soggy and was only held together by its plastic wrapping; it was so rank, I can only assume it had slithered to the back of the salad drawer to escape my attention for several weeks. There was also a heat-up vegetable pot that was bulging dangerously with the build-up of gases. It was tempting to leave it in the fridge, just to see how long it would take to explode. And that was about it. Apart from the endless jars of things that aren't ever going to go off but aren't ever going to be eaten because they look so disgusting. With them, I'm in a stand-off for now.</p><h2><strong>Michele Hanson</strong>: rotting banana</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420603940'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/21/1382371929299/A-banana-and-an-apple-in--001.jpg' alt='A banana and an apple in Michele Hanson's bath' width='220' height='310' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A banana and an apple in Michele Hanson's bath. Photograph: Michele Hanson for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>I don't like to boast, but there is nothing going off in my fridge. Not a scrap. The wrinkled lemon doesn't count, because I swear I'm going to use it. I give spare salad to the daughter, toast stale bread for the dog, compost all peelings, grow my own grapes and apples, but I do have one rotting banana in the bath. I store my bananas there, because it's the only place the mice can't get them. My friend Rosemary and I feel guilty if we throw the outer leaves of cabbage away. They're very good for soothing engorged breasts. But we're in our 70s. Should we carry them around in case we meet a pregnant woman?</p><h2><strong>Bim Adewunmi</strong>: fuzzy stew</h2><p>Today my fridge lies unusually empty – I am moving to Berlin for a few months and I've sublet my flat. I always feel terrible about throwing out food. When I was little, my uncle told me that every meal had a hidden blessing, and we had to finish every morsel to guarantee we got it.</p><p>But in the days before my departure, I have been forced to chuck out food. Out went the leftover Nigerian spinach stew, fuzzy with age. Also gone was an alarmingly soft red cabbage (I'm no respecter of best-before dates, but 12 August was no match for the crisper drawer) and a wizened old half of lemon. Not too shabby.</p><h2><strong>Jay Rayner</strong>: fermenting sweetcorn</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420603937'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/21/1382371797148/Jay-Raynors-fridge-001.jpg' alt='Jay Raynor's fridge' width='220' height='310' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jay Rayner's fridge. Photograph: Jay Rayner for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Like any self-regarding member of the devout middle classes, I like to think we have robust food-waste strategies. Any vegetables left over at the end of the week get blitzed up into what is known as Indeterminate Green Soup, and the few things that can't go in get composted. But I look at this photograph of my fridge and I see other crimes against waste, which keep repeating like bad plots in EastEnders. On the top shelf are two pots: one of olives, which I know have been there too long, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/aug/07/british-love-affair-with-hummus\">another of cheap hummus</a>, which has been there so long it is developing its own personality. I am not a fan of hummus, cheap or otherwise, so I can claim innocence on this one. It is bought for others. Who then don't eat it. On the middle shelf is sweetcorn, which is odd. We know our kids don't really care for it. And yet we keep buying the bloody stuff, not noticing it is there until the sugars have started to ferment and the packaging has started to bow. We throw it away. And then we buy it again. A few days ago we threw away half a pack of bacon. This, I can say, is an aberration. It is rare for bits of pig to get away without being eaten.</p><h2><strong>Stuart Jeffries</strong>: browning broccoli</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420603934'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/21/1382371560889/Stuart-Jeffries-quince-je-009.jpg' alt='Stuart Jeffries' quince jelly' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Stuart Jeffries' quince jelly. Photograph: Stuart Jeffries for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>I'm a pitifully mean, deeply anal keeper of food, but my wife is a thrower. Which makes for \"interesting\" altercations. At the moment, though, I'm winning. Maybe I'm tripping, but the browning broccoli I found at the bottom of the fridge (use by: 8 Oct) is just the thing to dip into the half-used, possibly rancid jar of quince jelly I'd forgotten about that my sister gave me last year (bottling date: 9 April  2012) and had been lurking behind the mustard. Yummy! The \"majestic basil\" (use by: 13 Oct) is turning black, but there are still some edible leaves and the rest I'll compost. Maybe I should pre-book an ambulance. Milk and yoghurt, boringly, are within their use-by dates. Shame: I do like a brush with danger from dairy.</p><h2><strong>Felicity Cloake</strong>: pink cheese</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420603941'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/21/1382371876207/Felicity-Cloakes-fridge-001.jpg' alt='Felicity Cloake's fridge' width='220' height='310' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Felicity Cloake's fridge. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to recipe testing, I end up with a lot of weird and wonderful ingredients crammed into the fridge – and, perhaps fortunately, it is not humanly possible for me to eat them all. The last things I threw away were a packet of very furry bird's-eye chillies (there are always far more in the pack than I can use) and some blue cheese that had turned intriguingly pink. I do relish the challenge of turning unpromising leftovers into something delicious, though; there are a couple of rashers of bacon, some wilting spinach, a quarter of a red onion and a bit of cream in there at the moment that seem heaven-sent for a pasta lunch. In fact, maybe I shouldn't have chucked that cheese after all …</p><h2><strong>Tony Naylor</strong>: mouldy ginger</h2><p>I'm very tight, so I throw little out. Although I did recently have to chuck (an oversight, this) a cucumber that had melted and filled the veg drawer with ectoplasm. There is guaranteed be a bit of ginger in the fridge going slightly mouldy, and there is some coleslaw in there that's a few days over, but it's going to get eaten later – cavalier, I know. As for irregular waste: I buy too many eggs and, occasionally, posh fruit, in the vain hope that one day I'll develop a taste for mangoes. A few weeks later, they're in the bin. Again.</p><h2><strong>Paula Cocozza</strong>: bearded mushrooms</h2><p>There is half an onion, saved in a spirit of good home economics, but whose layers, dried and separating, are as stark a sign of age as the rings of a tree trunk. The mushrooms are fuzzing up with a haze of white feathery whiskers, which, left unattended, will soon be a full beard. I don't mean to let things ruin. I'm a keeper of spoils by conception, but each week a thrower by trade. Even the best intentions grow mouldy, and many of my best intentions are vegetables. I've had this wilting fennel for 10 days, but I haven't given up on it yet. Somewhere inside is a usable bulb, getting smaller and smaller.</p><h2><strong>Tom Meltzer</strong>: tired salad</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420603936'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/21/1382371711454/Tom-Meltzers-fridge-conte-009.jpg' alt='Tom Meltzer's fridge contents' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tom Meltzer's fridge contents. Photograph: Tom Meltzer for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>I let a lot of food go to waste. Today I had a rummage in the fridge for things I needed to throw out. I found two half-full boxes of mushrooms, three unopened yoghurts, a bag of salad, half a pint of milk and the remains of some pasta. Some of it was more than a month past its sell-by date. By my standards, that's quite good. In the past, I've binned whole fishcakes, salmon fillets, unopened jars of pesto and even steaks. In my defence, I live with five other people. It's easy to lose track of what's yours and what isn't. Plus, when you spontaneously cook together, your individual meal plans tend to go out the window.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420556621|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|4cb63b58bc1aec2ea044e73733c8fe7a8b4fa2fe -->",

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/07/uk-households-food-waste\">4.2m tonnes of avoidable food and drink waste was thrown away by UK households last year</a> - worth £12.5bn -  according to the <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/hhfdw-2012-main.pdf\">latest report by the Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme</a> (Wrap).</p><p>The annual report by the government's waste advisory body provides estimates of the amount of food and drink wasted in the UK, with detailed data on the types of food and drink wasted, reasons for disposal and the impact on the environment. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebeccasmithers\">Rebecca Smithers </a>writes today:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The average UK family is wasting nearly £60 a month by throwing away almost an entire meal a day, according to a new report that reveals the scale of the ongoing challenge to reduce household food waste.</p><p>Britons are chucking out the equivalent of 24 meals a month, adding up to 4.2 million tonnes of food and drink every year that could have been consumed. Almost half of this is going straight from fridges or cupboards into the bin. One-fifth of what households buy ends up as waste, and around 60% of that could have been eaten.</p></blockquote><p>In the past we've<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/apr/26/brie-bin-food-waste-value\"> discussed the merits and downfalls of trying to estimate the amount of food waste produced</a> across the country. The Wrap report however is significant as its findings are employed in advising the government. So how does Wrap go about finding out these numbers?</p><p>According to the report the research, funded by UK Governments, is based on three sources: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>• Detailed measurement of the weight and types of food and drink waste from approximately 1,800 consenting households</p><p>• A week-long food and drink diary involving 950 households </p><p>• A synthesis of waste data from more than 80 local authorities</p></blockquote><p>So to break the 135-page report into bite-sized chunks, we've drawn out some of key findings from the report:</p><h2>7m tonnes of food and drink was thrown away last year - 4.2m tonnes of this was avoidable</h2><p>In 2012, 7m tonnes of food and drink was thrown away from our homes, which according to the report is enough to fill Wembley Stadium nine times over. However, 4.2m tonnes of this was classed as 'avoidable', 1.2m tonnes was considered 'possibly avoidable' and 1.6m tonnes was declared as 'unavoidable' (banana skins, tea waste, poultry bones etc).</p><p>In 2007 the amount of avoidable waste totalled 5.3m tonnes, meaning it made up 64% the total food and drink waste compared with 60% in 2012. </p><h2>Two thirds of household food and drink waste is collected by local authorities</h2><p>4.7m tonnes of household food and drink waste was collected by local authorities (LA) in 2012. Another 1.6m tonnes was disposed of via the sewer (kitchen sink and other drains) whilst 0.51m tonnes made it onto the compost heap and 0.28m tonnes was fed to animals.</p><h2>You're most likely to have thrown away bread, potatoes or milk</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422013107'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/7/1383853192995/Food-waste-graphic-from-W-009.jpg' alt='Food waste graphic from Wrap' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Click on the picture for a full-size graphic of the top 20 wasted food and drink items in 2012. Graphic by <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/hhfdw-2012-main.pdf\"> Wrap</a></figcaption></figure><p>Bread, potatoes and milk were the top three food types thrown away within the avoidable food waste category (by weight). If you look at it by food groups though, fresh vegetables and salads are at the top (contributing to 19% of avoidable food waste). And if you're to look at it by cost, meat and fish tops the list followed by home-made and pre-prepared meals.</p><h2>The average household wasted £60 per month last year on throwing away food and drink</h2><p>According to Wrap, the cost of avoidable food and drink waste to the average household last year was around £9 per week or £470 per year. But an average household with children is reported in the publication as wasting £700 per year. </p><p>The UK average cost of avoidable food and drink waste per person was £200 in 2012 - one-person households recorded a significantly higher average at £290. </p><h2>How bad is food and drink waste for the environment?</h2><p>The greenhouse gas emissions associated with avoidable food and drink waste in the UK accounted for around 17m tonnes of CO2 equivalent. According to Wrap, if all avoidable food waste in 2012 had been prevented then the UK would have made a carbon saving that would be the equivalent to taking one in four cars off the road. </p><p>But what about producing the food we throw away? Well, for the first time Wrap have estimated how much land is required to produce food and drink that is thrown away in the UK. They state that 19,000 square kilometres or an area about 91% the size of Wales is required. </p><h2>£5.6bn worth of avoidable food and drink waste in 2012 was due to 'not being used in time'</h2><p>Just under half of all avoidable food and drink waste was attributed to not being used on time (this includes items being thrown away because they had gone off or passed the date on the packaging). 31% of avoidable waste was due to 'cooked, prepared or served too much' whilst the remainder of avoidable food and drink waste is attributed to health reasons, personal preferences and accidents. </p><p>The table below shows the amount of food and drink waste last year by food group and is split by avoidability. You can find additional data from the report on the amount of food and drink wasted by reason and type of disposal in the downloadable spreadsheet. </p><p>We'd love to hear your thoughts on the findings from the report. Do you think Wrap have produced accurate estimations of the food and drink wasted in the UK?</p><p><a name=\"data\"></p><table>\n      <caption>\n            The amount of fresh vegetables and salad

        "headline":"Food waste: national campaign aims to stop the rot by 2020",
        "body":"<p>Food producers, retailers, restaurants and consumers are being urged to join forces to secure a ban on all food waste going into landfill by 2020, in a bold national campaign.</p><p>Compulsory collections of food waste from all homes and businesses by local councils are among a series of measures recommended in a new report to enable food waste to be harnessed as a valuable resource to provide energy, heat and benefits for agriculture.</p><p>The ambition is to save the UK economy over £17bn a year through the reduction of food wasted by households, businesses and the public sector, preventing 27m tonnes of greenhouse gases a year from entering into the atmosphere.</p><p>The new study, Vision 2020: UK Roadmap to Zero Food Waste to Landfill is the culmination of more than two years' work and has the backing and input of local authority and industry experts. It sets the framework for a food waste-free UK by 2020.</p><p>Last week official figures revealed the average UK family was wasting nearly £60 a month by throwing away almost an entire meal a day. A report from the government's waste advisory group Wrap showed Britons were chucking out the equivalent of 24 meals a month, adding up to 4.2m tonnes of food and drink every year that could have been consumed. Almost half of this is going straight from fridges or cupboards into the bin, Wrap found. One-fifth of what households buy ends up as waste, and around 60% of that could have been eaten.</p><p>At the same time the UK's largest retailer, Tesco, recently agreed to reduce its multi-buy items and other promotions after revealing that 35% of its bagged salad was being thrown out. It also found that 40% of apples were wasted, and just under half of bakery items.</p><p>The report highlights where and why food waste is happening at each stage of the UK supply chain; what actions are being taken to tackle food waste in each sector and what more can be done in the future to drive the positive environmental, economic and social outcomes.</p><p>The campaign is led by food waste recycling company ReFood – in collaboration with BioRegional, a sustainable business charity – as part of the Vision 2020 campaign supported by national and local government as well as industry. The Vision 2020 panel is headed by Lord Deben, the Conservative former environment secretary John Gummer.</p><p>Philip Simpson, commercial director at ReFood, said: \"Our message is clear; food waste is a valuable resource that should never end up in landfill sites. Everyone from the food producer, through to the retailer, the restaurant and the householder can play their part in ensuring that we take full advantage of its considerable potential by ensuring we re-use, recycle and recover every nutrient and kilowatt of energy it has to offer.\"</p><p>The report calls for better collaboration at every stage of the supply chain to accelerate the adoption of best practice, improve waste prevention and maximise the value of food waste as a resource. A clear timetable for the phased introduction of a ban on food waste to landfill to come into force by 2020 would allow the industry the time to finance and develop an optimum collection and processing infrastructure, it says.</p><p>Compulsory food collections by local authorities are key to the new campaign – currently only 40% of councils have separate food waste collections, while Birmingham – the UK's largest authority – still relies on black bag collections of mixed waste. The Local Government Authority, which was involved in the report, says if \"food contamination\" of recycling was halved by 2020, it would save £1bn. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are now consulting on banning food into landfill, but not England.</p><p>Re-using food waste through processes such as anaerobic digestion could return over 1.3m tonnes a year of valuable nutrients to the soil, the report says, or generate over 1 terrawatt-hour (Twh) electricity a year, enough to power over 600,000 homes.</p><p>Sue Riddlestone, chief executive and co-founder of BioRegional said: \"Achieving zero food waste to landfill within the next seven years is a big challenge and we will need the support and actions of individuals, businesses and the government if this vision is to be realised. However, the case for change is compelling. We will save billions of pounds. We will prevent millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases from entering our atmosphere. And crucially, we will ensure that food is treated as a precious resource.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422125329|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|812a5d4ce65edf884a19f61b784089e99706382f -->",
