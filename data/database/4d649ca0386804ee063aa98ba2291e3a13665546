        "headline":"British Gas: energy bills price hike turns into PR disaster",
        "body":"<p>British Gas has turned a consumer and political backlash over a 10% increase in energy bills into a public relations disaster after trying to head off criticism of the price hike by using social media.</p><p>Nearly 16,000 Twitter comments – most of them vitriolic – rained down on Britain's biggest power provider in a few hours after it invited questions from customers. One online expert described the company's attempt to ease public anger over the new tariffs as one of the biggest PR own goals he had ever seen.</p><p>The energy price increases – three times the level of inflation – will affect 16 million customers and came in for particular condemnation because the parent group, Centrica, had pledged earlier in the year to use windfall profits from last winter to keep prices down.</p><p>David Cameron, who appointed the company's &pound;4m-a-year boss Sam Laidlaw to his business advisory group in 2010, said the rise was very disappointing and urged customers to switch providers. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, said some of British Gas's numbers &quot;just don't add up&quot;.</p><p>But there were more venomous comments, spliced with the darkest humour, after the energy supplier invited users of Twitter to raise questions with its customer services director.</p><p>&quot;My Nan's just been on the phone (no twitter) Should she burn the garden table or the chairs first to keep warm?&quot; wrote one Twitter user. &quot;Have you started an affiliate scheme with a funeral directors?&quot; said another with reference to the number of elderly people who die in cold winters.</p><p>The hashtag &quot;AskBG&quot; was the top trend on UK Twitter within an hour of British Gas launching its chat; scores of tweets contained the words &quot;greed&quot; and &quot;death&quot;.</p><p>Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy, defended his decision to use social media to engage with customers and the wider decision to raise bills. &quot;I would not describe this as a PR disaster. We have made a commitment to be open and transparent. These are tough decisions we have had to take in tough times and it would not be right of us to hide away and not explain ourselves.&quot;</p><p>British Gas had taken to Twitter after unveiling a 10.4% rise in electricity prices and an 8.4% increase in the gas tariff from 23 November. The increase was announced a week after slightly smaller moves by SSE, another of the &quot;big six&quot; power companies. Some customers face bills of &pound;1,500 a year although fixed-price tariffs have also been introduced together with special help for those in need.</p><p>Peters said the decision to raise prices had not been taken lightly, but had been forced on the company by soaring costs despite promises to keep prices down after benefiting from larger-than-expected demand at the turn of this year.</p><p>He blamed the price rises on higher wholesale gas costs, charges for transport and distribution and the cost of government policies such as the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) to help insulate homes. The ECO element alone will add &pound;40 to average dual fuel bills in 2014, according to British Gas. However, this calculation was challenged by the energy secretary, who had also described the wider bill increases as disappointing.</p><p>Davey said: &quot;I recently wrote to energy companies asking them to publish their costs of delivering the Energy Company Obligation. Today's announcement shows why that is necessary, because British Gas ECO numbers just don't add up when you look at what other energy companies are saying about their costs.&quot;</p><p>Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, said the British Gas move reinforced Labour's determination to introduce a price freeze if it returns to government in 2015. &quot;This is the company that, with Centrica, has passed on the highest share of its profits to its shareholders while at the same time making the least amount of investment into what we need to ensure our energy security in the future.&quot;</p><p>Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, said the price rise increased the number of households where people would need to choose between &quot;heating and eating&quot;. He added: &quot;This price hike is big, and is nasty. It also means that two of the big six sheep have bleated, the rest are likely to follow within the next six weeks.&quot;</p><p>The Federation of Small Businesses said 40% of its members used British Gas and the &quot;disgraceful&quot; price increases would make life even harder for many struggling firms.</p><p>Twitter users seized on British Gas's attempt to explain its decision, particularly when its PR customer services director offered &quot;advice and tips&quot; on how to save money and blamed the price rise on the &quot;general wholesale energy trend&quot;.</p><p>One reply said: &quot;@BritishGas have you found a way to channel angry customer feedback into electricity?&quot; A British Gas advert for a social media senior manager, a job that comes with a salary of up to &pound;60,000, also attracted attention. The successful candidate, the advert says, will have a detailed understanding of Twitter and Facebook and &quot;implement social media best practice and innovation&quot;.</p><p>Matt Owen, head of social at Econsultancy, said it was one of the worst PR disasters on social media he had ever seen. &quot;It is a rotten PR fail … It is just ridiculous that they had set this up on the day of this huge price hike. They should have been prepared for vitriol and a backlash, but to exacerbate it by holding an 'ask me anything' session is ridiculous.&quot;</p><p>British Gas had made the situation even worse by failing to answer customers' Twitter questions, he added. &quot;They needed to be transparent and at least have some kind of [web] landing page on why [the price increases are] happening. As it was there were just vague mutterings about 'wholesale prices' and that sort of thing, which isn't going to stop the shouting.&quot;</p><p>The social media firestorm that engulfed British Gas may be the worst since Starbucks invited its customers to &quot;spread the cheer&quot; on Twitter screens at a London museum last Christmas, prompting a storm of angry tweets over its failure to pay UK corporation tax.</p><p>Waitrose provoked more gentle mockery of its posh image when it invited Twitter users to say why they shopped at the store, while Tesco was the laughing stock of the internet when – at the height of the horse-meat scandal – its customer services team signed off with the tweet: &quot;We're off to hit the hay&quot;.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420298241|2013-10-18T10:43:30Z|dc6c27230fa725cbda55fe701b2c159c0ee92417 -->",

        "body":"<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-419576960\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/10/ITNP_NF_ENERGY_10_dv-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/10/ITNP_NF_ENERGY_10_dv_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/10/ITNP_NF_ENERGY_10_dv_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/10/ITNP_NF_ENERGY_10_dv/ITNP_NF_ENERGY_10_dv.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>The row over soaring fuel bills escalated on Thursday when Ed Miliband accused SSE, one of the country's big six energy providers, of \"ripping off\" 7 million customers with an 8.2% price increase.</p><p>SSE, which earlier this week promised above-inflation dividend payouts to its shareholders, admitted that raising gas and electricity hikes over £100 to an average of £1,465 per annum would lead to more fuel poverty. But it blamed government policies for the price rise, which will take effect on 15 November.</p><p>Amid expectations that other big energy firms are poised to follow suit, Miliband attacked David Cameron for letting power companies \"get away with it\" and letting down the British people.</p><p>\"The companies are putting up prices because we've got a broken energy market and they are ripping off consumers,\" he said. \"This latest scandal shows why the government needs to act. The companies are trying to blame everyone else, the government is trying to blame everyone else … They're responsible, they're not getting a grip. We would get a grip: we'd freeze prices, we'd reform a broken energy&nbsp;market.\"</p><p>Cameron responded by saying the proposal to freeze energy prices, first unveiled by Miliband at the Labour conference two weeks ago, was a \"con\" because the increases were driven by international pressures and a moratorium would not help.</p><p>The prime minister said the best way of reducing energy bills was to tackle the roots causes of high wholesale gas prices, including improving competition between energy companies and pushing ahead with shale fracking. Cameron said green levies to subsidise renewables would not be on bills \"for a moment longer than is necessary\" but added that the UK needs to have a \"balanced energy mix\" including nuclear power and wind power. To achieve this, \"some of those subsidies have been necessary\", he said.</p><p>Consumer groups warned that other big six companies would be poised to push through their own increases shortly, while the energy regulator, Ofgem, promised to start a consultation on how to improve the transparency of company profits.</p><p>Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer campaign group Which?, described the move as a \"massive blow\" to SSE customers at a time when rising energy prices are consistently one of the top worries for hard-pressed consumers.</p><p>He called on the government to intervene in the energy market to \"make sure everything possible is done to keep prices in check\", such as breaking up the biggest energy companies into separate power generation and supply businesses.</p><p>Mark Todd, a director at the price comparison service energyhelpline, said: \"The dam has burst: expect a flood of price rises to follow. Other major suppliers are very likely to follow suit in a matter of days. It will be a bitter pill to swallow for customers, who have been hit by 40% price rises now in the last four years.\"</p><p>SSE, which was fined a record £10.5m by Ofgem earlier this year for \"prolonged and extensive\" mis-selling, insisted that a 13% rise in government levies plus the costs of upgrading electricity and gas networks, along with a rise in wholesale prices, were responsible for pushing up its bills. Will Morris, managing director of SSE's retail business, said that \"if politicians want to do something to make bills cheaper and fairer, they should take the cost of government policies out of bills and fund them through general taxation instead\".</p><p>The company has promised not to increase its bills again until 2014 but while saying \"sorry\" to customers, its website still talks of \"our dividend obsession\", and adds: \"we have just one strategic priority: sustained real dividend growth.\" Earlier this week its finance director, Gregor Alexander, insisted the company would stick to above-inflation dividend rises, while in a question and answer section on its website SSE admits \"in all likelihood and unfortunately\" the latest tariff increases will result in more fuel poverty.</p><p>This brought a stinging attack from the campaign group Fuel Poverty Action. \"We don't believe that SSE is apologetic about the price rises; they reported £1.4bn pre-tax profits this spring, and five of their top executives are earning over £1m a year. The big six continue to put their own profits before the lives of millions of people in the UK currently making the impossible choice between heating and eating,\" said the organisation's Clare Welton.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Debtline service said it had received a record 15,502 calls from people seeking help with energy debts in the first six months of this year, up 10% on the same period of 2012.</p><p>Britain has been affected by a series of changes that have driven up prices, including the running-down of North Sea gas supplies, rising international demand for gas following the Fukushima shutdowns, and a government drive to reduce carbon emissions by subsidising the building of wind farms and solar arrays.</p><p>But the six dominant energy companies have made themselves deeply unpopular with numerous scandals involving mis-selling, high executive bonuses and low corporation tax payments. Critics believe they hold a gun to the head of government by warning the lights will go out unless they make substantial profits; but they repeatedly argue that their retail margins are relatively low, at around 5%.</p><p>Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, appealed to other firms to refrain from raising their prices to avoid pushing more people into poverty.</p><p>\"This price rise will be a blow for stretched budgets. The hike comes at a time when some working households are turning to food banks to feed their families as they struggle to cope with the rising cost of living. I hope other energy firms show an understanding of their customers' financial situation by not raising their prices this winter.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419558181|2013-10-18T10:43:30Z|4a513af8448474411e8e05027f14f6f77baf1557 -->",

        "headline":"50,000 consumers switch suppliers after energy price rise, claim experts",
        "body":"<p>More than 50,000 energy consumers have switched their suppliers and many more are expected to follow  on Monday in the aftermath of the 8.2% price increase levied by SSE last week, experts say.</p><p>Other \"big six\" energy firms are believed to be temporarily holding back their own plans to raise bills in the hope they soak up new customers opting to leave SSE.</p><p>The mass switching will be welcomed by the government, which had urged consumers hit by the price rise to find cheaper options rather than passively accept an increase in the cost of living.</p><p>Paul Green, the marketing manager at Energyhelpline, said that at the end of last week his switching company had had six times the activity seen on normal days.</p><p>\"I would think that around 50,000 people overall have switched their energy providers – not necessarily all from SSE – following the price rise. We would expect to see more activity on Monday ,\" he explained.</p><p>Green said any price rise triggered a frenzy of activity as customers reviewed their energy bills and considered whether their providers would raise prices.</p><p>\"If British Gas had raised its prices the peak in activity would have been even higher because it is by far the largest supplier but SSE is the second largest so it was bound to be significant.\"</p><p>Often suppliers quickly raise their prices once a rival has taken the first step. While Energyhelpline  expected others to follow suit, it believed there might be a delay as rivals try to win those customers who have bailed out of SSE or have just decided to leave their own provider.</p><p>But other City experts said companies such as British Gas were holding back increases in the hope that the government would come up with ways of removing some responsibilities and costs, such as the ECO energy company obligation to provide lagging and other measures for poorer homes. Downing Street confirmed last Friday that the government was considering ways of cutting financial support in a bid to reduce overall fuel bills.</p><p>Energy companies including SSE have been campaigning for environmental measures to be taken off bills and put on to generation taxation while others want them scrapped completely.</p><p>The SSE price rise – the first to be announced by one of the big six this winter – will take effect from 15 November and force up the cost of living for more than 7 million customers.</p><p>SSE blamed government policy charges and green levies for the increase, which it insisted equated to an average rise of just £2 a week on most bills.</p><p>Michael Fallon, the energy minister, encouraged people to consider switching to one of the company's rivals.\"The best answer here is more competition. I would encourage customers to look at the tariffs they are on, and see if they can switch. That competition is best,\" he argued.</p><p>But the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, made an impassioned attack on SSE, accusing it of ripping off customers and said the latest \"scandal\" showed why the government needed to act.</p><p>But David Cameron responded by saying the proposal to freeze energy prices, first unveiled by Miliband at the Labour conference two weeks ago, was a \"con\" because the increases were driven by international pressures and a moratorium would not help.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419831880|2013-10-18T10:43:30Z|1bf99db30a043290f0a3721d9d828270b2f0a395 -->",

        "body":"<p>The energy firms have begun announcing big price rises just as temperatures start falling ahead of winter. If you are yet to heed Money's recent warnings to grab a fixed-rate tariff, the good news is you can still insulate yourself from the £100-a-year increases set to hit householders  but get your skates on.</p><p>So far <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/17/british-gas-energy-prices-gas-electricity-centrica\">British Gas</a> and SSE are the first of the \"big six\" to up their prices, but you can almost bet your house on the fact that the other four will do the same in the coming days and weeks. British Gas surprised analysts with a bigger increase than SSE. You can switch now and avoid the hikes which come into play on 23 November. Following today's announcement, the average annual dual fuel bill with British Gas will increase by £107 to £1,297.</p><p>If you haven't yet acted, where should you take your business?</p><p>The cheapest fixed tariffs are currently being offered by First Utility. Its <a href=\"http://www.first-utility.com/isave-fixed-v9-cheapest?utm_source=Money+Saving+Expert&amp;utm_medium=News+Article&amp;utm_campaign=MSE+ARTICLE\" title=\"First Utility offer\">iSave Fixed v9 April 2015 tariff</a> currently costs an average of £1,170. Unfortunately, Money receives too many complaints about its customer service to heartily recommend it, but it is certainly the cheapest.</p><p>The better alternative is one of three deals. <a href=\"http://my.edfenergy.com/gas-electricity/blue-plus-price-promise\">EDF's Blue +Price Promise</a>,  sets prices until March 2015 and costs an average of £1,183, <a href=\"http://www.npower.com/home/electricity-and-gas/products/fixed-short/\">while npower's Online Price Fix November 2014</a> will set you back an average £1,182 a year. </p><p>Lastly, ScottishPower has launched Online Fixed Price Energy March 2015, which costs an average of £1,181. Which is best for you will depend on your usage and where you are in the country.<br /> <br />The EDF and npower deals have the advantage that they don't come with exit penalties if you choose to leave before the fixed rate period. However, it is highly unlikely that a consumer switching to one of the others would want to switch out early as prices are not predicted to start falling again. </p><p>Both EDF and npower also have even longer fixed price tariffs - allowing customers to fix until March 2017. They both will set you back an average of £1,340 - a premium of £160 a year on the best prices now, but offering price certainty for an appealing three and a half years.</p><p>Mark Todd, who runs <a href=\"http://www.energyhelpline.com/\" title=\"EnergyHelpline website\">EnergyHelpline</a>, which provides the Guardian's switching service, says most customers should aim to fix. He says if he were switching his own supply he would go for one of the shorter-term fixed deals from one of the bigger firms.</p><p>• The quoted prices are only averages; your actual bill will depend on specific usage and location.

        "body":"<p>British Gas will raise energy prices by an average of 9.2% next month, piling further financial pressure on 7.8 million households and reigniting the political row over soaring gas and electricity prices.</p><p>Parent company Centrica became the second of the big six energy firms to announce a price rise after SSE raised prices last week. The average annual dual-fuel bill with British Gas will increase by £107 to £1,297.</p><p>Centrica blamed the above-inflation hike on higher costs for wholesale energy and delivering gas and electricity to homes, and government's \"social and environmental programmes\" which are paid for through customers' bills.</p><p>Electricity bills will rise by 10.4% and gas bills by 8.4% from 23 November. With usage and regional variations this equates to an average price rise of 9.2%, Centrica said.</p><p>The move escalated the row between energy providers and the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who accused SSE of \"ripping off\" customers after it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill\" title=\"\">announced an 8.2% price rise for its 7 million customers</a>.</p><p>Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, said the latest rise by British Gas showed \"clearer than ever\" why Miliband's proposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/sep/25/centrica-sse-labour-miliband-price-freeze\" title=\"\">20-month energy price freeze</a> was needed.</p><p>British Gas said on Thursday that although it recognised energy bills were a \"real worry for hard-pressed households\", the decision was down to rising costs \"that are not all directly under our control\".</p><p>Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas residential energy, said: \"I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes aren't keeping pace. We haven't taken this decision lightly.\"</p><p>He said the best way to keep bills down was by increased energy efficiency, and urged customers to check whether they were eligible for measures such as insulation.</p><p>Tom Lyon, an energy expert at uSwitch.com, said the rise would leave customers feeling \"betrayed\".</p><p>\"Today's price hike will be seen by many as a broken promise after the supplier suggested in May that it would use the extra profits it made last winter to hold off from any price hikes.</p><p>\"British Gas customers have had the rug pulled from under their feet and I suspect that many will be feeling let down and betrayed.\"</p><p>The company, however, insisted it was making \"fair profits\" for \"keeping homes warm and keeping the lights on\".</p><p>It said it was offering a new tariff which guarantees that prices will not go up until 30 November 2014. If standard prices fall, the fixed tariff will fall too, it said.</p><p>Clare Francis, editor-in-chief of Moneysupermarket.com, said other energy providers were likely to follow the move.</p><p>\"It won't stop there. We can expect the other four major providers – EDF, E.ON, npower and Scottish Power – to also announce price hikes over the coming weeks.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420240604|2013-10-18T10:43:30Z|b5044fdc23f3aa00553e56fa768c773b98398e8f -->",

        "headline":"British Gas: energy bills price hike turns into PR disaster",
        "body":"<p>British Gas has turned a consumer and political backlash over a 10% increase in energy bills into a public relations disaster after trying to head off criticism of the price hike by using social media.</p><p>Nearly 16,000 Twitter comments – most of them vitriolic – rained down on Britain's biggest power provider in a few hours after it invited questions from customers. One online expert described the company's attempt to ease public anger over the new tariffs as one of the biggest PR own goals he had ever seen.</p><p>The energy price increases – three times the level of inflation – will affect 16 million customers and came in for particular condemnation because the parent group, Centrica, had pledged earlier in the year to use windfall profits from last winter to keep prices down.</p><p>David Cameron, who appointed the company's &pound;4m-a-year boss Sam Laidlaw to his business advisory group in 2010, said the rise was very disappointing and urged customers to switch providers. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, said some of British Gas's numbers &quot;just don't add up&quot;.</p><p>But there were more venomous comments, spliced with the darkest humour, after the energy supplier invited users of Twitter to raise questions with its customer services director.</p><p>&quot;My Nan's just been on the phone (no twitter) Should she burn the garden table or the chairs first to keep warm?&quot; wrote one Twitter user. &quot;Have you started an affiliate scheme with a funeral directors?&quot; said another with reference to the number of elderly people who die in cold winters.</p><p>The hashtag &quot;AskBG&quot; was the top trend on UK Twitter within an hour of British Gas launching its chat; scores of tweets contained the words &quot;greed&quot; and &quot;death&quot;.</p><p>Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy, defended his decision to use social media to engage with customers and the wider decision to raise bills. &quot;I would not describe this as a PR disaster. We have made a commitment to be open and transparent. These are tough decisions we have had to take in tough times and it would not be right of us to hide away and not explain ourselves.&quot;</p><p>British Gas had taken to Twitter after unveiling a 10.4% rise in electricity prices and an 8.4% increase in the gas tariff from 23 November. The increase was announced a week after slightly smaller moves by SSE, another of the &quot;big six&quot; power companies. Some customers face bills of &pound;1,500 a year although fixed-price tariffs have also been introduced together with special help for those in need.</p><p>Peters said the decision to raise prices had not been taken lightly, but had been forced on the company by soaring costs despite promises to keep prices down after benefiting from larger-than-expected demand at the turn of this year.</p><p>He blamed the price rises on higher wholesale gas costs, charges for transport and distribution and the cost of government policies such as the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) to help insulate homes. The ECO element alone will add &pound;40 to average dual fuel bills in 2014, according to British Gas. However, this calculation was challenged by the energy secretary, who had also described the wider bill increases as disappointing.</p><p>Davey said: &quot;I recently wrote to energy companies asking them to publish their costs of delivering the Energy Company Obligation. Today's announcement shows why that is necessary, because British Gas ECO numbers just don't add up when you look at what other energy companies are saying about their costs.&quot;</p><p>Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, said the British Gas move reinforced Labour's determination to introduce a price freeze if it returns to government in 2015. &quot;This is the company that, with Centrica, has passed on the highest share of its profits to its shareholders while at the same time making the least amount of investment into what we need to ensure our energy security in the future.&quot;</p><p>Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, said the price rise increased the number of households where people would need to choose between &quot;heating and eating&quot;. He added: &quot;This price hike is big, and is nasty. It also means that two of the big six sheep have bleated, the rest are likely to follow within the next six weeks.&quot;</p><p>The Federation of Small Businesses said 40% of its members used British Gas and the &quot;disgraceful&quot; price increases would make life even harder for many struggling firms.</p><p>Twitter users seized on British Gas's attempt to explain its decision, particularly when its PR customer services director offered &quot;advice and tips&quot; on how to save money and blamed the price rise on the &quot;general wholesale energy trend&quot;.</p><p>One reply said: &quot;@BritishGas have you found a way to channel angry customer feedback into electricity?&quot; A British Gas advert for a social media senior manager, a job that comes with a salary of up to &pound;60,000, also attracted attention. The successful candidate, the advert says, will have a detailed understanding of Twitter and Facebook and &quot;implement social media best practice and innovation&quot;.</p><p>Matt Owen, head of social at Econsultancy, said it was one of the worst PR disasters on social media he had ever seen. &quot;It is a rotten PR fail … It is just ridiculous that they had set this up on the day of this huge price hike. They should have been prepared for vitriol and a backlash, but to exacerbate it by holding an 'ask me anything' session is ridiculous.&quot;</p><p>British Gas had made the situation even worse by failing to answer customers' Twitter questions, he added. &quot;They needed to be transparent and at least have some kind of [web] landing page on why [the price increases are] happening. As it was there were just vague mutterings about 'wholesale prices' and that sort of thing, which isn't going to stop the shouting.&quot;</p><p>The social media firestorm that engulfed British Gas may be the worst since Starbucks invited its customers to &quot;spread the cheer&quot; on Twitter screens at a London museum last Christmas, prompting a storm of angry tweets over its failure to pay UK corporation tax.</p><p>Waitrose provoked more gentle mockery of its posh image when it invited Twitter users to say why they shopped at the store, while Tesco was the laughing stock of the internet when – at the height of the horse-meat scandal – its customer services team signed off with the tweet: &quot;We're off to hit the hay&quot;.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420298241|2013-10-18T10:43:30Z|dc6c27230fa725cbda55fe701b2c159c0ee92417 -->",
