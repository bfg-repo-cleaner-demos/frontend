        "body":"<p>For a chancellor so keen on the defence of UK national sovereignty against democratic Europeans, George Osborne's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/17/china-buy-uk-nuclear-power-stations-george-osborne\" title=\"\">unbridled enthusiasm for Chinese investment in the UK's critical infrastructure</a> is striking. If all these memorandums of understanding come to fruition, Chinese entities will hold important stakes in water in the UK, airports, IT infrastructure and now nuclear power generation, all without a serious national debate on any potential risks such involvement might bring.</p><p>Since the Chinese government does its homework, it knows that Osborne represents a country reduced to penury by the financial crisis, and with some tricky, big-ticket items on its wishlist. Since the Chinese appreciate deference from their visitors, they must have been delighted by the chancellor. Britain is open for business, as he likes to say. Just make me an offer.</p><p>Neither China's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/16/china-investment-corporation-eurozone-austerity-jin-liqun\" title=\"\">sovereign wealth fund</a> nor its state-owned enterprises are philanthropic. All have large war chests, and their search for profitable, secure investments around the world has stimulated competition among aspirant recipients. But good bargains are not always done in haste and a number of unanswered questions hang over China's proposed investment, future majority stake-holding and possible future operational involvement in Britain's nuclear power.</p><p>Some are hardy perennials: the world has 270,000 tonnes of high-level waste in temporary storage, an unlovely heap that grows by 10,000 tonnes each year. In 50 years of nuclear power, nobody has come up with a workable plan for the million years that safety regulations demand. Are the costs of that, and of decommissioning, built into the deal and if so, who pays?</p><p>Then there is public subsidy: nobody has ever built a nuclear power plant without it, but the mandatory opening up of European electricity systems to competition means consumers are no longer obliged to underwrite unlimited costs, or to pay for expensive nuclear energy. This transfers the financial risk to the owners and financiers â€“ hence the difficulty of finding the cash. What is different here?</p><p><a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-04/26/c_124633021.htm\" title=\"\">French enthusiasm</a> is explained by the attempt to save their industry after decades of nuclear chill: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/16/japan-nuclear-shutdown-raises-energy-prices\" title=\"\">Japan's plants are currently shuttered</a>, for obvious reasons; new licensing is suspended in the United States; many countries (Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium) are phasing out nuclear power, or have never had it (Ireland, Austria, Norway, Greece, Portugal, Italy and Denmark).</p><p>But what is in it for China? China has been the global nuclear industry's main hope of survival in recent years. It is a newcomer, starting to build its first commercial reactor only in 1985. It now has 16 in operation and a further 26 under construction, and more are planned. Now China hopes to become the world's next big nuclear exporter and sees involvement in a British plant as a key step to gaining credibility in the market.</p><p>This is an ambitious programme, not least on the management side. Most nuclear accidents resulted from human error and today industry experts are worried by China's weak regulatory structure and its unproven capacity to build a safe management culture at such speed. Even in China, post <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\" title=\"\">Fukushima</a>, public anxiety over the nuclear programme has begun to spill out on to the streets: earlier this year, public protests halted the construction of a waste processing plant in Guangdong that the authorities had insisted was perfectly safe.</p><p>Surely we, too, should be asking more questions of a chancellor who appears to think that Chinese money buys him out of the intractable difficulties and uncertain costs of nuclear power? Will British consumers end up paying high energy prices to guarantee a Chinese investor a good return? What future leverage will Chinese investment in British infrastructure give to an emerging power that frequently says it does not accept established global rules? What degree of transparency and accountability can we, as supplicants, enforce on our new partner? What guarantee have we that in depending on Chinese finance, we haven't surrendered more than we bargained for? Perhaps it is not too late to ask.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420263056|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|7943c4fb769fcb9da41cf6e4bb860e42ecf32cd6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Well done, Andrew Tyrie. The chairman of the Treasury select committee is right to demand answers from the Bank of England on how it has come to pass that Chinese banks, usually regarded as some of the world's most impenetrable financial institutions, may soon be allowed to operate in London under a gentle form of regulatory oversight.</p><p>The difference between a bank branch and a bank subsidiary may seem a dry distinction but, in the world of financial regulation, it is critical.</p><p>Branches of foreign-controlled banks can operate with less capital and the lead role in their oversight is taken by regulators in the home country. Banks from the European Economic Area can operate in the UK this way and the privilege is usually only extended to banks from countries, such as the US, where standards of regulation are perceived to be high and where the flow of information is smooth between the Bank of England and its local counterpart.</p><p>Subsidiaries, on the other hand, must operate to UK standards on capital and be subject to normal UK regulatory scrutiny. In the post-crisis world, it had been assumed that the Bank wished to see fewer branches and more subsidiaries. That way the UK financial system ought to be safer, other factors being equal.</p><p>But George Osborne has now said that Chinese banks will be allowed to apply to open branches in the UK. These would be wholesale branches, rather than retail branches taking deposits and savings from the public. Even so, this looks like a huge shift in UK regulatory policy that had not been aired until the chancellor unveiled the news to his (presumably delighted) hosts in China this week.</p><p>Tyrie wants to know whether the Threadneedle Street's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) was leant upon; whether it is happy with the arrangements described by Osborne; whether the PRA's policy on branches and subsidiaries has indeed changed; and whether any changes apply only to China.</p><p>These questions are urgent. The government's current love-in with Beijing will look a dismal policy if the UK is actually whipping up business by giving special treatment to China's state-owned banks special treatment. Yes, it would be jolly nice for the City to be able to trade renminbis to its heart's content â€“ but not if the cost is a watering down of regulatory reforms and the Bank's authority. Tyrie's questions require point-by-point answers.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420183615|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|4ce3c6e0142ce93409f185d77cead08dd95045c5 -->",

        "body":"<p>This week's surprise decision by George Osborne to allow Chinese banks to set up more easily in the UK is being questioned by the Treasury select committee of MPs.</p><p>Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the committee, is seeking assurances that the chancellor did not put too much pressure on the City's regulatory bodies to relax rules to entice Chinese investment banking businesses to set up in London.</p><p>The Conservative MP has written to Andrew Bailey, chief executive of Prudential Regulation Authority, to find out if he was consulted about allowing Chinese banks to operate as branches in the UK rather than as subsidiaries â€“ the latter option bringing tougher oversight by the City regulator.</p><p>Osborne announced the plans this week during two days of talks with his Chinese counterpart, the vice-premier Ma Kai, as part of his goal of attracting more trading of the renminbi in London, already the destination of 41% of global currency trading.</p><p>The report by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Tyrie but now disbanded, had noted that some Chinese banks were moving away from the UK to Luxembourg because of a refusal by the City regulators to allow them to set up as branches in the UK.</p><p>Branches are treated as extensions of the overseas bank. The alternative is to form a subsidiary and meet tough standards on capital and liquidity. Bank of China already operates a branch in the UK.</p><p>Tyrie said in the letter to Bailey, which he also copied to the chancellor: \"I would be grateful for your assurance that the PRA was consulted about this announcement, is content with the arrangement that was proposed, and in particular does not have concerns on prudential grounds.</p><p>\"Clarity is needed about whether conditions have been attached and whether such conditions constitute a change in policy. I would be grateful for an assurance that any change is not specific to a particular country and that you were not put under any due pressure to agree to something about which you may have had concerns.\"</p><p>The cross-party commission, set up in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal, also recommended that the Bank of England governor be given a statutory power to reveal if lobbying to seek rule changes has occurred â€“ although the government did not adopt this proposal.</p><p>Neither the PRA nor the Treasury would comment immediately on Tyrie's letter.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420172435|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|ef0c23283c8db4d5c90f8850c3edbedbe5a44cd6 -->",

        "body":"<p>The announcement that Chinese companies can take a stake in British nuclear plants was hardly a surprise: George Osborne had already told reporters that the UK welcomed Chinese investment in all its infrastructure â€“ citing the sovereign wealth fund CIC's existing investment in Thames Water and Heathrow.</p><p>China has massively <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/806f926e-afc7-11e1-a025-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"\">increased investment in Europe</a> in recent years. One study this spring, by private equity firm A Capital, found that Chinese state-owned companies invested more than $12.6bn (Â£7.8bn) in the continent last year: a year-on-year increase of about 20%. Cash-strapped <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/study-finds-massive-investment-in-europe-by-chinese-state-companies-a-894570.html\" title=\"\">European countries have proved relatively welcoming</a>.</p><p>Involvement in critical infrastructure â€“ and particularly the nuclear sector â€“ is a more delicate issue. Jonathan Fenby, director of the China team at research service Trusted Sources, said: \"The question is whether people in Britain will say, 'Our electricity is being sold to the Chinese and if something happens and we say something we shouldn't, they will turn off the lights.' I think that's pretty unlikely, but nuclear brings a level of sensitivity.\"</p><p>But on the Chinese side, the same concerns â€“ diversifying holdings, gaining technical knowledge and turning a profit â€“ apply. The UK is expected to guarantee a <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304864504579140952002183822\" title=\"\">generous price for nuclear-generated electricity </a>to ensure more plants are built.</p><p>\"All these deals have a commercial logic to them. In this case they will get, they hope, some technological expertise which is what they have wanted for their domestic nuclear programme. Then, if it is a successful investment, that helps them vis-a-vis joint ventures elsewhere in the world or selling on their technology,\" said Fenby.</p><p>China already has 17 nuclear reactors and another 28 plants under way at home, although construction has been held up by a moratorium that was imposed after the Fukushima crisis.</p><p>If firms manage to meet Britain's strict regulatory requirements, it will give them credibility as they seek to sell their technology elsewhere, experts say. The memorandum of understanding also includes training for Chinese technicians in Britain in radioactive waste management.</p><p>Osborne's determination to welcome the Chinese across the board was underscored by his visit to the HQ of telecoms equipment firm Huawei in Shenzhen. Its founder is a former officer with the People's Liberation Army, and despite its insistence that it is not tied to the military or Chinese government, it has faced hostility or outright bans on its involvement in projects in the US, Australia and Canada.</p><p>\"There are some western governments that have blocked Huawei from making investments. Not Britain. Quite the opposite. That is why I was pleased to welcome Huawei's opening of a flagship office in our country in June, and of Â£1.3bn of investment that came with it,\" the chancellor said.</p><p>But while Osborne this week praised Chinese firms as \"very straightforward partners\", others are more wary and say greater openness is crucial.</p><p>The nuclear announcement came on the same day that anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International gave Chinese companies the worst ratings in a survey of the openness of firms in Brics economies. Eight of the 10 worst-performing companies â€“ including Huawei â€“ were Chinese, scoring zero on a scale where 10 indicated the greatest transparency.</p><p>\"Results show that companies from China lag behind in every dimension with an overall score of 20%,\" Transparency said in the report.</p><p>\"Considering their growing influence in markets around the world, this poor performance is of concern.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420291401|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|dd1b8cf7df5909f01cf6626beda249d9d4a13cd1 -->",

        "headline":"Nuclear expert raises concerns about Chinese role in UK's new nuclear plants",
        "body":"<p>One of Britain's leading nuclear engineering consultants has raised serious concerns about the safety implications of handing over some of Britain's nuclear plants to Chinese operators.</p><p>John Large, a government adviser, said he felt uncomfortable with the lack of transparency around the Chinese atomic industry, which has been drafted in to help the UK by George Osborne on the chancellor's trade mission to China. Osborne has given the green light to Chinese nuclear firms taking majority stakes in the UK's next generation of nuclear plants.</p><p>The first deal is likely to be unveiled next week, with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGNPC) taking a minority stake with the main operator, France's EDF, to build the new Hinkley Point C power station in Somerset. No UK firms are involved after Centrica pulled out.</p><p>Large, who has advised the UK government on nuclear issues, said: \"We can see that even with the French operatorship of UK nuclear power stations [through EDF] that there are differences in the regulatory regimes in France and the UK.</p><p>\"But these problems would be much more profound with the Chinese, who like the Russians, are rooted in a government system without independent [safety] regulators,\" he said.</p><p>His warning came as a report from the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International highlighted Chinese firms as some of the most secretive within the world's fastest-growing markets.</p><p>Large said it would be quite easy to supervise a US company working in Britain because they were used to operating under the American safety regime, which is noted for its openness.</p><p>But he said he was very wary of the \"totally non-transparent\" Chinese regulatory system, which left outsiders with almost no idea how it really worked.</p><p>Large feared that the Treasury's enthusiasm for winning and keeping foreign investment might mean pressure being brought to bear on the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation to gloss over problems encountered with a Chinese operator.</p><p>The reaction from Large, who in the past also helped the Russian government raise the stricken nuclear submarine Kursk, comes after Osborne endorsed Chinese firms' purchase of stakes in British reactors, including majority ownership.</p><p>The Treasury said: \"While any initial Chinese stake in a nuclear-power project is likely to be a minority stake, over time stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes.\"</p><p>But it added: \"Any investment from any country has to comply with rigorous regulatory standards for safety and security.\"</p><p>The government is expected to agree a deal over a generous 35-year subsidy regime to enable EDF and CGNPC to proceed with building a new Hinkley C reactor.</p><p>There has always been unease in some quarters about the security issues around inviting China to take a close role in certain industries such as telecoms and power. A leader from the GMB union recently told the Independent it was \"almost Orwellian\" to allow a country like China, which has been linked to allegations of corporate hacking, to be allowed access to highly sensitive energy infrastructure.</p><p>The concerns came as a report showed that China has the least transparent companies operating in the major emerging economies of Brazil, India, Russia and South Africa. In a survey of 75 companies across the Brics by Transparency International, Chinese companies were the least likely to publish financial information and vital details about corporate structure that allows them to be held to account.</p><p>Of 33 Chinese firms surveyed, including Chery Automobile and China National Offshore Oil Corporation, none has made any public statements on outlawing bribery.</p><p>Robert Barrington, executive director of Transparency International, said: \"There is a lack of transparency about some global companies in emerging markets, particularly in China. As they expand, that is a problem because the citizens of the countries in which they are operating will want to know some basic things about them. And indeed we think they have a right to know.\"</p><p>\"Part of the quid pro quo of coming into the international arena is that you have to play by international norms.\"</p><p>Barrington said Osborne had to ensure that Chinese firms operating in the UK met British legal and company standards. \"[Osborne] hasn't sent that message out publicly â€“ I hope he is doing it privately.\"</p><p>â€¢ This article was amended on 18 October 2013 to correct the spelling of the Russian submarine Kursk</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420296488|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|45595ff0291890ec4f42dd785f294ab3e2e3d42c -->",

        "headline":"China's economy grows by 7.8%",
        "body":"<p>China's economy grew 7.8% in the third quarter, its fastest pace this year and in line with expectations, as firmer foreign and domestic demand lifted factory production and retail sales.</p> <p>Yet any optimism from the government figures released on Friday could fade quickly as global demand remains volatile, which was underlined by a surprise fall in exports in September. Efforts at home to engineer slower but more sustainable growth will also weigh on the economy in coming quarters, analysts say.</p> <p>\"The Q3 GDP figure is in line with market expectations but the uncertainty is whether the current recovery is sustainable,\" said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong.</p> <p>\"We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market.\"</p> <p>After three decades of blistering expansion fuelled by exports and investment, Beijing is trying to shift the economic mix so that activity is geared much more to consumption. That means a slowdown from the double-digit growth of previous years.</p> <p>Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the world's second-largest economy to grow 7.8% in the third quarter from a year earlier, picking up from 7.5% in the second quarter and compared with 7.7% in the first. The latest expansion was the strongest since 7.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The data showed that the economy grew 2.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis from the previous quarter.</p> <p>The GDP readings keep China on track to achieve the government's 2013 growth target of 7.5%, stronger than other major economies but still the worst performance for the country in 23 years.</p> <p>Growth in the first nine months of the year was 7.7%, the data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.</p> <p>\"We have confidence in fulfilling the targets set out for economic and social development in 2013,\" Premier Li Keqiang said this month.</p> <p>In other figures released on Friday, factory output in September rose 10.2% from a year earlier, slightly above expectations of 10.1% and slowing down from August's annual pace of 10.4%.</p> <p>Retail sales rose 13.3% from a year earlier, slightly below expectations for an increase of 13.5%.</p> <p>Fixed asset investment, a crucial growth driver, rose in the first nine months of 2013 by 20.2% compared with a year earlier. Analysts had expected a rise of 20.3%.</p> <p>Real estate investment increased 19.7% in the first nine months of the year compared with a year earlier, picking up slightly from 19.3% in the first eight months.</p> <p>The fragility of China's economic revival was underscored last week when data showed September's exports fell 0.3% from a year earlier, in stark contrast to expectations for a 6% rise.</p> <p>Weaker demand in south-east Asia had driven the surprise drop in exports, as fears of possible US monetary policy tightening led investors to retreat from emerging markets, bruising consumer confidence and demand for Chinese goods.</p> <p>With China's economic pick-up so shaky, most economists believe Chinese authorities are likely to stand still on monetary policy in the next year and a half. But at the same time, few believe Beijing would dramatically loosen policy to aid growth, barring a sharp downturn.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420318542|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|a1e3f6e871c26fffae4a2df25c7417078a592651 -->",

He was told to reform import duty and sort out VAT claim-back issues at Heathrow airport.</p><p>Johnson said: \"VAT and import duty â€“ those it seems to me are classically things that can be resolved by growing trade and co-operation between London and China, London and Beijing. We need a proper, thoroughgoing free-trade agreement. If the EU won't do it we can do it on our own.\"</p><p>Johnson's remarks will give succour to Eurosceptic Tory MPs who want more UK trade independence, and they were warmly welcomed by the audience of mainly expat business people.</p><p>It is understood the mayor is not calling for unlimited migration or freedom of movement between the two nations, something he has in the past advocated with Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>Johnson said: \"Free trade would bring greater prosperity in both Britain and China and we should embrace it.</p><p>\"It would mean better access for British projects to Chinese markets, access that would bring huge benefits to London's economy, creating jobs and growth.\"</p><p>Johnson has been in China since Sunday promoting British products and courting Chinese investment in London.</p><p>Last month he called on David Cameron to deliver \"serious and proper and substantive\" reform of the \"intrusive\" EU.</p><p>The prime minister is committed to renegotiating the UK's relationship with Brussels before putting an in/out referendum on the EU before the British public.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420333682|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|f165af963ab2d29bc70eff8e3e3d255fc5cda2ad -->",
