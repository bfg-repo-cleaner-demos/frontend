        "headline":"Marine A's sentence must consider wider social context",
        "body":"<p>The actions of Marine A that led to his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/08/military-royal-navy\" title=\"\">court martial and conviction for the murder of an Afghan prisoner</a> were both shocking and wrong. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/07/military-court-audio-marine-shot-afghan\" title=\"\">From what little the public could hear and see of the evidence</a>, the verdict was correct. Does that mean he should face the maximum sentence or leniency? In my opinion, the latter. It's what we would wish for ourselves – and we sent him to Afghanistan.</p><p>\"War is hell,\" as the American civil war commander General William Tecumseh Sherman once observed. What the forces are asked to do on our behalf remains pretty hellish and must often – always? – scar the survivors physically or mentally for life. That is not to say it is not also fascinating, exhilarating (military memoirs like <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141039268\" title=\"\">The Junior Officers' Reading Club</a> make this abundantly clear) and sometimes very necessary.</p><p>Whether Britain's 12-year war in Afghanistan is necessary is open to debate. But political and military strategy is not the responsibility of a 39-year-old Marine sergeant, even a battle-hardened veteran with experience in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. The backbone of any army, senior non-commissioned officers do what they are told to do to the best of their often considerable ability.</p><p>But anyone who has read war books, let alone experienced conflict first-hand (as I have not), knows that when someone is trying to kill you, fear is a component of the adrenaline rush. Experienced soldiers should know better than to shoot their prisoners, and most don't do so. But it happens in all wars and all forces, including ours.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/28/naples-44-norman-lewis-rereading\" title=\"\">Naples '44</a>, his memoir of being a British intelligence officer in Italy in the second world war, Norman Lewis describes how he had interviewed enough American soldiers to have concluded they had sometimes been ordered to shoot German prisoners, but that plenty of farm boys from Tennessee were troubled by this because they knew it was wrong.</p><p>Not just the Americans, of course. The British army in Iraq is still embroiled in civil and criminal proceedings. Torture and death inflicted on Kenyan prisoners during the brutal Mau Mau uprising in 1950s Kenya is only now coming into full daylight; and the counterinsurgency in Malaya and other retreat-from-empire stories are replete with such incidents.</p><p>Secret files from the second world war – including the alleged torture of elite prisoners for information at the \"London Cage\" in Kensington? – are still under lock and key. One of the charges laid against the notorious publisher Robert Maxwell, a penniless Czech refugee who ended the war with a Military Cross, included the shooting of prisoners. His biographer Tom Bower <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-mystery-of-maxwells-death-469294.html\" title=\"\">quotes him saying as much</a>.</p><p>Of course, Maxwell's \"take no prisoners\" attitude explicitly arose from hearing that his mother and sister had been executed as \"hostages\" by the Nazis in Czechoslovakia. I think we can all follow that, though we probably like to think we would not stoop to the level of Nazis in retaliation. Colonel Tim Collins, of Iraq war fame, sets out how badly the enemy can sometimes behave <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2499079/Dont-sacrifice-man-altar-political-correctness-COLONEL-TIM-COLLINS-says-convicted-Marine-deserves-understanding.html\" title=\"\">in today's Mail</a>, which is campaigning for leniency.</p><p>Collins' military career ended over allegations (later dismissed) that he had pistol-whipped an Iraqi prisoner who had been planning to kill the colonel's Iraqi assistants.</p><p>Clearly discipline and morale in British ranks were damaged by the conflict, for which military and political leaders must accept much blame. It is a hard balancing act to maintain, though I am listening to Radio 4's Thought for the Day as I type and recoil from hints of moral equivalence between us and the German regimes of 1914 or 1939.</p><p>But Marine Sergeant A's war was fought in a local as well as a wider context. Several marines had recently been killed in Helmand. Body parts of killed or maimed colleagues were said to have been hung from trees by the enemy. \"I picked up my mates' brains,\" said one of the other two accused who were acquitted last week at Bulford military court in Wiltshire. Marine A's father had just died too, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2499051/Murder-Marine-acted-character-says-family-Mercy-plea-lovely-lad-traumatised-slaughter-comrades.html\" title=\"\">the Mail reports</a>.</p><p>I'm tempted to liken the killing to what some jurisdictions call \" a crime of passion\" – as mitigation, not an excuse. Perhaps the stress of living and fighting in such a grim environment may also explain the idiocy whereby the murder was filmed on one of the soldier's helmet cameras. The fatal footage was later found by civilian police on a laptop.</p><p>It's not hard to see how the circumstances arose that led to the prosecutions, but as in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/07/sas-sniper-danny-nightingale-appeal\" title=\"\">the case of SAS sergeant Danny Nightingale</a>, convicted of illegal possession of a pistol and ammunition, the disparity between peaceful Wiltshire and Iraq or Helmand is striking.</p><p>Military authorities have their duty to uphold the law, but they are as fallible as civilian prosecutors. Most of us don't know the details – being in the courtroom <em>always </em>matters – but it's odd.</p><p>A case for leniency? Senior soldiers are divided on the point. Major-General Julian Thompson, of Falklands fame, urged a five-year sentence in the Times. General Lord Guthrie, and ex-chief of staff, took the other view – \"murder is murder\" – and urged a tough stance against \"battlefield execution\".</p><p>But there is a wider social context to consider. Society consists of all sorts of trade-offs about things people feel strongly about in opposing directions. They're potentially dangerous to social cohesion and some people are far too careless about stirring things up, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/07/muslim-extremist-fined-for-poppy-burning\" title=\"\">burning poppies on Remembrance Sunday being one recent example by Islamist idiots</a>. It didn't happen this year, fortunately.</p><p>But the immediate background to Marine A's conviction (can the trial have been timed to coincidence with the annual Remembrance celebration of military sacrifice?) included two widely reported incidents that must have been extremely distasteful to many people who could be forgiven for linking all three, however tenuously, in their own minds.</p><p>One was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/08/burqa-fugitive-mohammed-ahmed-mohamed-20-charges\" title=\"\">escape in a burqa from TPim surveillance of Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed</a>, the 27-year-old terrorist suspect. What a chapter of accidents and idiocy, what a gift to rightwing columnists in search of easy copy and a chance (wrongly) to blame Nick Clegg. Mohamed had his passport and computer access; he had broken restrictions imposed on him 20 times; he received training in Somalia. What's more, he is suing the government for breaches of his human rights.</p><p>Hard to beat in the \"you couldn't make it up\" department? Apparently not. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493663/Revealed-Asylum-seeker-given-10-000-flying-lessons-taxpayer-lied-age-cared-child-falsely-claimed-parents-dead-missing.html\" title=\"\">The Mail has been digging into the case of Yonas Admasu Kebede</a>, a failed asylum seeker of Christian heritage from Ethiopia, for whom hard-pressed Newcastle city council has been required by the court of appeal to provide training, board and lodgings to allow him to become a pilot. The facts are disputed, including his age, family circumstances and background (an orphan or the abandoned son of wealthy Ethiopians?), but it is not a story to warm a taxpayer's heart.</p><p>If we are, as we seem to be, lenient, if not lax towards newcomers to whom we have only modest obligations – I put it no stronger – and possibly ambiguous feelings – again, I put it no stronger – then why not leniency towards someone who did a bad thing in very difficult circumstances in the service of the state?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422186994|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|dafeb1982ff4635f84e01f2f5284df6358cc23d3 -->",

        "headline":"Marine A's sentence must consider wider social context",
        "body":"<p>The actions of Marine A that led to his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/08/military-royal-navy\" title=\"\">court martial and conviction for the murder of an Afghan prisoner</a> were both shocking and wrong. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/07/military-court-audio-marine-shot-afghan\" title=\"\">From what little the public could hear and see of the evidence</a>, the verdict was correct. Does that mean he should face the maximum sentence or leniency? In my opinion, the latter. It's what we would wish for ourselves – and we sent him to Afghanistan.</p><p>\"War is hell,\" as the American civil war commander General William Tecumseh Sherman once observed. What the forces are asked to do on our behalf remains pretty hellish and must often – always? – scar the survivors physically or mentally for life. That is not to say it is not also fascinating, exhilarating (military memoirs like <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141039268\" title=\"\">The Junior Officers' Reading Club</a> make this abundantly clear) and sometimes very necessary.</p><p>Whether Britain's 12-year war in Afghanistan is necessary is open to debate. But political and military strategy is not the responsibility of a 39-year-old Marine sergeant, even a battle-hardened veteran with experience in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. The backbone of any army, senior non-commissioned officers do what they are told to do to the best of their often considerable ability.</p><p>But anyone who has read war books, let alone experienced conflict first-hand (as I have not), knows that when someone is trying to kill you, fear is a component of the adrenaline rush. Experienced soldiers should know better than to shoot their prisoners, and most don't do so. But it happens in all wars and all forces, including ours.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/28/naples-44-norman-lewis-rereading\" title=\"\">Naples '44</a>, his memoir of being a British intelligence officer in Italy in the second world war, Norman Lewis describes how he had interviewed enough American soldiers to have concluded they had sometimes been ordered to shoot German prisoners, but that plenty of farm boys from Tennessee were troubled by this because they knew it was wrong.</p><p>Not just the Americans, of course. The British army in Iraq is still embroiled in civil and criminal proceedings. Torture and death inflicted on Kenyan prisoners during the brutal Mau Mau uprising in 1950s Kenya is only now coming into full daylight; and the counterinsurgency in Malaya and other retreat-from-empire stories are replete with such incidents.</p><p>Secret files from the second world war – including the alleged torture of elite prisoners for information at the \"London Cage\" in Kensington? – are still under lock and key. One of the charges laid against the notorious publisher Robert Maxwell, a penniless Czech refugee who ended the war with a Military Cross, included the shooting of prisoners. His biographer Tom Bower <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-mystery-of-maxwells-death-469294.html\" title=\"\">quotes him saying as much</a>.</p><p>Of course, Maxwell's \"take no prisoners\" attitude explicitly arose from hearing that his mother and sister had been executed as \"hostages\" by the Nazis in Czechoslovakia. I think we can all follow that, though we probably like to think we would not stoop to the level of Nazis in retaliation. Colonel Tim Collins, of Iraq war fame, sets out how badly the enemy can sometimes behave <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2499079/Dont-sacrifice-man-altar-political-correctness-COLONEL-TIM-COLLINS-says-convicted-Marine-deserves-understanding.html\" title=\"\">in today's Mail</a>, which is campaigning for leniency.</p><p>Collins' military career ended over allegations (later dismissed) that he had pistol-whipped an Iraqi prisoner who had been planning to kill the colonel's Iraqi assistants.</p><p>Clearly discipline and morale in British ranks were damaged by the conflict, for which military and political leaders must accept much blame. It is a hard balancing act to maintain, though I am listening to Radio 4's Thought for the Day as I type and recoil from hints of moral equivalence between us and the German regimes of 1914 or 1939.</p><p>But Marine Sergeant A's war was fought in a local as well as a wider context. Several marines had recently been killed in Helmand. Body parts of killed or maimed colleagues were said to have been hung from trees by the enemy. \"I picked up my mates' brains,\" said one of the other two accused who were acquitted last week at Bulford military court in Wiltshire. Marine A's father had just died too, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2499051/Murder-Marine-acted-character-says-family-Mercy-plea-lovely-lad-traumatised-slaughter-comrades.html\" title=\"\">the Mail reports</a>.</p><p>I'm tempted to liken the killing to what some jurisdictions call \" a crime of passion\" – as mitigation, not an excuse. Perhaps the stress of living and fighting in such a grim environment may also explain the idiocy whereby the murder was filmed on one of the soldier's helmet cameras. The fatal footage was later found by civilian police on a laptop.</p><p>It's not hard to see how the circumstances arose that led to the prosecutions, but as in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/07/sas-sniper-danny-nightingale-appeal\" title=\"\">the case of SAS sergeant Danny Nightingale</a>, convicted of illegal possession of a pistol and ammunition, the disparity between peaceful Wiltshire and Iraq or Helmand is striking.</p><p>Military authorities have their duty to uphold the law, but they are as fallible as civilian prosecutors. Most of us don't know the details – being in the courtroom <em>always </em>matters – but it's odd.</p><p>A case for leniency? Senior soldiers are divided on the point. Major-General Julian Thompson, of Falklands fame, urged a five-year sentence in the Times. General Lord Guthrie, and ex-chief of staff, took the other view – \"murder is murder\" – and urged a tough stance against \"battlefield execution\".</p><p>But there is a wider social context to consider. Society consists of all sorts of trade-offs about things people feel strongly about in opposing directions. They're potentially dangerous to social cohesion and some people are far too careless about stirring things up, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/07/muslim-extremist-fined-for-poppy-burning\" title=\"\">burning poppies on Remembrance Sunday being one recent example by Islamist idiots</a>. It didn't happen this year, fortunately.</p><p>But the immediate background to Marine A's conviction (can the trial have been timed to coincidence with the annual Remembrance celebration of military sacrifice?) included two widely reported incidents that must have been extremely distasteful to many people who could be forgiven for linking all three, however tenuously, in their own minds.</p><p>One was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/08/burqa-fugitive-mohammed-ahmed-mohamed-20-charges\" title=\"\">escape in a burqa from TPim surveillance of Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed</a>, the 27-year-old terrorist suspect. What a chapter of accidents and idiocy, what a gift to rightwing columnists in search of easy copy and a chance (wrongly) to blame Nick Clegg. Mohamed had his passport and computer access; he had broken restrictions imposed on him 20 times; he received training in Somalia. What's more, he is suing the government for breaches of his human rights.</p><p>Hard to beat in the \"you couldn't make it up\" department? Apparently not. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2493663/Revealed-Asylum-seeker-given-10-000-flying-lessons-taxpayer-lied-age-cared-child-falsely-claimed-parents-dead-missing.html\" title=\"\">The Mail has been digging into the case of Yonas Admasu Kebede</a>, a failed asylum seeker of Christian heritage from Ethiopia, for whom hard-pressed Newcastle city council has been required by the court of appeal to provide training, board and lodgings to allow him to become a pilot. The facts are disputed, including his age, family circumstances and background (an orphan or the abandoned son of wealthy Ethiopians?), but it is not a story to warm a taxpayer's heart.</p><p>If we are, as we seem to be, lenient, if not lax towards newcomers to whom we have only modest obligations – I put it no stronger – and possibly ambiguous feelings – again, I put it no stronger – then why not leniency towards someone who did a bad thing in very difficult circumstances in the service of the state?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422186994|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|dafeb1982ff4635f84e01f2f5284df6358cc23d3 -->",

        "headline":"Military court releases audio of moment marine sergeant shot Afghan",
        "body":"<p>A shocking audio recording of the moment an injured Afghan insurgent is shot by a Royal Marine sergeant was released by a military court yesterday.</p><p>The pistol shot to the helpless man's chest can be clearly heard – followed by the marine telling the man: \"Shuffle off this mortal coil, you cunt,\" and instructing his fellow marines: \"Obviously this doesn't go anywhere, fellas&nbsp;… I've just broken the Geneva convention.\"</p><p>Three marines – who can be identified only as A, B and C – are accused of murdering the man, who had been badly wounded in a helicopter attack, in Helmand in September 2011.</p><p>A is alleged to have fired the fatal shot, while B and C are accused of helping and encouraging him. All three deny murder. The board hearing the court martial retired yesterday to consider its verdicts.</p><p>The incident was captured on a head camera worn by Marine B. The court refused to release the video after the government argued it would be a gift to terrorist recruiters and could prompt \"lone wolves\" to carry out revenge attacks against British soldiers or civilians.</p><p>But the court agreed that the audio recording should be released. It also said that a few <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/interactive/2013/nov/07/still-images-marines-video-shooting-afghan\" title=\"\">still images taken from the video could be published</a> – but not ones showing the insurgent or the moment he was shot.</p><p>During the first audio clip – identified as video <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/audio/2013/nov/07/recording-before-marine-shot-afghan-audio\" title=\"\">clip four</a> during the trial – the marines are roughly dragging the injured insurgent across a field and aiming abuse and laughter at him.</p><p>Marine A can be heard allegedly ordering his colleagues to get the man out of sight of a British observation balloon. Marine C is heard suggesting he shoot him in the head. \"I'll put one in his head, if you want.\" But A replies: \"That'll be too fucking obvious.\"</p><p>The prosecution alleges that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/audio/2013/nov/07/recording-moment-marine-shot-afghan-audio\" title=\"\">clip five</a> shows that the marines waited until the British helicopter that had injured the man had left the scene. Marine C is heard saying: \"Maybe we should pump one in his heart.\" After the shot is fired, Marine B says that if the shot was heard by anyone they should say it was a warning shot. Speaking on the radio, Marine A says: \"He's, er, fully dead now.\"</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/interactive/2013/nov/07/still-images-marines-video-shooting-afghan\" title=\"\">still images give an impression of the area the men were working in</a>. They show the cornfield the man was shot in and the mound he was dragged on to at the side of the field. They also give an idea of how heavily armed and well-equipped the marines were.</p><p>Marine A accepts he shot the man in the chest but claims the insurgent was already dead and he was firing into a corpse out of frustration. Marines B and C deny they encouraged or helped A. Marine B conceded he was prepared to cover up what had happened to help a fellow marine. Marine C claimed his remarks about shooting the man were bravado.</p><p>The court earlier released a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/25/royal-marines-court-martial-video-transcript\" title=\"\">transcript of the video produced by the prosecution</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421889325|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|db31f8ed6ea04ea44bdeddafe20f920be67d2ce9 -->",

        "headline":"In profile: the Royal Marines charged with murdering Afghan insurgent",
        "body":"<h2><strong>Marine A </strong><br /></h2><p>A hugely experienced sergeant in his late 30s with around 15 years' experience in the Royal Marines, who had completed tours of Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was in charge of CP (command post) Omar, Helmand province. He was considered a safe pair of hands by his superiors, and a physically imposing marine who always led from the front. An expert in heavy weapons, including machine guns, he was credited with building good relations with the local population and was friendly with a mullah who lived close to CP Omar. His role in Afghanistan also included taking part in <em>shuras</em> – meetings with community leaders and elders. He shot the insurgent in the chest but said he believed the victim was already dead and he was taking out his anger on a corpse. He has said he felt ashamed at his lack of self-control. He was found guilty of murder.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Marine B</strong> <br /></h2><p>An acting lance corporal in his early 30s at the time of the incident. An articulate university graduate, he joined the marines in his late 20s after a series of less challenging jobs. \"I wanted to test myself and achieve the green beret,\" he said of his reasons for signing up. This was his first overseas deployment. For most of his tour he was based at a command post called Taalander, which was attacked every day by insurgents. Three days before the incident he was moved to Omar. He claimed he was \"stunned\" when A opened fire. He was wearing the head camera – against rules – that captured the footage at the centre of the case. He had seen a colleague's leg hung as a trophy in a tree after a roadside bomb and had to clean up after another suffered fatal head injuries in a grenade attack. He was cleared of murder.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Marine C </strong><br /></h2><p>In his mid-20s, the youngest of the three accused marines and teased as the \"pretty boy\" of the group. Like B, he was on his first overseas deployment. C was usually \"point man\" while on patrol, operating the detector used to hunt for roadside bombs – a hugely pressurised job. Also a qualified sharpshooter, he was based at CP Omar. Considered a joker whose quips were often close to the mark, he was keen for action when he went out to Afghanistan but jaded at the time of the incident and in \"constant fear\".</p><p>He was caught on video suggesting he shoot the prisoner in the head or the heart but claims this was simply bravado. He kept a journal in which he also suggested he wanted to shoot the captive but said the journal was a way of letting off steam. He married after completing his tour of Afghanistan. He was cleared of murder.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421710314|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|1f92d2d7619fb7c6dc27c9cabb61485ae27230e1 -->",

        "body":"<p>An experienced marine sergeant faces a life sentence after a court martial found him guilty of the cold-blooded battlefield <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/23/marines-accused-court-martial-execution-afghan-insurgent\" title=\"\">\"execution\" of a helpless, badly wounded Afghan prisoner</a> – the first time in a generation that a member of the armed forces has been convicted of murder.</p><p>But despite the conviction the officer continues to be afforded anonymity and for the moment can only be identified as Marine A. He will have to be protected during his time in a civilian jail from possible attacks by fellow prisoners who it is feared might seek revenge for the killing.</p><p>Two more junior soldiers, Marines B and C, who were on the same patrol, were acquitted of murdering the captive insurgent and were ordered to return to their unit. The brutal incident had been captured on the head camera of Marine B, but the court has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/28/video-british-soldiers-allegedly-murdering-afghan-prisoner\" title=\"\">refused to release the film</a> for fear of encouraging reprisals. Only the audio of the murder and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/25/royal-marines-court-martial-video-transcript\" title=\"\">transcript of the video</a> was made publicly available.</p><p>In the graphic footage, Marine A leans over and fires into the chest of the bloodied and moaning insurgent with a pistol. He then tells him: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/audio/2013/nov/07/recording-moment-marine-shot-afghan-audio\" title=\"\">There you are, shuffle off this mortal coil</a>, you cunt. It's nothing you wouldn't do to us.\" A few moments later Marine A is picked up telling colleagues: \"Obviously this doesn't go anywhere fellas. I've just broken the Geneva convention.\"</p><p>Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of British troops in Helmand, said the incident would make life more dangerous for troops. \"This murder is a grotesque violation of British forces' longstanding reputation for morality and humanity even in the most desperate battlefield conditions,\" he said. \"Execution of prisoners of war is a crime we associate with Nazi stormtroopers, not Royal Marines.\"</p><p>On the film seen only by the court, the insurgent was dragged roughly from a field after he had been injured in an air strike from a British helicopter. Members of the eight-man patrol are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/audio/2013/nov/07/recording-before-marine-shot-afghan-audio\" title=\"\">heard abusing and laughing at him</a>. Marine C twice suggests shooting him before the man found guilty of murder does so.</p><p>General Sir Mike Jackson, a former head of the army, said: \"Whoever we are, we are subject to the law. The due process of law has taken place.\" But he said it was worth bearing in mind that of the 100,000 troops who had served abroad in the last decade, Marine A was the only one who had committed murder. \"A sense of perspective is called for,\" he added.</p><p>As well as putting the marines under the microscope, the court martial at Bulford in Wiltshire has focused attention on the principle of open justice. The three marines were granted anonymity by the court during the trial because of fears their lives be in danger if their identities were known. At all times they were hidden from the press and public by screens, an arrangement normally only afforded to special forces.</p><p>Judge advocate general Jeff Blackett, who heard the case, eventually agreed with representations from the media, including the Guardian and the prosecution, that they should be named, but the three marines are continuing to fight for their anonymity and the issue will be considered by the court martial appeal court. The Ministry of Defence has made it clear that it believes they should be identified.</p><p>Marine A had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/30/royal-marine-court-martial-ashamed-shooting-afghan\" title=\"\">claimed he thought the man was already dead</a> and was firing into a corpse in frustration. Marines B and C insisted they were shocked when Marine A opened fire and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/31/royal-marine-court-martial-stunned-afghan-prisoner-shooting\" title=\"\">had not helped and encouraged him</a>, as the prosecution argued. Marine A is the first British serviceman or woman to be convicted of murder since paratrooper Lee Clegg was found guilty of shooting dead two teenage joyriders in Belfast 23 years ago. Clegg was cleared on appeal.</p><p>In September 2006, an army corporal, Donald Payne, admitted a war crime connected to the notorious incident in which 26-year-old Iraqi hotel receptionist Baha Mousa died while in custody. But Payne was convicted of inhumane treatment rather than homicide and jailed for a year.</p><p>Defence sources said they knew of nothing similar to Marine A's crime in modern times, certainly since the second world war. The judge advocate general described it as \"novel and new\".</p><p>The marines stood and wore their green berets to hear the verdicts. Their reaction could not be seen because they remained behind their screen. Family members in the body of the court sobbed and held hands as the verdicts were returned by a board – the equivalent of a jury – made up of marine and navy officers.</p><p>Blackett ordered a psychiatric report to be prepared on Marine A before he sets the minimum term he will face. Meanwhile he will be held in custody. The judge told Marines B and C: \"Return to your normal place of duties.\"</p><p>The trial gave a vivid insight into the pressure personnel were under in Afghanistan. They suffered devastating losses during their six-month stint in Helmand in 2011. In one particularly gruesome incident, insurgents hung a British marine's leg in a tree as a trophy after he lost the limb in a bomb blast.</p><p>Marines B and C were on their first overseas tour. The Service Prosecuting Authority, which brought the case, said: \"This was always going to be a complex trial which polarised opinions as to actions on the battlefield.\"</p><p>The Royal Marines, an elite force that celebrates its 350th anniversary next year, apologised. Brigadier Bill Dunham, deputy commandant general, said: \"What we have heard is not consistent with the ethos, values and standards of the Royal Marines. It was a truly shocking and appalling aberration. It should not have happened. It should never happen again.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422051144|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|bb037310867116b095a0139df5c1c8b28fa88d6b -->",

I feel for him as I would my own son who might do something stupid.\"</p> <p>He said accepting an enemy's surrender on the battlefield was \"a very, very dangerous time\", and told the Daily Mail: \"I have no sympathy for the man who was killed but Marine A did the wrong thing by shooting him.</p> <p>\"But I'm not going to stand around bad-mouthing him. I won't condemn him. It is like a member of the family who has broke the law &ndash; you don't reject them, but you support them.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422063998|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|8affe3176128f8a7bcec22f912223b24c1112411 -->",

        "headline":"Royal Marine court martial: ex-defence chief calls for severe penalty",
        "body":"<p>A former head of the armed forces has challenged senior military figures who have called for clemency over the Royal Marine found guilty of killing a Taliban prisoner in Afghanistan. Lord Guthrie told the <em>Observer</em> on Saturday that \"murder is murder\" and the soldier should be punished severely.</p><p>The first chief of the defence staff under new Labour said that British soldiers, even when operating under the pressures of war, should never be considered above the law.</p><p>He added: \"My view is that the military should observe the highest standards, and if some crime is committed, like everybody else they should pay the price. I don't know whether there were any mitigating circumstances, but murder is murder.\"</p><p>The serviceman, known only as Marine A, was convicted on Friday, at the end of a two-week court martial, of murdering the wounded prisoner in Helmand province two years ago.</p><p>Major General Julian Thompson, one of the Royal Marines' most distinguished officers, had earlier said that the unique psychological pressures of war should be taken into account when assessing such cases.</p><p>\"The more times you do tours in that filthy war the more pressure there is on you,\" Thompson said. \"I'm not going to stand around bad-mouthing him. I won't condemn him. It is like a member of the family who has broken the law – you don't reject them, but you support them.\"</p><p>Marine A faces a life sentence.</p><p>However, Thompson, who led 3 Commando Brigade during the Falklands war, said life imprisonment would be too harsh and suggested that a five-year term was more appropriate for a crime committed in the pressure-cooker environment of combat.</p><p>Reports have suggested a number of deaths suffered by Marine A's unit in the months before the murder could have provided a motive for the crime.</p><p>\"The whole story is very regrettable. The court behaved as it should and reached the correct verdict,\" said Guthrie, who was chief of the defence staff between 1997 and 2001.</p><p>David Cameron also joined the debate on Saturday by backing the Royal Marines after a military court convicted the 39-year-old marine of the \"battlefield execution\" of an insurgent. The prime minister said the guilty verdict should not \"besmirch\" the marines' proud history. The incident \"in no way represents the incredible spirit, courage and history of the Royal Marines\", he said.</p><p>It is the first time that a British marine has been convicted of a war crime during the 12-year conflict. Two others, known only as Marines B and C, present during the incident, were acquitted of murder.</p><p>Marine A was convicted after footage emerged of him shooting the insurgent at close range in the centre of his chest. As the man convulsed on the ground, Marine A told him: \"There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you cunt. It's nothing you wouldn't do to us.\"</p><p>He then turned to his colleagues and said: \"Obviously this doesn't go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva convention.\"</p><p>The court heard the marines were on patrol on 15 September 2011 when they found the insurgent lying gravely injured in a field after an attack by an Apache helicopter. Superiors were informed the man had died in the gunship attack, in which 139 30mm anti-tank rounds were fired at him. However, footage of the murder – taken from a camera on the helmet of Marine B – was discovered on a laptop by military police investigating unrelated matters. The court refused to release the film for fear of encouraging reprisals. Only the audio of the murder and a transcript of the video were made publicly available.</p><p>Marine A told the court martial he thought the insurgent was already dead when he shot him, and said he did so out of anger, calling it \"stupid, lack of self-control, momentary lapse in my judgment\". Marine B admitted members of the patrol had lied during interviews to protect their comrade. Marine A was remanded in custody to be sentenced on 6 December. Marines B and C were freed and have returned to normal duties. The issue of identifying Marines A, B and C – as well as two others, named only as Marines D and E, who were also on the patrol – will be determined at an appeal hearing after the judge ruled they should be identified.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422082996|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|12b722fd74e675892973b03695200bc3b9a768ca -->",
