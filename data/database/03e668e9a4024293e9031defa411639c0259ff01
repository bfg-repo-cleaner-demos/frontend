Photograph: Frank Chmura/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>While the UK government welcomes a slowdown in inflation today, in the Czech Republic, central bankers have been worrying about deflation. After the Czech national bank's move last week to weaken the country's crown currency, Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities has been considering whether it is right to think - as US Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke claimed in November 2002 - that a central bank always could and always should use every device it could imagine to prevent a situation where prices fall, conventionally labelled 'deflation'.</p> <p>Lewis was prompted to consider this, he says, after the Czech central bank (CNB) launched crown sales on the open market for the first time in over a decade last Thursday, to weaken the currency and help stem a slowdown in inflation.

Japan has already established a precedent that exchange rate depreciation is fine with the global community if it happens to occur as an unintended consequence of domestic monetary actions. The CNB could hardly find comfort in that, however, since its policy is treating the exchange rate as a target and has involved active intervention on the exchanges to achieve its goal. There is a closer parallel with Switzerland, though the Swiss franc had been appreciating rapidly against the currency of its major trading partner, the euro zone, when the Swiss National Bank decided in September 2011 to cap its rate against the euro at 1.20. The Czech koruna, by contrast, had been fairly stable against the euro for months prior to the CNB's decision. Further, there had been brighter news on the Czech economy, in confidence indices and PMI data, raising doubts in some quarters whether a yet more accommodative monetary policy was needed at all.<br />The CNB justified its policy of fx sales in terms of preventing long-term undershooting of its inflation target. Mr Tomsik, a CNB vice governor, expressed the thinking behind the CNB's move in revealing terms. 'We would be in deflation for a very long period, easily three quarters if not longer, because economic theory shows that it is difficult to crawl out of deflation once you get stuck in it.' It is worth noting that this central banker regards nine months as a 'very long time'. It seems that, for him and his fellow-thinkers, even one month when the consumer price index is lower than in the corresponding month of the previous year is reason for deep concern.</p> <p>Then, there is his appeal to 'economic theory'. To be sure, some textbooks lay it down as indubitable truth that deflation is hard to escape and, as they understand the deflation process, they may be right. But that is not to say that any period when prices happen to fall is to be labelled 'deflationary'. There has, perhaps, been too much focus on Japan's experience, without regard for the special influences affecting that country, in assessing the proper priorities of monetary policy. After all, the USA recorded eight successive months of negative annual CPI inflation in 2009 without identifiable harm.</p> <p>Mr Janacek, a more robust member of the CNB's board, declared prior to last week's policy meeting that he would rather tolerate a few months of moderate 'deflation' than risk shocking the economy with a radical fx policy. We may well suppose the most immediate effect of the fx depreciation will be a rise in Czech import prices and a squeeze on Czech domestic purchasers' spending power. Though consumer prices may not now fall, the CNB's policy risks pushing the Czech economy back into recession. To court that danger simply because US economists of Mr Bernanke's stamp have theoretical notions on how the economy works shows how central bankers are still in awe of old thinking. We shall be watching the Czech experiment closely for the broader implications it might have for monetary management in the advanced economies.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T16:52:28.336Z\">at 4.52pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52824804e4b0312d704c111d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:44:17.715Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK fuel poverty rises and wage growth slows</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>After this morning's news of a significant slowdown in UK inflation there were plenty of commentators quick off the mark in noting that at 2.2%, it is still three times the average pace of wage growth. Now comes a separate report suggesting wage growth fell in recent months and another claiming fuel poverty is up.</p> <p>Data from VocaLink, the company that processes the large number of payments for UK workers, underlines the pressure on earnings. It says that despite recent signs of improvement in the UK economy its latest Take Home Pay Index shows that wage growth has slowed.</p> <p>The monthly index shows that pay growth in FTSE 350 companies fell to 2.2% in the three months to the end of October from 2.4% in the three month to end September.</p> <p>Looking at pay sector by sector, it says: </p> <ul> <li>Services sector take home pay growth slowed slightly year-on-year in the three months to October – down to 2.5% from 2.7% in the three months to September</li> <li>Annual take home pay in the manufacturing sector fell by 0.7% in the three months to October, following several months of slowing growth</li> <li>However the public sector experienced annual take home pay growth at 0.1% for the first time since March 2013.</li> </ul> <p>David Yates, VocaLink's chief executive:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This month’s Take Home Pay Index highlights that across multiple sectors wage growth remains sluggish. While inflation has remained steady for over a year, rising prices of essentials are putting pressure on households and recent increases in domestic gas and electricity bills mean household spending continues to be squeezed.</p> <p>With the pace of wage growth slowing, there may be concerns about the prospect of consumer spending worsening as retailers head toward the crucial Christmas sales period.</p> </blockquote> <p>A separate report from Legal &amp; General suggests 1 in 3 households say they will be in fuel poverty this winter, up 53% on the same period last year. That is based on the government’s definition of paying 10% of income on gas and electricity.</p> <p>Its MoneyMood Survey adds:</p> <blockquote> <p>The number of homes across the UK who say they are “In fuel poverty now or will be in the next three months” is 6.8 million, up 2.4 million on the equivalent figure for 2012 (4.4 million). This is significantly higher than the latest Government estimates of 3.2 million homes in fuel poverty, which is based on 2011 data.</p> <p>In many regions the number of households in fuel poverty is even higher.</p> <p>Two regions have almost 1 in 2 in fuel poverty – in the East Midlands 48% say they are in fuel poverty (up 152%). Similarly in the North East 48% of homes are in fuel poverty (up 140%).</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-94527bc2-b394-40fe-b72a-d417b613cb9f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/12/1384271052091/6bfc3eb1-a934-4cea-afbc-57924a5fd95c-460x242.png\" alt=\"Legal &amp; General MoneyMood Survey \" width=\"460\" height=\"242\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Legal &amp; General MoneyMood Survey shows 1 in 3 households across the country say they will be in fuel poverty this winter.

Troika inspectors have been focusing on lifting the blanket ban on repossessions of Greek properties. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption> </figure> <p>Over in Greece, word is coming through that ahead of this afternoon's meeting, visiting troika inspectors have been focusing on lifting the blanket ban on repossessions of properties in a bid to rejuvenate the market and as <strong>our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith</strong>, says it is a potentially explosive issue.</p> <p>She writes: </p> <blockquote> <p>No subject is quite as neuralgic as that of doing away with the blanket ban on repossessions of properties whose owners owe less than 200,000 euro. In a sign of the mounting tension around the issue, visiting troika inspectors insisted that the prohibition, which is to be in force until 31 December, was the focus of today's talks at the finance ministry. </p> <p>Indicatively, the talks were attended by the heads of Greek banks, the development minister Kostis Hadzidakis, the Justice minister Charalmbos Athanasiou and the finance minister Yannis Stournaras,&nbsp;all of whom are&nbsp;under immense pressure to lift the ban when it effectively ends at the end of the year. The vast majority of non-performing loans are believed to derive from mortgage payers defaulting on their debt with bankers classifying around 30% of borrowers as &quot;strategic defaulters&quot; who can pay but chose not to pay because of other debts they deem more expedient.</p> <p>The ban, passed by a previous socialist government, has in the main been blamed by bankers for the defaults. With lack of liquidity an ever more pressing issue in a market that became lifeless long ago,&nbsp;the troika is pressuring the government to allow banks to auction off homes in the hope it will rejuvenate the Greek property market - one of the first victims of the country's debt crisis. </p> <p>A development ministry official conceded that although the fragile coalition sees the issue as &quot;another red line&quot; - with at least ten MPs resolutely refusing to endorse such a measure in parliament -- the heat was now on for the government to &quot;make a decision by&nbsp;December 15.&quot; </p> <p>&quot;What we are trying to do is protect the poor, vulnerable groups who absolutely cannot lose their home,&quot; he said. &quot;There is enormous pressure for the issue to be settled by the middle of next month.&quot; </p> <p>According to Greece's central bank, first-home owners account for the majority of 100,000 plus mortgages in arrears with officials reporting a leap in numbers in recent months because of a three-year backlog in annual property taxes that property owners have had to pay as part of government efforts to boost revenue.</p> <p>Without a compromise analysts believe prime minister Antonis Samaras' increasingly frail coalition could fall. MPs have said repeatedly they will not allow foreclosures to pass with one saying publicly it will tip the country into civil war.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52823c84e4b0312d704c1117\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:09:34.407Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street lower</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>It is early on in the trading day in the US and for now, the main stock market indices are little changed.

Although the City of London was focusing on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/inflation-fall-welcomed-by-government\">unexpectedly sharp fall in the UK's cost of living</a>, this was merely part of a general trend from Hungary to Portugal and from Italy to Germany. Deflation is already a reality for some of the troubled countries on the fringes of the eurozone area. Others are heading in that direction.</p> <p>For now, that list does not include Britain where the current inflation rate of 2.2% is still (just) above the government target and higher than the eurozone average, which is already 0.7% and likely to fall lower when new figures are out later this week.</p> <p>But the data from the Office for National Statistics is still significant in three material respects. First, it suggests that the cost of living is finally responding to a lack of spending power...</p> <p>The second point to note - as Labour did - is that the gap between price increases and wage increases remains even after the fall in inflation from 2.7% to 2.2%, because average earnings are growing by less than 1% a year...</p> <p>Finally, falling inflation provides a breathing space for the Bank of England.

Sticking with the much <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/inflation-fall-welcomed-by-government\">weaker-than-expected inflation data</a> from the UK, a quick look now at how it is affecting the pound today.</p> <p>Sterling hit a two-month low against the dollar of $1.585 in the wake of the official data this morning as traders were forced to scale back their bets that the Bank of England would have to raise interest rates sooner than it had vowed. There is plenty more news in the pipeline for foreign exchange traders to bet on.</p> <p>Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inflation is now sitting closer to [Bank of England governor Mark] Carney's target of 2%, which will perhaps help ease market expectations for an early rate hike from the Bank of England. We'll hear from Carney and the bank tomorrow – it's an important 24 hours for the pound.</p> </blockquote> <p>For now, the pound stands at $1.5914, having recovered some ground against the dollar since the inflation number. </p> <p>Tomorrow morning sees the latest l<strong>abour market data for the UK at 9.30am</strong>. Once a story of primarily human and political importance, the figures have recently been catapulted into the economic indicator major league. Newly arrived Bank of England governor Mark Carney's forward guidance introduced in August uses a threshold of 7% unemployment, before which poliycmakers say they will not consider raising interest rates (barring various knockouts being triggered - lots more detail on that from the Bank <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx\">here</a>). Unemployment was at 7.7% in <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/october-2013/index.html\">last month's release</a> and economists forecast it to hold there in tomorrow's data. </p> <p>And just an hour after that we get Carney's second <strong>inflation report</strong> at the Bank. The quarterly release contains the Bank's outlook for inflation and growth and is accompanied with a 10.30am press conference. The markets have been quite clearly in disagreement with Carney's forward guidance, choosing to ignore reassurances of how long rates will stay low. It will be interesting to see if the Canadian can convince them to take forward guidance at its word with this latest appearance.</p> <p>Brian Hilliard, economist at Societe Generale in London expects the Bank to &quot;forcefully rebuff calls for early rate increases.&quot;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The central focus of the market will be on the unemployment rate forecasts. It seems very likely that the MPC will predict that the unemployment rate will reach the 7% threshold towards the end of the three year forecast period. If it does so, it will go to great lengths to reiterate that it will only use that as an occasion to reassess the state of the economy. Especially, if it does not make material increases to the inflation forecasts, it will feel able to resist the pressure for early rate increases.</p> <p>Note also recent developments in other markets. The ECB has just cut rates as it is fearful of inflation falling far below target. That indicates a downside growth risk in the euro area, the UK’s largest export market. The Bank will reiterate what that risk means for the UK.

The inspectors were forced to exit the building via an emergency back door entrance when protestors blocked elevators and the front door.

Economists said that while lower inflation was good news for Britain's nascent recovery, there were risks that price pressures could tick higher again in coming months and it would be some time before wage hikes caught up.</p><p></p><p>Here are reactions to the data:</p><p></p><h2>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</h2><p>The larger-than-expected fall in inflation will ease pressures on businesses and consumers, particularly at a time when wages aren't rising at the same rate. However, while we expect inflation to fall further over the next year, this will not be a smooth process. Some of the October declines are likely to be reversed, especially when energy price increases take effect.</p><p>The UK has been more inflation-prone than other major economies. While latest figures show US inflation at 1.2% and eurozone at 0.7%, ours has been above the 2% target for more than four years.</p><p></p><h2>Rob Carnell, economist at ING Financial Markets</h2><p>With the UK inflation report due tomorrow, today's release may take some of the pressure off the Bank of England to substantially alter their previous, and by now, not very credible guidance for a first hike in Bank Rate in mid 2016. Tomorrow's labour market report will also be critical in any change to the policy guidance, and if we see further falls in the unemployment rate, this could trump any improvement in the inflation backdrop suggested by today's figures.</p><p></p><h2>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight</h2><p>The marked dip in inflation to 2.2% in October eases the squeeze on consumers' purchasing power, which is helpful to growth prospects. Nevertheless, the squeeze on consumers' purchasing power remains appreciable given that inflation at 2.2% in October is still running at three times average annual earnings growth of 0.7% in the three months to August. This fuels doubts as to whether consumers will be able, or willing, to keep spending at a decent clip over the coming months. If they do, the concern is that it will be through many of them building up debt, although rising employment is helping matters.</p><p>While earnings growth seems likely to pick up gradually over the coming months, inflation may well hover close to 2.5% for a while, so it could well take to mid-2014 at least before earnings growth finally overtakes consumer price inflation.</p><p></p><h2>Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank</h2><p>Britain is slowly but surely getting past the worst of its troubles. Domestic price pressures are subdued and we do not expect rapid consumer price rises to deal the knock-out blow to the Bank of England's forward guidance.</p><p>Utility price hikes will stop inflation from falling much further in the next few months. But with productivity improving and sterling higher, inflation should fall towards the Bank of England's target through next year easing the squeeze on people's pay. That helps drive our above consensus growth call of 2.6% for 2014. It is not impossible that real wages begin rising again by the middle of next year.</p><p></p><h2>Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics</h2><p>Looking forward, inflation may tick up a touch in November as some of the recent announcements of hefty increases in energy prices start to take effect. But if rumours of government action to reduce energy prices in December's autumn statement are correct, this upward pressure could be short-lived. Meanwhile, underlying pressures are likely to remain subdued in response to weak cost pressures and spare capacity. So there seems little risk of the inflation 'knockout' to forward guidance being triggered anytime soon.</p><p></p><h2>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange providers, World First</h2><p>Sterling has been hit hard by the number as the market looks at three potential outcomes. Firstly, interest rates are likely to remain lower for longer if inflation poses even less of a concern to forward guidance. Secondly, more QE could be used if the Bank believes that inflation has fallen too much. And, finally, how will a lower pound affect trade flows – as exports become cheaper.\"</p><p></p><h2>Andy Scott, associate director at foreign currency specialists HiFX</h2><p></p><p>Sterling fell across the board Tuesday morning following the release of consumer price inflation data for October which showed prices increasing at the slowest pace since September 2012&nbsp;… Whilst in the short term this is slightly sterling negative, it is another positive overall for the economy and the impact on sterling should be fairly short lived.</p><p></p><h2>Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex</h2><p>Inflation is now sitting closer to [Bank of England governor Mark] Carney's target of 2%, which will perhaps help ease market expectations for an early rate hike from the Bank of England. We'll hear from Carney and the bank tomorrow – it's an important 24 hours for the pound.</p><p></p><h2>Treasury spokesperson</h2><p>Inflation has fallen to well below half of its peak of 5.2%. With the help of the ongoing freeze in fuel duty that has kept petrol prices 13 pence per litre lower than they otherwise would have been, petrol prices are now at their lowest level since July 2012.</p><p>Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity. Thanks to the government's long term economic plan, all parts of the economy are growing, the deficit is falling and jobs are being created - and that's the only sustainable way to raise living standards for hardworking families.</p><p></p><h2>Catherine McKinnell, shadow economic secretary to the Treasury</h2><p>This fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but with prices still rising much faster than wages the cost-of-living crisis under David Cameron continues. And with inflation-busting hikes in energy prices in the pipeline families and pensioners will carry on feeling the squeeze.</p><p>Labour will act to help people struggling with the rising cost of living by freezing energy bills until 2017 and make work pay by expanding free childcare for working parents. And to help 24 million people on middle and low incomes we also want to introduce a lower 10p starting rate of tax.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422280690|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|3c7e8833081ac1c5a675ef8cc7311ef46464107f -->",

        "body":"<h2>How pay has fallen behind inflation</h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>UK inflation <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/october-2013/index.html\">fell to 2.2% in October, down from 2.7% the month before</a>, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed today. The ONS state that the &quot;largest contributions to the fall in the rate came from the transport (notably motor fuels) and education (tuition fees) sectors.&quot;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/katieallen\">Katie Allen</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/inflation-fall-welcomed-by-government\">writes today</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Inflation has dropped to its lowest rate in more than a year, catching financial markets offguard and pushing back bets that interest rates in the UK will rise any time soon.</p><p>The rise in the cost of living was just 2.2% in October, down from 2.7% the month before as measured on the consumer price index. That was well below City economists' forecasts for 2.5% and almost back at the Bank of England's government-set target of 2%.</p></blockquote><p>There is more than one method of measuring inflation. Up until recently, we were mostly concerned with the consumer price index (CPI) measure - which is the government's favoured one. In September 2011, when the CPI stood at 5.2%, it had never been higher in recorded history. The CPI is important because it is used for uprating pensions, wages and benefits.</p><p>The second measure is the retail price index (RPI) which has now been dumped as a national statistic (although the ONS will keep publishing it for a while).</p><p>Instead we now have CPIH, which includes owner occupiers' housing costs and RPIJ - the new version of the Retail Prices Index (RPI). If you're interested, the old RPI measure is 2.6% down from 3.2% in September.</p><p>This is how the indexes compare:</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>We have also added in pay data - and you can see how inflation has been racing ahead of average earnings. Even with the falls in previous months, people's wages are not increasing as fast as the cost of living.</p><p>There are some important differences between the two ways the ONS measures inflation. The government prefers the <strong>consumer price index</strong>, which also includes services, housing, electricity, food, and transportation, but the <strong>retail price index</strong> covers more items. The RPI includes housing costs and is used for many pay negotiations and used to be used for pension payments.

The Czech central bank has been selling currency on the open market. Photograph: Frank Chmura/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>While the UK government welcomes a slowdown in inflation today, in the Czech Republic, central bankers have been worrying about deflation. After the Czech national bank's move last week to weaken the country's crown currency, Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities has been considering whether it is right to think - as US Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke claimed in November 2002 - that a central bank always could and always should use every device it could imagine to prevent a situation where prices fall, conventionally labelled 'deflation'.</p> <p>Lewis was prompted to consider this, he says, after the Czech central bank (CNB) launched crown sales on the open market for the first time in over a decade last Thursday, to weaken the currency and help stem a slowdown in inflation.

Japan has already established a precedent that exchange rate depreciation is fine with the global community if it happens to occur as an unintended consequence of domestic monetary actions. The CNB could hardly find comfort in that, however, since its policy is treating the exchange rate as a target and has involved active intervention on the exchanges to achieve its goal. There is a closer parallel with Switzerland, though the Swiss franc had been appreciating rapidly against the currency of its major trading partner, the euro zone, when the Swiss National Bank decided in September 2011 to cap its rate against the euro at 1.20. The Czech koruna, by contrast, had been fairly stable against the euro for months prior to the CNB's decision. Further, there had been brighter news on the Czech economy, in confidence indices and PMI data, raising doubts in some quarters whether a yet more accommodative monetary policy was needed at all.<br />The CNB justified its policy of fx sales in terms of preventing long-term undershooting of its inflation target. Mr Tomsik, a CNB vice governor, expressed the thinking behind the CNB's move in revealing terms. 'We would be in deflation for a very long period, easily three quarters if not longer, because economic theory shows that it is difficult to crawl out of deflation once you get stuck in it.' It is worth noting that this central banker regards nine months as a 'very long time'. It seems that, for him and his fellow-thinkers, even one month when the consumer price index is lower than in the corresponding month of the previous year is reason for deep concern.</p> <p>Then, there is his appeal to 'economic theory'. To be sure, some textbooks lay it down as indubitable truth that deflation is hard to escape and, as they understand the deflation process, they may be right. But that is not to say that any period when prices happen to fall is to be labelled 'deflationary'. There has, perhaps, been too much focus on Japan's experience, without regard for the special influences affecting that country, in assessing the proper priorities of monetary policy. After all, the USA recorded eight successive months of negative annual CPI inflation in 2009 without identifiable harm.</p> <p>Mr Janacek, a more robust member of the CNB's board, declared prior to last week's policy meeting that he would rather tolerate a few months of moderate 'deflation' than risk shocking the economy with a radical fx policy. We may well suppose the most immediate effect of the fx depreciation will be a rise in Czech import prices and a squeeze on Czech domestic purchasers' spending power. Though consumer prices may not now fall, the CNB's policy risks pushing the Czech economy back into recession. To court that danger simply because US economists of Mr Bernanke's stamp have theoretical notions on how the economy works shows how central bankers are still in awe of old thinking. We shall be watching the Czech experiment closely for the broader implications it might have for monetary management in the advanced economies.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T16:52:28.336Z\">at 4.52pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-52824804e4b0312d704c111d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:44:17.715Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK fuel poverty rises and wage growth slows</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>After this morning's news of a significant slowdown in UK inflation there were plenty of commentators quick off the mark in noting that at 2.2%, it is still three times the average pace of wage growth. Now comes a separate report suggesting wage growth fell in recent months and another claiming fuel poverty is up.</p> <p>Data from VocaLink, the company that processes the large number of payments for UK workers, underlines the pressure on earnings. It says that despite recent signs of improvement in the UK economy its latest Take Home Pay Index shows that wage growth has slowed.</p> <p>The monthly index shows that pay growth in FTSE 350 companies fell to 2.2% in the three months to the end of October from 2.4% in the three month to end September.</p> <p>Looking at pay sector by sector, it says: </p> <ul> <li>Services sector take home pay growth slowed slightly year-on-year in the three months to October – down to 2.5% from 2.7% in the three months to September</li> <li>Annual take home pay in the manufacturing sector fell by 0.7% in the three months to October, following several months of slowing growth</li> <li>However the public sector experienced annual take home pay growth at 0.1% for the first time since March 2013.</li> </ul> <p>David Yates, VocaLink's chief executive:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This month’s Take Home Pay Index highlights that across multiple sectors wage growth remains sluggish. While inflation has remained steady for over a year, rising prices of essentials are putting pressure on households and recent increases in domestic gas and electricity bills mean household spending continues to be squeezed.</p> <p>With the pace of wage growth slowing, there may be concerns about the prospect of consumer spending worsening as retailers head toward the crucial Christmas sales period.</p> </blockquote> <p>A separate report from Legal &amp; General suggests 1 in 3 households say they will be in fuel poverty this winter, up 53% on the same period last year. That is based on the government’s definition of paying 10% of income on gas and electricity.</p> <p>Its MoneyMood Survey adds:</p> <blockquote> <p>The number of homes across the UK who say they are “In fuel poverty now or will be in the next three months” is 6.8 million, up 2.4 million on the equivalent figure for 2012 (4.4 million). This is significantly higher than the latest Government estimates of 3.2 million homes in fuel poverty, which is based on 2011 data.</p> <p>In many regions the number of households in fuel poverty is even higher.</p> <p>Two regions have almost 1 in 2 in fuel poverty – in the East Midlands 48% say they are in fuel poverty (up 152%). Similarly in the North East 48% of homes are in fuel poverty (up 140%).</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-94527bc2-b394-40fe-b72a-d417b613cb9f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/12/1384271052091/6bfc3eb1-a934-4cea-afbc-57924a5fd95c-460x242.png\" alt=\"Legal &amp; General MoneyMood Survey \" width=\"460\" height=\"242\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Legal &amp; General MoneyMood Survey shows 1 in 3 households across the country say they will be in fuel poverty this winter.

Troika inspectors have been focusing on lifting the blanket ban on repossessions of Greek properties. Photograph: Alamy</figcaption> </figure> <p>Over in Greece, word is coming through that ahead of this afternoon's meeting, visiting troika inspectors have been focusing on lifting the blanket ban on repossessions of properties in a bid to rejuvenate the market and as <strong>our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith</strong>, says it is a potentially explosive issue.</p> <p>She writes: </p> <blockquote> <p>No subject is quite as neuralgic as that of doing away with the blanket ban on repossessions of properties whose owners owe less than 200,000 euro. In a sign of the mounting tension around the issue, visiting troika inspectors insisted that the prohibition, which is to be in force until 31 December, was the focus of today's talks at the finance ministry. </p> <p>Indicatively, the talks were attended by the heads of Greek banks, the development minister Kostis Hadzidakis, the Justice minister Charalmbos Athanasiou and the finance minister Yannis Stournaras,&nbsp;all of whom are&nbsp;under immense pressure to lift the ban when it effectively ends at the end of the year. The vast majority of non-performing loans are believed to derive from mortgage payers defaulting on their debt with bankers classifying around 30% of borrowers as &quot;strategic defaulters&quot; who can pay but chose not to pay because of other debts they deem more expedient.</p> <p>The ban, passed by a previous socialist government, has in the main been blamed by bankers for the defaults. With lack of liquidity an ever more pressing issue in a market that became lifeless long ago,&nbsp;the troika is pressuring the government to allow banks to auction off homes in the hope it will rejuvenate the Greek property market - one of the first victims of the country's debt crisis. </p> <p>A development ministry official conceded that although the fragile coalition sees the issue as &quot;another red line&quot; - with at least ten MPs resolutely refusing to endorse such a measure in parliament -- the heat was now on for the government to &quot;make a decision by&nbsp;December 15.&quot; </p> <p>&quot;What we are trying to do is protect the poor, vulnerable groups who absolutely cannot lose their home,&quot; he said. &quot;There is enormous pressure for the issue to be settled by the middle of next month.&quot; </p> <p>According to Greece's central bank, first-home owners account for the majority of 100,000 plus mortgages in arrears with officials reporting a leap in numbers in recent months because of a three-year backlog in annual property taxes that property owners have had to pay as part of government efforts to boost revenue.</p> <p>Without a compromise analysts believe prime minister Antonis Samaras' increasingly frail coalition could fall. MPs have said repeatedly they will not allow foreclosures to pass with one saying publicly it will tip the country into civil war.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52823c84e4b0312d704c1117\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T15:09:34.407Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street lower</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>It is early on in the trading day in the US and for now, the main stock market indices are little changed.

Although the City of London was focusing on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/inflation-fall-welcomed-by-government\">unexpectedly sharp fall in the UK's cost of living</a>, this was merely part of a general trend from Hungary to Portugal and from Italy to Germany. Deflation is already a reality for some of the troubled countries on the fringes of the eurozone area. Others are heading in that direction.</p> <p>For now, that list does not include Britain where the current inflation rate of 2.2% is still (just) above the government target and higher than the eurozone average, which is already 0.7% and likely to fall lower when new figures are out later this week.</p> <p>But the data from the Office for National Statistics is still significant in three material respects. First, it suggests that the cost of living is finally responding to a lack of spending power...</p> <p>The second point to note - as Labour did - is that the gap between price increases and wage increases remains even after the fall in inflation from 2.7% to 2.2%, because average earnings are growing by less than 1% a year...</p> <p>Finally, falling inflation provides a breathing space for the Bank of England. As Capital Economics notes, the economy is currently in a sweet spot in which price pressures are abating even though the economy is growing at an annual rate of around 3% a year.</p> <p>Read his full story here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/inflation-fall-spending-power-squeeze-uk\">Inflation fall shows effects of spending power squeeze</a></h2> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52823558e4b0f37bee4ff58c\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T14:20:53.802Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">German Wisemen plump for stronger growth but harsh criticism</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1404f81c-b083-4b88-a99e-5773a6b69e2c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/12/1384266342499/d33e334b-21de-45d1-869e-c9deefdca7b6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The German \" wise=\"\" men\"=\"\" deliver=\"\" their=\"\" annual=\"\" report=\"\" to=\"\" merkel=\"\" on=\"\" wednesday.\"=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The German &quot;wise men&quot; deliver their annual report to Merkel on Wednesday.

Sticking with the much <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/12/inflation-fall-welcomed-by-government\">weaker-than-expected inflation data</a> from the UK, a quick look now at how it is affecting the pound today.</p> <p>Sterling hit a two-month low against the dollar of $1.585 in the wake of the official data this morning as traders were forced to scale back their bets that the Bank of England would have to raise interest rates sooner than it had vowed. There is plenty more news in the pipeline for foreign exchange traders to bet on.</p> <p>Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Inflation is now sitting closer to [Bank of England governor Mark] Carney's target of 2%, which will perhaps help ease market expectations for an early rate hike from the Bank of England. We'll hear from Carney and the bank tomorrow – it's an important 24 hours for the pound.</p> </blockquote> <p>For now, the pound stands at $1.5914, having recovered some ground against the dollar since the inflation number. </p> <p>Tomorrow morning sees the latest l<strong>abour market data for the UK at 9.30am</strong>. Once a story of primarily human and political importance, the figures have recently been catapulted into the economic indicator major league. Newly arrived Bank of England governor Mark Carney's forward guidance introduced in August uses a threshold of 7% unemployment, before which poliycmakers say they will not consider raising interest rates (barring various knockouts being triggered - lots more detail on that from the Bank <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx\">here</a>). Unemployment was at 7.7% in <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/october-2013/index.html\">last month's release</a> and economists forecast it to hold there in tomorrow's data. </p> <p>And just an hour after that we get Carney's second <strong>inflation report</strong> at the Bank. The quarterly release contains the Bank's outlook for inflation and growth and is accompanied with a 10.30am press conference. The markets have been quite clearly in disagreement with Carney's forward guidance, choosing to ignore reassurances of how long rates will stay low. It will be interesting to see if the Canadian can convince them to take forward guidance at its word with this latest appearance.</p> <p>Brian Hilliard, economist at Societe Generale in London expects the Bank to &quot;forcefully rebuff calls for early rate increases.&quot;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The central focus of the market will be on the unemployment rate forecasts. It seems very likely that the MPC will predict that the unemployment rate will reach the 7% threshold towards the end of the three year forecast period. If it does so, it will go to great lengths to reiterate that it will only use that as an occasion to reassess the state of the economy. Especially, if it does not make material increases to the inflation forecasts, it will feel able to resist the pressure for early rate increases.</p> <p>Note also recent developments in other markets. The ECB has just cut rates as it is fearful of inflation falling far below target. That indicates a downside growth risk in the euro area, the UK’s largest export market. The Bank will reiterate what that risk means for the UK. Moreover, there are increasing hints from the Fed that, even once it has started and finished its tapering, it will hold rates unchanged for much longer than previously thought. This is not an international environment that is signalling rate increases.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52822adfe4b0312d704c1114\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-12T13:22:54.093Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Our inflation poll</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Back to UK inflation -- do you think today's drop in the rising cost of living, to 2.2% year-on-year, is sustainable or just temporary?

The inspectors were forced to exit the building via an emergency back door entrance when protestors blocked elevators and the front door.

Others are heading in that direction.</p><p>For now, that list does not include Britain where the current inflation rate of 2.2% is still (just) above the government target and higher than the eurozone average, which is already 0.7% and likely to fall lower when new figures are out later this week.</p><p>But The latest inflation data from the Office for National Statistics is still significant in three material respects. First, it suggests that the cost of living is finally responding to a lack of spending power. Inflation in the UK has proved \"sticky\" – staying high even during the period when the economy was barely growing. In part, that was due to a fall in the value of the pound, which made imports dearer. In part, it was caused by higher-than-inflation increases in \"administered\" prices: cost increases such as rail fares that are set either by the state or by regulators.</p><p>The latest data may help to dispel fears that Britain is somehow hardwired to have above-target inflation whatever the circumstances. Core inflation – which excludes volatile energy prices – is currently 1.7%, its lowest for four years. Companies are finding it hard to make price increases stick in an environment where consumers are seeing their real incomes squeezed year after year.</p><p>Falling inflation matters politically. The second point to note- as Labour did - is that the gap between price rises and wage increases remains even after the fall in inflation from 2.7% to 2.2%, because average earnings are growing by less than 1% a year. But the Bank of England expects pay awards to edge up next year as a growing economy increases the demand for labour. ONS data for producer prices shows that inflationary pressure in the pipeline is weak, so there is a chance that in 2014 downward pressure on the cost of living and a pick up in average earnings will lead to real incomes rising. That would be welcome news for George Osborne, although it remains to be seen whether the increase is big enough to make consumers forget the hard times.</p><p>Finally, falling inflation provides a breathing space for the Bank of England. As Capital Economics notes, the economy is currently in a sweet spot in which price pressures are abating even though the economy is growing at an annual rate of around 3% a year. Under Threadneedle Street's forward guidance, the monetary policy committee will not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate comes down to 7%, unless inflation is forecast to be above 2.5% in 18-24 months' time – survey evidence suggests the public expects higher inflation in the future –or there is price pressure from the housing market that can only be tackled by an increase in the cost of borrowing.</p><p>The Bank will come up with fresh economic  in its quarterly Inflation Report on Wednesdayforecasts today, and that will have a bearing on when the City can expect interest rates to rise. But with inflation coming down, the chances of the Bank moving this side of the election in May 2015 are reduced.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422292281|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|4430313276bb7d848bc63dc6dd4346ed98b58cd1 -->",

        "headline":"Fall in inflation to 2.2% welcomed by government",
        "body":"<p>Inflation has dropped to its lowest rate in more than a year, catching financial markets offguard and scaling back bets that interest rates in the UK will rise any time soon.</p><p>The rise in the cost of living was just 2.2% in October, down from 2.7% in September as measured on the consumer price index (CPI). That was well below City economists' forecasts for 2.5% and almost back at the Bank of England's government-set target of 2%.</p><p>The fall was driven by cheaper fuel prices and less chunky rises in university tuition fees than this time last year, the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/october-2013/stb---consumer-price-indices---october-2013.html\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics (ONS) said</a>. However, economists were quick to warn that with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/12/edf-energy-price-increase\" title=\"\">energy price hikes on the horizon </a>and average wage growth at just a third of inflation, or 0.7%, consumers would continue to suffer major strains on their budgets.</p><p>The government was quick to welcome the news, while experts said the fall, together with a drop in the less volatile core measure of inflation to a four-year low, was good news for the UK's nascent recovery.</p><p>\"The easing in the rate of inflation and underlying price pressures will provide greater scope for monetary policy to be kept looser for longer and thereby helping ensure a sustainable upturn in the economy,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at data specialists Markit.</p><p>\"Lower inflation reduces the risk of the Bank of England having to hike rates earlier than it may otherwise prefer to, allowing policy to focus on stimulating growth rather than warding off rising inflationary pressures.\"</p><p>The surprise drop in inflation pushed the pound down against other currencies, hitting a two-month low against the dollar at $1.585 with traders forced to scale back their bets that the Bank would have to raise interest rates sooner than it had pledged. Inflation was even lower than the Bank itself had been forecasting and policymakers are likely to change their outlook at their quarterly inflation report on Wednesday. .</p><p>Economists said that while energy bill hikes could push inflation back up, it was unlikely inflationary pressures would force the BoE to abandon the path it has set out for low interest rates under recently introduced <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx\" title=\"\">forward guidance</a>. Under that scheme, policymakers said they will not consider raising interest rates from the record low of 0.5% until at least a threshold of 7% unemployment. Unemployment was 7.7% in the latest data.</p><p>\"October's appreciable retreat in inflation will be welcomed by the Bank of England and it seemingly dilutes the risk that the knockout clauses to its forward guidance could be triggered,\" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, adding that the Bank is most likely to start raising interest rates \"in the latter months of 2015\".</p><p>Experts said the Bank would also take reassurance from other measures of inflation that suggested so-called \"pipeline pressures\" from manufacturers' costs were easing as well as the less volatile cost of living indicators.</p><p>Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, eased to 1.7% from 2.2%, the slowest pace since 2009. <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ppi2/producer-price-index/october-2013/index.html\" title=\"\">Factory gate prices rose just 0.8%</a>, also the slowest inflation for four years, according to separate ONS data released this morning.</p><p>The inflation slowdown was welcomed by the Treasury, which is putting the final touches to its latest round of budget measures in early December's autumn statement.</p><p>\"Inflation has fallen to well below half of its 5.2% peak. With the help of the ongoing freeze in fuel duty that has kept petrol prices 13p per litre lower than they otherwise would have been, petrol prices are now at their lowest level since July 2012,\" said the Treasury spokesperson.</p><p>\"Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity. Thanks to the government's long-term economic plan, all parts of the economy are growing, the deficit is falling and jobs are being created.\"</p><p>Catherine McKinnell, Labour's shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, said that with prices still rising much faster than wages \"the cost-of-living crisis under David Cameron continues. And with inflation-busting hikes in energy prices in the pipeline families and pensioners will carry on feeling the squeeze.\"</p><h2>Annual price rises: October 2012-October 2013</h2><p>Food and drink +3.9%<br />Alcoholic drink and tobacco +5.4%<br />Clothing and footwear +1%<br />Housing, water and utilities bills +4.1%<br />Furniture, household equipment and maintenance +1%<br />Health +2.6%<br />Transport  -0.3%<br />Communication +2.7%<br />Recreation and culture +0.7%<br />Education +10.3%<br />Restaurants and Hotels +2.8%</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422273280|2013-11-13T15:47:59Z|63cfc529512c7f7777642eff69ec1092100533bb -->",
