        "body":"<p>What can we do about the seizing-up of social mobility, the yawning attainment gap between rich and poor, and all the other aspects of inequality about which politicians and commentators affect to fret? If you have never adequately understood the effects of post-Thatcher capitalism on inequality and always mistrusted the idea of comprehensive education, the answer is simple enough: rewind the clock to the 1940s, bring back selection at 11, and usher in a new age of exacting meritocracy.</p><p>Indeed, in certain parts of the country where children sit a version of the 11-plus and grammar schools have never gone away, little islands of wonder are allegedly thriving. Just listen to the former Independent columnist <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/mary-ann-sieghart/mary-ann-sieghart-how-to-change-the-shape-of-the-establishment-in-one-generation-7769595.html\" title=\"\">Mary Ann Sieghart, writing last year</a>: &quot;If you are bright but poor and you live in Kent, Essex, Buckinghamshire or Northern Ireland, your parentage doesn't have to dictate your progress. You have nearly the same chance of becoming a cabinet minister, a judge, a newspaper editor or a top rower as your privately educated neighbour. Why is that? Because these areas still have grammar schools, those turbo-chargers of social mobility.&quot;</p><p>Unfortunately, this is rot. Last week the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Sutton Trust educational charity released a report</a> about who exactly goes to England's 164 remaining grammar schools. Though the news was not exactly revelatory, the figures were still striking: 2.7% of their pupils are entitled to free school meals (FSMs) as against 17.5% in other state schools; 13% of entrants to English state–funded grammars come from fee-paying schools, more than double the proportion of 10-year-olds in private education; <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-battle-for-grammar-school-places-children-from-poorer-homes-should-have-free-tuition-for-11plus-8927598.html\" title=\"\">in areas that have stuck with selection</a>, 66% of high-achievers at 11 who are not on FSMs get places at grammars; among those who are entitled to them, the figure is 40%.</p><p>It's clear what is going on. Affluent parents pay for coaching; many go as far as putting their kids in prep schools, in the expectation they will fly through entrance exams for state grammars, and the money will have been well spent. The Sieghart utopia is a fantasy: in Kent, Buckinghamshire, Trafford, Lincolnshire and the rest, a bright child on FSMs is much less likely to make it to a grammar school (and, if the theory holds true, from there to the cabinet room, the inns of court or the Oxford University Boat Club) than more affluent classmates with the same levels of ability. Even in Northern Ireland, where a superficially creditable 7.4% of grammar school kids are on FSMs, that is still far lower than the 19% of all post-primary children entitled to them, and the 28% who take them in non-grammar schools.</p><p>Somewhat disappointingly, the <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/news/news/sutton-trust-prep-schools-provide-four-times-more-grammar/\" title=\"\">Sutton Trust goes along with the idea</a> that grammars are &quot;here to stay&quot;, and suggests improving outreach programmes, funding some pre-test coaching from the public purse, and suchlike. Inevitably its proposals have the look of lipstick on the proverbial pig – because in the context of such jaw-dropping statistics, the point seems incontestable: quite apart from the brutal stupidity of deciding someone's life chances as they finish primary school, as proved by concerns that go <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/news/news/sutton-trust-prep-schools-provide-four-times-more-grammar/\" title=\"\">all the way back to the 1950s</a>, selection has always dovetailed with social segregation.</p><p>None of this, of course, will change the minds of the stubborn hardcore who claim that the return of the 11-plus would solve many of Britain's problems at a stroke. Such great minds as <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2082388/Why-wont-political-party-dare-champion-grammar-schools-I-owe-everything.html\" title=\"\">Michael Portillo</a>, the irksome Conservative MP Graham Brady and even some <a href=\"http://shiftinggrounds.org/2012/06/more-grammar-schools-please-but-open-them-up/\" title=\"\">voices on the left</a> bang on about grammar schools holding the key to some great revival of social mobility – but they're guilty of a misreading of history that would be found out in any undergraduate sociology tutorial.</p><p>Post-1944, we are told, the grammar schools churned out thousands of elevated proletarians, and the economy just happened to have salaried jobs for them. In fact, that great spurt of embourgeoisement happened because of the expansion of white-collar employment and the public sector: the fact that some of the new middle class had waved goodbye to most of their classmates at 11 and gone to get O-level Latin was beside the point.</p><p>The intersection of selection and class goes to the heart of the malign elements of modern education policy more generally (which, in the case of grammars, has lately taken a turn for the worse: thanks to Michael Gove, though no new grammars can open, existing ones are now free to expand). Here the basic point is simple: in a society as unequal as ours, if you carve up schools into one group held up to be excellent, and another acknowledged to be not nearly as good, the wealthy will tend to stampede towards the former, while the less well-off get the scraps – and inequality will either be&nbsp;perpetuated, or made worse.</p><p>The intake of the Labour government's academies contained fewer disadvantaged children than the schools they replaced. Now, the &quot;converter&quot; schools that have separated themselves from local authorities and become academies have been found to have far fewer pupils on FSMs than the national average. Last year it was revealed that three-quarters of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/apr/23/free-schools-deprived-pupils-average\" title=\"\">free schools admitted a lower proportion of pupils on FSMs</a> than registered in their surrounding areas: one, Canary Wharf College in east London, recorded 2% on FSMs as against a local figure of 48%.</p><p>Where such educational novelty has been held at bay, the picture is rather different. In fact, the author of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/academies-increase-divisions-between-the-rich-and-poor-study-finds-segregation-made-worse-by-a-wider-choice-of-schooling-8797105.html\" title=\"\">a recent report submitted to the British Educational Research Association</a> stated: &quot;Segregation by poverty is highest in areas with fewest 'bog standard' schools and lowest in areas with few independent, selective, faith-based, foundation, city technology colleges or academy schools.&quot;</p><p></p><p>In other words, if we really want to narrow the class-based attainment gaps that seem to keep politicians awake at night, we'll have to reverse the entire policy direction of all three main parties. We should stick with orthodox comprehensives, phase out grammars, do the same to faith schools, and promote the good local school over supposed &quot;choice&quot;. And we should do everything in our power to pull parents away from fee-paying places, starting with an end to their charitable status, and an insistence that the intakes of all Russell Group universities should reflect the proportions of school students in state and private education – and, come to think of it, those who've been to comprehensives and grammars. Imagine that.</p><p>I'm not holding my breath, obviously. But, eventually, a principle so self-evident will have to be acknowledged, one way or another. If you overlay increasing differentiation on deep inequality, you end up with privilege: something I rather thought we'd grasped about two-thirds of the way into the last century.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422132256|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|b46627b66e3bf1f93c3fd05506c251f95deb4fd6 -->",

        "body":"<p>What can we do about the seizing-up of social mobility, the yawning attainment gap between rich and poor, and all the other aspects of inequality about which politicians and commentators affect to fret? If you have never adequately understood the effects of post-Thatcher capitalism on inequality and always mistrusted the idea of comprehensive education, the answer is simple enough: rewind the clock to the 1940s, bring back selection at 11, and usher in a new age of exacting meritocracy.</p><p>Indeed, in certain parts of the country where children sit a version of the 11-plus and grammar schools have never gone away, little islands of wonder are allegedly thriving. Just listen to the former Independent columnist <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/mary-ann-sieghart/mary-ann-sieghart-how-to-change-the-shape-of-the-establishment-in-one-generation-7769595.html\" title=\"\">Mary Ann Sieghart, writing last year</a>: &quot;If you are bright but poor and you live in Kent, Essex, Buckinghamshire or Northern Ireland, your parentage doesn't have to dictate your progress. You have nearly the same chance of becoming a cabinet minister, a judge, a newspaper editor or a top rower as your privately educated neighbour. Why is that? Because these areas still have grammar schools, those turbo-chargers of social mobility.&quot;</p><p>Unfortunately, this is rot. Last week the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Sutton Trust educational charity released a report</a> about who exactly goes to England's 164 remaining grammar schools. Though the news was not exactly revelatory, the figures were still striking: 2.7% of their pupils are entitled to free school meals (FSMs) as against 17.5% in other state schools; 13% of entrants to English state–funded grammars come from fee-paying schools, more than double the proportion of 10-year-olds in private education; <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-battle-for-grammar-school-places-children-from-poorer-homes-should-have-free-tuition-for-11plus-8927598.html\" title=\"\">in areas that have stuck with selection</a>, 66% of high-achievers at 11 who are not on FSMs get places at grammars; among those who are entitled to them, the figure is 40%.</p><p>It's clear what is going on. Affluent parents pay for coaching; many go as far as putting their kids in prep schools, in the expectation they will fly through entrance exams for state grammars, and the money will have been well spent. The Sieghart utopia is a fantasy: in Kent, Buckinghamshire, Trafford, Lincolnshire and the rest, a bright child on FSMs is much less likely to make it to a grammar school (and, if the theory holds true, from there to the cabinet room, the inns of court or the Oxford University Boat Club) than more affluent classmates with the same levels of ability. Even in Northern Ireland, where a superficially creditable 7.4% of grammar school kids are on FSMs, that is still far lower than the 19% of all post-primary children entitled to them, and the 28% who take them in non-grammar schools.</p><p>Somewhat disappointingly, the <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/news/news/sutton-trust-prep-schools-provide-four-times-more-grammar/\" title=\"\">Sutton Trust goes along with the idea</a> that grammars are &quot;here to stay&quot;, and suggests improving outreach programmes, funding some pre-test coaching from the public purse, and suchlike. Inevitably its proposals have the look of lipstick on the proverbial pig – because in the context of such jaw-dropping statistics, the point seems incontestable: quite apart from the brutal stupidity of deciding someone's life chances as they finish primary school, as proved by concerns that go <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/news/news/sutton-trust-prep-schools-provide-four-times-more-grammar/\" title=\"\">all the way back to the 1950s</a>, selection has always dovetailed with social segregation.</p><p>None of this, of course, will change the minds of the stubborn hardcore who claim that the return of the 11-plus would solve many of Britain's problems at a stroke. Such great minds as <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2082388/Why-wont-political-party-dare-champion-grammar-schools-I-owe-everything.html\" title=\"\">Michael Portillo</a>, the irksome Conservative MP Graham Brady and even some <a href=\"http://shiftinggrounds.org/2012/06/more-grammar-schools-please-but-open-them-up/\" title=\"\">voices on the left</a> bang on about grammar schools holding the key to some great revival of social mobility – but they're guilty of a misreading of history that would be found out in any undergraduate sociology tutorial.</p><p>Post-1944, we are told, the grammar schools churned out thousands of elevated proletarians, and the economy just happened to have salaried jobs for them. In fact, that great spurt of embourgeoisement happened because of the expansion of white-collar employment and the public sector: the fact that some of the new middle class had waved goodbye to most of their classmates at 11 and gone to get O-level Latin was beside the point.</p><p>The intersection of selection and class goes to the heart of the malign elements of modern education policy more generally (which, in the case of grammars, has lately taken a turn for the worse: thanks to Michael Gove, though no new grammars can open, existing ones are now free to expand). Here the basic point is simple: in a society as unequal as ours, if you carve up schools into one group held up to be excellent, and another acknowledged to be not nearly as good, the wealthy will tend to stampede towards the former, while the less well-off get the scraps – and inequality will either be&nbsp;perpetuated, or made worse.</p><p>The intake of the Labour government's academies contained fewer disadvantaged children than the schools they replaced. Now, the &quot;converter&quot; schools that have separated themselves from local authorities and become academies have been found to have far fewer pupils on FSMs than the national average. Last year it was revealed that three-quarters of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/apr/23/free-schools-deprived-pupils-average\" title=\"\">free schools admitted a lower proportion of pupils on FSMs</a> than registered in their surrounding areas: one, Canary Wharf College in east London, recorded 2% on FSMs as against a local figure of 48%.</p><p>Where such educational novelty has been held at bay, the picture is rather different. In fact, the author of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/academies-increase-divisions-between-the-rich-and-poor-study-finds-segregation-made-worse-by-a-wider-choice-of-schooling-8797105.html\" title=\"\">a recent report submitted to the British Educational Research Association</a> stated: &quot;Segregation by poverty is highest in areas with fewest 'bog standard' schools and lowest in areas with few independent, selective, faith-based, foundation, city technology colleges or academy schools.&quot;</p><p></p><p>In other words, if we really want to narrow the class-based attainment gaps that seem to keep politicians awake at night, we'll have to reverse the entire policy direction of all three main parties. We should stick with orthodox comprehensives, phase out grammars, do the same to faith schools, and promote the good local school over supposed &quot;choice&quot;. And we should do everything in our power to pull parents away from fee-paying places, starting with an end to their charitable status, and an insistence that the intakes of all Russell Group universities should reflect the proportions of school students in state and private education – and, come to think of it, those who've been to comprehensives and grammars. Imagine that.</p><p>I'm not holding my breath, obviously. But, eventually, a principle so self-evident will have to be acknowledged, one way or another. If you overlay increasing differentiation on deep inequality, you end up with privilege: something I rather thought we'd grasped about two-thirds of the way into the last century.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422132256|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|b46627b66e3bf1f93c3fd05506c251f95deb4fd6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Earlier this year the then shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg, made a thoughtful speech about future education policy. Attention inevitably focused on the continuation of parent-promoted schools under Labour, but this obscured two more important points.</p><p>The first was that a Labour government would not favour any one type of school. This would end a presumption that new schools must be academies (or, under the coalition, free schools) that dates back to the Labour Building Schools for the Future programme and means that for the first time in a decade new maintained schools could be opened.</p><p>He also promoted the idea of a level playing field when it came to freedoms and responsibilities so that \"type\" shouldn't matter; all schools would have some flexibility to innovate, but all children would have a basic curriculum entitlement and the right to be taught by a qualified teacher.</p><p>The thorny issue of local authority role and oversight was pushed back on to a review by one of his predecessors, David Blunkett, with a strong endorsement for tougher regulation of admissions.</p><p>You might wonder why this matters since Twigg has now gone. But last month his successor, Tristram Hunt, launched into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/13/tristam-hunt-labour-free-schools\" title=\"Guardian: Tristram Hunt pledges Labour promotion of parent-led academies\">his new role </a>with two interviews widely reported to mark a shift in Labour's policy. I read and listened to them both carefully and can't see much difference between the positions of both men. What I can see are the questions that still need answering.</p><p>Labour has dealt very effectively with the issue of unqualified teachers. Michael Gove is now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/26/michael-gove-tests-trainee-teachers\" title=\"Guardian: Michael Gove unveils tougher tests for trainee teachers\">on the back foot </a>and the coalition divided. But the last few weeks have also demonstrated that in other ways the process of establishing and funding new schools is at best haphazard and at worse failing.</p><p>A whopping <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SuRxq9oejZcJ:www.local.gov.uk/documents/10180/11531/LGA%2BAutumn%2BStatement%2Bsubmission/bf576500-baca-49c3-af41-ae2263241857+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk\" title=\" The LGAs Autumn Statement submission October 2013 \">£1.7bn of capital investment </a>is being spent on DfE-procured new free schools this parliament, but it is predicted that almost a half of all councils will have a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/03/free-schools-open-pupils\" title=\"Guardian:  Warning of dire school places shortage\">shortage of primary places by 2015</a>.</p><p>This is a massive failure of planning that could affect thousands of children. At the same time about a third of so-called \"demand-led\" free schools aren't full. Their revenue funding is based on their predicted roll and should be clawed back if they have places. Does that happen? We may never know.</p><p>Eighteen months ago David Cameron told MPs that per-pupil funding would be available for academies and free schools just as it is for maintained schools. That pledge has never been fulfilled. A growing number of intrepid citizen investigators are trying to do the maths via Freedom of Information requests and individual school accounts, but this really is a mammoth task, not helped by the fact that schools in chains often don't have individual accounts. We can only assume that the government doesn't want people to know how much money they receive.</p><p>Meanwhile, the former head of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/interactive/2013/oct/16/oftsed-report-on-al-madinah-school-derby\" title=\"Ofsted report on Al-Madinah school in Derby\">catastrophically bad</a> Islamic Al-Madinah school in Derby is now about to join another school, this time with <a href=\"http://www.newarkadvertiser.co.uk/articles/news/School-counters-creationism-claims\" title=\"Newark Advertiser: School counters creationism claims\">creationist roots</a>, in Newark, Nottinghamshire, a town with surplus places, where the DfE is simultaneously spending millions rebuilding an improving local academy. The new free school is flush enough with cash to offer pupils a free bike.</p><p></p><p>It would be comical if it weren't so serious that the DfE is still blundering on, driven by a political imperative to get as many free schools as possible open before the next election rather than fulfilling its proper aim of guaranteeing quality and efficient use of public funds. It is also ripe future territory for the opposition.</p><p>The Blunkett review is ostensibly looking at the issue of how local government can fulfil its statutory role of holding all schools to account for quality with so many now contracted to central government. But Labour also needs to reflect on how new schools come into being, who commissions them, the rigour and transparency of the approval process and how they can be funded consistently with their neighbours.</p><p>There are several interesting possibilities. Reassigning the academy contracts from the DfE to local authorities, or even to new regional commissioning bodies, is one. Reviving the original Labour idea of open competitions for new schools is another. This could engage local parents, teachers and pupils in the future design of their school system.</p><p>Either way, it is another opportunity to state that quality matters, that localism and transparency come before reckless ideology and that clear water exists between all the main parties.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421924218|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|c775eff17f1bccb81016f91317af5eb99373faf7 -->",

        "body":"<p>England's 164 grammar schools are four times more likely to admit private school children than those on free school meals, a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has revealed.</p><p>The report, sponsored by the Sutton Trust, found that in selective local authorities, 3% of grammar school entrants were eligible for free school meals. At other state schools, the figure is 17.5%.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, grammar schools were admitting 12.7% of their children from outside the state sector, largely from independent schools, the report said.</p><p>On average, 6% of primary school children are enrolled in a private school nationally.</p><p>The findings, which form part of a larger report, Poor Grammar: Entry into Grammar Schools for disadvantaged pupils in England, indicate that even after allowing for \"a wider range of factors that may depress pupils' academic achievement\", sizeable differences remain between entrance rates.</p><p>England's remaining grammar schools educate 4% of the year-seven pupils in England and are largely concentrated in local authorities such as Kent, Buckinghamshire, Slough and Trafford.</p><p>The report added that on other measures of deprivation, the differences in admission \"extended up the income scale\".</p><p>\"Four per cent of pupils in grammar schools live in the poorest fifth of neighbourhoods, around 21% come from the middle quintile and 34% live in the richest fifth of neighbourhoods,\" it said.</p><p>The chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.ngsa.org.uk/contact.php\" title=\"\">National Grammar Schools Association</a>, Robert McCartney QC, dismissed the report, sayinghe did \"not see anything significant in these conclusions\".</p><p>He said there was \"phenomenal competition\" for the handful of grammar school places and after producing some of the best GCSE and A-level results in the UK, they had become a victim of their own success, which could explain discrepancies in admittance rates.</p><p>\"You get a preponderance of aspirational parents [applying], particularly from the middle classes,\" he said, adding that these families often apply from outside areas where there were no grammar schools, further skewing figures.</p><p>He also criticised the free school meals measure. \"As a yardstick for social deprivation, it is generally recognised as a crude instrument&nbsp;… A number of families, particularly aspirational parents who are not well off, do not apply for free school meals.</p><p>\"The type of parent who applies to grammar school, whether working class, middle-class whatever, are aspirational.</p><p>\"The are parents who … are determined to get the best education possible as they see it, for their children,\" he said.</p><p>\"Many, many parents from deprived areas, including what is generally called the dependency classes, are essentially not particularly interested in any form of academic education. Their interests are directed towards pop culture, sports.\"</p><p>The report's author, Anna Vignoles, said the numbers coming into grammar schools from outside the state sector were \"extremely high\".</p><p>\"Even if you took two identical kids, with similar levels of achievement, and they're both coming from a state school, it's still the case that the the child on free school meals is significantly less likely to get into the grammar school,\" she said.</p><p>The researchers admitted they were \"unable to pin down the exact mechanism for the under-representation of poorer pupils in grammar schools\" but suggested that children from poorer backgrounds might be less likely to apply to a grammar school, or also that private school children received tutoring to boost admittance exam scores.</p><p>Vignoles added that the research team combined measures of both free school meals and local depravation statistics to refine their conclusions.</p><p>\"We are using the two measures, not just the free school meals, and in other work that we've done, those measures do predict family circumstances very well.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421970033|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|89921121c2b1756dfe8e1969e35d96ecda914f65 -->",
