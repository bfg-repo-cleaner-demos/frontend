        "body":"<p>When people discover <a href=\"http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/joseph+d27lacey/meat/10046307/\">I write horror</a>, they usually take a nervous step backwards. Maybe they think I'm going to bury a cleaver in their skull. Maybe they think they'll catch Weirdofreakosis. They'll often say something like: \"So, is your head full of sick, horrible ideas all the time?\"</p><p>Actually, it's not. I'm calm, I'm happy and I hardly ever have nightmares. All my darkness is on the page – where it belongs. In fact, I'm convinced that people who write and read horror are saner and better-adjusted than those who casually dismiss the genre.</p><p>By engaging with horror, we take a journey into every possible fear. We open the closet door, rip the mask from the psycho's face, embrace ghosts and demons, cast ourselves into the hellish chasm of the imagination. We return, not polluted  but cleansed and set free.</p><p>This Halloween, I urge you to peel your fingers from your eyes and face your greatest dread.  If you can survive these books, I promise you'll live happily (and sanely) ever after…</p><h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780586042335/lets-go-play-at-the-adams\" title=\"\">Let's Go Play at the Adams' by Mendal Johnson</a></h2><p>In 1974, Stephen King released his smash hit debut Carrie. The same year, Johnson's far more challenging, non-supernatural horror novel was also published. It's an exploration of the behaviour of children left to their own devices and is utterly harrowing. I've known people weep towards the end of the book. King went on to monumental success and fame, but within two years Johnson was dead.</p><h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444723533/the-bachman-books\" title=\"\">The Long Walk by Stephen King (as Richard Bachman)</a> </h2><p>King's early works – written under the Bachman pseudonym – are my favourites, and this short novel is a classic of that period. Although not published until 1979, it appears King began it long before Carrie. Whatever the case, I was there with the boys of this dystopian tale for every agonising step of their journey.</p><h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780330513005/the-road\" title=\"\">The Road by Cormac McCarthy</a></h2><p>You might want to call this post-apocalyptic fantasy, but The Road is stacked with enough bleak terror to sit proudly in the horror section of any bookshop. It's a simple story of a father and son making a perilous journey in the aftermath of a global cataclysm. But it's really about keeping the light of the world aflicker, even in the darkest times. And, whilst it's disturbing as hell, it's also incredibly beautiful.</p><h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9780330514972/the-ritual\" title=\"\">The Ritual by Adam Nevill</a></h2><p>Nevill is arguably the best British horror author writing today. The Ritual takes us into the wild boreal forests of northern Sweden where four university friends reunite to go hiking. They soon find themselves lost and terrified, stalked by an unknown but malevolent entity. Riveting storytelling that barely lets you catch your breath.</p><h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9780753518106/one\" title=\"\">One by Conrad Williams</a></h2><p>Published in 2009, this earned Williams a British Fantasy award for best novel. It charts the journey of Richard Jane, who walks from Aberdeen to London searching for his son after a cataclysmic cosmic event. Like Nevill, Williams's command of language and use of imagery lifts this novel into the realms of literary fiction. Another example of the sheer joy of terror.</p><h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781471082757/the-function-room-the-kollection\" title=\"\">The Function Room: The Kollection by Matt Leyshon</a></h2><p>It may not be that big but there's still a market for short horror fiction. Many of the genre's brightest stars began their writer's journey by submitting tales to the small presses. This debut collection, published by indie magazine <a href=\"http://morpheustales.wix.com/morpheustales\" title=\"\">Morpheus Tales</a>, showcases a talented newcomer with a firm grasp of all things weird and grim. Accompany Leyshon to Leddenton for a double-handful of the bleakest horrors imaginable. Be warned, though; he might not let you come back.</p><h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9780330515207/the-rats\" title=\"\">The Rats by James Herbert</a></h2><p>I was 10 when I read this; a portal to a new world of shock and gore. I forget how many times I've read it but several of its scenes linger even now, as though they were my own memories. I think it's safe to say that the late James Herbert is responsible for my chosen career. Wherever you are now, Mr H, I salute you.</p><h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/classics/9780141188126/metamorphosis-and-other-stories\" title=\"\">Metamorphosis and other stories by Franz Kafka</a></h2><p>Born in 1883 and largely unpublished in his own lifetime, Kafka became and remains incredibly influential. This collection contains one of the most brutal and disturbing stories I've ever read: <a href=\"http://www.kafka.org/index.php?aid=167\" title=\"\">In the Penal Colony</a>. If you haven't read Kafka yet, you're missing an astonishing talent.</p><h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780857861771/under-the-skin\" title=\"\">Under the Skin by Michel Faber</a></h2><p>Canongate have a knack for picking unusual but brilliant writing. Marketed without the merest mention of the word horror, this novel packs in one terrifying surprise after another. The wonderful thing is that so many people bought and read this incredibly speculative work, probably thinking it was literary fiction. An engaging but utterly creepy book – now set to be adapted for screen – and another coup for Canongate.</p><h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9780330536301/american-psycho\" title=\"\">American Psycho by Brett Easton Ellis</a></h2><p>A meticulous study in sociopathy and a satirical critique of ladder-climbing, materialist culture. It's also cold, grim and nausea-inducing. I read it on a sunny tropical island but never have the grasping fingers of a serial killer felt so close to my throat. A landmark novel encapsulating the madness of late Twentieth Century society.</p><p>… Having picked this top 10, I realise there isn't a single female author among them. The reason is that I simply haven't read enough dark fiction by women. I'm now on the lookout for hard-hitting full length horror from  women for my TBR pile. If you have suggestions, please post them here. I'm starting off with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9780575084353/exquisite-corpse\" title=\"\">Poppy Z Brite's Exquisite Corpse</a> …</p><p><a href=\"http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/joseph+d27lacey/meat/10046307/\">Joseph D'Lacey's novel Meat is published by Oaktree Press, and can be bought here</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421222076|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|3ae0867f9928adfddb3db2dc2c443c3d8b3b4abd -->",
