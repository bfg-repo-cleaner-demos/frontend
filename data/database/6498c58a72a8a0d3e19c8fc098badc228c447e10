        "body":"<p>The Western Sydney Wanderers are undoubtedly a phenomenal sporting story, and they continue to create firsts in the club’s short history. Tomi Juric’s double against Adelaide United on Friday night ensured the Wanderers collected their first ever come-from-behind victory in the A-League. Coach Tony Popovic admitted his surprise when he was told of yet another mini milestone, but it is an even more surprising first that is worth talking about. Before Friday, Western Sydney Wanderers had never won an A-League match without Youssouf Hersi. So what is it about Hersi that is so important to how the Wanderers play?</p> <p><strong>The Numbers</strong></p> <p>In Hersi’s last 20 matches for the club, the Wanderers have won 18 times and drawn twice, and they have never won in his absence. Amazingly, last season, Western Sydney won 17 straight games in which Hersi played. His five goals and 10 assists so far for the club has helped contribute to their incredible run to win the Premiers’ Plate.</p> <p>But, up until Friday night, their failure to win without their Dutch winger was no coincidence. His combination with right full-back Jerome Polenz is one of the A-League’s best, and the Wanderers are not afraid to use it. So much is their right-sided bias in attack, that <a href=\"http://leopoldmethod.com.au/sydney-derby-bragging-rights-go-west/\">last season 65.6% of the Wanderers’ crosses came from the right</a>.</p> <p>Hersi’s importance to the system can be put down to his phenomenal energy. Without the ball, Hersi is a vital cog in Western Sydney’s high press. Not only applying pressure high up the pitch, Hersi also contributes defensively in deeper areas, dropping back to form an almost impenetrable 4-4-2 defensive block. In attack, his intelligent movement and quick acceleration means he is constantly the first outlet for a pass in a counter attack – with his team purposely picking him out wide on the right. The width Hersi provides on the right is essential to the Wanderers’ attack, allowing Mark Bridge, their top scorer last season, to come inside to finish off counter attacking moves.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f0921680-d5d2-4830-9b0c-e6fad7e4d22d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383614563538/2e727cfd-fb3b-4196-a3c8-340c99388cb5-460x250.png\" alt=\"Hersi’s five goals and 10 assists, as well as winning three penalties, makes him essential to the way Western Sydney play.\" width=\"460\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Hersi’s five goals and 10 assists, as well as winning three penalties, makes him essential to the way Western Sydney play. Photograph: /Guardian</figcaption> </figure> <p>In his absence, Tony Popovic has struggled to find a suitable replacement that can combine such enthusiasm in defence and probity on the right hand side of attack. Popovic has tried both Labinot Haliti and Kwabena Appiah-Kubi, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://leopoldmethod.com.au/wanderers-1-1-sydney-fc-faults-show-in-derby-limelight/\">neither has been able to provide a similar attacking threat</a>&nbsp;– so much so, that Western Sydney only scored 0.17 goals per game when Hersi did not feature, compared to 1.8 per game when he did (prior to Friday night).&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Against Adelaide United</strong></p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-478e46b3-40ab-4af9-b069-962bf443bd61\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383614765355/bf8d30d9-22ea-4b86-8456-2487b9062b68-460x338.png\" alt=\"Analysis of Western Sydney Wanderers' right hand side\" width=\"460\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Analysis of Western Sydney Wanderers' right hand side. Photograph: /Guardian</figcaption> </figure> <p>Hersi is clearly very difficult to fully replace, but against Adelaide, Popovic’s decision to start Brendon Santalab and later replace him with Tahj Minniecon allowed Western Sydney to almost match both the defensive and offensive qualities that Hersi offers. Both players defended admirably, but their attacking movements to the right helped the Wanderers maintain width in attack.</p> <p>Whilst Santalab lacked the guile that Hersi offers with the ball at his feet, his work rate was exceptional as he pulled wide in attack. As shown in the graphic above, Santalab most frequently received the ball off an immediate switch of play from Aaron Mooy. Receiving the ball almost on the sideline, Santalab was able to dribble directly toward Adelaide’s left-back Michael Zullo, whilst Polenz overlapped to create a 2 v 1 situation on the right.</p> <p>Santalab looked to create 2 v 1s, but lacked the confidence to repeatedly take on his man, instead playing a pass inside to support or to Polenz. But Minniecon’s introduction with half an hour to go added another spark to the Wanderers’ right-sided attack. By coupling similar movements (drifting wide to receive the ball, before attempting to isolate Michael Zullo) with his pace and technical skills, Minniecon was pivotal to the comeback win.</p> <p>On two occasions, after picking the ball up on the right thanks to two long-range passes from Mooy, Minniecon demonstrated similar attacking variety to Hersi. Firstly, in the 75th minute, Minniecon received possession on the sideline and ran directly at Zullo before whipping in an inch perfect cross to Bridge in the box. Then, just 45 seconds later, he again received the ball wide on the right. The pass from Mooy allowed Minniecon to run at Zullo, cutting inside to get away a dangerous shot on target.</p> <p>In Minniecon, Western Sydney might have found themselves best replacement yet for Hersi. With Santalab providing 60 minutes of hard work, Minniecon was able to intelligently find himself in space on the right and combine that with unpredictability with the ball at his feet. Ideally for the Wanderers, Hersi will shake off his foot injury and remain fit regularly, but should he be unavailable, they now have a suitable foil in Santalab and Minniecon. And also a monkey off their back.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421666849|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|dfdec6e3b74cdbb31cfe9ecdcb19dc81c707e859 -->",

        "body":"<p>New Melbourne coach Kevin Muscat showed he's keen to maintain the attacking principles laid down by his predecessor Ange Postecoglou as the Victory bagged three quick goals in their 3-2 win over Wellington.</p> <p>The scoreline belied Victory's dominance, the home side leading 3-0 thanks to a double from James Troisi and another goal from Archie Thompson before a spirited Phoenix comeback provided late drama.</p> <p>Thompson and Adama Traore exploited the left wing brilliantly for the Victory, with Mitch Nichols and Troisi running rampant through a non-existent Phoenix midfield.</p> <p>It took Victory only nine minutes to find their first goal, with Mark Milligan darting a ball through to Thompson behind the Phoenix back four.</p> <p>Such was the precision, Thompson had time to trap, assess and curl a neat finish past Glenn Moss for his first goal of the season.</p> <p>Victory's forward pressure paid off again 13 minutes later when Andrew Durante's weak header was intercepted by the lurking Troisi who made no mistake from the resulting one-on-one.</p> <p>If the New Zealanders could claim an assist for that attack, they were spectators for Troisi's second.</p> <p>Kostas Barbarouses had the ball on a string before playing in Troisi, who dinked the ball past Moss to make it 3-0 after just 31 minutes.</p> <p>The game won, there was nothing left for Victory to do but attempt to lose it.</p> <p>It was a shock to see Jeremy Brockie in clean possession running towards goal and even more so when he netted after 37 minutes.</p> <p>Victory had a number of chances from set pieces in the second half but couldn't increase their lead, the Phoenix then clawing back the margin to a goal with seven minutes left to play when Paul Ifill pounced on a loose ball.</p> <p>But that was as good as it got for the visitors.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421662357|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1ecc2522532482c716a6f38e388c84b28a8cf72b -->",

        "body":"<h2>Juric: flawed genius or youthful exuberance?</h2> <p>Everyone seems to have grown up knowing a young football prodigy boasting seemingly bankable talents, who somehow never quite makes the grade. Yet level-headed individuals boasting barely above-mediocre talent, seem to be a dime a dozen. Witness Matt Thompson racking up his 300th senior match on the weekend. Tomi Juric, on the other hand, is clearly not a rules kind of guy. That might work had he been playing in the agricultural 1980s NSL (for Sydney Croatia of course) where the winners were often the biggest, wildest and ugliest. Football across the world was a different beast in terms of officiating in those days too. Compare Lionel Messi&rsquo;s almost injury-free career to that of Diego Maradona&rsquo;s who was <a href=\"http://www.thehardtackle.com/2011/tht-rewind-barcelona-vs-athletic-bilbao-1984-diego-maradona-vs-butcher-of-bilbao/\">near-maimed</a> on countless occasions. To those uninitiated in the nuances of Aussie football Juric sounds like a contestant on Eurovision. Some of the behaviour of the <a href=\"http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/football/tomi-juric-could-be-the-next-mark-viduka-archie-thompson-says/story-fnii0fg0-1226684001063\">&lsquo;next Mark Viduka&rsquo;</a> is, however, anything but light family entertainment. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTYujcdZ2-o\">His assault on Brisbane&rsquo;s Luke Brattan</a> in last year&rsquo;s finals series was old-fashioned X-rated fare, and a worthy contender for &lsquo;worst-ever-A-League-tackle-not-to-receive-a red-card&rsquo;. There was the raised studs challenge on Sydney FC&rsquo;s goalkeeper last week that was perhaps worthy of an &lsquo;orange&rsquo;, yet Juric somehow managed to be indignant when cautioned. After a petulant challenge on Adelaide&rsquo;s Isaias Sanchez seemed designed to injury, Juric seemed destined for a second yellow all night. He was saved from a certain red card with referee Jared Gillett who, having been lenient throughout, elected to blow full time a few seconds early rather than dish out a second yellow as Juric recklessly kicked the ball away. On performance alone Juric has a strong case for a Socceroos call-up in a fortnight. If so, expect it to come packaged up with a forthright father-and-son chat from Ange. In the words of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lcOxhH8N3Bo\">Eurovision royalty</a> Juric is &ldquo;living in a powder keg and giving off sparks&rdquo;. </p> <h2>When you&rsquo;re down, your luck is out</h2> <p>What odds would you have got on Melbourne Heart winning at Brisbane Roar? ($5.50, or thereabouts, since you asked). And what odds would you have got on Heart outplaying the in-form Roar in the opening half and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/brisbane-roar-melbourne-heart-match-report%20\">narrowly failing to hit the target on several occasions?</a> (Unsurprisingly there was no market on that). Despite the relatively one-sided first 45 minutes, it came as no surprise when Brisbane went ahead three minutes after the break. Such is the injustice of football, or as Johnny Warren would have said, &ldquo;football is a metaphor for life&rdquo;.</p> <p>The Heart&rsquo;s winless streak outside Melbourne is now at 22 games and counting. So too, Sydney FC had no luck on their trip across the Nullarbor. Perhaps it is a kind of karmic credit thing. They had no savings in the bank after three weeks of abject performances, so had nothing to call on when endeavour was not enough. Sydney FC can, however, take heart from an energetic performance despite their advanced average age not being conducive to an unwelcome mid-afternoon kick-off in Perth&rsquo;s unrelenting sun. Fortunately for the under-pressure Frank Farina he had a ready-made, albeit valid, excuse in a display of &lsquo;assistant-refereeing&rsquo; usually reserved for that Dad crowbarred into running the line for his young son&rsquo;s team on a Saturday morning, who privately doesn&rsquo;t really get &lsquo;soccer&rsquo; but won&rsquo;t admit it given his reputation among the mums for being the all-round sporty type.</p> <h2>Derby-day offers polar opposite experiences</h2> <p>A-League derbies tend to be scrappy low-scoring affairs such with the opening round Melbourne derby a prime example. Or more rarely, they are high-octane encounters that make it hard for Fox Sports News to fit into their requisite 90 seconds packages. Central Coast Mariners&rsquo; trip up the road to Newcastle on Saturday was one-such derby. Near misses, scything tackles, on-field flare-ups, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQTNHhDTC54\">Andy Harper at full thesaurus-reading decibel</a>, goalmouth action aplenty, and a comedic goalkeeper lapse as if honed on the training ground simply to get a run on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYl3Pqm43oo\">Soccer AM</a> or earn<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xkF5SBiorU\"> YouTube</a> hits. Justin Pasfield&rsquo;s cataclysmic attempt to trap the ball will get a run for years to come. It did, however, allow the Mariners to show their trademark resolve and just as some A-League teams seem dead and buried at 2-0 down, Graham Arnold&rsquo;s always seemed likely to recover.</p> <h2>The fans are still coming</h2> <p>October-November has long been perfect time for buoyant crowd numbers and a spike in media coverage. Even the NSL found the post-winter, pre-cricket period fruitful. In this era of little loyalty and short attention spans, the trick is to maintain the interest and continue a steady build. So far that has been the case. This round, excluding Monday&rsquo;s Wellington Phoenix home match, has witnessed the highest-ever minimum crowd for a round (10,613, Perth Glory v Sydney FC) since the A-League expanded to 10 teams. This follows on from a litany of crowd peaks in recent weeks. The opening round Melbourne derby attracted 45,202 fans &ndash; the second highest Australian domestic crowd outside a finals match &ndash; and helped pushed the round aggregate to a new high. Round two witnessed the largest Hindmarsh Stadium league crowd ever (I am not yet ready to call the venue anything else, regardless of how decent a brew the sponsors may make). Last week&rsquo;s 40,388 was the biggest ever for a league game in NSW, aside from finals. However, as wonderful as the Wanderers crowd numbers are, it seems there is clearly some logistical work still to be done on the distribution of tickets. Though <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/packed-mentality-wanderers-aim-for-sellout-season-at-home-20131030-2whh8.html\">only a handful of tickets</a> were available the day before the game and a sell-out predicted, the crowd number barely (16,279) barely exceeded 80% of Parramatta Stadium&rsquo;s official <a href=\"http://www.pirtekstadium.com/media/stadium-information\">20,741</a> capacity. An <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viagogo\">exchange system</a> for members&rsquo; tickets has been working successfully for some of Europe&rsquo;s biggest clubs for several years.</p> <h2>Muscat, a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing?</h2> <p>There was a time when it seemed illegal to run newspaper copy on the new Melbourne Victory coach, Kevin Muscat, without the words &lsquo;<a href=\"http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolverhampton-wanderers-nostalgia-now-man-5837006\">most hated man in football&rsquo;</a>. His crimes were <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/24/1077594824929.html\">many</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSjr54z-vuY\">then some</a>. Thankfully the ghost of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhytfYBMKMw\">Christophe Dugarry&rsquo;s knee</a> didn&rsquo;t want payback when the Socceroos hit Paris recently. What chance then that Musky would be given the keys to Ange Postecoglou&rsquo;s Tiki-taka Academy. Much interest will now focus on whether Victory maintain the Postecoglou method, or start to diverge down different paths. One fancies that the Victory&rsquo;s prospects for the title &ndash; and many tipped them for championship glory this season &ndash; are at a crossroads. Adding an extra layer of intrigue is that his full-time coaching debut opens with career mentor Ernie Merrick on the opposition bench. Now making an early impression at the Phoenix, it was Merrick who identified Muscat as the Victory heartbeat way back when the A-League was still a fresh white canvas. Incredibly, the <a href=\"http://www.goal.com/en-au/news/4021/a-league/2013/11/01/4372336/merrick-backs-outstanding-muscat-to-thrive-at-victory\">partnership stretches back a quarter of a century</a> when outer suburban Melbourne NSL outfit Sunshine George Cross were coached by a Scottish-lilting man with a <a href=\"http://www.sunshinegeorgecross.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=3091\">Tintin-esque baby face</a>, while a <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/search?q=ernie+merrick+sunshine&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dyt2UrznEsSmlQWwxoDgDw&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1093&amp;bih=470#q=kevin+muscat+sunshine&amp;tbm=isch&amp;facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=YyOzLSlyZZmd5M%3A%3BJQ9bBw7ciQf40M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.sunshinegeorgecross.com%252Fgallery2%252Fmain.php%253Fg2_view%253Dcore.DownloadItem%2526g2_itemId%253D3115%2526g2_serialNumber%253D2%3Bhttp\">teenage full-back</a> was filled with braggadocio and a poor-man&rsquo;s mullet (can there be a rich-man&rsquo;s mullet?) inspired by the city&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnejLmQGYhg\">synth acts of the era</a>. Them were the days. Or maybe not.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421552058|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|84be5d1e5de7709222c8b72be326a2f767491a35 -->",

        "body":"<p>A depleted Brisbane Roar again reduced Melbourne Heart to A-League road kill in their 3-0 Suncorp Stadium win on Sunday.</p> <p>Henrique's stunning brace &ndash; backed by captain Matt Smith's 77th minute volley &ndash; ensured an injury-hit Roar moved back to the top of the ladder with their third win in four games. It was another painful afternoon for the visitors though, who have now failed to win away for 16 games.</p> <p>Brisbane had to cope with an injury list that included Shane Stefanutto (hamstring), Besart Berisha (hamstring), Liam Miller (calf), George Lambadaridis (knee) and Kofi Danning (knee).</p> <p>Brisbane's German playmaker Thomas Broich also threw a scare in the Roar camp when he appeared to injure his achilles in the warm-up but took his place in the starting line-up.</p> <p>However, Heart did not look like a side who had not won away since New Year's Eve 2011 as they came out swinging. Someone had to stand up for Brisbane &ndash; and Henrique was the star.</p> <p>Whatever Roar coach Mike Mulvey said at half-time worked as a reenergised Brisbane emerged in the second half and finally opened the scoring through Henrique's 48th minute strike.</p> <p>Henrique had a double by the 65th minute, pouncing when Heart keeper Andrew Redmayne deflected Dimitri Petratos's full-blooded effort.</p> <p>Smith brought the 15,011-strong crowd to full voice when he latched onto a clever Matt McKay cross in the 77th minute.</p> <p>The Heart sorely missed the likes of Harry Kewell as the visitors squandered chance after chance, most notably Iain Ramsay's sixth minute attempt from a pinpoint Andrea Migliorini cross.</p> <p>It was an unhappy homecoming for Massimo Murdocca who played his first Suncorp Stadium game since switching to the Heart after eight seasons at Brisbane.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421548308|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|70b9f19f664767718c37bac52b06ac0e8e703d8c -->",

        "body":"<p>The Newcastle Jets broke their goal-scoring drought but remain without a win after four rounds of the A-League following a 2-2 draw with defending champions Central Coast Mariners at Hunter Stadium.</p> <p>In front of a crowd of 13,744, defender Scott Neville ended the Jets' barren streak at 457 minutes when he was on the spot to tap home a blocked Adam Taggart shot in the 51st minute.</p> <p>The Jets went two goals up five minutes later through an own goal in embarrassing circumstances for the Mariners. Goalkeeper Justin Pasfield missed a back-pass which just crossed the line before he could clear it under pressure from Taggart.</p> <p>The Mariners were back in the contest in the 64th minute via a penalty after teenage Jets defender Connor Chapman hand-balled a cross from Joshua Rose. Marcos Flores scored from the spot but was forced to retake it after team-mates encroached on the area early. He made no mistake with the second attempt.</p> <p>The visitors then equalised in the 80th minute when Mile Sterjovski found an open goal after a mis-hit Flores shot rebounded to him off the crossbar.</p> <p>The result leaves the Jets on three points and the Mariners on six.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421501027|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|e8d2bbba42d12459e94c3fa7c3e9af430c444a27 -->",

        "body":"<p>Perth Glory grabbed a 1-0 win over under-fire Frank Farina's Sydney FC but only because of a botched offside call that led to a penalty.</p> <p>Sydney came to Perth desperate for points following disappointing losses to the Brisbane Roar and Western Sydney Wanderers, and more than held their own against the Glory in the warm afternoon sun, but the call in the opening minutes was the difference.</p> <p>Glory attacker Ryo Nagai was clearly offside attempting to run onto a good pass from Jamie MacLaren which would have left him one-on-one with Sydney goalkeeper Vedran Janjetovic. When the offside call wasn't given, Janjetovic cannoned into the back of Nagai and caught him high, and the penalty was given.</p> <p>Steve McGarry coolly slotted home the penalty to give Perth the lead and the score would stay at 1-0 for the rest of the afternoon.</p> <p>The Sky Blues had the better of the opportunities for the remainder of the match after conceding with Marc Warren taking a shot that almost curled into the top corner, Nicky Carle having several opportunities on goal as did Richard Garcia.</p> <p>Glory goalkeeper Danny Vukovic was outstanding in keeping Sydney from scoring.</p> <p>Even the introduction of striker Shane Smeltz didn't see Perth create any realistic goal scoring chances in the dying stages but the home side got the job done to have won two on the trot at home while the pressure continues to mount on Sydney and coach Frank Farina.</p> <p>Alessandro Del Piero came back from injury for Sydney off the bench in the 62nd minute to replace Carle, who had an outstanding creative match for the Sky Blues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421498502|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|e8006d166a7583b5dc510741083cb8689b625dd4 -->",

        "body":"<p>Two goals from Tomi Juric sealed a 2-1 win over Adelaide United in their A-League clash at Pirtek Stadium.</p> <p>Marcelo Carrusca broke the deadlock in the 54th minute for the visitors before Juric hurt his former club with an equaliser just six minutes later and then bagged the vital goal in the 80th minute.</p> <p>The return of striker Jeronimo Neumann and midfielder Carrusca from injury proved vital for the Reds with the Argentinians imports combining to open the scoring.</p> <p>But while the visitors had a decent share of possession, the well-structured Wanderers were mostly able to nullify any threat as Adelaide largely lacked any real spark up front.</p> <p>It took until the 40th minute for Wanderers goalkeeper Ante Covic to make his first save when Sergio Cirio got his head to a Carrusca ball into the box.</p> <p>Western Sydney, on the other hand, looked dangerous from the outset. It took just 35 seconds for the hosts to have their first shot when a Shinji Ono free-kick found Nikolai Topor-Stanley in the box, his ensuing header putting Reds gloveman Eugene Galekovic straight to work.</p> <p>And the chances kept coming for the Wanderers with striker Juric forcing another save from Galekovic in the 20th minute - the rebound going only as far as fellow new recruit Brendon Santalab who shot just wide.</p> <p>Juric finally broke through in the 60th minute for his second goal of the season, getting past former Wanderer Tarek Elrich and his superb strike was too good for Galekovic.</p> <p>Ono was perfectly set up by Italian Iacopo La Rocca to snatch a winner with just over 10 minutes remaining, but the Japanese star sent his shot high.</p> <p>Instead it was Juric who put the game beyond doubt soon after, heading the ball home off a perfect cross from German Jerome Polenz to send the crowd into raptures.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421443987|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|64f1deffc9ab394d479fc07168492b0b618d98f0 -->",

        "body":"<h2><strong>Roar to bounce back</strong></h2> <p>After suffering their first defeat of the season last week &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/25/melbourne-victory-brisbane-roar-a-league\">an away loss to Melbourne Victory</a> &ndash; ladder-leaders Brisbane Roar will be particularly keen to return home on Sunday and get back to winning ways. This doesn&rsquo;t augur well for the Heart, in the same way the appearance of a man carrying a chainsaw and wearing a mask made from human skin doesn&rsquo;t augur well for the general health of the young college kid with whom he&rsquo;s sharing a cinematic moment. Not only do the Heart seem incapable of winning away from the comfort of their attractive home stadium (or winning <em>anywhere </em>for that matter &hellip; it&rsquo;s eight games and counting), they will be without their backline muscle, centre-back Patrick Kisnorbo, so far one of their leading lights. And while Harry Kewell has returned to training, he&rsquo;s no sure thing. Some athletes seem to be made of iron and are rarely injured. Kewell is not one of those players, so his partnership with Michael Mifsud &ndash; which the Heart hope will be as complementary as bacon and eggs, as Jeeves and Wooster &ndash; may need to wait another week. The Roar &ndash; who were unlucky to get nothing out of last week&rsquo;s match &ndash; are not without their own worries. Besart Berisha is still out (which reduces their ability to apply a knock-out blow, for all their setting up), so is Liam Miller, and now Shane Stefanutto is looking wobbly after limping out of what coach Mike Mulvey calls the Roar&rsquo;s &ldquo;tribal&rdquo; conditioning sessions. Still, the Roar have Matt McKay, Thomas Broich, who&rsquo;s in sublime form, and a continually improving Ivan Franjic, and you&rsquo;d expect them to dominate proceedings.</p> <h2>&nbsp;<strong>Secrets and lies</strong></h2> <p>Just as we&rsquo;re pretending to be shocked at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/31/abbott-assurance-on-australian-agencies\">the news that Australian spies have been eavesdropping on our neighbours</a> (have spies no scruples?!), we&rsquo;re told that former Western Sydney Wanderer now Adelaide defender Tarek Elrich is prepared to <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/football/adelaide-defender-tarek-elrich-to-reveal-former-team-western-sydneys-secrets/story-fni2fq2r-1226749980014\">share anything he can about his former club to give United an edge when the clubs meet on Friday night</a>. But what could be worth sharing, we wonder, considering the Wanderers&rsquo; modus operandi is apparent to anyone who&rsquo;s ever watched their matches (they sit deep, defend stoutly and have a lightning transition)? Maybe it&rsquo;s just dressing room secrets the Wanderers should be worried about. Imagine if it comes out that Jerome Polenz likes small, fuel-efficient cars? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/01/my-little-pony-bronies-rebels\">Or that Shinji Ono is a brony?</a> Such embarrassing revelations could destabilise the imposing edifice that is being built out Parramatta way. But unless Elrich&rsquo;s information is as classified as that, Adelaide will have to destabilise the Wanderers by more conventional means, by beating them on their home patch, by now the most imposing home ground in the country in any sport. Even disregarding the fact that the past two matches between these teams have been won 6-1 and 4-2 by the Wanderers, and that Ono is gaining fitness and finesse, it&rsquo;s a mighty challenge. Tony Popovich&rsquo;s men seem to be hitting their straps just as Adelaide continue to experience the difficulties in transitioning to a new style. As a Jeronimo-less United discovered last week &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not a top secret revelation &ndash; all the possession in the world means little if you can&rsquo;t put the ball in the net.</p> <h2><strong>A tale of two cities</strong></h2> <p>The mood in the Perth and Sydney camps must be quite different ahead of their meeting on Saturday. Perth had their first win last week and they&rsquo;ll be pleased to be back at the renovated home stadium where the turf and the blue sky work so well off each other. In another boost, they may even have the A-League&rsquo;s all-time leading scorer Shane Smeltz back from injury. Just what Sydney need. Sydney, meantime, after back-to-back losses, are reeling. Their coach Frank Farina is under fire and accused of not having imposed a meaningful, or least coherent, style for his team. The Sky Blues are lampooned for being a one-player team (it was 0-0 against the Roar when Alessandro Del Piero went off injured in round two, and he didn&rsquo;t play last week), and the club itself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/25/the-sydney-derby-and-the-battle-of-the-west\">has been painted as one without a discernible culture</a> &ndash; that is, it&rsquo;s all shine and no substance, which is just the kind of barb Sydney, as a city, is used to copping. It&rsquo;s almost backs to the wall time. How will Sydney respond? Fight or drop into the foetal position?</p> <h2><strong>Daniel-san versus Mr Miyagi</strong></h2> <p>In his first match as head coach of the Melbourne Victory on Monday, Kevin Muscat will face his old mentor, ex-Victory coach Ernie Merrick, now with Wellington Phoenix. It was Merrick who appointed Muscat captain for Victory&rsquo;s two A-League winning seasons and, long before that, Merrick who drafted Muscat into the seniors at Sunshine George Cross when the young man had hair and could only dream of becoming one of world football&rsquo;s most feared and loathed defenders. Now they face off as coaches for the first time. While they will no doubt know much about each other&rsquo;s tactical and defensive predilections (Merrick is unlikely to be thrown by Muscat&rsquo;s waxing on or waxing off formations, and Muscat will know to be wary of Merrick&rsquo;s favourite move, &lsquo;Give it to Carlos [Hernandez]&rsquo;) Muscat is unlikely to be distracted by the presence of his former coach. He&rsquo;ll be too concerned with continuing Ange Postecoglou&rsquo;s good work, which has given the Victory some nice momentum and drawn career best form out of the likes of Mitch Nichols, who was a thorn in the Roar&rsquo;s side last week. No doubt Muscat will have his own ideas, philosophy and style to impart, but he&rsquo;s smart enough to know that these will need to be implemented slowly. So his first manner of business &ndash; aside from deciding whether to re-inject the previously suspended Pablo Contreras into the team or stick with Adrian Leijer and Nick Ansell &ndash; will be to keep Victory on an even keel. For now the rest should take care of itself.</p> <h2><strong>Heskey&rsquo;s influence</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ1AaZWB0Tc\">Even in his pomp</a>, Newcastle&rsquo;s Emile Heskey was neither a prolific goalscorer, or even a reliable one. While the strapping former England and Liverpool striker could always be counted on to hit the ball hard, too often he&rsquo;d hit it high, too. This tendency would be helpful if football goals were situated in the top row of the stands &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U6OjDZTiZE\">or, say, on the back of freight trains atop high rail bridges</a> &ndash; but not so helpful when they&rsquo;re rooted to the pitch. That, of course, is a cruel assessment, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ynCj8VzIsw&amp;list=TLMkGupSsqhBdr3KcfBoE7puKGiYY81YFJ\">just as this is a gratuitously cruel link</a>, for Heskey has scored some beauties in his time, and last season scored a very respectable nine goals for Newcastle. But those expecting him, after a long-layoff, to start bulging the net when he makes his long-awaited season debut for Newcastle against the Central Coast on Sunday may be disappointed. What Heskey <em>should</em> do, however, is give Newcastle &ndash; who have thus far failed to find the net in 270 minutes of football this season &ndash; more attacking edge. As a genuine target man with the size and shoulders of a piano remover, Heskey can hold the ball up, attract defenders like a picnic does flies, and create space for others. A striker will always be judged by the goals he scores but it&rsquo;s not the only measure of his worth. Heskey should at least give the Jets a mighty lift this weekend. They&rsquo;ll need it.</p> <h2>Round four</h2> <p><strong>Friday: </strong>Western Sydney Wanderers v Adelaide United, Pirtek Stadium, Parramatta</p> <p><strong>Saturday:</strong> Perth Glory v Sydney FC, nib Stadium, Perth</p> <p>Newcastle Jets v Central Coast Mariners, Hunter Stadium</p> <p><strong>Sunday: </strong>Brisbane Roar v Melbourne Heart, Suncorp Stadium</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421360164|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|701c130e7a7d4566ebc6d5a9bbb906c0f56a9cb0 -->",

Muscat also started his coaching apprenticeship under Merrick, as a playing assistant during the tail end of his playing career.</p> <p>The two-season deal includes the current season, but Victory chairman Anthony Di Pietro said the club was confident Muscat would be in the job long-term.</p> <p>\"As head coach, it's not about being a favourite son, it's about being a father figure,\" Di Pietro said. \"And we've given him the opportunity to write that [history] and we look forward to that and hope that this is a long-term relationship.</p> <p>\"In fact, dare I say, I hope he's in contention for the next Socceroos job, that would be a demonstration of what has been achieved.\"</p> <p>Muscat said he had learnt a great deal from Postecoglou and wouldn't be straying far from his predecessor's path.</p> <p>\"One thing's for sure, over the last 18 months the football team now has an identity,\" he said. \"There's a certain DNA that's expected from Melbourne Victory when they perform now. My ego doesn't tell me that I need to fracture what's happened in the last 18 months and rebuild it.\"</p> <p>He said the club was capable of claiming the championship in his first season in charge.</p> <p>Di Pietro said the club hadn't considered any other candidates and continuing what had been built under Postecoglou was important.</p> <p>\"It was clear that we had a program in place and Kevin was by far the best-placed person to continue that on,\" Di Pietro said. \"It wasn't a decision made with comfort or ease, it was a decision made because it was the right decision.\"</p> <p>The Victory are yet to appoint a permanent assistant but youth team coach Darren Davies will fill the role in the lead-up to the Wellington game.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421333622|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|7a331b7f762eaa26533aad6d6a4201e85e817223 -->",

        "body":"<p>The FFA is considering shifting the A-League Sydney derbies to a bigger venue next season and have already booked ANZ Stadium should the teams meet in the grand final.</p><p>Last week's derby was a sell-out, amassing a record crowd of 40,388 at Allianz Stadium – beating Sydney FC's largest crowd for a regular-season game and far exceeding last season's best figure for the derby of 26,176 at the same ground.</p><p>With the 11 January fixture between the two sides also sure to be a sell-out the debate has again been raised over moving it from the 20,000-seater Pirtek Stadium to a larger venue like ANZ Stadium which can accommodate over 80,000 fans.</p><p>The head of the A-League, Damien de Bohun, while open to the possibility for next season, has all but ruled out a switch of venue for the two remaining Sydney derbies this campaign, the final one to be played on 8 March at Allianz Stadium.</p><p>De Bohun said besides the Wanderers' contractual obligations to play their home games at Pirtek Stadium, they also wouldn't want to do wrong by their 16,000 members.</p><p>\"A big part of the Wanderers' success is their loyalty to their fans, they're part of the club's DNA,\" de Bohun said. \"They have a commitment to Parramatta as their home ground and they're committed to their fans to play their games there.</p><p>\"With 16,000 members, they need to stay loyal to those fans who have brought those memberships so they can be guaranteed a place at all the big games at Parramatta. If the club themselves were to express an interest in moving the derby to a larger venue then we would definitely look at that.\"</p><p>De Bohun admitted the commercial opportunity a larger venue presented was attractive and said the FFA would look at the prospect from next season.</p><p>\"There are a lot of commercial reasons why you'd look at it very seriously and we're very alive to that,\" he said. \"We will definitely be looking at that when we come to fixturing next season and beyond.</p><p>\"We are serious about growing the league and we think the opportunity to play matches in the future at big venue like ANZ is something that we need to look at very seriously.\"</p><p>And, in an effort to capitalise on the momentum the Sydney derby is gaining De Bohun revealed the FFA had already moved to shore-up the city's largest stadium should the two sides meet in this season's title-decider on 4 May.</p><p>\"We have placed a booking on the Olympic Stadium for grand final day in the event it plays out that way,\" he said. \"ANZ Stadium is being considered as a grand final venue across the board this season, but it becomes particularly relevant if the grand final is a Sydney derby.\"</p><p>The Wanderers will be able to better cater for a burgeoning fan base from next season with Pirtek Stadium to undergo expansion which will increase capacity by 4,000 seats.</p><p>The club are also exploring the possibility of installing of German-style \"rail seating\", widely used in the Bundesliga, to allow safe standing areas as part of the overall stadium upgrade.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421253598|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|c0e74d32aee847e064bb1b898fd121394f3e5c09 -->",
