The party leadership was opposed by 144 members, including Paul Ryan, the former vice-presidential candidate and a key figure in Congress.</p> <p>In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would &quot;lift the cloud of uncertainty&quot; that had hung over the country in recent weeks.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T07:45:02.043+01:00\">at 7.45am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-525f8542e4b0010b6627a908\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T07:37:45.293+01:00\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">The state of play</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>My US colleagues <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/16/us-debt-limit-brink-shutdown-senate-deal-live\"><strong>live-blogged all the action from Washington</strong></a> (<em>and quite gripping it was too</em>).</p> <p>Here's their closing summary:</p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>The House and Senate both passed a bill this evening funding the government and raising the debt ceiling until early 2014.</strong>President Obama says he will sign it &quot;immediately,&quot; as in, tonight.</p> <p><strong>• The 16-day government shutdown is over.</strong>&nbsp;Government employees&nbsp;will receive retroactive pay for the shutdown period.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>Fiscal talks will now shift to a budget conference between the House and Senate, where a negotiated report is due by mid-December.&nbsp;</strong>The talks will be led by the budget committee chairs of each chamber, senator Patty Murray and congressman Paul Ryan.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>President Obama will speak tomorrow about his budget priorities</strong>.

But the fact some members of Congress were prepared to risk a default may have caused lasting damage to America's pivotal role in the global financial system.</p> <p><strong>I'll be tracking the reaction to the deal over the next few hours, along with other events across the world economy, the eurozone, the financial markets and the business world.</strong></p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T07:35:57.340+01:00\">at 7.35am BST</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420220910|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|54620527042ab33187ea3b3ab95c7e0d2b5963f5 -->",

The retailer has a total of 237 UK stores, with 191 Mothercare shops and 46 Early Learning Centres.</p><p>The international business performed better, with sales up 12.4% during the quarter, but it was not enough to offset the weakness in the UK and total group sales fell by 0.5%. The company's shares were up nearly 4% in lunchtime trading to 408p as the retailer beat market expectations for a sharper slowdown in the UK market.</p><p>Simon Calver, the chief executive, said: \"We are continuing to make fundamental improvements to our business in the UK, which will allow us to compete effectively in a changing marketplace.</p><p>\"However, the UK market in home and travel remained highly promotional and autumn/winter clothing faced the same warm-weather challenges as the rest of the sector but is gaining market share.\"</p><p>He added that next-day click-and-collect services would be extended to all UK Early Learning Centre stores in time for Christmas trading.</p><p>Data published by the Office for National Statistics showed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/17/online-sales-surge-uk-retailers\" title=\"\">UK retail sales returned to growth in September</a>, rising by 0.7% on a monthly basis compared with a 2.1% fall in August.</p><p>Sales were driven higher by strong demand for home furnishings.</p><p>Meanwhile growth in online retail sales between August and September was the strongest on record, according to a report by IMRG Capgemini.</p><p>The e-retail sales index rose by 13% on a monthly basis, the highest for that period since the survey began 13 years ago.</p><p>Sales increased by 20% on an annual basis, boosted by the increasing use of mobile devices for transactions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420253422|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|07fd8e96d4118a8354f2d5478bc840347552efa6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Hans Riegel, who has died aged 90 of heart failure, devoted his life to the company that bears one of the great names of confectionery – Haribo. Building up his family business into an international brand producing 100m sweets a day made him one of Germany's richest men.</p><p>Johannes Peter Riegel, always known by the abbreviation Hans, was the elder son of Hans Riegel, who set up the business in 1920, registering it under an acronym derived from HAns RIegel BOnn. Hans senior set the tone for the future with a \"dancing bear\" sweet in 1922, and deliveries were made by his wife Gertrud, initially on a bicycle.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420249391'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382008962495/hans-riegel-001.jpg' alt='hans riegel' width='220' height='310' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Hans Riegel continued to go to the office every day, as he had done for almost 70 years. Photograph: Rolf Vennenbernd/AP</figcaption></figure><p>In 1945 Hans senior died, and upon returning to Bonn from Allied prisoner-of-war camps, Hans junior and his younger brother, Paul, resolved to revive and expand the family business, whose production plant remained largely undamaged. They changed the recipe of their gummy bear sweets to make them coloured and fruit-flavoured. Paul took charge of production and technical matters, while Hans, who had been studying economics at the University of Bonn, handled sales and marketing.</p><p>The gummy bear proved an unstoppable success. When the brothers started, they had a workforce of about 30. Within five years it had grown to more than 1,000, and today Haribo employs some 6,000 people at 15 factories in several countries, including a base in Pontefract, West Yorkshire. Its takeover of Dunhills, maker of the liquorice buttons known as Pontefract cakes, was completed in 1994, one of a number of purchases that expanded the firm's range of products to more than 200. They are now sold in more than 100 countries and Haribo has an annual turnover exceeding £1.6bn.</p><p>Starmix is the ubiquitous Haribo product in the UK, but the most popular globally is the Gummi bear. In 2007, Hans ordered the expression on Gummi bears' faces – in Britain they are called Goldbears – to be changed from a scowl to a smile. <a href=\"http://haribo.bg/en/\" title=\"History on the Haribo website\">The company's phenomenal growth</a> is largely due to the efforts of Hans, a reader of children's magazines and keen adopter of television advertising and slogans, backed by Paul's contribution to quality and consistency.</p><p>The business, despite the everyday modesty of its product, is an example of the kind of enterprise that made the postwar \"economic miracle\" in West Germany possible, through the Mittelstand, or small to medium-size enterprises. As the Riegels expanded the company, each owning 50% of the business, they proceeded with caution, chary of borrowing money or speculating. Today Haribo remains privately owned, with its headquarters still in Bonn.</p><p>When my family and I lived in the area in the 1970s, my elder daughter took part in a tradition started by Hans senior in 1936. She and her German schoolfriends would harvest horse chestnuts in autumn, gather them into sacks and drag them to the Haribo factory gate; they were intended as a seasonal treat for the deer on the nearby Riegel family estate. In exchange for the conkers, the children were given generous bags of sweets.</p><p>Hans junior always took an active interest in young sportspeople, having attained a high national standard himself in badminton. In 1987 he set up the Hans Riegel Foundation, giving scholarships to students at 12 German universities. He was awarded one of Germany's highest honours, the Federal Cross of Merit, in 1994.</p><p>A nephew, Hans-Jürgen Riegel, long accepted as the Haribo heir apparent, left the company in 2006, having failed to persuade the old man to hand over control and retire. Another nephew, Hans-Guido, remains with Haribo. Their uncle continued to go to the office every day, as he had done for almost 70 years, until he was treated for a brain tumour earlier this year.</p><p>Riegel's marriage ended in divorce. Paul died in 2009.</p><p>• Hans (Johannes) Peter Riegel, confectionery manufacturer, born 10 March 1923; died 15 October 2013</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420245521|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|f85333b110fb3edf3a50d4665920db25c626e9f9 -->",

        "body":"<p>The former boss of Northern Rock, Adam Applegarth, has left the private equity firm he joined four years ago with the hope of rehabilitating himself following the banking crisis.</p><p>Applegarth had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/01/disgraced-northern-rock-boss-job\" title=\"\">joined Apollo Global Management in the autumn of 2009</a>, two years after the run on the Newcastle-based lender that eventually led to the bank's nationalisation. He had presided over the first run on a bank since 1866 and later described 9 August 2007 as the \"day the world changed\", marking the start of the credit crunch which froze the bank out of the wholesale markets on which it relied for financing.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/banking/article3896776.ece\" title=\"\">According to the Times</a>, he has now resigned as an adviser to Apollo after causing controversy by becoming involved in bids for parts of Northern Rock and the 314 branches which Royal Bank of Scotland needed to sell. They are now being sold to a consortium involving the Church of England.</p><p>Officials from Apollo were not available for comment but the resignation of Applegarth comes as the roles of former bankers during the crisis have been subjected to fresh scrutiny following the report into the collapse of HBOS. James Crosby, the former boss of HBOS, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/11/hbos-james-crosby-formally-stripped-knighthood\" title=\"\">gave back his knighthood after criticism by the parliamentary commission on banking standards</a>.</p><p>Applegarth quit Northern Rock in December 2007 – two months before Alistair Darling stepped in to nationalise the former building society – with a payoff of around £760,000, ending a 20-year career with the bank which he had joined as graduate trainee.</p><p>The government later split Northern Rock into two: a \"good\" bank which has been bought by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Money and a \"bad\" bank which is still owned by taxpayers and part of UK Asset Resolution, which is running down the remaining loans.</p><p>It is not clear how much Applegarth has been paid over the past four years by Apollo, which specialises in buying distressed loans and securities.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420241190|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|1dddf7216a40e3bab2fe4141394ea4a859148d04 -->",

        "body":"<p>British Gas will raise energy prices by an average of 9.2% next month, piling further financial pressure on 7.8 million households and reigniting the political row over soaring gas and electricity prices.</p><p>Parent company Centrica became the second of the big six energy firms to announce a price rise after SSE raised prices last week. The average annual dual-fuel bill with British Gas will increase by £107 to £1,297.</p><p>Centrica blamed the above-inflation hike on higher costs for wholesale energy and delivering gas and electricity to homes, and government's \"social and environmental programmes\" which are paid for through customers' bills.</p><p>Electricity bills will rise by 10.4% and gas bills by 8.4% from 23 November. With usage and regional variations this equates to an average price rise of 9.2%, Centrica said.</p><p>The move escalated the row between energy providers and the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who accused SSE of \"ripping off\" customers after it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill\" title=\"\">announced an 8.2% price rise for its 7 million customers</a>.</p><p>Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, said the latest rise by British Gas showed \"clearer than ever\" why Miliband's proposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/sep/25/centrica-sse-labour-miliband-price-freeze\" title=\"\">20-month energy price freeze</a> was needed.</p><p>British Gas said on Thursday that although it recognised energy bills were a \"real worry for hard-pressed households\", the decision was down to rising costs \"that are not all directly under our control\".</p><p>Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas residential energy, said: \"I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes aren't keeping pace. We haven't taken this decision lightly.\"</p><p>He said the best way to keep bills down was by increased energy efficiency, and urged customers to check whether they were eligible for measures such as insulation.</p><p>Tom Lyon, an energy expert at uSwitch.com, said the rise would leave customers feeling \"betrayed\".</p><p>\"Today's price hike will be seen by many as a broken promise after the supplier suggested in May that it would use the extra profits it made last winter to hold off from any price hikes.</p><p>\"British Gas customers have had the rug pulled from under their feet and I suspect that many will be feeling let down and betrayed.\"</p><p>The company, however, insisted it was making \"fair profits\" for \"keeping homes warm and keeping the lights on\".</p><p>It said it was offering a new tariff which guarantees that prices will not go up until 30 November 2014. If standard prices fall, the fixed tariff will fall too, it said.</p><p>Clare Francis, editor-in-chief of Moneysupermarket.com, said other energy providers were likely to follow the move.</p><p>\"It won't stop there. We can expect the other four major providers – EDF, E.ON, npower and Scottish Power – to also announce price hikes over the coming weeks.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420240604|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|9d55c2d1b1d68ab0c3956f580494a019eb9fb679 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's retailers returned to health last month on the back of strong demand for new furniture and a 20% year-on-year surge in online sales, according to official figures.</p><p>After a 2.1% fall in August, the Office for National Statistics said retail sales rose by 0.7% month on month in September, excluding petrol sales, following a 3% surge in the purchase of household goods.</p><p>The rise in furniture sales and other household goods was credited by many analysts to the buoyant mood in the housing market. After a short time-lag, the government's Help to Buy deposit insurance scheme and the Bank of England's funding for lending initiative, which has depressed mortgage rates, appear to have pushed up the number of transactions and the demand for homeware.</p><p>The ONS said a look back over the previous three months revealed a period of growth, with retail sales up 1.5% quarter on quarter.</p><p>\"This is the largest quarter-on-quarter rise since March 2008 when the economy as a whole was at its peak, before the economic downturn,\" it said.</p><p>Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank, described the figures as solid and unspectacular.</p><p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said: \"Retail sales showed a welcome revival in September after dipping in August, adding further to mounting evidence that the economy grew strongly in the third quarter. The three months to September have been the best quarter the retail sector has seen the start of 2008, suggesting an encouraging lead-up to the all-important Christmas season.\"</p><p>He said: \"The upturn corroborates data from Visa, which showed a wider measure of total consumer spending up a buoyant 1.5% during September.\"</p><p>Consumer confidence, which has risen sharply in recent months largely because people have been busier at work, has driven incomes higher and provided greater job security, he said.</p><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/oct/16/employment-growing-wage-slaves-ons-prices-pay\" title=\"\">Employment jumped higher in August</a>, pushing the number of jobless benefits claimants down at the fastest rate since 1997. Rising house prices have added to the feel-good factor,\" he added.</p><p>Clarke said that based on surveys of manufacturing, construction and services industries, GDP should rise by 1.2% quarter on quarter.</p><p>The first estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter is published on 25 October and economists' estimates vary from 0.7% to 1.2%.</p><p>\"It's just that lacklustre industrial production data, the soggy July monthly services reading and mediocre retail sales have undermined faith in a super-strong outcome,\" Clarke said.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/16/bank-of-england-interest-rates-may-rise-next-year\" title=\"\">an interview with the Guardian</a> on Wednesday, Spencer Dale, the Bank of England's chief economist, pointed to a strong GDP number when he said the economy was \"growing at something like 3-4% annualised\".</p><p>Dale said it was possible Threadneedle Street would raise interest rates as early as next year if the strength of the recovery was maintained.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420237666|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|771d41ac02a2c24146a962b881689e638f179918 -->",

        "body":"<p>HMV is relaunching its online strategy seven months after it was bought out of administration. The entertainment retailer, which is now owned by restructuring specialist Hilco, has kickstarted its new digital strategy with a free mobile phone app, which launched on Thursday.</p><p>The app allows shoppers to buy or listen to tasters of tracks by scanning CD covers, posters or adverts in store or elsewhere or by playing songs from the radio into their phone. It will be the first non-iTunes based digital music download app available via Apple phones.</p><p>Users can buy or pre-order tracks from HMV's digital catalogue and store them in an online locker to play on Android or Apple phones.</p><p>The retailer's digital music store will be fully integrated into a revamped website, which is due to launch next week, extending the ability to listen to and buy digital music to other platforms, including Mac OS X, Windows PC as well as BlackBerry 10 and Windows smartphones.</p><p>Paul McGowan, the chief executive of Hilco Capital and chairman of HMV, said: \"HMV's position at the heart of entertainment retail demands that we enable customers to buy their music from HMV in the way that best suits them and to engage more closely with the music, video and gaming worlds.\"</p><p>Hilco's £50m buyout of HMV secured 2,500 jobs at 141 shops, just over half the chain. The buyout was strongly supported by music labels keen to back an alternative to online behemoth Amazon. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/15/hmv-in-administration-key-facts\" title=\"\">HMV fell into administration in January</a> amid tough competition from supermarkets and online stores such as Amazon. It also struggled to cope as shoppers switched rapidly to digital downloads of music, films and computer games and increasingly used online services such as Spotify and Netflix, rather than browsing for CDs and DVDs on the high street.</p><p>HMV's new app and online store is part of a fightback strategy as nearly 30% of music sold in the UK was downloaded last year compared with about 20% in 2010, according to figures from retail analysts Conlumino. By 2015, about 45% of music is expected to be downloaded.</p><p>Alongside the new app and website, McGowan said HMV would also be revitalising its YouTube channel and stepping up the number of live events in its stores.</p><p>Hilco is hoping to repeat the success it has had so far with HMV Canada, which it bought several years ago.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420224541|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|9905519ff6f87d1214e0e983dc04d71f534bc4f1 -->",

        "body":"<p>A former chairman of the Australian Coal Association, who has accused the fossil fuel industry of &ldquo;stuffing up&rdquo; effective action on climate change, is fighting an insurgent battle to gain a seat on the board of the mining giant BHP Billiton.</p> <p>Ian Dunlop, formerly a senior executive in the oil, gas and coal industries, is attempting to gain shareholder support for his bid to challenge what he claims is &ldquo;utter bullshit&rdquo; from a resources industry that has stymied an urgent transition away from carbon-intensive fuels.</p> <p>The board of BHP, which will hold an annual general meeting in London next week and another in Perth on 21 November, has called on shareholders to reject Dunlop, with the chairman, Jacques Nasser, describing him as a single-issue candidate who would add little to the board.</p> <p>But Dunlop, who will fly to London for the meeting, told Guardian Australia that shareholders were &ldquo;curious&rdquo; about his bid and that BHP required a strong advocate for dealing with the challenge of climate change.</p> <p>&ldquo;This is an unusual situation, which has created a lot of interest among shareholders,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There needs to be a range of perspectives on boards or you get locked into the kind of groupthink that the fossil fuel industry has on climate change.&rdquo;</p> <p>Dunlop has turned to climate change activism after his career in the fossil fuel industry, chairing <a href=\"http://www.safeclimateaustralia.org\">Safe Climate Australia</a> and become a member of the <a href=\"http://www.clubofrome.org\">Club of Rome</a>, which has warned of the limits of sustainable living.</p> <p>He told Guardian Australia that the resources industry had &ldquo;completely ignored the catastrophic risk&rdquo; posed to their business models by climate change.</p> <p>&ldquo;The industry hasn&rsquo;t shown any leadership as it hadn&rsquo;t been prepared to admit what&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If we want to keep below the limit of 2C warming, which is already far too high, we cannot continue ad infinitum in Australia talking about doubling our coal exports and tripling our gas exports.</p> <p>&ldquo;BHP, to be fair to them, is doing more than most but when I look around the boardrooms of Australia, the UK or US I see absolutely no recognition of the strategic implications of climate change.</p> <p>&ldquo;These businesses have got a horrendous problem when it comes to [climate] risk management. Waiting until it is too late and then being forced to do something in a panic isn&rsquo;t risk management in my book.</p> <p>&ldquo;There is a mind block towards it. Some [executives] are in denial while others have this gently, gently approach, whereas the reality is far more urgent. You simply can&rsquo;t do business in a world with 4C of warming. Shareholder value will go down the tubes.&rdquo;</p> <p>Dunlop said governments had abrogated their responsibility to lead on climate change, while the resources industry had failed to take the initiative owing to its focus on short-term profit.</p> <p>&ldquo;The industry used to have nation builders but now it has technocrats with a short-term focus,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Their arguments are utter bullshit. Utter nonsense. We have a global problem and if we all sit on our hands we&rsquo;ll all commit suicide together.</p> <p>&ldquo;[Environment minister] Greg Hunt&rsquo;s approach won&rsquo;t do anything, so we need business leaders capable of articulating the problem. The likes of Rio Tinto and the Minerals Council express great concern about climate change but then allow [others] to whiteant any action.</p> <p>&ldquo;[The industry has been] actively stuffing up carbon pricing for the past decade. That&rsquo;s just not acceptable anymore.&rdquo;</p> <p>Dunlop admitted that it was &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; for shareholders to ignore a board&rsquo;s advice on director appointments but said he was hopeful of winning them around.</p> <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be on the board to destroy the joint,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;BHP is a diversified miner and has got a solid, long future, but it has got to get out of fossil fuels.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420220890|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|405bbf5e29549791d2429a1d4db06f902d9c9792 -->",

Now, at the 11th hour, a deal has finally been thrashed out and, barring any last minute hiccups, will be approved by Congress.</p> <p>But the US government has been paralysed during a 16-day shutdown that is so far estimated to have cost US$24bn - US$1.5bn a day.</p> <p>The US government will soon reopen and America may have avoided a catastrophic default, but has the problem simply been kicked down the road? And what will be the lasting impact not only on the US, but on Australia and the rest of the global economy?</p> <p>Greg Jericho writes the Grogonomics blog for Guardian Australia. While working as a public servant he wrote the blog Grog’s Gamut which came to prominence during the 2010 federal election.</p> <p>He left the public service in 2011 to write the book, “The Rise of the Fifth Estate” on social media and blogging in Australian politics.

Defence spending is going to play a big role in the next round. The deal done today really just kicks the can down the road till Jan 15 re the Govt shutdown and mid February for the debt ceiling. Not coincidentally Jan 15 is when the next round of sequestration cut kick in, and they are suggested to have a much larger impact than the ones which were somewhat watered down this year.</p> <p>&nbsp;The big issue is defence spending. One report has suggested that if the sequester cuts continue then by 2021, &quot;ground divisions will drop from 20 to six, Air Force fighter and attack planes will drop by 1,632 aircraft, and Navy ships will drop by 338, with the aircraft carrier force declining from 15 carriers to seven in 2021.&quot;</p> <p>Normally Republicans would be getting quite antsy about this, but the political situation regarding the Tea Party and govt spending cuts is such that they have recently toned down their rhetoric on this because they the Tea Party want across the board spending cuts to come in</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28009477\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11914963\" title=\"View OGriffey’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2013/08/21/11914963/2b1c14aa-d8d7-4916-9e4d-64a0eafae6cb/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for OGriffey\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11914963\" title=\"View OGriffey’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">OGriffey</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28009477\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2013 2:01am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Should the US debt ceiling be abolished and does Australia have anything similar as Joe Hockey seemed to imply while in opposition?</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yep it should be abolished.

Short term, yes. I'd suggest Hockey was talking more about the financial markets aspect rather than any plans re fiscal stimulus to counter any decline in economic growth.

This of course ignores that then sequester cuts when proposed in 2011 were done so as a threat to ensure congress would agree on a budget - so it was hoped the law would not come into effect!</p> <p>And all of this is coupled with the fact that Ted Cruz will no doubt have raised heaps of money from all of this, and the Tea Party are still targeting &quot;moderate&quot; GOP senators and congress members.</p> <p>So my view is that while you would think this logically should see the Tea Party weakened, that only works if you are dealing with an organisation that responds to logic.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28009908\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12416905\" title=\"View Ben Peake’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Ben Peake\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12416905\" title=\"View Ben Peake’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Ben Peake</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28009908\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2013 2:42am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>As far as I understand it, the positive view from some Tea-Partiers (Rand Paul) is that a default would be a good thing as it would essentially decouple the US financially from world money markets therefore leading to a drastically smaller Government.

The market doesn't give a stuff about it being raised - the bond yields never go up because it is raised, they only go up when Congress threatens to block move for it to be raised.</p> <p>But I can't see it happening, purely because there are those who view it as a weapon in their arsenal that they can use to force spending cuts etc. But what today has really shown is that if the other side refuses to budge the threat to allow a default up being empty.</p> <p>So logically there is no reason to keep it even politically, but again I think logic isn't much in play. It;s worth noting that Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul still voted against the Bill that just went through the Senate. Now maybe they did so only because they knew it would pass, but it does show that the belief that there is political benefit from forcing a default still remains.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28010163\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12416941\" title=\"View Katealan’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Katealan\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12416941\" title=\"View Katealan’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Katealan</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28010163\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2013 3:10am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Would it be possible for the US to buy its own debt and then not demand repayment, as suggested by Terry McCrann today? </p> <p>Why would/wouldn't this work?</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have seen that view expressed - for eg an article on <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/10/09/ending-the-debt-limit-crisis-dear-ben-bernanke/\">Reuters' website </a>suggested:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>&quot;So a simple solution to the impasse is as follows: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke should simply cancel the Treasury debt that it owns. The government can just forgive the government’s debt.</p> <p>&quot;This wouldn’t solve the debt problem entirely. The Federal Reserve doesn’t own all U.S. government debt; it owns only roughly $2 trillion of it. (Well $2,076,927,000,000.00, as of last Wednesday, but who’s counting?)&quot;</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What this is is essentially short-term solution to get the govt through any period where they would actually default. Similarly the Treasury could have sold some of its gold to raise some cash. This would stop the US from actually defaulting - ie not being able to pay back money it owes. But for how long could they do this is the issue and the big worry would be how the market would react.</p> <p>It's a bit like you telling your bank when you go to get a housing loan that you will be able to make the mortgage repayments because you can sell your car if things get tight. It doesn't scream confidence, and the system is essentially built on the fact that US will never ever ever default.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28010445\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11914573\" title=\"View Greg Jericho’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2013/05/27/11914573/802e1f94-9505-473c-8d7d-3053588ef311/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Greg Jericho\" /> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11914573\" title=\"View Greg Jericho’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Greg Jericho</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28010445\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2013 3:41am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Well that will do us for today. </p> <p>Thanks all for your great questions. </p> <p>It looks like America has avoided financial and economic catastrophe for itself and the rest of us at least until February when the debt ceiling deadline occurs once again - because obviously doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is a smart way to govern a country.</p> <p>No doubt Americans will enjoy Christmas this year knowing that this could all start (or more to the point, stop) again on January 15!</p> <p>Thanks again, </p> <p>Greg</p></div> </div> </div> </figure><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420198102|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|b8c55fc5b69593a86e0b79fd6c5a980e0df5f0d1 -->",

The average annual dual-fuel bill with British Gas will increase by £107 to £1,297.</p><p>Centrica blamed the above-inflation hike on higher costs for wholesale energy and delivering gas and electricity to homes, and government's \"social and environmental programmes\" which are paid for through customers' bills.</p><p>Electricity bills will rise by 10.4% and gas bills by 8.4% from 23 November.

The party leadership was opposed by 144 members, including Paul Ryan, the former vice-presidential candidate and a key figure in Congress.</p> <p>In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would &quot;lift the cloud of uncertainty&quot; that had hung over the country in recent weeks.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T07:45:02.043+01:00\">at 7.45am BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-525f8542e4b0010b6627a908\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T07:37:45.293+01:00\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">The state of play</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>My US colleagues <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/16/us-debt-limit-brink-shutdown-senate-deal-live\"><strong>live-blogged all the action from Washington</strong></a> (<em>and quite gripping it was too</em>).</p> <p>Here's their closing summary:</p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>The House and Senate both passed a bill this evening funding the government and raising the debt ceiling until early 2014.</strong>President Obama says he will sign it &quot;immediately,&quot; as in, tonight.</p> <p><strong>• The 16-day government shutdown is over.</strong>&nbsp;Government employees&nbsp;will receive retroactive pay for the shutdown period.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>Fiscal talks will now shift to a budget conference between the House and Senate, where a negotiated report is due by mid-December.&nbsp;</strong>The talks will be led by the budget committee chairs of each chamber, senator Patty Murray and congressman Paul Ryan.</p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>President Obama will speak tomorrow about his budget priorities</strong>.

But the fact some members of Congress were prepared to risk a default may have caused lasting damage to America's pivotal role in the global financial system.</p> <p><strong>I'll be tracking the reaction to the deal over the next few hours, along with other events across the world economy, the eurozone, the financial markets and the business world.</strong></p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T07:35:57.340+01:00\">at 7.35am BST</time></p> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420220910|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|54620527042ab33187ea3b3ab95c7e0d2b5963f5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's retailers returned to health last month on the back of strong demand for new furniture and a 20% year-on-year surge in online sales, according to official figures.</p><p>After a 2.1% fall in August, the Office for National Statistics said retail sales rose by 0.7% month on month in September, excluding petrol sales, following a 3% surge in the purchase of household goods.</p><p>The rise in furniture sales and other household goods was credited by many analysts to the buoyant mood in the housing market. After a short time-lag, the government's Help to Buy deposit insurance scheme and the Bank of England's funding for lending initiative, which has depressed mortgage rates, appear to have pushed up the number of transactions and the demand for homeware.</p><p>The ONS said a look back over the previous three months revealed a period of growth, with retail sales up 1.5% quarter on quarter.</p><p>\"This is the largest quarter-on-quarter rise since March 2008 when the economy as a whole was at its peak, before the economic downturn,\" it said.</p><p>Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank, described the figures as solid and unspectacular.</p><p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said: \"Retail sales showed a welcome revival in September after dipping in August, adding further to mounting evidence that the economy grew strongly in the third quarter. The three months to September have been the best quarter the retail sector has seen the start of 2008, suggesting an encouraging lead-up to the all-important Christmas season.\"</p><p>He said: \"The upturn corroborates data from Visa, which showed a wider measure of total consumer spending up a buoyant 1.5% during September.\"</p><p>Consumer confidence, which has risen sharply in recent months largely because people have been busier at work, has driven incomes higher and provided greater job security, he said.</p><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/oct/16/employment-growing-wage-slaves-ons-prices-pay\" title=\"\">Employment jumped higher in August</a>, pushing the number of jobless benefits claimants down at the fastest rate since 1997. Rising house prices have added to the feel-good factor,\" he added.</p><p>Clarke said that based on surveys of manufacturing, construction and services industries, GDP should rise by 1.2% quarter on quarter.</p><p>The first estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter is published on 25 October and economists' estimates vary from 0.7% to 1.2%.</p><p>\"It's just that lacklustre industrial production data, the soggy July monthly services reading and mediocre retail sales have undermined faith in a super-strong outcome,\" Clarke said.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/16/bank-of-england-interest-rates-may-rise-next-year\" title=\"\">an interview with the Guardian</a> on Wednesday, Spencer Dale, the Bank of England's chief economist, pointed to a strong GDP number when he said the economy was \"growing at something like 3-4% annualised\".</p><p>Dale said it was possible Threadneedle Street would raise interest rates as early as next year if the strength of the recovery was maintained.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420237666|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|771d41ac02a2c24146a962b881689e638f179918 -->",

        "headline":"Interest rates may rise next year, says Bank of England chief economist",
        "body":"<p>The Bank of England warned that interest rates might rise as early as next year as its chief economist said Threadneedle Street's desire to keep borrowing costs low for several years could be thwarted by a combination of stronger than expected growth and unusually weak productivity.</p><p>Spencer Dale, one of the nine members of the rate-setting monetary policy committee, said the UK was currently growing at an annual rate of 3-4% and the Bank could not be certain when it might need to tighten policy.</p><p>Following guidance issued by the Bank in August, the City is expecting interest rates to remain on hold at their record low of 0.5% until at least 2015. But Dale said in a Guardian interview that in certain circumstances an increase could happen as soon as 2014.</p><p>\"What we are clear about is what the state of the economy will be like when we raise interest rates. What we are not as clear about is whether that is two years ahead, three years ahead, or one year ahead. But it is clear that we are thinking of years not months,\" Dale said.</p><p>The Bank said in August that unless there was a risk from inflation or an over-heating property market it would only start thinking about raising interest when unemployment had come down to 7% from 7.7% currently, something it did not expect until 2016. But the recovery in the economy seen since the spring has left many in the City convinced that the Bank will be forced to take action before then.</p><p>Dale said that \"forward guidance\" had been useful in explaining how the Bank was likely to behave, and that he was \"nervous that some people may be thinking we are going to raise rates just because we are going to have strong growth\".</p><p>\"By doing that [forward guidance], we reduce the likelihood that people, when they see a few quarters of strong growth, expect us to raise rates. We have reduced the likelihood of a premature raising of rates.\"</p><p>But Dale said he could not say for sure how long the period of 0.5% interest rates would last. \"The economy looks as if it is growing at something like 3-4% annualised. Bank rate is at 0.5%, something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. The big message is that monetary policy is going to remain loose for a considerable period of time. I can't be sure whether that means it will be tightened in 2015 or 2016. It could be 2015. It could be a bit earlier than that or a bit later.\"</p><p>Asked whether the Bank could raise rates as early as next year, Dale replied: \"Conceivably it could be 2014. But it would have to be in a world where you had quite strong growth, perhaps stronger than you have got now, and a recovery in productivity weaker than I would expect.\"</p><p>Dale said the biggest downside risk to the economy was a renewed crisis in the euro area. \"We have seen some of the near term tensions ease, but the fundamental challenges are immense.\"</p><p>But he added that there was also a chance that the economy would grow far more strongly than currently expected.</p><p>\"If you take business surveys at face value and base your view of the economy purely on them it would suggest that the economy is growing in at a rate in excess of 4%. We might be misjudging it. It could be that the economy is coming back more quickly than we think.</p><p>\"I am aiming off of that slightly. I am aware of the fundamental challenges facing our economy. In particular, real incomes remain weak and we are not going to see a strong pick up in consumption until we see that.\"</p><p>Dale said that the economy was still 3% smaller than at its peak before the deep recession of 2008-09 and that the Bank was alive to the risk that a premature increase in borrowing costs could choke off recovery. He added that if markets failed to get the message and pushed up long-term interest rates to a level that impinged on the recovery, the Bank's monetary policy committee would act. \"The natural thing would be to do more quantitative easing and loosen policy to stimulate the economy.\"</p><p>Dale said he welcomed the fact that the housing market was recovering, and saw no immediate threat of a bubble. It was \"great\" for the construction sector that more houses were being built, and the increase in mortgage approvals boosted demand for professional services and led to greater labour mobility. \"It is good for consumption, because there is quite strong evidence that when people move home they go out and change the carpets and buy new furniture. We are moving from a housing market in deep freeze to where it is thawing and helping the recovery.\"</p><p>Dale said that one difference from previous cycles was that there was now a financial policy committee at the Bank of England armed with the tools to tackle any problems from the housing market.</p><p>He said \"bitter experience\" had shown what could happen when the housing market was allowed to overheat. \"I don't think that's where we are now but are very active to that risk. The Bank as a whole is. The monetary policy committee is. Most importantly, the financial policy committee is.\"</p><p>Asked if the Bank was being complacent, he replied: \"We are not being complacent. We are looking at this very closely.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420190744|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|ce0fc0da3f050656fda0987c54dc71944e65547f -->",

        "headline":"Grangemouth oil refinery shuts as owners refuse to back down in dispute",
        "body":"<p>Scotland's biggest oil refinery was shut down on Wednesday  as the owners of the Grangemouth site refused to back down in an industrial dispute with the Unite trade union.</p><p>Ineos, which owns the plant on the Firth of Forth, said it will await a response from its 1,300 staff to proposed pension changes before deciding whether to reopen the plant. However, the pensions dispute is part of a tangled web of grievances between Ineos and Unite, including the involvement of Grangemouth's chief shop steward in the furore over the selection of Falkirk's Labour parliamentary candidate.</p><p>A spokesman for Ineos said workers would receive proposals on Thursday to replace their final salary pension scheme. He said: \"Grangemouth is shut down and it will remain shut down. When we have got a response from the workforce we will consult with our shareholders and make a decision.\"</p><p>Ed Davey, the energy secretary, assured motorists the shutdown would not affect Scotland's petrol and diesel supplies.</p><p>The plant processes about 200,000 barrels of oil a day and supplies most of Scotland's fuel. The closure could also disrupt the flow of North Sea oil into Scotland because BP's giant Kinneil processing terminal next door relies on Grangemouth for its power.</p><p>The decision to close Grangemouth came after talks between the company and Unite broke down on Wednesday morning. Unite called off a planned 48-hour strike set to start on Sunday and said it was doing so to protect the plant from being damaged by the shutdown.</p><p>The Scottish secretary, Alistair Carmichael, said he was concerned by Ineos's decision, and wanted to know why it had attached conditions to keeping the plant running. He said: \"It doesn't look constructive because this is a dispute which has enormous danger of damaging Scotland's economy and confidence. For that reason, I think there is a legitimate interest for government both in Edinburgh and London to hold both parties to account here. Be in no doubt that the stakes are exceptionally high. This could be seriously bad news for Scotland's economy.\"</p><p>Unite attacked Ineos for going ahead with a \"cold shutdown\" that would put Grangemouth out of action for a month even after the plant was reopened. The union had called for a partial \"warm\" shutdown during its strike to allow the plant to tick over and resume operation quickly. But despite the union's decision to cancel its strike, Ineos went ahead with its shutdown and upped the stakes by raising the prospect of permanent closure.</p><p>The dispute between Unite and Ineos is complicated by claims and counterclaims over a number of grievances.</p><p>The planned strike was over Ineos's treatment of Stephen Deans, Unite's convenor in Scotland who works at the plant. Deans was implicated in the furore over the selection of Falkirk's Labour parliamentary candidate, which ultimately saw the party and the police clear Unite of allegations of vote rigging.</p><p>After he was suspended from the Labour party, the police decided to bring no charges against him and Labour reinstated him as chairman of the local party. But Ineos has carried on with its own inquiry, based on the allegation that Deans recruited party members on the company's premises.</p><p>The talks also covered the future of Grangemouth and Ineos's proposals.</p><p>Ineos claims Grangemouth is losing £10m a month and cannot survive without huge investment and cost cuts. Last month it presented a \"survival plan\" to its employees that included the closure of the final salary pension scheme and a request for £150m of government support.</p><p>Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said the dispute would not affect fuel distribution and indicated that the Scottish government will invest in the site in a bid to help resolve the dispute. \"What is important – and what now is at stake – is the future of Grangemouth as a chemical complex and a refinery in Scotland, and that can only be brought about by investment in the plant.</p><p>\"The Scottish Government is happy to assist with such an investment package, but before that can happen there needs to be goodwill on both sides between management and the unions.\"</p><p>Ineos said it agreed to reopen Grangemouth as soon as possible if the union delayed any further industrial action until the end of March, but that Unite refused. Unite also refused to accept Ineos's version of Grangemouth's financial position.</p><p>A major sticking point was Unite's refusal to apologise for its claim that Ineos had taken money from the pension fund – an allegation that sparked a libel action. Unite said Ratcliffe demanded a public apology in return for withdrawing the suit.</p><p>Ineos is owned by its management, headed by chairman and chemicals industry veteran Jim Ratcliffe. The company expanded from its launch in 1998 by snapping up chemical works. It gained a reputation as a canny but hard-nosed operator and now has a turnover of $43bn (£27bn). PetroChina bought a stake in Grangemouth in 2011 in a deal that was meant to secure its future.</p><p>Grangemouth's Labour MP Michael Connarty said: \"This isn't 1970s management; this is 1920s management. Big companies shouldn't be able to hold our country to ransom. Major national assets shouldn't be left to the whim of a couple of hard men from the chemicals industry.\"</p><p>Grangemouth is Ineos's biggest production centre and operates refinery and petrochemicals plants on a 1,700-acre estate 25 miles from Edinburgh. Ineos bought the site from BP in 2005 when the oil giant decided to dispose of its olefins and derivatives businesses.</p><p>Connarty said Ineos acquired the plant when the economy was booming, enjoyed a year or two of bumper business and then suffered as demand fell in the global recession.</p><p>\"They made the mistake of buying these things when the world economy was turning down and now they blame the workforce,\" he said.</p><p>Unite yesterday released an analysis of Grangemouth's finances by tax consultant Richard Murphy. He disputed Ineos's claims and said Grangemouth Chemicals – the only accounts he could find – made a profit in 2012 and was expecting £117m of tax gains that could only occur if the company earned £500m over the next few years.</p><p>Murphy said total labour costs, including exceptional pension expenses, were 16.9% of revenue and total labour costs \"should not be a critical cause for concern\".</p><p>But with the stakes suddenly increased the future of Grangemouth is starting to look critical.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420184819|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|2f2d562933ec3762645e9812a90c759239516611 -->",

        "body":"<p>HMV is relaunching its online strategy seven months after it was bought out of administration. The entertainment retailer, which is now owned by restructuring specialist Hilco, has kickstarted its new digital strategy with a free mobile phone app, which launched on Thursday.</p><p>The app allows shoppers to buy or listen to tasters of tracks by scanning CD covers, posters or adverts in store or elsewhere or by playing songs from the radio into their phone. It will be the first non-iTunes based digital music download app available via Apple phones.</p><p>Users can buy or pre-order tracks from HMV's digital catalogue and store them in an online locker to play on Android or Apple phones.</p><p>The retailer's digital music store will be fully integrated into a revamped website, which is due to launch next week, extending the ability to listen to and buy digital music to other platforms, including Mac OS X, Windows PC as well as BlackBerry 10 and Windows smartphones.</p><p>Paul McGowan, the chief executive of Hilco Capital and chairman of HMV, said: \"HMV's position at the heart of entertainment retail demands that we enable customers to buy their music from HMV in the way that best suits them and to engage more closely with the music, video and gaming worlds.\"</p><p>Hilco's £50m buyout of HMV secured 2,500 jobs at 141 shops, just over half the chain. The buyout was strongly supported by music labels keen to back an alternative to online behemoth Amazon. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/15/hmv-in-administration-key-facts\" title=\"\">HMV fell into administration in January</a> amid tough competition from supermarkets and online stores such as Amazon. It also struggled to cope as shoppers switched rapidly to digital downloads of music, films and computer games and increasingly used online services such as Spotify and Netflix, rather than browsing for CDs and DVDs on the high street.</p><p>HMV's new app and online store is part of a fightback strategy as nearly 30% of music sold in the UK was downloaded last year compared with about 20% in 2010, according to figures from retail analysts Conlumino. By 2015, about 45% of music is expected to be downloaded.</p><p>Alongside the new app and website, McGowan said HMV would also be revitalising its YouTube channel and stepping up the number of live events in its stores.</p><p>Hilco is hoping to repeat the success it has had so far with HMV Canada, which it bought several years ago.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420224541|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|9905519ff6f87d1214e0e983dc04d71f534bc4f1 -->",

        "body":"<p>The former boss of Northern Rock, Adam Applegarth, has left the private equity firm he joined four years ago with the hope of rehabilitating himself following the banking crisis.</p><p>Applegarth had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/01/disgraced-northern-rock-boss-job\" title=\"\">joined Apollo Global Management in the autumn of 2009</a>, two years after the run on the Newcastle-based lender that eventually led to the bank's nationalisation. He had presided over the first run on a bank since 1866 and later described 9 August 2007 as the \"day the world changed\", marking the start of the credit crunch which froze the bank out of the wholesale markets on which it relied for financing.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/banking/article3896776.ece\" title=\"\">According to the Times</a>, he has now resigned as an adviser to Apollo after causing controversy by becoming involved in bids for parts of Northern Rock and the 314 branches which Royal Bank of Scotland needed to sell. They are now being sold to a consortium involving the Church of England.</p><p>Officials from Apollo were not available for comment but the resignation of Applegarth comes as the roles of former bankers during the crisis have been subjected to fresh scrutiny following the report into the collapse of HBOS. James Crosby, the former boss of HBOS, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/11/hbos-james-crosby-formally-stripped-knighthood\" title=\"\">gave back his knighthood after criticism by the parliamentary commission on banking standards</a>.</p><p>Applegarth quit Northern Rock in December 2007 – two months before Alistair Darling stepped in to nationalise the former building society – with a payoff of around £760,000, ending a 20-year career with the bank which he had joined as graduate trainee.</p><p>The government later split Northern Rock into two: a \"good\" bank which has been bought by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Money and a \"bad\" bank which is still owned by taxpayers and part of UK Asset Resolution, which is running down the remaining loans.</p><p>It is not clear how much Applegarth has been paid over the past four years by Apollo, which specialises in buying distressed loans and securities.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420241190|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|1dddf7216a40e3bab2fe4141394ea4a859148d04 -->",

        "headline":"BSkyB profits hit by tussle with BT over Premier League",
        "body":"<p>BSkyB has reported an 8% fall in profits to £285m in the three months to the end of September, as investment in new services and costs incurred in its Premier League battle with pay-TV rival BT took its toll.</p><p></p><p>BSkyB's adjusted operating profits were hit by the £2.3bn deal it was forced to make to stop BT from securing the lion's share of Premier League matches for the next three years, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/13/premier-league-tv-rights-3-billion-sky-bt\" title=\"\">a 40% increase on the last deal</a>, although the company said the dip was \"in line with expectations\".</p><p></p><p>The satellite broadcaster said that the new deal it has with the Premier League sees the amount it pays each year rise by £220m, from the previous £540m a year to £760m.</p><p></p><p>BSkyB saw churn – the rate of customers leaving its business – rise slightly in the quarter by 0.1% to 11%.</p><p></p><p>The fairly stable churn rate would appear to indicate that the promotional offers available from BT, such as free TV sports packages to customers who take broadband, are not yet damaging Sky.</p><p></p><p>Investors reacted warmly to the results, with BSkyB's share price rising 4%, or 34.5p, to 912.5p in early trading.</p><p></p><p>Sky said that TV viewing of the first 23 live Premier League games was up 20% year on year, which excludes viewing on mobile devices.</p><p></p><p>\"The rise has come from across the board,\" said the BSkyB chief executive, Jeremy Darroch. \"Core viewing to our live channels is [85%] up with the switch from Saturday lunch to Saturday evening matches [under the new TV rights deal] which has been a big part of the schedule.\"</p><p></p><p>BSkyB is expecting another serious challenge from BT when Champions League TV rights come up next year, although Darroch played down the impact of what is expected to be a massive increase in the cost of the previous deal.</p><p></p><p>\"In terms of content inflation [cost increase for rights] I'm very happy,\" he said. \"This quarter programming costs went up less than sales – that has been the trend for a while.\"</p><p></p><p>BSkyB reported 7% growth in revenue in the quarter to £1.84bn as total viewing to its Sky Sports channels rose 15% on last year, fuelled by a summer of sport that included England's triumphant battle for the Ashes against Australia and successful Lions rugby tour.</p><p></p><p>TV subscriber numbers, which include subscribers to its satellite TV channels as well as internet service Now TV, rose by 37,000 in the quarter to 10.45m.</p><p></p><p>Viewing of Sky Sports via mobile TV service Sky Go rose 40% year on year, while watching of movies on the service increased by 50%. Its premium paid-for service Sky Go Extra, which allows customers to register up to four devices and download TV and movies to watch offline for £5 a month, saw users rise 219,000 to a total of 385,000.</p><p></p><p>Sky added 111,000 new broadband subscribers in the quarter, a 9% year-on-year increase, to take its total customer base to more than 5 million.</p><p></p><p>Those taking Sky's high definition service rose 107,000 to 4.89 million.</p><p></p><p>Sky HD service subscriptions grew by 642,000, taking the total number of customers to 3.4 million, with growth running at 50,000 a week.</p><p></p><p>The rapid rise in the penetration of the internet-connected Sky+HD boxes is helping to fuel a surge in on-demand usage.</p><p></p><p>There was a fourfold increase in weekly downloads through Sky's on-demand services, while movie rentals via Sky Store have doubled year on year.</p><p></p><p>Triple-play customers, those taking three products from Sky, rose to 36% of the total customer base.</p><p></p><p>Programming costs were up 6% to £622m, due to a \"step-up\" in Premier League costs and investment in original UK TV commissions.</p><p></p><p>Advertising revenues rose 7% to £102m.</p><p></p><p>Darroch said the healthy rise is due to the fact that the London Olympics, which aired on the ad-free BBC, dented viewing – and therefore advertising – on commercial channels.</p><p></p><p>Average revenue per user, a key metric watched by analysts, rose by £17 year on year, or 3%, to £559.</p><p></p><p>BSkyB announced in July that it would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/26/bskyb-annual-results-now-tv\" title=\"\">spend £60m to £70m on developing connected TV services</a>, which include internet service Now TV and the development of a budget £9.99 set-top box.</p><p></p><p>Darroch said that the company would not give an update on the sales of the set-top box, which is aimed at Freeview households, or the progress of the internet service.</p><p></p><p>In July BSkyB said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/26/bskyb-annual-results-now-tv\" title=\"\">more than 50,000 people</a> had taken advantage of its £9.99 sport \"day pass\", the first time in its two-decade history the pay-TV giant has allowed access to prime content such as Premier League football without a TV subscription.</p><p></p><p>Earlier this week BSkyB reached a deal with arch-rival BT to offer its Sky Movies channels on BT TV.</p><p></p><p>However, Darroch said that the two companies were still at loggerheads over offering Sky Sports to BT customers with internet-connected YouView set-top boxes.</p><p></p><p>The deal is seen as critical to BT, as YouView is the advanced set-top box being pushed to customers, and currently only BT customers with its Vision set-top box are able to get Sky Sports.</p><p></p><p><em>• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

        "body":"<p>Suspicions that the vast global currency markets may have been rigged by major banks and traders has sparked the City regulator to launch a formal investigation into the £3tn a day market.</p><p>Royal Bank of Scotland is among the major banks to have been contacted by the Financial Conduct Authority about the investigation, in a blow to the new boss of the bailed-out bank Ross McEwan, who  took the helm at the start of the month.</p><p>The investigation is likely to be on a similar scale to the far-reaching inquiry into interest rate markets that found that traders at a number of major firms had been manipulating the Libor benchmark.</p><p>After gathering information over the last six months, the FCA has now joined with a number of regulators around the world to investigate the dealing activities of banks and their traders in a market that is regarded as the most actively traded anywhere in the world. More than 40% of global forex trading is conducted in London.</p><p>The FCA warned that the investigation could take months to conclude, but if misconduct has taken place, firms and traders could face fines and bans. The watchdog fined Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and money broker Icap for Libor rigging.</p><p>A number of regulators have already launched formal investigations into the foreign exchange markets, including authorities in the US and the markets regulator in Switzerland. They are focusing particularly on the way that a benchmark used to price a wide range of currencies may have been manipulated.</p><p>RBS handed information to the FCA after it scrutinised a series of instant messages sent by a former trader, revealed this week to be Richard Usher, now a top trader at JP Morgan.</p><p>There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Usher – who still works for the Wall Street bank – or any of the firms under investigation. JP Morgan declined to comment.</p><p>Traders are said to have sent instant messages to a group known as the Bandits' Club or the Cartel.</p><p>RBS said: \"We can confirm that we were contacted by the FCA on this matter. Our ongoing enquiry into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and our other regulators.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the FCA said: \"We can confirm that we are conducting investigations alongside a number of other agencies both in the UK and abroad into a number of firms relating to trading on the foreign exchange market.</p><p>\"Our investigations are at an early stage and it will be some time before we conclude whether there has been any misconduct which will lead to enforcement action.\"</p><p>The FCA's announcement came after Hong Kong Monetary Authority admitted it has also begun analysing the foreign exchange markets.</p><p>The scrutiny of the foreign exchange markets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/12/foreign-exchange-rate-benchmarks-investigation\" title=\"\">became apparent after the Bloomberg news agency reported allegations that traders</a> may have been able to influence the way currency benchmarks – used by fund managers to value their investments – were set.</p><p>The benchmarks, run by WM/Reuters, are based on prices during a 60-second trading window and it is suggested that traders were putting in client orders ahead of this crucial trading period.</p><p>The benchmark rates are published hourly for 160 currencies and half hourly for the 21 biggest currencies, including sterling, which are set by calculating the median price of trades taking place in a 60-second window.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420184158|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|263f2955d37690d1186dafac83e8f6b464eabd2d -->",

        "body":"<p>Twitter has chosen the New York Stock Exchange for its forthcoming initial public offering, dealing a blow to the technology-focused Nasdaq market.</p><p>The social media group revealed it had picked the larger exchange in an update to its float prospectus, which also showed a bump in advertising revenues but decelerating growth in users.</p><p>Twitter had 232 million monthly active users by 30 September, up from 218 million at the end of June. This represented a quarter-on-quarter increase of 6.13%, down from 6.9% the previous quarter and an average of over 10% in the previous six quarters.</p><p>Revenue for the nine months to September grew to $422m (£264m), up from $205m the year before. But increased marketing costs meant net losses widened from $71m to $134m.</p><p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/29/nasdaq-10m-fine-facebook-ipo\" title=\"\">bungling Facebook's high-profile float last year</a>, Nasdaq was unable to persuade Twitter to join Google and Apple on its roster of quoted stocks.</p><p>An 11th-hour intervention by the Nasdaq chief executive, Robert Greifeld, who according to Reuters flew to Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on 4 October to make a pitch in person, was ultimately unsuccessful.</p><p>In a statement, Nasdaq said it \"wished Twitter well\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/24/facebook-ipo-mark-zuckerberg-nasdaq\" title=\"\">Computer glitches delayed the start of trading in Facebook shares in May last year</a>, and left many investors with orders processed wrongly or not at all.</p><p>In August, confidence in the robustness of Nasdaq's IT systems was shaken further when it was forced to suspend trading for three hours.</p><p>With its pre-IPO investor roadshow expected to begin on 28 October, Twitter has decided to join professional networking site LinkedIn and internet radio Pandora Media on the NYSE.</p><p>\"This is a decisive win for the NYSE. We are grateful for Twitter's confidence in our platform and look forward to partnering with them,\" said Scott Cutler, head of the exchange's listings business.</p><p>The latest filing shows Twitter's US monthly users accelerated in September, reaching nearly 53 million compared with 49 million in June and 48 million in March.</p><p>Advertising revenues increased 123% during the quarter, said analyst Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research Group, which outstripped his 98% growth forecast. \"This represents a very solid pace of growth,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420112269|2013-10-17T12:53:02Z|bfddfa61b82a28f2a9458feb8e767f8a0b60b588 -->",
