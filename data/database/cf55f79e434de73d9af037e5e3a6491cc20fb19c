        "trailText":"England's coach Stuart Lancaster, who will announce his team on Thursday, has backed Billy Twelvetrees to get it right against the Pumas",
        "headline":"England's Stuart Lancaster backs Billy Twelvetrees against Argentina",
        "body":"<p>Stuart Lancaster will not confirm England's lineup to face Argentina until Thursday but has already made clear he is not planning major surgery to the team which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/03/england-australia-autumn-international-rugby-union\" title=\"\">battled to victory over Australia</a>. Billy Twelvetrees, accordingly, looks set to retain his place in midfield with Lancaster backing the Gloucester centre to deliver against the Pumas.</p><p>While England clearly lacked attacking fluency against the Wallabies at the weekend, Lancaster was happy with the way his young side came back to secure a confidence-boosting victory. With the All Blacks due at Twickenham on Saturday week, he wants to give the bulk of his starting XV another chance to gel, rather than chopping and changing for the sake of it.</p><p>There may yet be a couple of alterations, not least in the front row with Alex Corbisiero set to train fully for the first time on Tuesday following a knee injury, but Twelvetrees has been publicly reassured by the management that he is not about to be instantly jettisoned.</p><p>\"Billy's done pretty well for us and deserves another chance I think,\" stressed Lancaster. \"He is disappointed with one or two areas of his game, but a lot of areas were pretty good. We have to give him credit for that. We'll make the decision over the next 24-48 hours but I'm not envisaging too many changes. There's definitely more in us and we feel we can improve in that [midfield] area.\"</p><p>There is a bigger picture to be considered, too, with Lancaster still a fan of picking an inside-centre with a range of footballing skills as opposed to an up-and-down battering ram. When Twelvetrees, on his debut against Scotland last season, played alongside Manu Tuilagi he was outstanding but Saturday's win over the Wallabies was a completely different style of contest, with few opportunities for England's centres to stretch their legs in attack.</p><p>Northampton's powerful back Luther Burrell would clearly dent a few opponents but Twelvetrees is a better passer and kicker of a ball and plenty of variety will be required in the long term if England are to forge a team capable of winning the 2015 World Cup.</p><p>Privately, the view within the England camp is that Saturday's victory showcased the growing character within the team and that their individual talents will also flourish given more time.</p><p>Lancaster is particularly optimistic about his pack – with an average age of under 25 – which, between them, did not miss a tackle during the entire game. While England may not have achieved much with ball in hand, their defence was mostly excellent and their fitness and strength off the bench contributed to the Wallabies' second-half downfall.</p><p>\"When you look at the young age of the pack and some of the size and athletic ability we have in the forwards we have some good options building now,\" said Lancaster. \"If you put Tom Croft back into the equation along with some of the young lads coming through, we should have a good pack for a while.\"</p><p>Corbisiero and his Northampton team-mate Dylan Hartley are also under consideration to start against the strong-scrummaging Pumas but Geoff Parling, a Test Lion against Australia in the summer, looks set to miss out again in the second row as Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury prepare to be reunited for a second week in a row. Mako Vunipola is recovering from a bang to the knee and Marland Yarde has a sore hip but both are expected to be fit for the weekend.</p><p>The maturing Lawes also reckons England are making strides and thinks the Wallaby victory will prove significant in terms of boosting morale.</p><p>\"As a team it was really good to get the win because we could easily have lost. To not play well and win against an experienced side like that is promising. There's a hell of a lot more to come.\"He also senses England are developing a set of forwards who, physically, can stand toe to toe with anyone. \"When you have got one big hitter in a team it can make a difference. When you have two, three and four big hitters, sides really start to think about who they are going to be running at?</p><p>\"I would probably be the smallest enforcer in the world but I've always had the mindset that you give your body to the fans, to the rugby and the team. What happens, happens. I am not going to back out of a tackle because a guy is bigger.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421641901|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|531bd09c3a9750150d9ea3f3b26bf3e45f6d78cc -->",

        "headline":"Wales's Sam Warburton on a high after the lows for South Africa Test",
        "body":"<p>\"I never saw myself as a captain,\" Sam Warburton says with distinctive honesty. Stepping away from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jul/06/lions-triumph-australia-consequences\" title=\"\">his triumphant role as the leader of the Lions in Australia</a>, and preparing for another autumn series with Wales, Warburton confronts the demons and pressures that often accompany international captaincy in unflinching detail.</p><p>He is a fine openside flanker and, having turned 25 a few weeks ago, on the path towards sealing a monumental career with Wales and the Lions. Warburton is also composed and amiable, and a treat to interview, but he prefers being quiet and solitary on match days rather than a rabble-rousing captain. He even confesses to almost breaking down on the field towards the end of a Test against the world champions New Zealand.</p><p>Leadership was foisted on him at a young age because, invariably, he was his team's best player. Warburton, however, nods emphatically at a suggestion that being singled out as captain went against his instinctive introspection. \"Definitely. When I was growing up my motivation was never to be captain. It was to achieve things like being on a winning Lions tour and World Cups and grand slams.</p><p>\"When I was captaining all my age group sides I thought it would be good for my rugby CV and help me get a contract but I always found it uncomfortable. I probably found it uncomfortable in my first 10 to 15 games as Wales's captain but now I've done it 20 times, and with the Lions, I'm completely comfortable. It took two to three years to reach that position of comfort because it's different captaining your country. You're under the microscope constantly. The toughest thing about [international] captaincy is that if you don't give an eight out of 10 performance then you get criticised and it's suggested you could be dropped. Emotionally, that's difficult.\"</p><p>Warburton picks out the lowest moment of his tenure as captain. \"I remember it as if it was yesterday,\" he says. \"I was sat on a plane, going out to play Leinster, and I thought, 'Oh, I'd love to be that guy instead of me …' He was the guy on the runway doing this [Warburton holds up the imaginary beacons of an aircraft marshall directing planes to and from the gate], waving his hands. I thought how much I'd love to swap places and have a job with no pressure. I texted my mum and said that before a game against New Zealand in an autumn international. There was so much pressure going into that game because people had been criticising me harshly. That whole week's buildup was one of the most difficult I'd ever been through.</p><p>\"I played and by about the 65th minute I knew I'd had a really good game. I would have given myself a nine out of 10. And so then, in the 65th minute, I nearly broke down on the pitch because of the relief. The overwhelming feeling was relief that people could get off my back for a while.\"</p><p>Warburton shakes his head at his own jumbled emotions. \"You go through quite a bit and you have moments when you feel it's not worth it …\"</p><p>He is such a warm and generally positive man that his face soon brightens. \"But then you have moments on a winning Lions tour that completely outweigh any negative thoughts.\"</p><p>Warburton has just written an intriguing book which hints at the complexity of his experiences. The flashes of insight into the bruising vagaries are made all the more immediate by the fact that earlier this year he captained a Wales team who had suffered a record eighth successive defeat. Injury then intervened and, even when he regained full fitness, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/12/sam-warburton-wales-italy-six-nations\" title=\"\">Warburton could not reclaim his place against Italy</a> in February. At that stage of the season, with England unbeaten in the Six Nations and having gained an exhilarating victory over the All Blacks last November, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/15/chris-robshaw-sam-warburton-six-nations\" title=\"\">Chris Robshaw had edged ahead of Warburton in the media-driven race</a>, alongside Brian O'Driscoll, to captain the Lions. In the end, after Wales dismantled England in a tournament-winning finale, Robshaw did not even make the Lions squad.</p><p>But the testing nature of last winter lingers for Warburton. \"The most frustrating thing for me was that I didn't feel I was playing badly. I wasn't missing tackles. I was actually quite happy with my form. But it makes a great story – and once you accept the captaincy you're going to be put in these situations.\"</p><p>Warburton admits that the invasive scrutiny led to a loss of self-belief. \"That really happened. I've always had the utmost belief in my abilities. Ever since I was a kid I've believed I was better than anyone I was playing against. That's not me being arrogant. It's the way you have to think in sport. That self-belief went for a while and Andy McCann [his sports psychologist] had to get me back on track.\"</p><p>Recalled to the team for Wales' penultimate Six Nations match against Scotland, Warburton thrived without the pressure of captaincy. He produced a man of the match performance and then asked the interim coach, Rob Howley, not to offer him his usual leadership role when the stand-in captain, Ryan Jones, was injured. Warburton also played at No6 because of Justin Tipuric's blistering form at openside – and England were humiliated.</p><p>Warburton was touched that Robshaw, despite his disappointment, sent him a supportive text after his captaincy of the Lions was announced. \"It was really nice of him. I see how much attention Chris gets as England captain. He's always under the microscope so I understand what he's going through. But he's a great player and, hopefully, I'll have the chance to play with Chris one day.\"</p><p>Warren Gatland, Warburton's coach with Wales and the Lions, was <a href=\"http://www1.skysports.com/watch/tv-shows/rugby-club/news/8907969/brian-odriscoll-resents-warren-gatlands-decision-to-drop-him\" title=\"\">condemned for his decision to omit O'Driscoll</a> from the 22-man squad for the third Test against Australia. O'Driscoll had played solidly in the first two Tests and his Lions and leadership credentials made him the obvious candidate to replace the injured Warburton as captain.</p><p>\"Obviously, it was a pretty controversial event but I supported Warren by saying you could pick either Brian or Jonathan Davis and they'd do a fantastic job. He took a monumental amount of stick but we won by that huge [41-16] margin. It was probably the most dominant performance against Australia by a northern hemisphere side – ever – so Warren should take credit. He had been under immense pressure but he didn't gloat. He was very humble in victory.\"</p><p>Did Warburton talk to O'Driscoll after he had been dropped? \"No. I didn't want to seem patronising. You just try to act normally. He's been through a lot and so if anyone could handle that it would be Brian – and he handled it great.\"</p><p>After he had been injured during the second Test defeat, Warburton spent part of that evening with his parents and his fiancee, <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/sam-warburton-gets-engaged-girlfriend-2025519\" title=\"\">Rachel</a>. Just before he retreated to bed his mother told him that one of his beloved dogs, Gus, had died back home. \"As four-hour periods go, it was pretty bad. I tore my hamstring, we lost the  second Test and I lost my dog.\"</p><p></p><p>He laughs ruefully. \"My fiancee has only seen me cry twice since we've been together – for seven years –and that was one of the times when I just broke down.\"</p><p>Rachel and Sam have vowed to replace Gus, named after Gus Poyet, with a new Spurs-inspired mutt. \"We're going to get another dog and you're the first to know his name,\" Warburton says as he quips about this rare exclusive. \"We're going to call him Ledley. Ledley King's a real hero of mine.\"</p><p>Before then Warburton confronts another testing autumn of four internationals – bookended by matches against South Africa, this Saturday, and Australia on 30 November. \"I don't watch any rugby normally but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2B0EviQDB0\" title=\"\">South Africa against New Zealand</a> [in last month's titanic Rugby Championship decider] just grabbed me. It was awesome and one of the best games of international rugby I've ever seen.</p><p>\"We've got South Africa first up and it would've been better to play a team lower down the rankings as we've always started slower than we would have liked in past autumn and Six Nations campaigns. So we're going to have to crank up the intensity in training and hit the ground running against South Africa.</p><p>\"But Australia is the most eagerly-awaited match for the Welsh public because we've had some desperately close matches and lost by one or two points. It's probably the eighth time I've played the Aussies in two years. We've broken the pattern of defeats with the Lions and the motivation will be really high going into that match.\"</p><p>Warburton is only three games into his comeback from injury but his place as captain and at No7 for Wales seems assured. \"Justin has been playing really well,\" he says of Tipuric, \"and if I was asked to be part of that combination again [with Warburton at No6] I'd do it because I enjoyed it. But I don't think it would work against South Africa. I think you need a battering ram at six when you're playing such a physical side.\"</p><p>His load is lightened at the Cardiff Blues by a joint decision for him to just be a player. \"The coach, Phil Davies, agreed. It's hard to do captaincy all year round. It would end up pulling you down. Phil knows I'm happy to captain the Blues whenever they need me but it's quite nice that I can be selfish and just concentrate on myself.\"</p><p>Warburton was one of the key performers in the Blues' recovery from their <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/24492700\" title=\"\">shattering loss in the Heineken Cup against Exeter</a> – who led 36-3 at half-time. \"It was like panic stations – real SOS stuff,\" Warburton says of the following week's salvage operation which resulted in victory over the European champions, Toulon, in their next game.</p><p>\"We did lots of team building that week. It was unusual circumstances when you've been part of a victorious team, in the Lions, which is so rare, and to follow that by going 30 points down to Exeter. But Toulon was the best club game I've been involved in by a long shot. It was an incredible turnaround in six days. A lot of the players are quite young and, if anything, it was a lack of confidence and them not knowing how good they could be. Toulon have all these stars but you realise that they're just human and everyone can be put under pressure. It was a valuable lesson for our younger guys.\"</p><p>Warburton sounds as mature as he is resolved after all his personal battles. He has discovered some kind of comfort, at last, in leadership. And it is striking how clear he is when asked if he aspires to emulate his achievement in Australia on the next, far more unforgiving, tour with the Lions – in New Zealand in 2017. \"Absolutely. I have that hunger now – big time. People say it's wrong to look forward to things but I am now. It's a long way away but that's definitely my long-term goal. To win in New Zealand, with the Lions, would be incredible.\"</p><p><em>Sam Warburton's Lions Triumphant: The Captain's Story is published by Simon &amp; Schuster </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421622718|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a8db06421655f65b577a9f5aed3420f298a14449 -->",

        "headline":"Let the Wales weather do its worst, says South Africa's coach Meyer",
        "body":"<p>The first concern of southern hemisphere coaches when they arrive in Cardiff to start preparing for a November international is usually whether the roof of the Millennium Stadium will be closed on the day of the match, but South Africa's Heyneke Meyer is open-minded.</p><p>Both coaches have to agree for the roof to be shut but even though the forecast is for a typically wet week in the Welsh capital after a rare outbreak of sunshine on Monday, Meyer is disposed to letting the elements do their worst for the meeting between the Six Nations champions and the Rugby Championship runners-up on Saturday. He was, though, speaking before he had inspected a pitch badly cut up on the opening weekend of the Rugby League World Cup last month.</p><p>&quot;We need to adapt with the World Cup being held in England in 2015,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;I have always said that there is no bad weather, only soft people, so we have to have the right mindset. Once we start worrying about the conditions or the roof, we are in the wrong mindset.</p><p>&quot;I actually want it to rain this week because that is what we will face in the World Cup; the more the better. The players will have to get stuck in so I do not care what conditions we play in. The team has to be mentally tough to play in all conditions and the worse they are this tour, the better for us.</p><p>&quot;It will be the same for both teams and we have to go out and do the job. I do not believe in preparing players indoors and having a cushy week in the warm. You should train in exactly the same conditions you are going to play in and if any of the guys show they are not mentally tough, they will not be here for the World Cup. I will probably be disappointed if it is sunny on Saturday.&quot;</p><p>Meyer has a full squad to pick from, with the wing Bryan Habana playing 60 minutes for Toulon on Saturday after a month out with a hamstring strain, and he intends to field close to his strongest team while mindful of the need to look at players in readiness for 2015. &quot;Continuity is important but you have to have the World Cup in mind,&quot; the coach added. &quot;We have three tough matches and we have to change the way we play, becoming more clinical. I want to see what some players are made of and whether they can make it to the next level. We learned about others a year ago and they are not here any more.</p><p>&quot;Wales are a strong, balanced side with a simple gameplan, and I do not say that disrespectfully, based on getting over the gain line. The have big backs and big forwards, good in defence and attack, and they are in form. Games between the sides are always close and we will need to be motivated: we are calling this the northern hemisphere tour rather than the end-of-year tour because this is a new start for us.</p><p>&quot;Iwant to finish this tour knowing 25 of my World Cup squad. We need to develop all parts of our game, even the parts that have worked well this year. We won the most turnovers in the Rugby Championship but the breakdown is refereed differently in Europe, with referees allowing more of a contest. Luckily we have Francois Louw, who, as a Bath player, knows what to expect.&quot;</p><p>Wales have brought forward their team announcement by 48 hours to Tuesday. Scott Williams and Liam Williams are set to replace the injured Jamie Roberts and Alex Cuthbert in the centre and on the wing respectively, while Bradley Davies will replace Ian Evans in the second row with the Lion resuming training only this week after an achilles tendon problem.</p><p>&quot;We have had an excellent week's training and all the players are highly motivated. In my view, we are playing the best South Africa side since 2009,&quot; said the Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards. &quot;Anyone who likes a gladiatorial contest should buy a ticket because the Millennium Stadium on Saturday will be no place for the faint-hearted. If we can reached the levels we found against France and England in the Six Nations, we will get close to a very good team.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421616860|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5c3ab9081988b74ed1e2e7821708cdb6a68a8dfd -->",

        "headline":"England's Owen Farrell not fazed by errors in drive to make perfect 10",
        "body":"<p>The first cavilling cry came two minutes into the Test. \"Bloody wake up, England!\" Few crowds are as quick to carp as the ones which gather at Twickenham, where some come, it seems, simply to indulge in a good bit of bellyaching. They have high  standards – they pay high prices – and this nascent England side still seem to fall short of them. Few things infuriate them more than missed kicks and, when Owen Farrell squandered three penalties in short succession against Australia, the murmurs of discontent grew more voluble with each passing minute.</p><p>The team, too, seemed deflated to have earned so little return on the opportunities they had and entered a slump which they snapped out of only in the second half.</p><p>Farrell, though, is not easily deterred. \"Why would you let it affect you?\" he said after the match. \"You've got to move on.\" And he did. He finished the match with 15 points and a try. He also made more  tackles than any player other than Chris Robshaw and more metres than anyone but Marland Yarde and Mike Brown. Still, as he admitted himself, it was a far from perfect performance. At times he stood too deep, though that owes as much to the instructions of the coaches as it does to his own inclinations. Farrell is said to be excellent at following orders and  implementing plans, which is an aspect of his play it is hard to appreciate from the outside. He said that he needs to learn to \"control the tempo more\".</p><p>\"If you focus on what has just happened you are not going to have a grip on the game,\" Farrell said. \"And that is what a 10's job is. Irrespective of how a kick went you still have to back yourself and go again.\" The secret, Farrell said, was to minimise the emotional reaction to the mistake. \"You have got to have a clear head. Work out what went wrong, then put it behind you and move on.\"</p><p>Farrell has always been blessed with the ability to do that. When he was 19 he kicked the match-winning penalty against Gloucester in the Premiership semi-final, despite having missed four of the shots earlier in the match. Richard Wigglesworth and Alex Goode were on the field and had also taken kicks at goal that afternoon. \"It says everything about him that, despite the fact he had missed a couple of kicks,\" Saracens' director of rugby, Mark McCall, said at the time, \"he was the guy who wanted to put his hand up and kick the winning penalty.\" Along with his sound kicking it has always been Farrell's strength of character which stood out, rather than his skill with the ball in hand.</p><p>So Farrell has been pigeon-holed as a pedestrian player, a roundhead who is keeping the more cavalier talents of Freddie Burns and the uncapped George Ford out of the side. <a href=\"http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-article/question-talent-art-graft/83943\" title=\"\">Mike Atherton wrote an essay</a> in the 2013 Wisden Almanack in which he talked about how people are \"prone to this weakness of falling for the kind of talent that a moment of brilliance implies: a breathtaking stroke, a scintillating piece of fielding. As a result we underestimate the gifts given to those who achieve consistently, if not spectacularly.\"</p><p>There is truth in that. And as Atherton says, the kind of qualities Farrell has, \"the more humdrum aspects of the game – the ability to work hard, stay focused, adapt to circumstance, bring your best game time and again despite all the distractions – are all gifts, just as much as sweet ball striking.\"</p><p>Stuart Barnes, a richly gifted player himself, says similar things in an article called Advice for the Aspiring Fly-Half on the RFU's coaching website. \"Some are fortunate to be born with slightly quicker wits and speed of thought. In the press such players are generally regarded as instinctive. The great news is that you can become instinctive; few are born to this particular manor.\" The idea that a player either has natural ability or he does not, Barnes says, is \"all nonsense\". Skills must be learned, honed and perfected.</p><p>Which, it is easy to forget, is what Farrell is doing. He has had his moments this year, flashes of inspiration which belie his reputation, like the long miss-pass he threw to Geoff Parling to set up a try against Scotland in the Six Nations or the cunning grubber he sent through to Mike Brown on the left wing against Wales later in the same tournament.</p><p>On Saturday he spotted, then slipped through, a sliver of a gap for his try. It was a quick switch – had been shaping to pass out to Brown who, he said, was \"screaming for the ball on the wing\" – and a cute move, as was the little chip he produced earlier in the half, which he collected himself after stepping round the defender in front of him. He is 22 and has started only 10 games as England's fly-half. He is already good. And he is going to get better.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421566432|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|10841d1df8e1fd1b5fa7289ae3e92256f6bdd24c -->",

        "headline":"Stuart Lancaster has plenty to ponder before tougher Test for England",
        "body":"<p>Not since Stuart Lancaster's first two games in charge have England been quite so grateful for small mercies. Beforehand all the talk had been about a rousing performance, regardless of outcome. As so often in sport, the opposite came to pass: England will savour this psychologically crucial result despite, for 50 minutes, resembling a team who had barely met each other.</p><p>Little wonder Lancaster sounded mightily relieved as he looked ahead to England's remaining autumn internationals against Argentina and New Zealand. \"I always feel the pressure of winning as England head coach but I felt it here because I knew it would build some momentum and allow the team some space to grow.\" That luxury felt painfully distant as England began the second half trailing 13-6, watched by a Mount Rushmore of frowning 2003 World Cup winners up in the stands.</p><p>In that respect England deserve credit for pulling through, albeit with a nudge or two of good fortune. It might have been a different game had the outstanding Mike Brown been pulled up for a foot in touch near his own line and England also escaped a possible forward pass in the build-up to a charge-down score for Chris Robshaw at the other end of the pitch.</p><p>Poor Scott Fardy was also being treated at the time for a possible spinal injury. While the concussed flanker ultimately escaped any serious damage, the game should probably have been halted as a precaution.</p><p>The steam certainly seemed to drain out of the Wallaby pack and the visitors' composure was still absent when Owen Farrell cut through a gap partially created by Dylan Hartley's considerable frame to score his first international try and give England a lead they never relinquished. While England's mental steel in the final half-hour will not have gone unnoticed by their 2003 predecessors, significant advances still clearly have to be made if they are to lift any trophies in 2015. Top of that list – as it has been for almost a decade – is England's midfield balance. Twickenham and Bermuda are not obviously twinned but, in both cases, there seem to be mysterious triangles into which it is possible to disappear without trace. In this case Billy Twelvetrees, a good player with an enviable range of skills, had one of those days, and his debutant centre partner Joel Tomkins was starkly introduced to the significant difference between club and international rugby union.</p><p>It was not entirely their fault. Expectations of big English forwards rampaging over the gain-line were seldom met, the promised upbeat first-half tempo was more of a funereal trudge and Farrell, at fly-half, is still acquiring the necessary spatial confidence to make centres salivate at the prospect of playing outside him.</p><p>There continue to be occasions when, for all his unshakable temperament, he looks like a centre playing at 10, an ongoing concern in terms of England's creative backline development.</p><p>Rivals such as Freddie Burns, though, do not kick or tackle to the same high standard and Farrell's ability to put mistakes behind him is second to none. Three missed first-half penalties might have destroyed weaker characters and Lancaster said he \"always had confidence\" the 22-year-old would bounce back. \"Ian McGeechan talks about 'Test match animals' and the ability to absorb the pressure of playing under the spotlight. He seems to be able to do that.\"</p><p>Saturday was also another occasion which underlined how tough it is to be a baton-whirling fly-half in the claustrophobic modern game. Farrell's opposite number, Quade Cooper, produced the two best passes of the game, one a sumptuous back-door offload, but was also hampered by the contest's lack of momentum on a blustery afternoon.</p><p>Only when England's spluttering lineout allowed free ball did the Wallabies make much headway, Matt Toomua's crunching finish through Twelvetrees' attempted tackle causing the home crowd to fall quieter than ever. Lancaster, in terms of selection against the Pumas, has to decide whether continuity or further experimentation is the way ahead with the All Blacks looming on Saturday week.</p><p>On pure form there is a case for Luther Burrell's gainline power, with Bath's Kyle Eastmond also available. \"Both Kyle and Luther are genuine options, Luther on form certainly,\"said Lancaster who has added the 19-year-old Bath full-back Anthony Watson to his squad. The Northampton duo – Alex Corbisiero, if fit, and Hartley – must also be close to starting and the scrum-half role will attract further scrutiny.</p><p>Ben Youngs looked sharp when he came on but, having invited Lee Dickson to bring his organisational talents to bear, Lancaster needs to be wary of excessive tinkering. On the plus side England will get better and are starting to win games against southern hemisphere opposition without playing particularly well.</p><p>\"We've won eight out of our last nine games now but it means nothing if we don't turn up, perform and win next weekend,\" cautioned the head coach. \"It's a good start but we're not getting carried away.\"</p><p>A moderate Australian team, who sat out on the pitch at half-time on their tucker-boxes as the 2003 World Cup parade circled them, also have plenty to contemplate. Were this a three-Test series between the sides, the smart money would be on England's scrum securing them a 3-0 whitewash.  Either way the Wallabies will now face Italy in Turin having lost eight of their 11 Tests this year. If the pitches stay soft, the next month will be hard work.</p><p></p><p><strong>England</strong>: <strong>Brown</strong> (Harlequins); <strong>Ashton</strong> (Saracens), <strong>Tomkins</strong> (Saracens), <strong>Twelvetrees</strong> (Gloucester; <strong>Flood</strong>, Leicester, 67), <strong>Yarde</strong> (London Irish); <strong>Farrell</strong> (Saracens), <strong>Dickson</strong> (Northampton, <strong>B Youngs</strong>, Leicester, 55); <strong>M Vunipola</strong> (Saracens; Marler, Harlequins, 55), <strong>T Youngs</strong> (Leicester; Hartley, Northampton, 55), <strong>Cole</strong> (Leicester; Wilson, Bath, 67), <strong>Launchbury</strong> (London Wasps; Attwood, Bath, 76), <strong>Lawes</strong> (Northampton), <strong>Wood</strong> (Northampton), <strong>Robshaw</strong> (Harlequins, capt), <strong>B Vunipola</strong> (Saracens; Morgan, Gloucester, 67).</p><p><strong>Tries</strong> Robshaw, Farrell <strong>Cons</strong> Farrell 2 <strong>Pens</strong> Farrell 2.</p><p><strong>Australia</strong>: <strong>I Folau</strong> (Waratahs); <strong>Ashley-Cooper</strong> (Waratahs), <strong>Kuridrani</strong> (Brumbies), <strong>Toomua</strong> (Brumbies), <strong>Cummins</strong> (Western Force); <strong>Cooper</strong> (Reds), <strong>Genia</strong> (Reds; <strong>White</strong>, Brumbies, 67); <strong>Slipper</strong> (Reds; <strong>Robinson</strong>, Waratahs, 58), <strong>Moore</strong> (Brumbies; S Fainga'a, Reds, 69), <strong>Alexander</strong> (Brumbies; <strong>Kepu</strong> (Waratahs, 51), <strong>Timani</strong> (Waratahs; <strong>Douglas, </strong>Waratahs, 62), <strong>Horwill</strong> (Reds), <strong>Fardy</strong> (Brumbies; <strong>McCalman</strong>, Western Force, 50), <strong>Hooper </strong>(Waratahs), <strong>Mowen</strong> (Brumbies, capt).</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Toomua <strong>Con</strong> Cooper <strong>Pens</strong>: Cooper 2.</p><p><strong>Referee</strong> G Clancy (Ire). <strong>Attendance</strong> 80,691.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421563495|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|0136126af4fb435447fafe7d5facbcca67c97763 -->",

        "body":"<p>Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall was delighted how the Aviva Premiership leaders put last weekend's mauling by title rivals Northampton behind them, as they routed Newcastle Falcons 40-3 at  Allianz Park.</p><p>Former England fly-half Charlie Hodgson marked his first appearance of the season with an 18-point haul in a victory that saw Saracens move two points clear of nearest rivals Northampton at the top of the table.</p><p>Veteran Hodgson was back in action after an achilles injury and scored the opening try, two conversions and three penalties as Sarries bounced back from the 17-16 Heineken Cup defeat to Toulouse and last weekend's 41-20 Premiership hammering at the Saints.</p><p>Wing David Strettle, hooker Jamie George and full-back Alex Goode scored second-half tries to secure a bonus-point win for the leaders before Goode converted Strettle's second try three minutes from time.</p><p>\"It was the complete performance today,\" said McCall.</p><p>\"We had to build some foundations in the first 20 minutes into a very strong wind but overall we are very pleased.</p><p>\"A lot of things which weren't very good last week were very good today. Our set-piece was outstanding, our scrum was good and to keep them try-less was important as our defence last weekend wasn't great.\"</p><p>McCall said of Hodgson: \"He looked like he'd never been away.</p><p>\"He hadn't played for two and a half months and to play that well was fantastic and showed what a class player he is.\"</p><p>The Saracens director of rugby was also heartened by the performances of the younger members of his pack, including try-scoring man of the match hooker George.</p><p>\"There was a lot of energy from Will Fraser, Jackson Wray, George Kruis, Jimmy George – that younger brigade – while full-back Alex Goode was very involved and looked good too.</p><p>\"Across the board we are very pleased because this is the end of a block of nine games [before the LV Cup] and we have 28 points in the Premiership,\" he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards was disappointed to see his side go in 10-3 down at half-time after their promising start.</p><p>Richards said their were \"a huge amount of positives\" but admitted: \"The second half will take a little bit of looking at.</p><p>For 40 minutes they had one chance and scored and I thought we were in with a shout. We'd had a few more chances than them but you have to take your chances. If we had been more clinical we might have been points up rather than conceding a soft try but it's games like today that you learn from.</p><p>\"Some of our boys fronted up very well but you have to keep your patience for 80 minutes and we lost that.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421576030|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5d72ecb82fb621f58e8faa6ddfef1f49731a065c -->",

        "body":"<p>One Wallaby at least was happy with his performance this weekend. When Brian Smith, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/londonirish\" title=\"\">London Irish</a> director of rugby, described <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/28/james-oconnor-london-irish-australia\" title=\"\">James O'Connor last week as the club's biggest ever signing</a> there may have been a few raised eyebrows but, on the strength of his debut in Reading, Smith may just have a point.</p><p>Smith, uniquely an international for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ireland-rugby-union-team\" title=\"\">Ireland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-rugby-union-team\" title=\"\">Australia</a>, has helped pull off quite a coup in signing the 23-year-old O'Connor from beneath the noses of several French clubs with a lot more money to spend than London Irish.</p><p>Smith knows, of course, that O'Connor comes with more baggage than Heathrow could handle. O'Connor, who played at fly-half for the Wallabies in all three <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lions-tour-2013\" title=\"\">Lions Tests last summer</a>, saw his Wallabies contract torn up a few weeks ago after his latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/20/australia-james-oconnor-dropped\" title=\"\">\"alcohol-related\"</a> incident, but on the pitch he remains a potent force.</p><p>The attendance of 7,247 at the Madejski Stadium did not quite rival the crowd at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/02/england-australia-autumn-internationals\" title=\"\">Twickenham</a>, where Australia's suffering supporters were not exactly raising glasses to their absent friend, and O'Connor could not prevent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/northamptonsaints\" title=\"\">Northampton</a> from squeezing a victory and going top of the Premiership for an hour or so.</p><p>But from the moment O'Connor, at full-back six days after arriving in England, sidestepped the young wing Tom Collins to send Topsy Ojo tearing down the touchline, the new recruit helped galvanise the Irish back division.</p><p>Smith said: \"You could hear a pin drop in the changing room after the game, but we played with a lot of spirit and fight and James was outstanding. You have to remember he is just a kid but he has settled down straight away and he showed his class out there, really giving the back three energy. James has got an outstanding skill-set. I think his future for now is at No15 where you really want your best footballer. That's where you have the freedom to express yourself. My concern is that in the past he has been seen as a bit of a jack of all trades.\"</p><p>O'Connor was being diplomatic when he described the atmosphere as \"awesome\" but he certainly had the home support on the edges of a few seats as he helped launch a series of counterattacks in the closing minutes in a move of 25 phases, but the Northampton defence somehow held out.</p><p>\"The club has been great to me and I really wanted to perform out there and not let anyone down. I was blowing a bit towards the end and my fitness levels have to improve but I was pleased with my performance and the only disappointment was the result.\"</p><p>In end the real difference between the sides was the kicking of Stephen Myler. Only Paul Grayson has scored more points for Northampton than their current fly-half, and Myler's contribution of 14 more here was invaluable. Myler was playing behind a pack that dominated the scrums despite the absence of Northampton's England contingent and in which the captain Phil Dowson and the USA international Samu Manoa were outstanding, but the Saints' director of rugby Jim Mallinder admitted that his side were not able to hit the heights of their previous week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/26/northampton-saracens-premiership\" title=\"\">demolition of Saracens,</a> who edged past Northampton at the top after  their win over Newcastle.</p><p>Early on O'Connor looked like being upstaged by a full-back from New Zealand as James Wilson took a smart inside pass from George Pisi to score the first try of the afternoon. The game did not lack passion and London Irish's Samoan flanker Ofisa Treviranus was lucky not to be shown a yellow card for his left jab into the head of another Australian, the tighthead prop Salesi Ma'afu, and O'Connor continued to look dangerous.</p><p>Just before the interval, Irish won a  lineout and a driving maul took them into the Northampton 22. Ian Humphreys and Ojo gave O'Connor the chance the draw his man and slip a perfect pass to the wing Sailosi Tagicakibau, who plunged down for a try in the corner.</p><p>There was a scare after the break when O'Connor collided in mid-air with Tomas O'Leary and Luther Burrell. Burrell was badly shaken up and needed treatment but will be fit if England need him this autumn. And on this evidence Australia will one day certainly need James O'Connor to add to those 44 caps.</p><p><strong>London Irish: </strong>O'Connor; Ojo, Mulchrone, Sheridan, Tagicakibau (Lewington, 77); Humphreys, 0'Leary (capt; Allinson, 77); Yapp, Paice (Parr, 50), Halavatau (Hagan, 50), Gough, Evans, Cowan, Treviranus (Danaher, 78), Hala'ufia (Low, 55).</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Tagicakibau. <strong>Pens</strong> Humphreys 3.</p><p><strong>Northampton</strong>; Wilson; K Pisi, G Pisi (Waldouck, 62), Burrell, Collins; Myler, Fotuali'i; A Waller (E Waller, 70), Haywood (McMillan, 77), Ma'afu (Mercey, 55), Manoa (Nutley, 59), Day, Clark, Dowson (capt), Dickinson (Van Velze, 27).</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Wilson. <strong>Con</strong> Myler. <strong>Pens</strong> Myler 4.</p><p><strong>Referee</strong> A Small. <strong>Att</strong> 7,247.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421569401|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|882ce94f54b40e05dc0d5d64cfdf6b72151be92a -->",

        "headline":"England v Australia: five things we learned in 20-13 victory",
        "body":"<h2>1  Breakdown was unqualified success</h2><p>An area of the game where England struggled at times last year, notably against Australia and Wales, has undergone an overhaul. From the third minute, when pressure at an Australian ruck exerted by Joe Launchbury resulted in a penalty that Owen Farrell converted, England were so competitive and organised in the tackle area that Will Genia had little quick ball to exploit and the Wallabies had to rely on set pieces to launch attacks. Thirteen of England's points came as a result of their effectiveness at the breakdown, Farrell's try coming after they had taken play through 13 phases in their opponents' 22. If there were occasions when England overcommitted, they were rare and generally they got the numbers right, piling in when there was a chance of a turnover with all the forwards, led by Chris Robshaw, below, and Tom Wood, contributing. The game ended as it had started, Australia's final attack snuffed out by Joel Tomkins and Farrell, who choke-tackled Tevita Kuridrani and forced an England scrum.<strong> </strong></p><h2>2  Set pieces were a mixed bag</h2><p><strong> </strong>When England review the lineout they will note the contrast in the statistics of the two hookers. Tom Youngs had six throws, three of which resulted in takes, but Australia helped themselves to two overthrows at the back and there was a not-straight. Dylan Hartley's first successful throw out of five led to the decisive moment of the match: Launchbury caught the ball, Mako Vunipola charged through Quade Cooper to get over the gain-line and 13 phases later, Farrell scored under the posts. Courtney Lawes was calling the lineouts for the first time and Hartley is a club colleague, although Wood noted that England's problems at the lineout stemmed not from the calling but execution of drills.</p><p>Australia lost one throw in 10 and gained their first penalty after an overthrow by Youngs, but England dominated the scrum, awarded five penalties and two free-kicks and not conceding any, although Australia's try came after a move from a scrum.</p><h2>4  Selection invested in youth</h2><p>England's starting line-up was missing five players who had appeared for the Lions in the Test series against Australia, Manu Tuilagi, Ben Youngs, Alex Corbisiero, Geoff Parling and Tom Croft, although Youngs made an impact from the bench. The England head coach Stuart Lancaster had been guided by form, not reputation, and he fielded an inexperienced side which had only one more cap, 213, than Australia's back division. Billy Vunipola, above, justified his selection ahead of Ben Morgan at No8, staying close to the ball and resisting any temptation to stand in wide positions, while Marland Yarde was a threat with the ball in hand, although he conceded a couple of penalties in defence. The new midfield combination of Billy Twelvetrees and Joel Tomkins betrayed its inexperience at times although the former, like the scrum-half Lee Dickson, would have profited from quicker possession.</p><h2>3  Mike Brown flourished at 15</h2><p><strong> </strong>The Harlequin, left, was given his first start at full-back since June last year after a stint on the wing and in a match high on kicks, he carried the ball further than any other player on the field with 125 metres – 18 ahead of his opposite number, Israel Folau. He generally placed his return kicks rather  than just put boot to ball, he was prepared to attack space in his own half and he was a solid last line of defence.  A year ago, Alex Goode looked a fixture in the position, used as a second receiver, and he may come in again  depending on who England settle on at 12, while Ben Foden, in form for Northampton, was an unused replacement on Saturday. England  have not only options but some variety at No15.</p><h2>5 Australia are a side in decline</h2><p>Australia will face England at Twickenham in the World Cup in less than two years and if the men in white promise to be markedly better then, both because of the players they have to return and the extra experience they will have in 2015, the Wallabies look a team in decline. They were dangerous attacking from set pieces, but made little of slow possession and only managed one off-load. They failed to react to the way the breakdown was refereed and at the moment England seized momentum with two tries in the second half, they lacked someone to take hold of the game, unusually for a southern hemisphere side and tamely slipped under the waves. As things stand, they look behind England and Wales in their World Cup group.  Their new coach, Ewen McKenzie, said it was a matter of recalibration, but it seems more complicated than that for the Wallabies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421569186|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|d5a642d77d95c24c1a40e6a67d779ee837fbe70a -->",

        "body":"<h2><strong>Rugby Union: Wade wades in to serve reminder to Lancaster</strong></h2><p>Wasps director of rugby David Young praised winger Christian Wade after his side ran out 32-30 winners in the Aviva Premiership match at <strong>Gloucester</strong>. The result means <strong>Wasps</strong> recorded their first away league win since February as they took a big leap up the table with a bonus-point victory at Kingsholm. Wade scored two  tries, while No8 Nathan Hughes and replacement Guy Thompson were also on the scoreboard, with fly-half Andy Goode claiming 12 points with three conversions and two penalties. \"Nobody else could have scored that try so we probably owe him a victory there,\" Young said of Wade.  <strong>Leicester</strong> director of rugby Richard Cockerill slammed his side for their \"embarrassing\" defensive lapses after they crashed to a 23-16 home defeat by <strong>Harlequins</strong>, who outscored them two tries to one and also leapfrogged them in the table to go fifth. A furious Cockerill said: \"Some of our defence early in the game was embarrassing.\" Quins'  two tries came from Nick Easter and Matt Hopper either side of half-time while Julian Salvi was in the sin-bin. <strong>PA</strong></p><p></p><h2><strong>Golf: Poulter has a chance</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Dustin Johnson gave the chasing pack some hope with a double-bogey on the last to reduce his lead to three shots after the third round of the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai. Despite also making a double-bogey on the 10th, Johnson stood on the 18th tee with his five-shot overnight lead intact thanks to a front nine of 30 for the second day running and four more birdies in succession from the 13th, eventually signing for a final-hole seven and a third round of 66. At 18 under par, Johnson led by three from the defending champion, Ian Poulter, who carded a 63, with Graeme McDowell a shot further back following a 64. Justin Rose, first-round leader Rory McIlroy and Graham DeLaet were all on 12 under. Martin Kaymer was 10 under after setting a course record with a 62. <strong>PA</strong></p><h2></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421540070|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|740780201654724dc8a5e3e56683958058f642e8 -->",

        "headline":"England's Chris Robshaw and Tom Wood put lustre on a rusty display",
        "body":"<p>Stuart Lancaster will be delighted and England should be. Against an Australian team that might have looked to have turned the corner after a win in Rosario and scoring 33 points against the All Blacks in Dunedin, Saturday was just what Lancaster's squad needed to silence those voices in the head that must have been still there after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/16/wales-england-six-nations\" title=\"\">Wales and the Millennium Stadium at the end of the last Six Nations</a>.</p><p>For 50 minutes England looked terribly rusty, unable to put any tempo on the game with the start of the second half a mess, but then Quade Cooper missed for the first time and that triggered a sea change. A dodgy line call led to Chris Robshaw's try and the introduction of Dylan Hartley and Ben Youngs from the bench kept the momentum going.</p><p>Less than two years out from the World Cup, England have beaten one of their rivals to get out of their pool and into the knockout stages and while is was not pretty, far from it,  this set up Lancaster's and England's autumn.</p><p>Regarding his back five, the head coach's decision to stick with his captain – but gamble on a mobile second row – came up trumps and was key to winning a difficult match for a young side with new partnerships together for the first time. The two flankers, Robshaw and Tom Wood, were immense, causing Will Genia all sorts of headaches at the breakdown. If good players have time on the ball, then good defenders rob rivals of time and Genia suffered flankers in the face all afternoon.</p><p>Last year it was the breakdown and Michael Hooper <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/17/england-australia-autumn-international1\" title=\"\">that set up an Australia win at Twickenham</a>; this time Hooper hardly showed and when you have athletes such as Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes getting around the field and making big tackles, and props in the shape of Dan Cole stealing ball at the breakdown, it means that teams such as Australia are living off scraps.</p><p>Faced with a suffocating defence, the tourists' lack of ball-carriers showed, whereas the brothers Vunipola, Mako and Billy, did some eye-catching work, especially in the first half and, after a wobbly start, the set piece also settled down.</p><p>In the scrum there were times when Cole came close to reducing James Slipper to rubble and after the trials and tribulations of the summer with the Lions, Mako Vunipola suggested he is happier with the new laws, even if he will have trouble stealing the shirt from a fit Alex Corbisiero. And the lineout? It got better as the day went on.</p><p>Faced with a couple of losses and one squint throw from Tom Youngs, Lawes, still pretty new to calling the line, did well to hold his nerve and immediately upon Hartley coming on things improved. The Northampton captain threw his first ball to the back, hit his target and from then on, rather than jump mob-handed against Lawes in the middle, Australia had to worry about the whole line. The Northampton lock signed off by calling a series of throws to himself, winning the lot.</p><p>I doubt Lancaster will make too many changes to his midfield, but very soon he is going to have to decide on one that will win him a World Cup quarter-final. Manu Tuilagi will come back, but with whom? Billy Twelvetrees will be disappointed with his attack and defence; he tends to sit too long in defence and that is what happened for Matt Toomua's try. The Gloucester centre has all the skills to make it work, but needs to impress against Argentina next weekend, or Lancaster might be tempted to cross out Twelvetrees's name before the All Blacks.</p><p>Joel Tomkins's inexperience showed, but he will play again next Saturday when I expect Ben Youngs to start at scrum-half, probably with Danny Care on the bench. England need to up the tempo, which they did so successfully in turning the game around, and while Lee Dickson was the form choice, I don't see him as a World Cup-winning No9. Owen Farrell needs someone to inject that pace and the centres outside him suffer the knock-on tribulations if the ball is delayed.</p><p>That said, you have to admire the steel in Farrell's soul. After missing three penalties, and from places where a right-footed fly-half should fancy them, most No10s would have been in pieces, but for a 22-year-old Farrell is remarkably mature. He steadied himself and even spotted the gap manipulated by Hartley's obstruction for the try that left Australia having to play from too deep in their own territory. He is a tough kid.</p><p>Lancaster's easiest call should be at full-back, where Mike Brown was solid under the aerial bombardment and exciting in counterattack. The Harlequin may have got lucky with the touch judge's mistake before Robshaw's try, but the yards he makes out of defence were as encouraging to England as they increased the Australian suffering.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421526111|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|8097e012e76e8bbab4cfb1a9653cc2ac63e8508c -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>You only play in the front row</strong> if you're prepared to be confrontational. You also can't be a loner – you're relying on the two guys next to you for your safety, because people can get badly hurt in the scrum.</p><p><strong>A lot of the maxims that are good for sport do not help you in life.</strong> For instance: \"Never give up, never quit…\"</p><p><strong>I'm adopted, so I'm not like my parents.</strong> But I keep aspiring to their values, of tolerance, of quiet dignity, of work ethic, of decency.</p><p><strong>Sport is very simple: you win or you lose.</strong> There's a comfort in that. But nothing is ever like that again. It's come as a bit of a shock to me: life is not black and white and if you try to live it like that you're going to be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Being a lawyer teaches you to argue rationally.</strong> [Moore is a trained solicitor.] It drives me crazy when people argue with non-sequiturs.</p><p><strong>Someone will always be richer than you,</strong> someone will be better looking. I'm trying to learn to value my achievements, but my head is always saying the next one is the only one that matters. I can't control my competitive streak.</p><p><strong>I'm actually quite an angry man.</strong> The thing that makes me angry at the moment it is people not answering questions. Politicians, local authorities, people from quangos… There's a whole industry teaching people not to answer things, not to tell the truth.</p><p><strong>There's a tendency in this country</strong> for people to be vicariously offended. Get over it: if you're offended by something, stop thinking and reading about it.</p><p><strong>The Lions tour is special</strong> in a way that people who haven't been round it can't really understand. The players who are there are all used to being number one in their country, they're not used to fighting for a place continually.</p><p><strong>You can't buy anything in life that's really important,</strong> and you can't force it either. People's affection, people's friendship – they're not commodities.</p><p><strong>The best I've ever felt on a rugby field</strong> was when David Campese dropped the ball behind his line in the third Test of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOCN4dkyvp4\" title=\"\">Lions series in 1989</a> to make us the first and only Lions side to lose the first Test in a series and still win. That was a very pleasing moment, especially because it was David.</p><p><strong>If I've ever been truly happy </strong>it's been in those fleeting moments you can't manufacture, like this one day we were on the beach in Cornwall and the children designed a sphinx out of sand.</p><p><strong>When I </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianmoore666\" title=\"\"><strong>tweet</strong></a><strong> about opera,</strong> people say: \"Oh, trying to show off are we?\" I say no, it's all culture, it's just that my culture's different to yours. Give me the <em>Magic Flute</em> and a bottle of 1982 Saint-Émilion.</p><p><strong>I had a great wedding day.</strong> Well, I had a few. I'm on my third one, and they were all great.</p><p><br /><em>Brian Moore is part of talkSPORT's commentary team for the British and Irish Lions Tour to Australia on 1089/1053am and DAB (</em><a href=\"http://www.talksport.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>talkSPORT.co.uk</em></a><em>)</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410093083|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|11bf21ec3e162821014636caabc345a75bce7069 -->",

        "headline":"Jonny Wilkinson kicks Toulon to Heineken Cup final win over Clermont",
        "body":"<p>On the day of reckoning, an all-French final, the side that had not lost a single game in the Heineken Cup did just that, failing against Jonny Wilkinson's Toulon. Clermont will be wondering how on earth they let slip a game they seized by the scruff after half-time. Mathieu Bastareaud, who tackled his way to the man of the match award, will not care a jot how his team scrambled to victory. For the record, two Englishmen scored the points that mattered: Wilkinson 11 from three penalties and a conversion, and Delon Armitage with a try.</p><p>For the first 15 minutes there was thunder on the ground, a man-made alternative to any storm in the skies. Rain that had been forecast but wisely kept its distance. The tacklers advanced furiously and the ball-carriers were swept back. The body has become the new object in the game that can be picked up and tossed around. During this period of Rollerball, the two little figures of Wilkinson and Mogan Parra remained sufficiently intact to land a penalty each</p><p>Mercifully for the shoulders of the Toulon captain, the game sprang the locks on its shackles even before the first quarter was out. He had to make a tackle less juddering than the head-on variety when he raced back to stop Wesley Fofana, the centre who was on full alert now that there was a little bit less suffocation. Clermont had others now hungry for the ball. Sitiveni Sivivatu roamed away from the touchline and was slipped a pass that put him into a postage stamp of space. The ex-All Black was stopped only by a tackle of athletic agility by Andrew Sheridan, the prop propelling himself horizontally at the wing.</p><p>Lee Byrne brought a different kind of threat from full-back, chasing and gathering his own kick, a glimpse of his speciality in the Wales grand slam campaign of 2005.</p><p>That was how the openness expressed itself, in snatches, flashes, echoes of days of greater freedom. But nothing lasted; no runner could run clear of the scrambling tacklers.</p><p>Not until Rudi Wulf spilt the ball near the touchline on halfway and Clermont pounced, releasing Brock James. The Australian is not the quickest in the universe but he found himself in a race, in pursuit of his own kick ahead, with Chris Masoe, more hulk than whippet. James beat the No8 but not the dead-ball line. Video review led to a 22 drop-out and the game turned around at half-time still at 3-3.</p><p>The deadlock lasted 90 seconds into the second half. Again, Clermont swooped when they had a whiff of space but this time Toulon could not plug the gap opened up by Aurélien Rougerie in particular, the centre pulling in two defenders before releasing the ball to Napolioni Nalaga, the leading try-scorer in the Heineken Cup this season. It was another straight race, Clermont player against a last defender and a line – the touchline this time. Nalaga won.</p><p>Toulon needed to score quickly as if to give themselves a point of restart in this second half. Wilkinson obliged after a maul was hauled down. Toulon were back, but only until the combination of James and Rougerie struck again. More time passed than 90 seconds but not much when James dinked a little kick over the Toulon three-quarters and Rougerie barged past Wilkinson to regather and slip another fine pass to James. Now there was nobody between the outside-half and the line. Parra added the conversion.</p><p>Toulon rang the changes, taking off Danie Rossouw, who had had a clumsy game, and replacing one ex-Springbok with another, Joe van Niekerk. The 38-year-old Sébastien Bruno left too, the old – Toulon are not exactly in their first flush – giving way to the less venerable. The most influential change was to be Frédéric Michalak, on at scrum-half, and kicking into space to give his team something to pursue in a positive direction. James, retreating, gave away a penalty and Wilkinson reduced the gap to six points.</p><p>Clermont still seemed to be more comfortable with the ball in hand, but Toulon took a leaf from that opening chapter, when to have a body in hand was the name of the game. Fofana set off on a run but was brought down by Bakkies Botha and Van Niekerk. Sivivatu fumbled the pick-up and was stripped by Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe.</p><p>The Argentine wing-forward delivered a one-handed pass to Armitage who strolled over for Toulon's first try in the knock-out stages. Wilkinson converted, not the most difficult kick of his career, but at the end of his penultimate season, for a club that has revitalised his extraordinary career, this mattered.</p><p>He delivered and, remarkably, Toulon were in the lead by a point with 16 minutes left to play.</p><p>They held on, Bastareaud charging down a drop-goal attempt by James, and Sivivatu throwing the last, the very last, try-scoring pass forward. Jonny Wilkinson, king of the elder statesman, had his hands on the Heineken Cup</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409110418|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|12ba753e967c6ddcbe5405e16e5133f5bf80790d -->",

        "headline":"Prince Harry to lead push to expand rugby into inner-city schools",
        "body":"<p>It takes its name from a famous private school and, for some, has long been associated with the Barbour-wearing, Range Rover-driving masses that throng Twickenham whenever England play.</p><p>As part of an effort to change that image the Rugby Football Union (RFU) has launched a new drive to get hundreds more state schools, many of them in inner cities, playing the game to make the most of a hoped-for boom in its profile around the 2015 Rugby World Cup, which will be staged in England.</p><p>Apparently without irony, the Old Etonian Prince Harry has been named as the <a href=\"http://www.rfu.com/news/2013/march/news-articles/070313_all_schools_patron\" title=\"\">patron for the All Schools scheme</a>, with the aim of getting 400 more state schools playing the game by 2015 and 750 more playing by 2019.</p><p>Clusters of three or four schools will be targeted and provided with kit, equipment and resources by the RFU as well as being linked with a local club, which will also provide coaching and ongoing support.</p><p>Steve Grainger, RFU rugby development director, said the programme was aimed both at schools that used to play the game but had dropped the habit and those that had never taken it up, seeking to provide coaching education for teachers who had never played or taught the game.</p><p>\"One of our aims up to 2015 and beyond is to broaden the reach of the game and ensure it is a game that can be played by everyone. It can have a real impact on a school not only from a sporting perspective, but from a behaviour perspective, a values perspective, a discipline perspective,\" he said.</p><p>The RFU estimates that of a total of just over 3,000 secondary schools, about half of them play some form of rugby and about 750 of those play competitive fixtures against other schools.</p><p>Grainger, who was previously chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust, acknowledged that the government's decision to axe £162m in ringfenced funding for a network of school sport partnerships had made the task more difficult but said rugby benefited from a network of willing clubs and volunteers.</p><p>\"We're talking about a three-year investment from us to sustain rugby in these schools. We're not only looking for willing schools, we're looking for willing clubs that have got some capacity and a commitment to work with schools,\" said Grainger.</p><p>In developing links between clubs and schools, the hope is that children can graduate to clubs and help to arrest a decline in the number of teenagers playing competitive rugby, despite a boom in younger children playing \"mini rugby\". Grainger said that many of those chosen would be \"inner-city schools\" in some \"pretty tough environments\".</p><p>\"This is a great way to bring in some new players, some new parents, some new volunteers and new coaches through those teenage years and demonstrating that rugby has as much, if not more, to offer than many other sports.\"</p><p>Those without facilities will be provided with rugby posts or linked with clubs where they can play and the benefits of touch rugby and sevens will also be emphasised for those who may not be suited to the full-contact sport.</p><p>Grainger said: \"There is a perception still that it is an independent school sport. But if you look at the 23 players in the matchday squad against France and take out the three that were educated overseas, 13 of those guys came from the state sector.\"</p><p>The initiative is part of a wider drive to bring rugby union to parts of the country where it is traditionally less popular, ahead of the 2015 World Cup, which will be staged largely in big Premier League football grounds around England.</p><p>The final list of venues will be confirmed on Friday but Old Trafford in Manchester, Elland Road in Leeds, Newcastle's St James' Park and St Mary's in Southampton are among those on the long list.</p><p>\"I don't think there's a perception that it's a poor relation to football, but it just doesn't get the same degree of exposure. One of the things we're finding is that local rugby clubs tend to have an identity in the community that football clubs don't. We're trying to position them at the heart of their local community,\" said Grainger.</p><p>There is an acknowledgement that the RFU failed to capitalise on a surge in popularity for the sport when Sir Clive Woodward led England to the 2003 World Cup and is determined not to repeat the mistakes of that era.</p><p>Before Sunday's Six Nations tie against Italy at Twickenham, which England are expected to win to set up the possibility of a grand slam decider against Wales at the Millennium Stadium, 100 participating state schools will be presented with a rugby shirt made to their own design as part of a programme to learn about the \"core values of rugby\".</p><p>A St James's Palace spokesperson said: \"This patronage will allow Prince Harry to combine his passion for rugby with his work to help children and young people in society to build their skills, confidence and aspirations. Prince Harry recognises that rugby can play an important role in helping to achieve this.\"</p><p>Grainger insisted there was no irony in the appointment of Prince Harry, a regular visitor to Twickenham, as patron: \"This is about adding genuine weight and genuine profile, and hopefully other people getting the opportunities that he had.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405260609|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|b41164ed25af931f233e33ff1beab88d8cb96433 -->",
