Snowden's documents have already shown that it intercepted the top-secret communications of the then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/16/nsa-dmitry-medvedev-g20-summit\">during his visit to Britain for the G20 summit</a> in 2009. The papers also show this information was then shared with high-ranking officials from Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the other members of the &quot;five eyes&quot; spying club. At the same summit, British spies were also snooping on other delegations, specifically from Turkey and South Africa.</p> <p>When the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Services_Act_1994\">Intelligence Services Act was passed in 1994</a>, it included a line – inserted at the last minute – that Britain's spy agencies could legitimately seek intelligence that would support the &quot;economic wellbeing&quot; of the country&quot;. This provision is one of the most opaque in the law and could be interpreted to justify <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/espionage\">espionage</a> on just about any head of state or company chief executive, though this would require ministerial signoff.</p> <p>Would Downing Street want to know Merkel's innermost thoughts? Of course it would. Knowing the mind of the world's most powerful woman would be invaluable during summits and bilateral talks, particularly at a time when Britain's membership of the EU is a source of constant tension.</p> <p>So Cameron probably signed the memorandum with fingers crossed behind his back knowing, perhaps, that Britain may have benefited from the NSA's surveillance on Merkel, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls\">35 other world leaders</a> it targeted.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-526a72d3e4b04921a1f0c394\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-25T14:35:49.239+01:00\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/25/nsa-no-congress-oversight\">comment piece</a>, Florida Democrat Alan Grayson says: &quot;Despite being a member of Congress possessing security clearance, I've learned far more about government spying on me and my fellow citizens from reading media reports than I have from &quot;intelligence&quot; briefings.&quot;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/aug/04/email-exchange-alan-grayson\">requested classified information</a>, and further meetings with NSA officials.

I’ve set out the framework in which the British intelligence services operate. I’m satisfied, as prime minister and the minister effectively for the intelligence services, I’m satisfied that’s a good framework. It’s a framework that works, and above all, you know, at a time when everyone is discussing this issue, let’s remember that the people who do this work, that keeps us safe, that helps to keep us safe, they are people we can never properly thank, we can never properly identify. We can’t have medal parades and ceremonies for the very brave things that they do and so it is worth saying every now and again on a public platform these are some of the most talented and bright and hard-working and dedicated officials in our country. They love our country.

Let me say this, though, about what Mr Snowden has effectively done, and what some newspapers are assisting in doing, and that is going to make it a lot more difficult to keep our countries and our people safe.</p> <p>You know, we do have to take a sort of cold, hard look at this. As we stand today there are lots of people in the world who want to do us harm, who want to blow up our families, who want to maim people in our countries. That is the facts. It’s not a pleasant fact but it is true. We see it with what happened recently in Kenya, we see it with what happened to, you know, whether it was Italians or British people in In Amenas in Algeria, we’ve seen appalling attacks on British soil, we’ve seen appalling attacks throughout Europe.</p> <p>That is the threat that we face. And so we have a choice: do we maintain properly funded, properly governed intelligence and security services that can gather intelligence on these people using all the modern techniques to make sure that we can try to get ahead of them and stop them? Or do we stop doing that?</p> <p>And the point is what Snowden is doing, and to an extent what the newspapers are doing in helping him doing what he’s doing, is frankly signalling to people who mean to do us harm how to evade and avoid intelligence and surveillance and other techniques. That is not going to make our world safer. It is going to make our world more dangerous.</p> <p>And the first priority of a prime minister is to help try and keep your country safe, and that means not having some la di da, airy fairy view about what this all means, it’s understanding intelligence and security services do an important job.</p> <p>Yes, they need to be governed under law. Yes, they must be scrutinised by parliament, but we need those people; they’re brave people who help to keep us safe. And I’ve lost count of the plots that I’ve seen and the problems that I’ve seen being avoided by the work that they do. And that is really important, not just for Britain, but the information we gather, that we then share with other countries in Europe, has helped those countries in Europe too.</p> <p>So I make no apology for the fact that we have intelligence services, we will maintain intelligence services, and I will back the work they do, and I will criticise, though, those that, you know, make public some of the techniques they use because that is helping our enemies.

I think that is important. We all have secret intelligence services, as other countries do, but we don’t give a running commentary on what they do, we don’t comment on their work. That is very important.</p> <p>But let me make two points about the sort of framework for this. The first is I think the leaders of the European Union issued a good and sensible statement last night, about this matter, and I agree with that statement.</p> <p>And the second thing is specifically for Britain, but this applies to other countries as well, because remember this is a national responsibility, these intelligence agencies are a national responsibility, there’s no EU competence here, there's no EU drift here, and at the national level every national leader needs to be confident that their security services are properly overseen. Now in the United Kingdom we have proper parliamentary scrutiny through the intelligence and security committee, the ISC in parliament; we’ve strengthened that oversight. Everything that’s done is done within a framework of proper law. And wee also have intelligence commissioners to oversee the work of these agencies.</p> <p>So I’m satisfied that our intelligence agencies are properly governed, properly run, act under the law, and are subject to parliamentary scrutiny. And that is very important. </p> <p>But let me also say this: the work they do is very important. As prime minister I get to see that work at first hand.

On the eve of their departure, France cancelled their visit and hardened their tone demanding that [French intelligence officials] Bernard Barbier and Patrick Pailloux be given a hearing at the NSA on 12 April 2013.

We will put all efforts into forging a joint understanding by the end of the year for the co-operation of the [intelligence] agencies between Germany and the US and France and the US, to create a framework for the co-operation … It's not just about me but about every German citizen. We need to have trust in our allies and partners, and this trust must now be established once again. I repeat that spying among friends is not at all acceptable against anyone, and that goes for every citizen in Germany.</p> </blockquote> <p>The United States has a &quot;no-spying&quot; deal with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, an alliance known as &quot;Five Eyes&quot; that was formed after the second world war. But there has traditionally been a reluctance to make similar arrangements with other allies. Merkel said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are in Afghanistan together. Our soldiers experience life threatening situations. They sometimes die in the same battle. The friendship and partnership between the European member states, including Germany, and the United States is not a one-way street. We depend on it. But there are good reasons that the United States also needs friends in the world.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Francois Hollande</strong>, French president:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What is at stake is preserving our relations with the United States. They should not be changed because of what has happened. But trust has to be restored and reinforced.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Mark Rutte</strong>, Dutch prime minister:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will support [Merkel] completely in her complaint and say that this is not acceptable. I think we need all the facts on the table first.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Enrico Letta</strong>, Italian prime minister</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want the truth. It is not in the least bit conceivable that activity of this type could be acceptable.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fredrik Reinfeldt</strong>, the Swedish prime minister, called it &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; for a country to eavesdrop on an allied leader.</p> <p><strong>Jose Manuel Barroso</strong>, the president of the European commission, said that eavesdropping on phone calls or emails was particularly objectionable because it recalled the totalitarian regimes of Europe’s recent past. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At least in Europe, we consider the right to privacy a fundamental right and it is a very serious matter. We cannot, let's say, pretend it is just something accessory. To speak about Chancellor Merkel, in Germany there was a part of Germany where there was a political police that was spying on people's lives every day [the East German Stasi]. So we know very recently what totalitarianism means. And we know very well what comes, what happens when the state uses powers that intrude in people's lives. So it is a very important issue, not only for Germany but for Europe in general.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-77d50ef6-eae1-424f-ac34-d92e5b3b6910\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/23/1322052667192/The-Stasi-East-German-Min-007.jpg\" alt=\"The Stasi, East German Ministry of State Security, archives office in Berlin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The Stasi archives office in Berlin.

The NSA does listen to the content of some of those phone calls. It also monitors the online and phone calls of foreign citizens.</p> <p>— Emails, instant messages and Facebook posts, as well as contact lists and raw internet traffic.

Even Merkel seems to have lost faith in that promise by now. One doesn't dare imagine how Obama's secret services deal with enemy states, when we see how they treat their closest allies. Barack Obama is not a Nobel Peace Prize Winner, he is a troublemaker.”</p> <p><strong>Die Zeit</strong> writes that Obama's “half-hearted denial” of the allegations raised more new questions that it answered: “Was Merkel's mobile the target of NSA surveillance in the past?” The paper adds: “It is time for Obama and the US Congress to be ruthlessly transparent about the macabre practices of the NSA and restrain them strongly. They promised it months ago, but until recently very little has happened. With each revelation trust is eroded further. If America wants to stop annoying its friends and allies, it only has one option: get on the front foot and be open.”</p> <p>In the <strong>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</strong>, Georg Mascolo and Ben Scott warn of the creation of a “digital Maginot line” between Europe and the US, and instead call for a “no spy treaty” between European countries. “Storing data and surveillance would only be allowed for previously agreed goals – the fight against terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as grave acts of crime. All forms of political and economic espionage would be banned. The privacy of every EU citizen has be respected by each EU secret service as if they were their own.”</p> <p><strong>Germany's data protection commissioner Peter Schaar</strong> said that the reports shows “the absurdity of politicians trying to draw to a close the debate about surveillance of everyday communication here.” He went as far as saying that it had been “irresponsible” of politicians not to be more upfront in calling for the US to clear up the matter.”</p> <p><strong>Anke Domscheit-Berg of the German Pirate Party</strong>, told the Guardian: &quot;In the past few months, chancellor Merkel did very little to make the US government answer all those questions that should have had highest political priority. Now she gets a taste of what it feels like when foreign secret services spy on all your communication. We have stopped trusting empty promises and so should Angela Merkel.

I also wrote that “No one lied about the various programs” Snowden disclosed. But then we found out that James Clapper did. The director of national intelligence was asked at a Senate hearing in March if “<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/james-clappers-least-untruthful-statement-to-the-senate/2013/06/11/e50677a8-d2d8-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_blog.html\">the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is completely false</a>” and he replied that it was.

It alerted me to the fact that even in this great country of ours with this fantastic Constitution, there’s a real pressure against press freedoms that’s going on. Perhaps unintentionally in the hot pursuit of leakers and trying to protect secrets, we are really putting pressure on press freedom here.

We'd like to know what you think about the whole NSA story, what you're worried about – and any new areas you'd like to read more about.</em></p> <p>Good morning and welcome to this week’s NSA live blog, with live coverage of all major developments resulting from Edward Snowden’s leak of information about US and UK surveillance to the Guardian.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\">Le Monde</a> has today published details from files leaked by Snowden, and we’ll have more details on their stories shortly.</p> <p>Here are today’s headlines:</p> <p>•&nbsp;<strong>The former cabinet minister Chris Huhne has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/20/gchq-tempora-chris-huhne-surveillance\">called for an investigation</a> into which<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\"> Labour</a> cabinet ministers signed off<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\"> GCHQ's Tempora programme</a>, the clandestine electronic surveillance programme revealed by leaks from the former US intelligence contractor<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\"> Edward Snowden</a>.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Huhne, the Liberal Democrat who resigned from parliament after being jailed over lying about a speeding offence, has revealed<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/06/cabinet-gchq-surveillance-spying-huhne\"> the cabinet was not informed about Tempora</a>, which was tested in 2008 and fully implemented in 2011.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/20/parliament-forsaken-liberty-law-last-resort\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, the former member of the coalition's national security council asks whether the Labour cabinet was similarly kept in the dark and suggests the decision to authorise the programme could yet be made subject to judicial review.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/20/parliament-forsaken-liberty-law-last-resort\">Huhne’s full Guardian article here</a>.</p> <p><strong>•&nbsp;With some Conservative MPs planning in a parliamentary debate <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/calendar/#!/calendar/Commons/WestminsterHall/2013/10/22/events.html\">tomorrow</a> to make the case for the prosecution of the Guardian over the Snowden disclosures, the US ambassador to Britain, Matthew Barzun, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/edward-snowden-leaks-ambassador-guardian-matthew-barzun\">rejected an opportunity to criticise the newspaper on Sunday</a>, saying he wanted to focus on the importance of the debate about the tradeoffs between security and privacy.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Barzun was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b03fns2l/The_Andrew_Marr_Show_20_10_2013/\">appearing</a> on the BBC's<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0080bbs\"> Andrew Marr Show</a> for the first time since his arrival in London in June, and talked about the impact of the debate on national security created by Snowden's leaks. He also stressed that President Barack Obama was clear that his response to the leaks should not have &quot;a chilling effect on the press&quot;.</p> <p>Asked if he shared the UK security services' concerns about the threat to national security from the leaks, he said he wanted to focus on the &quot;importance of having this debate about what the trade-offs are between security and privacy, between transparency and secrecy, and to do so in a way that protects whistleblowers – which is different, by the way, from wholesale releasing of information, hundreds of thousands of documents&quot;.</p> <p>Barzun said Obama had &quot;promised to seek to balance the legitimate security concerns of not only our citizens but of our allies, and balance those with the privacy concerns shared by all people&quot;. He said the president &quot;put in specific measures to protect whistleblowers if they see something illegal or unethical. That's an important part of the balance&quot;.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>•&nbsp;Harold Evans, the former editor of the Sunday Times and the Times, has<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/20/media-duty-scrutinise-use-of-power\"> come to the defence of the Guardian for its reporting of the Snowden leaks</a>.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;No editor in his right mind wants to give aid to murderous enemies,&quot; he writes, &quot;but every editor is duty bound to scrutinise the use of power, responsibly but fearlessly, however personally unappealing a leaker may be. Conflict between the conceptions of duty is inevitable, indeed healthy. Reporting often exposes an ill that government has not recognised or acknowledged.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>•&nbsp;Mexico has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/mexico-condemns-us-nsa-hacking-presidents-emails\">criticised</a> the United States over new allegations of spying after a German magazine reported that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had hacked Felipe Calderon's public email account while he was president.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Der Spiegel said in May 2010, an NSA division known as &quot;Tailored Access Operations&quot; reported it had gained access to then-president Calderon's email account, and turned his office into a &quot;lucrative&quot; source of information.</p> <p>It said details of the alleged NSA hacking of Calderon's account were contained in a document leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Snowden's leaked information has prompted angry recriminations against Washington in Latin America, particularly Brazil.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read last week’s live blog <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/14/nsa-files-live-coverage-of-all-developments-and-reaction\">here</a>.

        "body":"<p>Unlike her predecessors, Angela Merkel has been an enthusiastic user of her mobile phone, earning her the epithet \"die Handy-Kanzlerin\", or \"mobile chancellor\". She even forgot to switch her phone off during a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgy9kHVrCX8\" title=\"YouTube\">speech in front of the German employers' association</a> in 2011. When asked how he had communicated with Merkel during an EU summit in Brussels in 2008, the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy had said: \"We call each other's mobiles and write text messages.\"</p><p>With so much diplomacy happening directly on the chancellor's mobile, security services have increasingly tried to make her phone safe from bugging. In 2009, it was reported that Merkel had fitted her Nokia with an encryption chip by Düsseldorf IT company Secusmart. As many as 5,250 other ministers, advisers and important civil servants were supplied with similar state-of-the-art encryption technology.</p><p>Only in March this year, Merkel was given a new mobile, a Secusmart Blackberry, which the company now advertises as the <a href=\"http://mobil.teltarif.de/secusmart-kanzler-handy-blackberry-z10/news/52747.html\" title=\"\">\"Chancellor Phone\"</a>. According to the company's press release, the new phone allows politicians to switch easily between three modes of communication: private chats, confidential conversations and high-security data transfers. In the past, some politicians had to carry around three separate phones for the same purpose.</p><p>US president Obama's dependency on his Blackberry – and his <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/sep/9/tech-challenge-obama-has-trouble-iphone/\" title=\"Washington Times\">inability to handle an iPhone</a> – have been the source of much amusement in the American press.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420807635|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|9d405298593dd4b3d0dd814be213856abc871d68 -->",

        "headline":"Merkel spying claim: with allies like these, who needs enemies?",
        "body":"<p>For the third time in a week, Barack Obama has found himself trying to placate the leaders of closely allied nations who have discovered the extent of NSA surveillance in their countries. As the flood of spying scandals threatens to engulf the White House, it has raised the question over whether the negotiating edge such secret eavesdropping provides is worth the reputational damage to Washington once it is secret no more, mostly as a result of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">revelations of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden</a>.</p><p>With each leak, American soft power haemorrhages, and hard power threatens to seep away with it.</p><p>At the summit level, deal-making is personal. Now that the US under Obama has acknowledged it cannot act alone on the world stage, relationships between leaders can make the difference between success and failure. The recent wrangling over Syria in the UN security council is a recent and vivid illustration.</p><p>Yet nothing could be more personal for a foreign leader than to find their own mobile phones tapped by a nation they considered an essential friend and ally. That appears to be the case for Angela Merkel, as it has been for Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto. The other humiliating phone call of the week was on Monday with François Hollande, whose phone was not bugged as far as he knew, but who demanded an explanation for the revelation – once more from the Snowden files – that the NSA had been recording tens of millions of French phone calls a month. The White House was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/us-french-surveillance-legitimate-questions\" title=\"\">forced to admit</a> that the evidence raised \"legitimate questions for our friends and allies\".</p><p>Top of that list of questions is what exactly does it mean to be an American ally in the 21st century. Germany and France are Nato partners. Their soldiers have fought and died alongside American troops in Afghanistan. Mexico is fighting a bloody battle with drug cartels with America and on its behalf.</p><p>The Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, whose phone was also monitored by the NSA, was an American critic but by no means an adversary.</p><p>The same sort of questions are being asked of Britain, after the Guardian revealed that GCHQ <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/16/gchq-intercepted-communications-g20-summits\" title=\"\">spied on the delegations</a> the UK had invited to the lavishly staged G20 summit in London. It turned out that the handy internet cafe laid on for foreign diplomats had been rigged up specifically so that GCHQ could read outgoing emails. Among the targets were the finance minister and other officials from Turkey, another Nato ally that considered Britain to be its closest friend in Europe, and a close partner over Syria. Turkish officials say their faith in the UK is now far more guarded.</p><p>Belgium, another old ally, found evidence its main telecoms provider, Belgacom, had undergone a powerful cyber attack apparently from GCHQ, in a scheme codenamed Operation Socialist aimed at \"better exploitation\" of Belgian communications.</p><p>It is clear from the trove of documents leaked by Snowden that the only protection against NSA or GCHQ intrusion is membership of Five Eyes: the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>New members do not seem to be welcome, and the lesson is that outside that tight circle, it does not matter how senior you are, and how close a friend you think you are to Washington or London, your communications could easily be being shared among the handful of white, English-speaking nations with membership privileges.</p><p>So far, most of the damage sustained by the US and UK has been reputational and rhetorical. Some of the accusers, Hollande in particular, are well aware that their own intelligence services are up to the same tricks, if not quite so adept and well-equipped. Essential national interests demand that the core relationship is maintained.</p><p>But there are signs too of deeper damage. Rousseff is calling for the constructional of a national internet infrastructure that would lock out US-based corporations, and is trying to rally other emerging powers to the cause.</p><p>The European parliament, meanwhile, has this week passed legislation, restricting the ability of US telecoms firms to export European user data to the US, on pain of swingeing fines. Thanks to Snowden, the advantages offered by American technological dominance and Britain's position as European gateway to the world's fibre-optic cables, are beginning to turn into burdens through overuse.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420799833|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|13df6d96599fd98e00ed5eaaad189a0925e9dfb5 -->",

        "headline":"The NSA scandal puts Europe to the test",
        "body":"<p>On one level we should hardly be shocked by the revelations that the National Security Agency has been tapping our phones and monitoring our metadata. The thing about secret services that is not so secret is that they all spy on each other. Some, like the Americans, probably do it better than others. Countless Hollywood movies and BBC dramas about spooks and covert operations have brought this reality into our living rooms. Yet we probably laboured under the assumption that our spies were only after the \"bad guys\" – those broadly falling inside George Bush's definition of the \"axis of evil\" – not our friends and allies.</p><p>Angela Merkel's discovery that her personal mobile phone had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/angela-merkel-bugging-snowden-leaks-mp\" title=\"\">a target of NSA hacking</a> disrupted this week's EU summit. The relationship she nurtured with the US president was suddenly undermined by questions about the true level of trust she thought they enjoyed. She was not alone, though. Leaked NSA memos revealed by the Guardian suggest up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls\" title=\"\">35 world leaders</a> have been similarly treated. But this is not just an elite spying exercise. The NSA has been trawling through 70m communications from French citizens in the space of just one month. This is spying on a massive scale and clearly not exclusively directed at combating terrorism.</p><p>A case can be made for secret services to monitor phone calls and internet use of suspected terrorists or criminal gangs under the supervision of a judge or a minister who can be held accountable, but the systematic hacking of world leaders goes way beyond the bounds of good behaviour; it would be a very ugly world if no one could be trusted.</p><p>We should now be asking whether we have entered an Orwellian world of \"thought crimes\" and \"Big Brother\". The anti-terrorism measures we are taking are having a deleterious effect on our civil liberties – our right to privacy and freedom to go about our business without fear that we are being monitored. The Snowden revelations have pointed to NSA \"back door\" spyware being implanted in devices at the point of manufacture and of internet and social media giants being compromised. Data stored on servers on US soil is no longer above suspicion, and who knows what happens to our airline passenger data that is collected every time we take a flight?</p><p>Only last week MEPs voted to recommend the suspension of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/eu-threat-us-data-sharing-terrorist-funding\" title=\"\">a controversial EU-US financial data-sharing agreement</a> to assist with the US <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/eu-threat-us-data-sharing-terrorist-funding\" title=\"\">terrorist finance tracking programme</a>. The agreement allows the US department for homeland security to access data from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_Finance_Tracking_Program\" title=\"\">the Swift database</a> (the conduit for all global financial transactions). Parliament had reluctantly accepted the agreement, following the personal intervention of Joe Biden, the US vice-president, and on condition of extra privacy safeguards. But allegations broadcast on Brazilian TV suggest that the system was hacked illegally. In light of all the evidence and new revelations, the US does not deserve the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>The spying scandal will now put Europe to the test. It must show that it is both willing and able to protect the rights of European citizens and uphold its core principles. The European Commission and member states should translate their indignation into a firm response, not brush the scandal under the carpet, for there will surely be more to come. Parliament's recommendation to suspend the exchange of Swift data requires a proposal from the commission and backing from two-thirds of EU member states. They should dangle this like a sword of Damocles over the heads of the Americans: that co-operation will be halted if the snooping on allies does not stop.</p><p>Second, no final agreement on a transatlantic trade and investment agreement between the EU and US can be concluded until this issue has been satisfactorily resolved.  I would not recommend halting negotiations since a transatlantic free-trade area is manifestly in our own interests, but there will undoubtedly be chapters related to data privacy and regulation of online services that would be problematic in the current climate.</p><p>Third, the EU is updating its data protection legislation in light of developments in digital and online technology over the last 15 years. The legislation was voted at committee stage last week and is due to be completed before the end of the current European parliamentary mandate in June next year. Indeed, this legislation is urgently needed so that nationals of all member states are equally protected from unauthorised data gathering.  The US spying scandals have also forced the issue of extra-territoriality into the foreground. MEPs have reinserted the <a href=\"http://www.dataguidance.com/news.asp?id=2120\" title=\"\">\"anti-Fisa\" clause</a>, enabling the blocking of surveillance by foreign law-enforcement bodies, despite lobbying by the US administration to drop it.</p><p>Guaranteeing national security is no easy matter and often pits one right against another. There will always be those who want more security or more privacy.  What matters is knowing what is being done to protect our freedom so we can judge for ourselves and hold our politicians to account for the balance they strike. Without accountability, the state becomes all-powerful and we slip from democracy to dictatorship. The US (and possibly other countries participating in their programme or operating similar schemes) have been put in the spotlight and now have a duty to explain themselves to those they represent and serve.</p><p></p><p>Governments have a duty to look after our safety, but in a free and open democracy they also have a duty to look after our liberty. In some countries, not least those in the Arab world fighting for their rights and freedoms, many are prepared to risk their lives for liberty. It is a sobering thought for all those who bear the responsibility of government.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420972815|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5acacfe2becbba483f4071fa849694a2b5880929 -->",

The German chancellor found the evidence substantial enough to call the White House and demand clarification.</p><p>The outrage in Berlin came days after President François Hollande of France also called the White House to confront  Obama with reports that the NSA was targeting the private phone calls and text messages of millions of French people.</p><p>While European leaders have generally been keen to play down the impact of the whistleblowing disclosures in recent months, events in the EU's two biggest countries this week threatened an upward spiral of lack of trust in transatlantic relations.</p><p>Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, made plain that Merkel upbraided Obama unusually sharply and also voiced exasperation at the slowness of the Americans to respond to detailed questions on the NSA scandal since the Snowden revelations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">first appeared in the Guardian in June</a>.</p><p>Merkel told Obama that \"she unmistakably disapproves of and views as completely unacceptable such practices, if the indications are authenticated,\" Seifert said. \"This would be a serious breach of confidence. Such practices have to be halted immediately.\"</p><p>The sharpness of the German complaint direct to an American president strongly suggested that Berlin had no doubt about the grounds for protest. Seibert voiced irritation that the Germans had waited for months for proper answers from Washington to Berlin on the NSA operations.</p><p>Merkel told Obama she expected the Americans \"to supply information over the possible scale of such eavesdropping practices against Germany and reply to questions that the federal government asked months ago\", Seibert said.</p><p>The White House responded that Merkel's mobile is not being tapped. \"The president assured the chancellor that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor,\" said a statement from Jay Carney, the White House spokesman.</p><p>But Berlin promptly signalled that the rebuttal referred to the present and the future and did not deny that Merkel's communications had been monitored in the past.</p><p>Asked by the Guardian if the US had monitored the German chancellor's phone in the past, a top White House official declined to deny that it had.</p><p>Caitlin Hayden, the White House's National Security Council spokeswoman, said: \"The United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of Chancellor Merkel. Beyond that, I'm not in a position to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity.\"</p><p>Obama and Merkel, the White House said, \"agreed to intensify further the co-operation between our intelligence services with the goal of protecting the security of both countries and of our partners, as well as protecting the privacy of our citizens.\"</p><p>The explosive new row came on the eve of an EU summit in Brussels opening on Thursday afternoon. Following reports by Le Monde this week about the huge scale of US surveillance of France, Hollande insisted that the issue be raised at a summit which, by coincidence, is largely devoted to the \"digital\" economy in Europe. Hollande also phoned Obama to protest and insist on a full explanation, but received only the stock US response that the Americans were examining their intelligence practices and seeking to balance security and privacy imperatives, according to the Elysee Palace.</p><p>The French demand for a summit debate had gained little traction in Europe. On Wednesday morning, briefing privately on the business of the summit, senior German officials made minimal mention of the surveillance scandal. But by Wednesday evening that had shifted radically. The Germans publicly insisted that the activities of the US intelligence services in Europe be put on a new legal basis.</p><p>\"The [German] federal government, as a close ally and partner of the USA, expects in the future a clear contractual basis for the activity of the services and their cooperation,\" Merkel told Obama.</p><p>In 2009, it was reported that Merkel had fitted her phone with an encryption chip to stop it being bugged. As many as 5,250 other ministers, advisers and important civil servants were supplied with similar state-of-the-art encryption technology. Merkel is known to be a keen mobile user and has been nicknamed \"die Handy-Kanzlerin\" (\"Handy\" being the German word for mobile phone).</p><p>When asked how he had communicated with Merkel during an EU summit in Brussels in 2008, then French president Nicolas Sarkozy said: \"We call each other's mobiles and write text messages.\"</p><p>Katrin Goring-Eckhart, parliamentary leader of the Greens, said: \"If these allegations turn out to be true, we are dealing with an incredible scandal and an unprecedented breach of trust between the two countries, for which there can be no justification.\"</p><p>On social media, a number of Germans mocked Merkel's change of tone over the NSA affair, given her previous reluctance to talk about the controversy. Jens König, a reporter for the news weekly Stern, tweeted that it was \"the first time that Merkel is showing some proper passion during the NSA affair\".</p><p>The European Commission has thrown its weight behind new European Parliament proposals for rules governing the transfer of data from Europe to America and demanded that the forthcoming summit finalise the new regime by next spring.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/merkel-calls-obama-over-suspicions-us-tapped-her-mobile-phone-a-929642.html\" title=\"\">a</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420795449|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|de9f4f81a80dc49c87e5ba81b03d63eda5ef624c -->",

        "body":"<p>The international debate prompted by the leaking of the NSA files by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden led to the disclosure that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel's mobile telephone was allegedly monitored by the US</a>, a Labour MP has claimed.</p><p></p><p>David Winnick, a member of the home affairs select committee, said the disclosure showed it was right for parliament to hold a debate on an \"orchestrated campaign of intimidation\" against the Guardian, which has published a series of articles about mass surveillance based on the leaked NSA files.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after Winnick spoke it was announced that parliament would hold a three-hour debate next week on the oversight of the UK's spying agencies.</p><p></p><p>The debate, which will be held in Westminster Hall, was granted after an application by Julian Huppert, the Liberal Democrat MP and civil liberties campaigner, Tom Watson, the Labour MP who investigated phone hacking, and Dominic Raab, the Tory MP who led a rebellion against the communications data bill, otherwise known as the \"snooper's charter\".</p><p></p><p>The debate will be held next Thursday afternoon and follows one led by Tory MP Julian Smith to highlight his call to the Metropolitan police to investigate whether the Guardian has broken the law.</p><p></p><p>The announcement of the debate came as the allegation that the US National Security Agency monitored Merkel's mobile phone threatened to overshadow a two-day European summit that opens in Brussels on Thursday afternoon.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/us-french-surveillance-legitimate-questions\" title=\"\">François Hollande, the French president, who complained to the White House earlier this week</a> when Le Monde reported that the NSA was targeting the private phone calls and text messages of millions of French people, is expected to discuss the latest surveillance allegations with Merkel in Brussels.</p><p></p><p>Downing Street indicated that David Cameron was unlikely to join Hollande in calling for the matter to be formally placed on the summit agenda. Asked whether the prime minister has received assurances from the US that his phone has not been bugged, the spokesman said: \"I am not going to comment on matters of security or intelligence.\"</p><p></p><p>Asked whether Cameron had any views about the monitoring of Merkel's phone, the spokesman said: \"Again, I am not going to comment. Same answer.\"</p><p></p><p>David Winnick said the allegations about the monitoring of Merkel's mobile telephone would not have been aired without the Snowden leaks.</p><p></p><p>Speaking during the weekly session of business questions in the Commons, Winnick said: \"Would the leader [of the Commons] agree that if we had a debate in the chamber on the orchestrated campaign of intimidation against the Guardian newspaper, that would be an opportunity for some of us to point out that if it hadn't been for the Snowden disclosures the fact that the German chancellor's mobile phone had been monitored for some time by the US intelligence gathering would not have been known?</p><p></p><p>\"Surely the message should be about Snowden, let's have more disclosures because undoubtedly what the Guardian is publishing is in the national interest.\"</p><p></p><p>Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader of the Commons, said: \"Clearly I don't agree with him in terms of what he says is an orchestrated campaign against the Guardian newspaper. I think clearly there is a need for the issues of public interest the Guardian wants to highlight to be balanced with any security implications of any material they put out into the public domain.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420851712|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|83f80af14456ef569433876975b37e327062f630 -->",

        "body":"<p>Reports of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel's phone being monitored by the US National Security Agency</a> were met in Germany not just with outrage, but a more familiar German emotion: schadenfreude.</p><p>Many Germans thought the chancellor, below, had been too restrained in her criticism when the extent of NSA surveillance on ordinary citizens emerged. Now they believe Merkel is getting a taste of her own medicine.</p><p>Anke Domscheit-Berg, of the German Pirate party, who is the wife of the former WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg,  said: \"In the past few months, Chancellor Merkel has done very little to make the US government answer all those questions that should have had highest political priority. Now she gets a taste of what it feels like when foreign secret services spy on all your communication.\"</p><p>When the schadenfreude tipped over into anger, it was targeted at Merkel'sinterior minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich. Jan Philipp Albrecht, a Green MEP, said Friedrich had spent the past few months blocking block efforts for tighter data protection regulation at European level, favouring self-regulation over a tightening of rules in Brussels.</p><p>\"The interior minister has not only failed to act in Germany's interest, he also failed to act on Angela Merkel's promise to take data protection more seriously,\" he said.</p><p>In June Friedrich said the NSA scandal was driven mainly by \"a mix of anti-Americanism and naivety\". But on Thursday the interior minister told the <a href=\"http://www.lvz-online.de/\" title=\"\">Leipziger Volkszeitung</a>newspaper that America should apologise for its actions: \"Bugging and snooping on friends in public or in private is unacceptable.\"</p><p>Albrecht said the affair was a huge embarrassment for the Christian Democratic Union politician and should rule him out from continuing in the same post in a new government: \"I ask myself: why is this man still interior minister?\"</p><p>Peter Schaar, the federal commissioner on data protection, was also remarkably frank in criticising his own government. He said the reports showed \"the absurdity of politicians trying to draw to a close the debate about surveillance of everyday communication here. In the light of the new revelations it seems irresponsible that more transparency wasn't called for earlier\".</p><p>In August, Merkel's chief of staff, Ronald Pofalla, said the government had been reassured by the US and UK governmentsthat no large-scale human rights violation had taken place. The allegations were \"off the table\", and the NSA scandal was <em>\"beendet\"</em> (finished). Few commentators have passed on the opportunity to point out the irony of those remarks. The parting justice minister, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, pointedly referenced Pofalla's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sls_bmj\" title=\"\">comments in a tweet</a>: \"Die NSA-Affäre ist nicht beendet\" (\"The NSA affair is not finished\").</p><p>The Social Democratic party, currently in the middle of coalition talks with the CDU, was more cautious in its criticism of Merkel and her ministers. But they too will be wondering how differently the general election in September could have played for them had the reports emerged earlier.</p><p>Die Zeit newspaper, usually one of the more US-friendly publications on the German market, published an op-ed by its political editor, Ludwig Greven, arguing that it was unethical that Merkel did not complain to the US president when the revelations about NSA spying first emerged. \"That would have been her duty when millions of NSA attacks on citizens' privacy were at stake because their basic rights are as valuable as those of the chancellor,\" he said.</p><p>But given that collaboration between Germany's secret service and the NSA was supposed to have started during the last grand coalition in 2002, Greven said he had little faith in a change of attitudes during a new SPD/CDU government. \"For convenience's sake, maybe Merkel should just officially unlock her phone for the US secret services. Then we'd get spared her and her citizens' delayed and fake outrage.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420876937|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|6fbe39b88802bd26ce0c757ece0a8ccdf875ba93 -->",

        "body":"<p>International anger over US government surveillance has combined with a backlash against its current Middle East policy to leave President Obama increasingly isolated from many of his key foreign allies, according to diplomats in Washington.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\" >furious call that German chancellor Angela Merkel made to the White House on Wednesday</a> to ask if her phone had been tapped was the latest in a string of diplomatic rebukes by allies including France, Brazil and Mexico, all of which have distanced themselves from the US following revelations of spying by the National Security Agency.</p><p>But the collapse in trust of the US among its European and South American partners has been matched by an equally rapid deterioration in its relationships with key allies in the Middle East. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/kerry-talks-us-saudi-rift-foreign-policy\" >Saudi Arabia</a> this week joined Israel, Jordan and United Arab Emirates in signalling a shift in its relations with the US over its unhappiness at a perceived policy of rapprochement toward Iran and Syria.</p><p>Though the issues are largely unrelated, they have led to a flurry of diplomatic activity from Washington, which is anxious to avoid a more permanent rift in the network of alliances that has been central to its foreign policy since the second world war.</p><p>Secretary of state John Kerry has been meeting with Saudi and Israeli leaders in an effort to keep them involved in Middle East peace talks about Palestine and Syria, Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/pakistani-pm-obama-end-drone-strikes\" >met Wednesday with Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif</a> to reassure him over separate anxiety over US drone attacks, and the White House has been privately trying to mend fences with world leaders on the surveillance issue.</p><p>\"The [NSA] revelations have clearly caused tension in our relationships with some countries and we are dealing with that through diplomatic channels,\" said White House spokesman Jay Carney on Thursday.</p><p>\"These are very important relations both economically and for our security, and we will work to maintain the closest possible ties.\"</p><p>But the Guardian has spoken with several diplomats and foreign government officials – all of whom agreed to talk only on the condition of anonymity – who say the White House is still underestimating the anger felt over recent disclosures.</p><p>They argue that US officials are being deliberately disingenuous when they claim that all countries engage in similar forms of espionage, even against allies. While it is widely accepted that the US, Britain, France, Russia and China engage in counter-espionage, other countries do not have the tools to conduct surveillance on the scale of the NSA.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420898420'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/24/1382636332279/Obama-Merkel-Hollande-010.jpg' alt='Obama, Merkel, Hollande' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Obama, Merkel and Hollande at the G20 summit in St Petersburg. Photograph: Getty</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p>A European diplomat said that the White House had presented a false comparison by claiming all countries were engaged in the same tactics.</p><p>\"How would the US respond if it discovered a friendly country was covertly listening to the calls of thousands of US citizens – including Obama?\" the diplomat said.</p><p>France, Mexico, Brazil and Germany have all provided the White House with a list of detailed questions about the reports of surveillance, demanding explanations and assurances it will stop. None have so far received what they believe to be a satisfactory answer.</p><p>Some foreign officials posted in Washington have changed the way they conduct business since the revelations about US surveillance: not speaking about sensitive information over the phone, increasing the frequency of de-bugging inspections in embassies, and keeping some communications – those deemed most secret – out of secure cables, having now concluded that their encryption may have been compromised by the NSA.</p><p>In Brazil, thousands of federal workers are now being ordered to adopt a form of highly-encrypted email – a program that was quickly accelerated after the Edward Snowden disclosures. And although the State Department insists that a planned bilateral meeting between Obama and Brazillian president Dilma Rousseff has merely been \"postponed\", it has not yet been rescheduled. Brazil is insisting the US come clean about the nature of the surveillance it has been conducting before it schedules another summit.</p><p>Speaking before Wednesday's revelation about Merkel's phone, a senior western diplomat speculated that the tenor of debate would be transformed if it emerged that an elected European politician had been targeted – as occurred in Brazil and Mexico.</p><p>\"If that happened, there would be a huge uproar,\" the diplomat said. \"This is not an issue that will go away.</p><p>\"The surveillance debate in the US is focused on the constitution – and whether the privacy of US citizens is compromised. There seems to be minimal acknowledgement about the concern other countries have about the rights of their citizens.\"</p><p>One European official said the disclosures had prompted EU countries to review policies on internet governance, privacy and data-sharing, amid growing scepticism about whether the US can be trusted. Major transatlantic trade negotiations have also been jeopardised amid anxiety that the US' surveillance tools give it an advantage during talks.</p><p>\"It has become clear we're not doing business on a level-playing field during negotiations,\" the official said.</p><p>A Brazilian official said that some top-level discussions with the US on energy matters had been suspended as a consequence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/08/brazil-accuses-canada-spying-nsa-leaks\" >leaks</a>, which suggested Canada may have spied on its energy and mines ministry. It would be \"impossible\" for discussions to proceed on that basis, the official added.</p><p>A Latin American diplomat said that if no satisfactory answer and apology was forthcoming, a scenario they thought unlikely, there would be enormous pressure for affected countries to react with more than just rhetoric.</p><p>\"Countries that have close partnerships simply should not spy on each other to that kind of level,\" they said. \"There has to be some kind of consequences.\"</p><p>The combination of diplomatic setbacks has led to particular scorn from Obama's critics on the American right, who compare his growing international unpopularity with his criticism of George W Bush for damaging America's reputation through the Iraq war.</p><p>\"This is a perfect storm,\" said Jim Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank. \"Countries are getting impatient with US foreign policy largely because they see it as one of disengagement, but the NSA scandal has given them fresh reason to mistrust us, too.\"</p><p>So far the official response in Washington has been muted, but there are signs of growing American frustration with the criticism it is receiving at the same time that it is expected to act as world leader.</p><p>On Wednesday, for example, Washington's outgoing ambassador to Saudi Arabia, James Smith, rebuked those calling for greater US involvement in the Middle East.</p><p>\"Much criticism has been directed at the US and there is a mounting frustration at the perceived lack of a coherent foreign policy in the region but then we hear the same refrain that somehow only we can fix it,\" he told an Arab/US policy conference in Washington.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420892017|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|edf54c8bab8ec109b33b26fb3e6541c4f868c8f8 -->",

        "headline":"NSA bugging turns spotlight on world leaders' 'safe' communications",
        "body":"<p>Angela Merkel has revealed further details about her mobile phone usage in light of the NSA hacking scandal.</p><p>At the EU summit on Thursday, the German chancellor said she made a point of conducting conversations about party political issues and matters of state through a variety of channels.</p><p>\"For all communication relevant to matters of state there are landlines, encrypted lines and if you are away from the landline, there are encrypted mobiles,\" she said, later adding that \"those [mobiles] which are less encrypted are more likely to be bugged than those that are encrypted\".</p><p>Secusmart, the company that built the chancellor's \"safe\" phone, issued a statement saying that its product had not been bugged. \"We still meet the highest security standards\", said the company's co-founder, Hans-Christoph Quelle.</p><p>But some newspapers reported that German politicians, Merkel included, had not always been so disciplined in their use of \"safe\" communication. The secure technology was often slow and complicated to use – for technical reasons, there is often a time-delay during conversations, for example.</p><p>Some ministers had reportedly handed their secure mobiles to junior colleagues and used their old Nokia handsets instead. \"She likes simple things\", Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung quotes a Merkel confidante as saying. \"She can't stand slow technology.\" The newspaper also says Merkel's CDU phone ran on a <a href=\"http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/kanzlerin-abgehoert-es-war-merkels-parteihandy-12631977.html\" title=\"\">normal Vodafone contract</a>.</p><p>The number of Merkel's CDU phone had originally been found on an NSA list by Der Spiegel; the information was then passed on to the government. The document does not state when and for how long the surveillance took place, or what information the agency had been trying to obtain.</p><p>If the NSA did hack Merkel's CDU phone, it would indicate that it did so mainly because it could, rather than because it was trying to access crucial intelligence. On German social media, people were wondering why American spies would have listened in to mind-numbing conversations about CDU fundraisers,<a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/merkels-fiktive-sms-protokolle-a-929813.html\" title=\"\"> committee meetings and office parties</a>.</p><p>In a further twist, Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that the bugging of Merkel's phone may have been carried out via the <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/handy-affaere-warum-die-us-botschaft-ein-spionagezentrum-sein-koennte-1.1803383\" title=\"\">US embassy in Berlin</a>. The unit responsible for the bugging is suspected to be the so-called Special Collection Service (SCS), which is run by the NSA and US foreign service intelligence unit and works covertly with American embassies.</p><p>The SCS is said to have been around since the 1970s. In his 1994 book Spyworld, the US whistleblower Mike Frost said the project, which was originally known as \"College Park\", involved embedding secret agents in embassies around the world.</p><p>In order to collect surveillance information, these spies would need a local \"collection point\". Several German papers are speculating whether this may be situated in the US embassy, located next to the Brandenburg Gate and close to the Reichstag building where the German parliament holds its sessions.</p><p>On 28 August, a German state helicopter flew over the US embassy and took photographs, reportedly to check for antennae indicating the <a href=\"http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article119844652/Helikopter-spaehte-im-Tiefflug-US-Konsulat-aus.html\" title=\"\">presence of surveillance technology</a>. At the time, Focus news magazine reported that the embassy had complained about the helicopter flight to the German foreign office.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420936899|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|0d1b749b1ca811c4b00d9e7527e16c4bf56be5c1 -->",

        "headline":"NSA monitored calls of 35 world leaders after US official handed over contacts",
        "body":"<p>The National Security Agency monitored the phone conversations of 35 world leaders after being given the numbers by an official in another US government department, according to a classified document provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>The confidential memo reveals that the NSA encourages senior officials in its \"customer\" departments, such as the White House, State and the Pentagon, to share their \"Rolodexes\" so the agency can add the phone numbers of leading foreign politicians to their surveillance systems.</p><p>The document notes that one unnamed US official handed over 200 numbers, including those of the 35 world leaders, none of whom is named. These were immediately \"tasked\" for monitoring by the NSA.</p><p>The revelation is set to add to mounting diplomatic tensions between the US and its allies, after the German chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\">accused the US of tapping her mobile phone</a>.</p><p>After Merkel's allegations became public, White House press secretary Jay Carney issued a statement that said the US \"is not monitoring and will not monitor\" the German chancellor's communications. But that failed to quell the row, as officials in Berlin quickly pointed out that the US did not deny monitoring the phone in the past.</p><p>Arriving in Brussels for an EU summit Merkel accused the US of a breach of trust. \"We need to have trust in our allies and partners, and this must now be established once again. I repeat that spying among friends is not at all acceptable against anyone, and that goes for every citizen in Germany.\"</p><p>The NSA memo obtained by the Guardian suggests that such surveillance was not isolated, as the agency routinely monitors the phone numbers of world leaders – and even asks for the assistance of other US officials to do so.</p><p>The memo, dated October 2006 and which was issued to staff in the agency's Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID), was titled \"Customers Can Help SID Obtain Targetable Phone Numbers\".</p><p>It begins by setting out an example of how US officials who mixed with world leaders and politicians could help agency surveillance.</p><p>\"In one recent case,\" the memo notes, \"a US official provided NSA with 200 phone numbers to 35 world leaders … Despite the fact that the majority is probably available via open source, the PCs [intelligence production centers] have noted 43 previously unknown phone numbers. These numbers plus several others have been tasked.\"</p><p>The document continues by saying the new phone numbers had helped the agency discover still more new contact details to add to their monitoring: \"These numbers have provided lead information to other numbers that have subsequently been tasked.\"</p><p>But the memo acknowledges that eavesdropping on the numbers had produced \"little reportable intelligence\". In the wake of the Merkel row, the US is facing growing international criticism that any intelligence benefit from spying on friendly governments is far outweighed by the potential diplomatic damage.</p><p>The memo then asks analysts to think about any customers they currently serve who might similarly be happy to turn over details of their contacts.</p><p>\"This success leads S2 [signals intelligence] to wonder if there are NSA liaisons whose supported customers may be willing to share their 'Rolodexes' or phone lists with NSA as potential sources of intelligence,\" it states. \"S2 welcomes such information!\"</p><p>The document suggests that sometimes these offers come unsolicited, with US \"customers\" spontaneously offering the agency access to their overseas networks.</p><p>\"From time to time, SID is offered access to the personal contact databases of US officials,\" it states. \"Such 'Rolodexes' may contain contact information for foreign political or military leaders, to include direct line, fax, residence and cellular numbers.\"</p><p>The Guardian approached the Obama administration for comment on the latest document. Officials declined to respond directly to the new material, instead referring to comments delivered by Carney at Thursday's daily briefing. </p><p>Carney told reporters: \"The [NSA] revelations have clearly caused tension in our relationships with some countries, and we are dealing with that through diplomatic channels.</p><p>\"These are very important relations both economically and for our security, and we will work to maintain the closest possible ties.\"</p><p>The public accusation of spying on Merkel adds to mounting political tensions in Europe about the scope of US surveillance on the governments of its allies, after a cascade of backlashes and apologetic phone calls with leaders across the continent over the course of the week.</p><p>Asked on Wednesday evening if the NSA had in the past tracked the German chancellor's communications, Caitlin Hayden, the White House's National Security Council spokeswoman, said: \"The United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of Chancellor Merkel. Beyond that, I'm not in a position to comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity.\"</p><p>At the daily briefing on Thursday, Carney again refused to answer repeated questions about whether the US had spied on Merkel's calls in the past.</p><p>The NSA memo seen by the Guardian was written halfway through George W Bush's second term, when Condoleezza Rice was secretary of state and Donald Rumsfeld was in his final months as defence secretary. </p><p>Merkel, who, according to Reuters, suspected the surveillance after finding her mobile phone number <a href=\"http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE99M0Y720131023?irpc=932\">written on a US document</a>, is said to have called for US surveillance to be placed on a new legal footing during a phone call to President Obama.</p><p>\"The [German] federal government, as a close ally and partner of the US, expects in the future a clear contractual basis for the activity of the services and their co-operation,\" she told the president.</p><p>The leader of Germany's Green party, Katrin Goring-Eckhart, called the alleged spying an \"unprecedented breach of trust\" between the two countries.</p><p>Earlier in the week, Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/us-french-surveillance-legitimate-questions\">called the French president</a> François Hollande in response to reports in Le Monde that the NSA accessed more than 70m phone records of French citizens in a single 30-day period, while earlier reports in Der Spiegel uncovered NSA activity against the offices and <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/secret-nsa-documents-show-how-the-us-spies-on-europe-and-the-un-a-918625.html\">communications of senior officials of the European Union</a>.</p><p>The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, this week backed proposals that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/business/international/eu-panel-backs-plan-to-shield-online-data.html?_r=0\">could require US tech companies to seek permission</a> before handing over EU citizens' data to US intelligence agencies, while the European parliament voted in favour of <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20131021IPR22725/html/MEPs-call-for-suspension-of-EU-US-bank-data-deal-in-response-to-NSA-snooping\">suspending a transatlantic bank data sharing agreement</a> after Der Spiegel revealed the agency was monitoring the international bank transfer system Swift.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420870250|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|7e47a3819f1b4843ff1a9d29a7f3367f800c934d -->",

        "body":"<p>A Conservative MP who claimed the Guardian had endangered national security with its reporting of top secret intelligence files has a picture on his official website of him posing with staff from the high-security US base in North Yorkshire, Menwith Hill.</p><p>Julian Smith, MP for Skipton and Ripon, raised concerns about the Guardian's coverage of the US National Security Agency files, leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, in a House of Commons debate on Tuesday. He wrongly claimed it had distributed information about British intelligence agents and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/22/edward-snowden-guardian-should-be-prosecuted-tory-mp\" title=\"\">called for the Guardian to be prosecuted</a>.</p><p>\"To communicate, not just publish, any identifying information about GCHQ personnel is a terrorist offence,\" he told MPs.</p><p>However, on his website, he has publicly identified staff from the high-security US base, publishing a picture of himself posing with more than 30 people outside the House of Commons. The caption reads: \"Julian has welcomed a group of around 40 people from RAF Menwith Hill to Westminster.\" The picture is also on Smith's Facebook page where it states: \"Enjoyed meeting members of the British-American group from RAF Menwith Hill\".</p><p>The Guardian has republished the picture, pixelating the faces of everyone except the MP to ensure there is no threat to national security.</p><p>Smith said on Friday: \"The people that came on that trip would have given me full permission to use any photograph.\"</p><p>The base is the NSA's key eavesdropping hub in Europe and has an array of radomes, commonly called \"golf balls\", which are used for satellite communications interceptions. Although the base is called RAF Menwith Hill, most of the staff there are US employees of the NSA.</p><p>On a visit to the site in June 2008, the head of the NSA, Lieutenant General Keith Alexander set staff an ambitious task. \"Why can't we collect all the signals all the time?\" he asked. \"Sounds like a good summer project for Menwith.\"</p><p>According to the files released by Snowden, Menwith Hill was also the listening station that intercepted the telephone calls of the then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev when he was in London for the G20 summit in 2009.</p><p>Smith, who has made a complaint about the Guardian to the police, called this week's debate in Westminster Hall to raise his concern at how the Guardian handled the Snowden files, claiming the paper had endangered the lives of intelligence agents. The backbencher's address was condemned as McCarthyism and \"absolute scaremongering\" by Labour MPs who were prevented from speaking.</p><p>Smith said: \"The Guardian focused on sending abroad revelations not about the American NSA or whistleblowing. They chose to distribute information about our own intelligence agents and GCHQ … to communicate, not just publish, any identifying information about GCHQ personnel is a terrorist offence. This is not press freedom – this is the Guardian's devastating impact on national security.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for Guardian News &amp; Media said Smith's speech \"propagated a series of myths\" about the Guardian's reporting of the Snowden documents. \"When responsible journalists working on the same story share documents they are engaged in journalism not terrorism. Senior politicians and government officials in the UK and internationally, over 30 of the world's leading newspaper editors, and an overwhelming majority of the public, have all said that the Guardian's reporting on this story is important for democracy.\"</p><p>She added: \"They all agree, as does Mr Smith, that surveillance of citizens by intelligence agencies is a legitimate subject for debate. But there would be no public debate had there been no disclosure.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420968934|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|2b1d74e922535b1e31331baac488b588e16f5691 -->",

Such trust now has to be built anew … The United States of America and Europe face common challenges. We are allies. But such an alliance can only be built on trust.&quot;</p><p>Privately, according to senior sources who witnessed the two-hour discussion of intelligence snooping on Thursday evening, Merkel told the other leaders that the issue at stake was not that her mobile phone may have been tapped by the Americans, but that it represented &quot;the phones of millions of European citizens&quot;.</p><p>While conceding that intelligence services everywhere might be prone to behaving badly, Hollande dismissed suggestions that the Americans were merely operating as other security services also did. He complained that the revelations by the US whistleblower, Edward Snowden, showed a level of eavesdropping and data gathering that took place nowhere in Europe and was unique to the US agency.</p><p>A delegation of nine MEPs will travel to Washington on Monday for a three-day visit, during which they will press senior US government and intelligence officials for answers on allegations of widespread spying by the US, and explore &quot;possible legal remedies for EU citizens&quot; resulting from the alleged surveillance.</p><p>Separately, the German government said on Friday that a group of senior officials including the heads of its foreign and domestic intelligence agencies would travel to the US &quot;shortly&quot; for talks at the White House and with the NSA.</p><p>The White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obama administration was discussing Germany's concerns &quot;through diplomatic channels at the highest level&quot;.</p><p>It is plain that the French and the Germans want to limit the damage from the NSA furore, but also hope to engage the Americans to rein in their activities. They set a deadline of the end of the year for results. The statement said other countries could join the negotiations, leaving the door open for British participation.</p><p>Given the role of GCHQ in the mass surveillance, Cameron found himself the target of veiled criticism at the summit, according to witnesses. Merkel complained that Britain enjoyed a privileged position with the Americans because it is the only EU member in the &quot;Five Eyes Club&quot; – the intelligence-sharing arrangement linking the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>Senior EU security officials suspect that Berlin may seek to exploit the crisis to gain admission to, or at least greater co-operation with, the Five Eyes pact.</p><p>Cameron, sources said, responded to the critical remarks by stressing that under his premiership the shared intelligence with the four other countries had resulted in several terrorist plots being foiled, with countless lives saved.</p><p>The controversy deepened on Thursday when the Guardian revealed that the NSA had monitored the phone conversations of 35 world leaders after being given their phone numbers by an official in another US government department. The latest claims, which emerged from a classified document provided by Snowden, have further overshadowed this week's EU summit in Brussels.</p><p>Despite US efforts to placate Merkel – including a phone call with the US president, Barack Obama, on Wednesday – she has refused to conceal her anger.</p><p>Merkel briefed the other leaders in some detail on the 20-minute conversation with Obama, sources said, adding that several participants commented that they thought the US leader was &quot;embarrassed&quot;.</p><p>The European anger and frustration was directed at a US agency seen to be out of control and beyond appropriate scrutiny rather than being aimed at Obama.</p><p>The latest confidential memo provided by Snowden reveals that the NSA encourages senior officials in its &quot;customer&quot; departments – such as the White House, state department and the Pentagon – to share their Rolodexes so that the agency can add the phone numbers of leading foreign politicians to their surveillance systems.</p><p>The document notes that one unnamed US official handed over 200 numbers, including those of the 35 world leaders, none of whom has been named. These were immediately &quot;tasked&quot; for monitoring by the NSA.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420939311|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|24e90cc0d5556ba0411b437c37be5fd9a16ea15b -->",

        "body":"<p>The UK intelligence agency GCHQ has repeatedly warned it fears a \"damaging public debate\" on the scale of its activities because it could lead to legal challenges against its mass-surveillance programmes, classified internal documents reveal.</p><p>Memos contained in the cache disclosed by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden detail the agency's long fight against making intercept evidence admissible as evidence in criminal trials – a policy supported by all three major political parties, but ultimately defeated by the UK's intelligence community.</p><p>Foremost among the reasons was a desire to minimise the potential for challenges against the agency's large-scale interception programmes, rather than any intrinsic threat to security, the documents show.</p><p>The papers also reveal that:</p><p>• GCHQ lobbied furiously to keep secret the fact that telecoms firms had gone \"well beyond\" what they were legally required to do to help intelligence agencies' mass interception of communications, both in the UK and overseas.</p><p>• GCHQ feared a legal challenge under the right to privacy in the Human Rights Act if evidence of its surveillance methods became admissible in court.</p><p>• GCHQ assisted the Home Office in lining up sympathetic people to help with \"press handling\", including the Liberal Democrat peer and former intelligence services commissioner Lord Carlile, who this week criticised the Guardian for its coverage of mass surveillance by GCHQ and America's National Security Agency.</p><p>The most recent attempt to make intelligence gathered from intercepts admissible in court, proposed by the last Labour government, was finally stymied by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 in 2009.</p><p>A briefing memo prepared for the board of GCHQ shortly before the decision was made public revealed that one reason the agency was keen to quash the proposals was the fear that even passing references to its wide-reaching surveillance powers could start a \"damaging\" public debate.</p><p>Referring to the decision to publish the report on intercept as evidence without classification, it noted: \"Our main concern is that references to agency practices (ie the scale of interception and deletion) could lead to damaging public debate which might lead to legal challenges against the current regime.\" A later update, from May 2012, set out further perceived \"risks\" of making intercepts admissible, including \"the damage to partner relationships if sensitive information were accidentally released in open court\". It also noted that the \"scale of interception and retention required would be fairly likely to be challenged on Article 8 (Right to Privacy) grounds\".</p><p>The GCHQ briefings showed the agency provided the Home Office with support in winning the PR battle on the proposed reforms by lining up people to talk to the media – including Lord Carlile, who on Wednesday gave a public lecture <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/10401711/Publishing-Edward-Snowden-security-secrets-a-criminal-act-says-former-terrorism-watchdog.html\" title=\"\">condemning the Guardian's decision to publish stories based on the leaked material from Snowden</a>.</p><p>Referring to the public debate on intercept evidence, the document notes: \"Sir Ken McDonald [sic] (former DPP [director of public prosecutions]), Lord Goldsmith (former AG [attorney general]) and David Davis (former Shadow HSec [home secretary) [have been] reiterating their previous calls for IaE [intercept as evidence].</p><p>\"We are working closely with HO [Home Office] on their plans for press handling when the final report is published, e.g. lining up talking heads (such as Lord Carlisle [sic], Lord Stevens, Sir Stephen Lander, Sir Swinton Thomas).\"</p><p>Carlile was the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation in 2001-11, and was awarded a CBE in 2012 for his services to national security.</p><p>Another top GCHQ priority in resisting the admission of intercepts as evidence was keeping secret the extent of the agency's co-operative relationships with telephone companies – including being granted access to communications networks overseas.</p><p>In June, the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\" title=\"\">disclosed the existence of GCHQ's Tempora internet surveillance programme</a>. It uses intercepts on the fibre-optic cables that make up the backbone of the internet to gain access to vast swaths of internet users' personal data. The intercepts are placed in the UK and overseas, with the knowledge of companies owning either the cables or landing stations.</p><p>The revelations of voluntary co-operation with some telecoms companies appear to contrast markedly with statements made by large telecoms firms in the wake of the first Tempora stories. They stressed that they were simply complying with the law of the countries in which they operated.</p><p>In reality, numerous telecoms companies were doing much more than that, as disclosed in a secret document prepared in 2009 by a joint working group of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6.</p><p>Their report contended that allowing intercepts as evidence could damage relationships with \"Communications Service Providers\" (CSPs).</p><p>In an extended excerpt of \"the classified version\" of a review prepared for the Privy Council, a formal body of advisers made up of current and former cabinet ministers, the document sets out the real nature of the relationship between telecoms firms and the UK government.</p><p>\"Under RIPA [the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000], CSPs in the UK may be required to provide, at public expense, an adequate interception capability on their networks,\" it states. \"In practice all significant providers do provide such a capability. But in many cases their assistance – while in conformity with the law – goes well beyond what it requires.\"</p><p>GCHQ's internet surveillance programme is the subject of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/08/nsa-gchq-spy-programmes-legal-challenge\" title=\"\">a challenge in the European court of human rights</a>, mounted by three privacy advocacy groups. The Open Rights Group, English PEN and Big Brother Watch argue the \"unchecked surveillance\" of Tempora is a challenge to the right to privacy, as set out in the European convention on human rights.</p><p>That the Tempora programme appears to rely at least in part on voluntary co-operation of telecoms firms could become a major factor in that ongoing case. The revelation could also reignite the long-running debate over allowing intercept evidence in court.</p><p>GCHQ's submission goes on to set out why its relationships with telecoms companies go further than what can be legally compelled under current law. It says that in the internet era, companies wishing to avoid being legally mandated to assist UK intelligence agencies would often be able to do so \"at little cost or risk to their operations\" by moving \"some or all\" of their communications services overseas.</p><p>As a result, \"it has been necessary to enter into agreements with both UK-based and offshore providers for them to afford the UK agencies access, with appropriate legal authorisation, to the communications they carry outside the UK\".</p><p>The submission to ministers does not set out which overseas firms have entered into voluntary relationships with the UK, or even in which countries they operate, though documents detailing the Tempora programme made it clear the UK's interception capabilities relied on taps located both on UK soil and overseas.</p><p>There is no indication as to whether the governments of the countries in which deals with companies have been struck would be aware of the GCHQ cable taps.</p><p>Evidence that telecoms firms and GCHQ are engaging in mass interception overseas could stoke an ongoing diplomatic row over surveillance ignited this week after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, accused the NSA of monitoring her phone calls, and the subsequent revelation that the agency monitored communications of at least 35 other world leaders.</p><p>On Friday, Merkel and the French president, François Hollande, agreed to spearhead efforts to make the NSA sign a new code of conduct on how it carried out intelligence operations within the European Union, after EU leaders warned that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/germany-france-nsa-spying-merkel-hollande-eu\" title=\"\">international fight against terrorism was being jeopardised</a> by the perception that mass US surveillance was out of control.</p><p>Fear of diplomatic repercussions were one of the prime reasons given for GCHQ's insistence that its relationships with telecoms firms must be kept private .</p><p>Telecoms companies \"feared damage to their brands internationally, if the extent of their co-operation with HMG [Her Majesty's government] became apparent\", the GCHQ document warned. It added that if intercepts became admissible as evidence in UK courts \"many CSPs asserted that they would withdraw their voluntary support\".</p><p>The report stressed that while companies are going beyond what they are required to do under UK law, they are not being asked to violate it.</p><p>Shami Chakrabarti, Director of Liberty and Anthony Romero Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union issued a joint statement stating:</p><p>\"The Guardian's publication of information from Edward Snowden has uncovered a breach of trust by the US and UK Governments on the grandest scale. The newspaper's principled and selective revelations demonstrate our rulers' contempt for personal rights, freedoms and the rule of law.</p><p>\"Across the globe, these disclosures continue to raise fundamental questions about the lack of effective legal protection against the interception of all our communications.</p><p>\"Yet in Britain, that conversation is in danger of being lost beneath self-serving spin and scaremongering, with journalists who dare to question the secret state accused of aiding the enemy.</p><p>\"A balance must of course be struck between security and transparency, but that cannot be achieved whilst the intelligence services and their political masters seek to avoid any scrutiny of, or debate about, their actions.</p><p>\"The Guardian's decision to expose the extent to which our privacy is being violated should be applauded and not condemned.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420974026|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|644cb6ec61b96a9c433365e1b2a83df45288ebdd -->",
