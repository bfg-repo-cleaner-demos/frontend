        "headline":"Shaming lesson behind the boat tragedy in Lampedusa",
        "body":"<p>While translated into English in last week's reports as tragedy, the word in Italian used by Pope Francis to describe the horrific loss of life in the Mediterranean was <em>vergogna </em>(<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/lampedusa-boat-tragedy-italy-migrants\" title=\"\">More than 100 dead&nbsp;in boat tragedy at 'gates of Europe',</a> 4 October). A more meaningful translation would be \"shame\". This is not a mere detail. Tragedy implies that this slaughter is an event that we observe; shame means we are complicit and should assume responsibility.</p><p>To focus just on the people-smugglers misses the point. Of course, theirs is an evil trade profiting from human misery, but people-smuggling is the symptom and not the cause of migration. Tougher border controls, higher fences and more expensive surveillance systems won't deal with the causes either. They will make things worse by driving more people into the perilous embrace of the smugglers. The causes of migration are overwhelmingly poverty, inequality and conflict. This is a humanitarian crisis that demands a humanitarian and European response. To paraphrase a currently popular soundbite: we are Europe, surely we can do better than this.<br /><strong>Professor Andrew Geddes</strong><br /><em>Department of politics, University of&nbsp;Sheffield</em></p><p></p><p>• Hugh Muir (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/04/lampedusa-migrants-europe-help\" title=\"\">Lessons of Lampedusa</a>, 5&nbsp;October) is right that we need to understand why people are so desperate as to undertake journeys such as the one that ended tragically last week. Eritrea, from which the majority of people on that boat seem to have come, is only ever in the news when disasters like this happen. The country has been under a dictatorship for more than 20 years. Opponents of the regime are routinely \"disappeared\", tortured and executed. Men and women are subject to indefinite military service, lasting up to 20 years. There are now no universities, only training camps and re-education \"colleges\". In these circumstances it is not surprising that thousands cross the borders every week, and are living in poverty in refugee camps in neighbouring countries.</p><p>Until the EU and the UN put effective pressure on Eritrea to change, and institute a systematic process for relocating Eritrean refugees from already impoverished countries to the west, tragedies like this will inevitably continue.<br /><strong>Tzeggai Yohannes Deres</strong><br /><em>Chair, Eritrean National Council for&nbsp;Democratic Change</em></p><p></p><p>• Jack Shenker's analysis (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/mediterranean-migrant-deaths-avoidable-loss\" title=\"\">People or borders first?</a>, 4 October) looks behind the tragedy near Lampedusa. Of course, as he states, the traffickers are criminally responsible. However, migrants, driven by poverty, see their intended destination countries as being wealthy. Why are these countries, including the UK, wealthy? One reason is in their history of colonialism, exploiting the resources of countries by force. Left behind, when independence was granted, was a perceived link to a country that had become rich by theft. The exploitation behind the recent sinking only can be eradicated by addressing the root cause through a just settlement of colonial debts.<br /><strong>Michael Shaw</strong><br /><em>Huddersfield</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419399608|2013-10-16T15:58:10Z|7db6afd1fc1e8546b4de46e9f36225f08f98e239 -->",

        "body":"<p>In 2010 the mayor of Torrington in Devon caused a scandal by posting this \"joke\" on the internet, \"Illegal immigrants are like sperm – millions of them come in but only one works\". After the tragedy off the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/lampedusa-shipwreck-italy-state-funeral-migrants\" title=\"\">Italian island of Lampedusa</a>, the truth is closer to: thousands come to our shores, but they rarely survive.</p><p>If I, born in Yugoslavia, and my family hadn't received political asylum in Germany during the 1980s, I probably wouldn't be writing these lines, as our future would have been uncertain. I had the opportunity to learn the language and even go to school in my adopted country. In the 90s I moved to Croatia and now we are \"proud\" citizens of the EU. That's three different political systems in a pretty short lifetime.</p><p>During the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the war of the 90s, refugees from Croatia, Bosnia or Kosovo survived only because they were given asylum by some European countries. Today, just 20 years later, it is our countries that are sought out by refugees from Afghanistan, Libya or Pakistan, desperate to get to the EU.</p><p>In July 2012, in waters south of the Croatian island of Mljet, a boat without a captain was sighted, with 65 migrants on board. After setting sail from Greece, the boat's engine failed, and the ship drifted at sea for two days. The migrants on board were originally from Somalia, Egypt, Syria and Afghanistan, and they wanted to reach the Italian coast. Eventually they ended up in the port of Dubrovnik, and now seek asylum in Croatia.</p><p>This was a sign of things to come. Why? Because Croatia is the EU country with the longest land border with non-EU countries, somewhat longer than that of Finland/Russia (1,340km) and Greece/Turkey (1,248km). Much of this border is shared with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro.  In 2012, 1,193 people applied for asylum in Croatia, 50% more than the year before. The largest number of asylum seekers come from Somalia – another country that has for almost two decades been hit by a bloody civil war. So, could Croatia become the new Lampedusa?</p><p>It seems that Croatia will in fact become the <em>antemurale Europae</em>, reminding us of its role as<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antemurale_Christianitatis\" title=\"\"> <em>antemurale Christianitatis</em></a>, a title that was given to the country in 1519 by Pope Leo X in praise of its struggle against the Turks and the advance of the Ottoman empire. Realising that title anew before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/01/croatia-latest-member-eu-periphery\" title=\"\">its entrance to the EU</a>, Croatia has introduced, on the insistence of the EU, visas for Turkish citizens, causing Turkey to reciprocate by re-introducing visas for Croatian citizens. Once again, Croats are called in to help Europe resist the \"barbarians\" as their primary task in the EU.</p><p>Here, a reference to the book The Ruin of the Roman Empire: A New History, by the classical specialist James J O'Donnell, is useful. Unlike traditional and prevailing interpretations that the Roman empire collapsed because of the barbarian invasions, O'Donnell claims that it is in fact the barbarians who could have saved it. His main thesis is that the barbarians who conquered Italy, Iberia, Gaul and north Africa were actually Romanised and thoroughly Christianised, and instead of ruining the Roman institutions, they were the ones who kept them running. The great historian of antiquity Cassius Dio writes in his Roman History:</p><p><blockquote>\"The barbarians were adapting themselves to Roman ways, were becoming accustomed to hold markets, and were meeting in peaceful assemblages. They had not, however, forgotten their ancestral habits, their native manners, their old life of independence, or the power derived from arms. Hence, so long as they were unlearning these customs gradually and by the way, as one may say, under careful watching, they were not disturbed by the change in their manner of life, and were becoming different without knowing it.\"</blockquote></p><p>O'Donnell's thesis is that the Roman empire only fell when Emperor Justinian tried to \"restore\" the old Roman empire, without being aware it had long gone. He was already living in an empire in which the \"barbarians\" were not so barbaric anymore, but had been influenced by Roman civilisation for decades or even centuries, and were not a threat to the Roman \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitkultur\" title=\"\">Leitkultur</a>\". Instead, it was Justinian who was the threat to Rome's survival.</p><p>Is not the EU today also destroying what it is desperately trying to save, a centralised and monocultural Europe that is actually a rather recent phenomenon because such a situation didn't even exist before 1945? And isn't Europe, via <a href=\"http://www.frontex.europa.eu/\" title=\"\">Frontex</a>, which controls border management, trying to save what cannot be saved, the \"Fortress Europe\" that is already conquered, not by mighty immigrants but by its own impotence and by the power of global capital?</p><p>The European problem is not the intruding barbarians – the problem is, and the recent tragedy of Lampedusa is a clear example, that the EU itself has become barbaric.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419573028|2013-10-16T15:58:10Z|2751c54723016194ee540b75a2256362e07fcdaa -->",

        "body":"<p>The European Union has come  under pressure  to revamp its  immigration policies in the wake of the Lampedusa tragedy that led to the deaths of 274 people in Italian waters last week.</p><p>The European commission told a meeting of interior ministers in Luxembourg that more had to be done at the EU level to control mass immigration, legal and illegal.</p><p>Reacting specifically to the Lampedusa boat sinking in Italian waters between Tunisia and Malta, Cecilia Malmström, the commissioner for interior affairs, called for an EU rescue mission spanning the entire Mediterranean.</p><p>The project would be entrusted to Frontex, the EU's borders agency, with the aim of tracking, identifying and if need be rescuing boatloads of migrants leaving north Africa for southern Europe. Malmström said the project should stretch from Spain to Cyprus.</p><p>It was not stated if the proposed patrols would also be used to chase boats back to where they came from.</p><p>\"I am going to propose to the member states to organise a Frontex operation covering the whole Mediterranean, from Cyprus to Spain, for a big save-rescue operation in the Mediterranean, and I am going to ask for the necessary support and resources to do that,\" Malmström said.</p><p>But interior ministers from the 28 governments showed little inclination to respond to the Lampedusa tragedy or to the Syrian refugee crisis by agreeing a more open or generous policy.</p><p>National governments jealously guard their sovereign authority over immigration issues and are unlikely to surrender powers to Brussels or pool decision-taking in the foreseeable future, despite the shame of the Lampedusa tragedy, which is the biggest single loss of life involving Mediterranean \"boat people\".</p><p>Italy is clamouring for greater solidarity from other EU states in trying to cope with the number of migrants coming across the Mediterranean. \"Municipalities like ours cannot be left alone on the frontline,\" wrote the mayor of Lampedusa, Giusi Nicolini, in an open appeal. \"What hurts the most is that Europe is a bystander.\"</p><p>\"The Mediterranean represents the Africa-Europe border, not the Africa-Italy border,\" Angelino Alfano, the Italian interior minister, told parliament in Rome in the wake of the disaster.</p><p>But the German interior minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich, signalled on Tuesday that Berlin was in no mood to relax the rules on immigration. Germany recently agreed to take 5,000 temporary refugees from Syria, criticised widely as a paltry figure.</p><p>But the Germans point out that they had more than four times the number of asylum-seekers that Italy had last year.</p><p>According to Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, Germany had more than 77,000 asylum seekers last year while Italy had under 16,000.</p><p>Echoing the debate in Britain about asylum seekers and immigrants as \"benefit scroungers\", Friedrich said that most of those trying to cross the Mediterranean were \"economic\" migrants rather than political refugees and that they were seeking better social security than they would receive at home.</p><p>The emphasis of the meeting in Luxembourg was on stemming the flow rather than liberalising entry rules, by discussing further aid to, for example, Lebanon or Turkey, which are struggling under the burden of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria.</p><p>Meanwhile, a 35-year old Tunisian man was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of piloting the migrant boat that caught fire and sank within sight of Lampedusa last Thursday.</p><p>Khaled Ben Salem was identified by survivors as one of the \"white men\" who escorted the 500 passengers, most of them Eritrean, from a warehouse in Libya to a beach at Misrata, where they were packed on to the boat for the two-day crossing.</p><p>He was previously deported in April after piloting another migrant boat to Italy. He now risks being charged with multiple homicide, with some passengers claiming he started the fire on board the boat, Italian media reports said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Italian deep sea divers continued emptying the interior of the sunken ship of the dozens of corpses still packed into it. The number of bodies recovered rose to 274, including 81 women, while only six women were among the survivors.</p><p>A Vatican spokesman said Pope Francis had decided to donate an unspecified sum of money to each of the 155 survivors of the disaster, who are slowly being moved from a migrant holding centre on Lampedusa.</p><p>Migrants still held on the island protested on Tuesday about conditions at the camp, throwing mattresses over the fence of the centre and trying to block departing buses.</p><p>\"The extreme situation at the centre has deteriorated, with entire families forced into the open for three days in the rain in a row. It is absolutely unacceptable,\" said Lauren Jolles, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) representative in Italy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419394978|2013-10-16T15:58:10Z|59ec5658aa549db0fbad1f6103c64fae2060ab1f -->",

With 155 survivors plucked from the water on Thursday that left more than 100 of the roughly 500 passengers, mostly Eritreans, still unaccounted for, many crammed into the hold of the boat which lies on its side at a depth of 47 metres.</p><p>\"The divers are using their hands to pull out the bodies,\" said Massimiliano Pugliese, the head of a team of divers sent by Italy's fire service.</p><p>One diver, Salvo Vagliasindi, told the Italian news agency Adnkronos: \"The image I cannot shake from my mind is of those bodies packed into the wreck, almost all with staring eyes and their arms raised, as if they were calling for help.\"</p><p>Another diver, Antonio D'Amico, started to cry as he described pulling a child free from the boat on Sunday. \"He was turned away from me. I delicately pulled him free from the hull and his face hit mine,\" he told La Repubblica. \"It could have been my son.\"</p><p>D'Amico said the operation was being rushed to stop the current dragging the bodies out to sea. \"That mustn't happen,\" he said. \"They have already suffered enough.\"</p><p>Luca Cari, a fire service spokesman, said some of the divers were veterans of the search for bodies around the capsized Costa Concordia cruise ship in Tuscany. \"I have seen everything, but the fact the migrants in the hold had absolutely no chance to escape is what makes this so shocking,\" he said.</p><p>Captain Giampaolo Trucco, a spokesman for divers from the Italian navy, said: \"Going inside the boat is the toughest job, psychologically, since visibility is low and the numbers of bodies is extremely high.\"</p><p>The Vatican's daily newspaper reported that each diver descending to the ship was carrying a rosary blessed by Pope Francis. Father Konrad Krajewski, a representative of Francis, travelled to the site of the sinking on a coastguard dinghy on Monday.</p><p>Bodies recovered are being loaded into refrigerated fish trucks. Documents found on them and around the wreck are being used for identification. Survivors now sleeping outdoors in Lampedusa's migrant holding centre are assisting with the task, as are relatives who have travelled from Germany and Sweden.</p><p>The boat, which had sailed from Misrata in Libya, was overloaded because the sailing season was coming to an end. The pending onset of bad weather prompted another 350 migrants, most from Egypt and Syria, to risk the sailing at the weekend. They were picked up safely by merchant vessels off the coast of Sicily.</p><p>Visiting Lampedusa on Sunday, Cecile Kyenge, Italy's first black minister, took issue with the Italian law that makes clandestine immigration a crime. \"We must reflect on the absurdity that the survivors of a shipwreck are put under criminal investigation,\" she said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419281522|2013-10-16T15:58:10Z|8ce095eed2aa23e460f9684720545011b89dae5a -->",

Human rights campaigners said that the tragedy could easily have been prevented.</p><p>\"A terrible human tragedy is taking place at the gates of Europe. And not for the first time,\" said Jean-Claude Mignon, head of the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly. \"We must end this now. I hope that this will be the last time we see a tragedy of this kind, and I make a fervent appeal for specific, urgent action by member states to end this shame.\"</p><p>The Italian government declared on Friday a national day of mourning as rescue workers continued to search the seas off the Sicilian island in a desperate attempt to find any more survivors. Initial rescue attempts managed to save 159 people but the 20-metre-long boat was believed to have been carrying between 450 and 500 passengers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419060131'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380885010589/Map-of-where-migrant-boat-010.jpg' alt='Map of where migrant boat sank off coast of Lampedusa' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>As the island's quayside was lined with corpses, hopes for more survivors dimmed. When coastguard divers began an inspection of the area around the wreck, they found 20 more bodies underwater. Asked on Italian radio what help was needed, Pietro Bartolo, chief of health services on Lampedusa, replied: \"Coffins. Coffins and hearses.\"</p><p>Giusi Nicolini, the island's mayor, said: \"It's horrific, like a cemetery. They are still bringing them out.\"</p><p>The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said the tragedy should be a spur to action. In Italy Napolitano and government ministers said the time had come for the world to shoulder its share of the burden in the growing problem of migrant boat arrivals.</p><p>Angelino Alfano, the deputy prime minister, said: \"We hope the EU realises that this is not an Italian but a European disaster.\" He headed to Lampedusa vowing to \"make Italy's voice heard loudly\" with José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission.</p><p>Napolitano said there was now an \"absolute necessity for decisions and actions by the international community and primarily the EU\". The integration minister, Cécile Kyenge, told journalists: \"It is not the moment to point the blame at anyone, but we will ask countries to each do their bit.\"</p><p>Their message was echoed by Pope Francis, who said: \"Let's unite our efforts so that tragedies like this don't happen again. Only a decisive collaboration of everyone can help and prevent them.\" In impromptu remarks, he added: \"The word disgrace comes to mind. It is a disgrace.\"</p><p>The alarm over the unfolding disaster was raised shortly after 6am by fishing boats who noticed a vessel in trouble off the Lampedusa coast near Isola dei Conigli (Rabbits' Island). Lampedusa, where the interior ministry says more than 8,000 migrants landed in the first eight and a half months of this year – out of a national total of more than 17,000 – is just 70 miles from the Tunisian coast.</p><p>Alfano said the boat's motor was believed to have stopped working, causing water to come into the vessel and prompting the passengers to burn a sheet to try to attract rescuers. \"Once the fire started, there was a concern about the boat sinking and everyone moved to one side, causing the boat to go down,\" he said. The passengers, mostly Eritreans and Somalians, were just half a mile from the shore.</p><p>A young Tunisian man was arrested by Italian police on suspicion of being one of the people smugglers responsible for organising the crossing. Unnamed survivors quoted in the Italian media, who said the boat had left the Libyan port of Misrata two days earlier, said that three fishing boats in the area had seen their vessel was in trouble but had not come to their rescue. Alfano rejected this, saying that the boats nearby had not seen them. \"If they had, they would have intervened,\" he said. \"Italians have big hearts.\"</p><p>But Codacons, an Italian consumer group, said it would ask prosecutors to look into the allegations, which it said, if true, would represent a very serious failure.</p><p>The controversy echoed a similar tragedy in March 2011, revealed in the Guardian, in which dozens of African migrants en route to Lampedusa died after being apparently ignored by a number of European military units.</p><p>Human rights groups have long been calling on Italian and European authorities to rethink their approach to the crossings, which brought about 15,000 migrants to Italy and Malta last year, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees.</p><p>Judith Sunderland, senior western Europe researcher of Human Rights Watch, said \"the lack of solidarity from the rest of the EU\" had caused an \"almost utter failure of any proposals for greater burden-sharing\".  Member states needed to do more to help Italy shoulder the burden, she said, calling also for a \"presumption of rescue\" policy to be implemented to ensure that any overcrowded migrant boat spotted by passing ships would have to be offered help.</p><p>Andrea Iacomini, spokesman for Unicef in Italy, urged Enrico Letta, the prime minister, to go to Europe and demand more co-ordination and help. He urged the interior ministers of all Mediterranean nations to hold an immediate conference focused on how to prevent  tragedy from happening again.</p><p>\"We need to go to Europe and say that there is a humanitarian emergency in Italy. What are we doing about it? … We cannot have the victims on our consciences only afterwards,\" Iacomini said, claiming the Mediterranean had \"become a cemetery. And it will become even more so.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419000089|2013-10-16T15:58:10Z|eb7d5bfa4de68feca154c6a94289caf1acae81fe -->",

        "body":"<p>Hundreds of victims of last week's migrant boat disaster off the Italian island of Lampedusa will be given a state funeral, the Italian prime minister, Enrico Letta, has said.</p><p>Letta visited the island with José Manuel Barroso, head of the European commission, who promised Italy €30m (£25m) in EU funds to help resettle migrants risking the 70-mile journey across the Mediterranean from Africa.</p><p>Divers on Tuesday continued to retrieve bodies from the boat, which sank after catching fire half a mile off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa last Thursday. The number of bodies found was reported to be 296. Of the 500 passengers packed on board, only 155 survived.</p><p>As they arrived on the island, Letta and Barroso were heckled by locals shouting \"shame\" and \"assassins\", while banners were raised and fishing boats sounded sirens in protest at a perceived lack of support from Rome and Brussels for migrants who reach the island, which is closer to Africa than mainland Europe.</p><p>After visiting the airport hangar housing the victims' bodies, Barroso said: \"It's an image you cannot forget.

We started to cry. My mask was flooded with tears,\" Renato Sollustri, a police diver, told La Repubblica.</p><p>The victims died when a boat packed with around 500 African migrants caught fire and sank around half a mile from the Italian island last Thursday.</p><p>José Manuel Barroso, president of the European commission, visited Lampedusa this week and said he would never forget the sight of \"hundreds of coffins lined up\" in the airport hangar being used temporarily to store the bodies.</p><p>Rescuers said that the baby had been placed in the same coffin as his mother, who is believed to have been about 20 years old. The two were found in the prow of the boat, and were only discovered by Sollustri and his team after they broke through what he described as \"a wall of bodies\", including a woman pressing a young child to her chest and a teenage boy with a T-shirt emblazoned with the word 'Italia'. Then they saw the woman.</p><p>\"We could not have gone back up without trying to do something for her,\" he said. \"We took her out of the boat forming a human chain with our arms. Then we laid her on the seabed. We tied her with a rope to other bodies and then … we rose with them from the depths of the sea to the light.\"</p><p>It was only then that they realised that the woman had, nestling in her clothes, a baby, presumed to have been born during the voyage from the Libyan coast.</p><p>\"Confronted with that woman and her little baby who had just been born we lost our detachment,\" said Sollustri. \"In the many years that I have been doing this job I had never seen anything like that.\"</p><p>As the recovery efforts continued, the ramifications of the disaster dominated political debate in Italy.</p><p>On Wednesday night the justice committee in the upper house of parliament, or Senate, approved an amendment to a 2009 law that made illegal immigration a crime punishable with a fine of up to €10,000 (£8,500).</p><p>Because of that law, the 155 survivors of last week's disaster are under criminal investigation. During a visit to Lampedusa on Wednesday, prime minister Enrico Letta said he felt \"deep shame at such [judicial] zeal\".</p><p>The amendment – presented by two MPs for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) – is understood to have the backing of Letta's government. But it will still have to be voted through in both houses of parliament, and support is by no means unanimous.</p><p>In a tweet, justice undersecretary Cosimo Ferri said he supported the repeal of the law because the criminal penalty was \"disproportionate and unjustified\" – let alone impractical given the poverty in which the migrants usually arrive.</p><p>But that view was not shared by some on the centre-right. Mariastella Gelmini, a former minister under Silvio Berlusconi, tweeted: \"The crime of illegal immigration abolished in the justice commission? Have we gone mad?\"</p><p>And, while the proposal began with two M5S senators, it was harshly criticised by their figurehead, Beppe Grillo, and movement guru Gianroberto Casaleggio, neither of whom are elected to parliament.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.beppegrillo.it/en/2013/10/the_crime_of_clandestinity.html\" title=\"\">In an angry blog</a>, they said they agreed with neither the senators' method nor the substance of their amendment.</p><p>\"Substituting oneself for public opinion, the popular wish, is common practice among the parties which want to 'educate' the citizens, but it is not ours,\" they wrote, criticising the MPs for having acted on a policy which was not in M5S electoral manifesto and which had not been consulted on.</p><p>They added that the policy itself would be \"an invitation to migrants from Africa and the Middle East to set sail for Italy … How many illegals are we able to receive if one Italian in eight does not have money to eat?\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419634463|2013-10-16T15:58:10Z|9de37c140c1e59e5e4b983bb4babe9aa64f3de38 -->",
