        "body":"<p>We had communicated about a month ago when we were going to come by New York to play the Apollo, and Lou was going to come to the show and hang out. He didn't make it because his health took a turn for the worse, so I knew things were not good, but I didn't know it was that serious. So I was half shocked and half crushed – shocked that he went so quickly and crushed over the loss.</p><p>Most people in the rock'n'roll world know about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/28/neil-gaiman-lou-reed-sandman\" title=\"\">Lou Reed and his reputation</a>. I had met him briefly, socially, about a decade ago, where he was very cordial. Four years ago, when we were doing the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame concerts, we had invited Lou to come play with us because we were one of the hosts for one of the segments. We were aware of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/28/lou-reed-career-being-contrary\" title=\"\">reputation for being unfiltered and upfront</a>, and that he just says what he's thinking; he can be a bit standoffish, we were told. We were in a rehearsal room in midtown Manhattan – he walked in and was quite standoffish, quite short, quite like you would expect him. We started setting up, and waltzing around a few musical things, and he was complaining about how loud we were and that we were playing everything wrong. Every single thing we were doing was wrong. It wasn't limited to our entire approach to music, our existence was wrong. From the day we were born, our existence was wrong. Obviously I'm exaggerating for effect here …</p><p>But within an hour or so, me and him had a little chat, and I think I comforted him in the fact that nothing bad was going to happen. It dawned on me when I was talking to someone else about Lou, that a lot of people from his generation, they've just been so mistreated over the years by people who have taken advantage of them, both inside and outside the business – a lot of people his age are guarded. So when a bunch of musicians in their 40s welcome him with open arms and invite him to come in and jam, he's just suspicious that something's going to happen. I understand that and I'm not faulting him for that.</p><p>Things did thaw, me and him had a pow-wow in a corner, and it went very fast and became pretty cool. We realised we had so much in common. There was this trust. But he was a very guarded, mistrusting person, and spending the subsequent couple of years with him and being around everything from interviews to playing gigs I could just see that whenever there were new people who came on his radar that he would have to size them up first before he let himself be opened up. I've met half a dozen other artists from his generation, and if you talk to them for long enough they'll tell you stories about getting fucked over, by the man, the system, the business, bad deals, each other, whatever.</p><p>We were both outsiders, we both never felt comfortable going down the same path that everyone else was doing. Metallica's always been autonomous, and Lou Reed is the godfather of being an outsider, being autonomous, marching to his own drum, making every project different from the previous one and never feeling like he had a responsibility to anybody other than himself. We shared kinship over that. And we brought him something that he didn't have, or maybe hadn't experienced so much, which in his own words were 'energy' and \"weight\" and \"size\" and whatever it is that happens when we start playing. He was so into what we brought him. And, of course, he brought us this incredible piece of work that he had already written, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/27/lou-reed-metallica-lulu-review\" title=\"\">Lulu</a>, and about her escapades and sexual endeavours. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJlU_9Vyvqs\" title=\"\">We brought something to each other</a>, and we shared a common lack of ability to fit in with our surroundings.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fJlU_9Vyvqs\" title=\"\">Reading on mobile? Click to view</a></p><p>Jann Wenner threw a celebration of the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame, and U2 and Springsteen were there hosting little segments, and they asked us to host a segment, so we asked him to play with us. And that worked out very well, and I think he felt so comfortable with us. As we were leaving Madison Square Garden, he looked at me as we walked out into the car park in the bowels of Madison Square Garden and we ended up making the record a year-and-a-half after Madison Square Garden. But the Lulu escapades and everything that became our record was stuff he's had swirling in his mind for probably decades: the story of this character and the relationship with all the different men in her life.</p><p>I played the record for my kids yesterday in the car, and it sounded as relevant and more intense than ever; it sounded incredibly potent, very alive and impulsive. He brought this incredible lyrical story. I'm not so into who's \"best\" or \"No 1\", but he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/oct/27/lou-reed-six-of-his-greatest-songs\" title=\"\">the most accomplished poet within the world of rock'n'roll</a> over the last four decades. He brought this story he had spent a lot of time with, but on the counter side of that he brought an incredibly impulsive energy into the studio where he asked us to come up with stuff on the spot.</p><p>Nothing was thought about, nothing was laboured over, nothing was dissected or analysed. We just started playing, Lou started half-reciting, half-singing these beautiful poems, and off we went and this record came out. It taught me a different approach in the studio, of just doing it rather than thinking about it. We did the whole record in three weeks; three weeks in on a normal Metallica record we haven't even decided what corner of the studio we're going to set the drums in. The whole thing was very impulsive, and there wasn't a lot of analytical thought that went into it.</p><p>The hard rock community, they can be pretty harsh, so I'm pretty thick-skinned. And so when the hard rock community turned its back on the record I wasn't surprised. A lot of people were saying, \"oh, Lou Reed doesn't sing\". Yeah, no shit. What do you think he's been doing for the last 40 years? Did you expect him to sound like Robert Plant? That's not what he does. In the hard rock community I was not particularly surprised. But I was surprised that some more intellectual writers were pretty harsh to it.</p><p>But two years later, a lot of people have come around. Howard Stern did a whole episode about how wrong he was about Lulu, and how Junior Dad is his favourite song of last year even though it came out two years ago. Twenty-five years from now, you're going to have millions of people claiming they owned the record or loved it when it came out, of course neither will be true. I think it's going to age well – when I played it yesterday it sounded fucking awesome. In some ways it's almost cooler that people didn't embrace it, because it makes it more ours, it's our project, our record, and this was never made for the masses and the masses didn't take to it. It makes it more precious for those who were involved.</p><p>I'll always remember his fragility. I felt in some way that I connected to his fragility, and identified with it. He was very open, he would say, \"Lars, I love you\", and text me a heart. It was so beautiful. The way he was so unfiltered is what I will remember most, and his fragility, and how I've never met anybody who, no matter what he was saying, he was always speaking his truth. It never felt cerebral, it always felt like it came from some other place somewhere. When people talk, it comes from their brain; I don't know where his words came from, but they came from somewhere else. Emotional, physical, everything – it really resonated with me. I wanted to give him strength, and I think Metallica gave him strength. His being was so beautiful once that guard went away, and it was childlike.</p><p>• Lars Ulrich was speaking to Ben Beaumont-Thomas</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421273370|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|831165fd9f9c47de840904a9ff789e2007afe240 -->",

        "body":"<p>As a teenager I would try to imagine what I would say to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/27/lou-reed-velvet-underground-dies\" title=\"\"> Lou Reed </a>if I ever met him. I'd turn questions over in my mind: perhaps I'd be able to eke out some hitherto unrecorded detail of Factory life, or draw him on the meaning of an obscure lyric. Maybe he could tell me whether he'd really been<a href=\"https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographer/default.aspx?photographerID=19&amp;photographID=1496\" title=\"\"> about to kiss David Bowie in that famous picture</a>. Or whether he did in fact detest poor Nico. But no question I could think of felt right. He'd be bound to get pissed off, which would be the last thing I'd want. My fantasy ended with us just sitting there in silence, and he'd smile at me. I'd smile back. That was enough.</p><p></p><p>Lou Reed was my idol. Out of place and out of time, for sure. When I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/22/transformer-lou-reed\" title=\"\">wrote about what his most famous solo album, Transformer, meant to me</a>, some readers seemed to feel I wasn't qualified. I was born six years after it was released. So no, it wasn't on the radio (or being banned from it) when I first started going out or smoking weed or falling in love. But it was on my tape deck, so who cares? A really great artist isn't tied to the time and place he or she worked in, though I can understand the impulse to try to claim someone like that as your own. It's a way of showing how much they mean to you.</p><p></p><p>But it is selfish. As long as there are misfits, and gay people, and transsexuals, and kids festering in the suburbs (or out on the island), dreaming of a life that suits them better, there will be fans of Lou Reed. And as long as mainstream culture caters to the optimistic, law-abiding, career-minded heterosexual (which, by definition, it always will), new people will discover him, and he will be their means of escape. They will be transported back to New York in the 1960s and 70s, but also to a place outside of time, like Christopher Isherwood's Berlin or Armistead Maupin's San Francisco.</p><p></p><p>Reed as an icon will be analysed and theorised endlessly in the coming days. And of course he was a cultural phenomenon. With those shades and that blank expression he communicated something far more menacing to middle-class America than the curly haired man with the harmonica. We're not just talking opposition to the Vietnam war and a few tokes on a reefer. He shot up heroin and speed and went out with a transsexual. He sang about dumping an overdose victim out in the streets so that \"by the morning she's just another hit and run\". The darkest sides of human nature were front and centre for Reed; no apologies, no compromise.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/oct/27/lou-reed-six-of-his-greatest-songs\" title=\"\">But he also wrote brilliant songs.</a> His mentor at Syracuse University was the poet Delmore Schwartz (another count on which Reed beats Bob Dylan is as a lyricist: his writing doesn't strain to impress or bamboozle. It makes very direct, very human sense.) And his instinct for irresistible hooks was first harnessed as a staff songwriter for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickwick_Records\" title=\"\">Pickwick Records</a>. Both talents combined to push the genre to its limits: Reed could make great art out of pop. Just listen to I'll Be Your Mirror, a conventionally structured song of such heartbreaking tenderness it can stop you in your tracks. And there have been times I couldn't bear to play Coney Island Baby, with its refrain of \"I wanted to play football for the coach\", its quiet nostalgia like a punch in the stomach.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, now he's gone and I'll never get to talk to him. I wouldn't have taken the chance even if it came up. The disillusionment would've been awful: the Lou Reed I knew and loved wasn't the man himself, but the result of some unlikely alchemy between his recordings and the mind of a 13-year-old from the East Midlands. He held the promise of everything strange and exciting the world might have to offer. Luckily that promise is still there, and always will be, just out of reach – thanks to those exquisitely painful songs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421103063|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|b5c19aa8b1409a2a6a50ff28b27f0c163cd9089a -->",

        "headline":"Lou Reed obituary",
        "body":"<p>Before the arrival of Lou Reed, it could be said that rock'n'roll remained a part of the entertainment industry, still in the business of ingratiating itself with its target audience even as it tried equally hard to alienate their parents. Reed, who has died aged 71, made alienation the dominant mode and an article of faith for subsequent generations.</p><p>With his band, the Velvet Underground, and in his subsequent solo career, his hymns to transgressive behaviour shaped the approach of such near-contemporaries as David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Patti Smith before exercising a pervasive influence on such successors as Talking Heads, the Sex Pistols, Joy Division, REM, the Strokes, and almost certainly whichever indie band finds itself on the cover of the next issue of the New Musical Express.</p><p>After the affectless New York drawl heard on Walk on the Wild Side and Perfect Day, his fearlessness was the most distinctive quality that Reed brought to the business of making rock'n'roll. Unafraid to jolt his audience by presenting them with noise elements borrowed from the jazz and classical avant-garde or with images of himself as a representative of a sexually ambiguous underworld, eventually he would find that he had created an audience of outsiders who coalesced around his example.</p><p>For five years following the release in 1967 of The Velvet Underground and Nico, an album ostensibly &quot;produced&quot; by Andy Warhol and featuring the artist's peel-off banana on the cover, the music of Reed and his colleagues was listened to only by a devoted few. Those few, however, eventually emerged as the shapers of a new and powerful strain of popular music. Once the punk and new wave explosions had occurred on both sides of the Atlantic, it could be seen that Reed had changed the mood and the direction of pop in a way that might legitimately be compared with the impact of Elvis Presley, the Beatles or Bob Dylan.</p><p>Before Reed got to work, pop's idea of darkness was the romantic despair of Roy Orbison's Running Scared, the adolescent misogyny of the Rolling Stones' Under My Thumb or the acid put-down of Dylan's Positively 4th Street. Right from the beginning, the Velvet Underground's songs plunged into the real darkness of hard drugs, sexual degradation and psychosis, the mood of Venus in Furs and the even more startlingly explicit Heroin recalibrating rock'n'roll's sights.</p><p>The prevailing darkness was reflected in the way Reed and his fellow musicians rebooted the music's primal look: they wore black, black, and more black, a blatant rejection of the vivid palette of psychedelia and its love-and-peace attitudes. The look flourishes today among young groups seeking to evoke the illicit thrill of Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia shows, in which the Velvet Underground played while the actress Edie Sedgwick gyrated and the poet <a href=\"http://www.gerardmalanga.com\" title=\"\">Gerard Malanga </a>cracked a bullwhip, all against a backdrop of Warhol's movies.</p><p>Reed's more profound ambition was to use rock's immediacy as a vehicle for a certain kind of literary approach. &quot;Let's take Crime and Punishment and turn it into a rock'n'roll song,&quot; he said. As well as Dostoevsky, his heroes included Raymond Chandler, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/28/guardianobituaries.film\" title=\"\">Hubert Selby Jr</a>, William Burroughs and Edgar Allan Poe. His later career included collaborations with artists from various fields, including theatre pieces with Robert Wilson, films with Wim Wenders and works with the composer Laurie Anderson, who was his companion for the last 20 years.</p><p>Reed was born to a middle-class Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of a tax accountant and a former beauty queen. Growing up from the age of 11 on Long Island, he was sent to a psychiatric hospital for electroconvulsive therapy, intended to cure him of a general hostility to his parents and what they believed to be homosexual instincts. Attracted to the sounds of rock'n'roll, doo-wop vocal groups and avant-garde jazz, he had taught himself to play the guitar and made his first record with a doo-wop group, the Jades, at the age of 14.</p><p>In 1960 he enrolled at Syracuse University, where he studied film directing, creative writing and journalism, and fell under the influence of the poet and short-story writer Delmore Schwartz. On graduating in 1964, and intent on a career in music, he went to work as a songwriter for Pickwick Records, whose principal business was churning out budget-priced discs for sale in supermarkets. When one of his compositions, titled The Ostrich and intended to promote a made-up dance craze, threatened to become a hit, a band was quickly assembled to help promote it, and it was there that Reed met John Cale, who would become his most important musical collaborator.</p><p>The Welsh-born Cale, whose instruments were the viola and the bass guitar, had studied composition with Aaron Copland and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/feb/05/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Iannis Xenakis </a>and performed with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jul/10/john-cage-composer-drawings-exhibition\" title=\"\">John Cage </a>and La Monte Young's Dream Syndicate. His discovery that Reed played The Ostrich on a guitar with all its strings tuned to the same note encouraged him to pursue their collaboration. Rehearsing in an apartment on the Lower East Side with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sterling-morrison-1599390.html\" title=\"\">Sterling Morrison</a>, a friend of Reed's from Syracuse, on rhythm guitar and the sculptor Walter De Maria on drums, they went through a series of names: the Primitives, the Warlocks, the Falling Spikes. Once De Maria had departed and his replacement, Angus MacLise, had been succeeded by Maureen Tucker, they settled on calling themselves the Velvet Underground, after a pulp paperback devoted to aberrant sexual behaviour.</p><p>Returning from a visit to London with copies of records by the Who and the Small Faces, Cale advocated a shift from their conventional Dylan-influenced folk-rock style to something more adventurous and confrontational. With Reed adding the abstract noise elements of free-form jazz, Cale alternating between hammering out piano ostinati and using his viola to produce grating drones, and Tucker thumping her tom-toms from a standing position, the group began to produce the morose, sludgy ensemble sound that was like nothing else in popular music, as well as rendering Reed's vocals tantalisingly indistinct.</p><p>Both rudimentary and highly sophisticated, their music appealed to Warhol, who was looking for a rock group to add to his menagerie of soi-disant superstars and was taken to hear them at a Greenwich Village coffee house. They soon became familiar figures at the Factory, where they were introduced to the German actress and model Nico (born Christa P&auml;ffgen), who had recently made a record in London. At Warhol's suggestion she became their fifth member, adding an element of glamour and mystery as she intoned Reed's songs, notably Femme Fatale, I'll Be Your Mirror and All Tomorrow's Parties, in her deep, virtually expressionless voice.</p><p>It is hard to exaggerate the degree to which they were swimming against the tide of popular fashion, or the extent of the mingled scorn and indifference with which their debut album was received. Supposedly, San Francisco and Los Angeles were the crucibles of the new music emerging to accompany the celebrations of the Summer of Love, while New York had been temporarily relegated to the status of a black hole from which no cultural light escaped.</p><p>Nico left the band after the first album, but the remaining Velvets carried on as a quartet to record a second album, one that would be just as striking and, ultimately, as influential as its predecessor. The centrepiece of White Light/White Heat (1968) was the majestic 17-minute Sister Ray, probably the closest any of the studio records came to reproducing the controlled anarchy of their live performances.</p><p>Tensions between Reed and Cale led to the Welshman's enforced departure before their third album, The Velvet Underground, in which Reed adopted a gentler overall tone – except for a song called Murder Mystery, in which he experimented with parallel narratives delivered simultaneously from either side of the stereo sound-picture. A fourth album, Loaded, contained two songs that would become classics, Sweet Jane and Rock &amp; Roll, but by the time of its release in 1970 Reed had left the group, disillusioned by its failure to make any sort of commercial impact.</p><p>He returned to his parents' home, working as a clerk at his father's firm for more than a year before re-emerging at the end of 1971 to begin a series of albums under a new contract with RCA Records. The first was not a success but the second, Transformer, was the one that finally brought him attention: produced by his new friend Bowie, it contained a hit single, the seductive Walk on the Wild Side, in which he portrayed a series of picaresque Warhol characters. Its packaging aligned him with the new mood of glamour and decadence to whose adherents, thanks largely to Bowie's enthusastic patronage, he became an object of veneration.</p><p>He retained his status as glam-rock gave way to punk, but his recording career became characterised by its inconsistency: sometimes infuriatingly sub-standard, occasionally brilliant. The moments of brilliance were usually those most likely to lose him his following, such as a song-cycle of epic morbidity titled Berlin (1973), and Metal Machine Music (1975), a double album of guitar noise which could have been explicitly devised to ensure the termination of his recording contract.</p><p>Street Hassle (1978), The Bells (1979) and The Blue Mask (1982) all contained pieces in which he stretched himself in interesting directions, but with New York (1989) and Magic and Loss (1992) he hit his full stride once more, the songs Dirty Blvd and What's Good proving his continuing ability to invest the two-chord rock'n'roll song with an irresistible freshness. At the other extreme came The Raven (2003), a series of pieces inspired by Poe, demonstrating the extent of his extraordinary range.</p><p>He collaborated with Cale once again in 1990 on Songs for Drella, a threnody for Warhol, and in 1993 the four original Velvets re-formed for a brief series of European concerts that ended, appropriately enough, in acrimony. Reed, Cale and Tucker played together once more, while being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the year after Morrison's death.</p><p>Reed's final years were full of activity, including several theatre pieces with Wilson, the publication of his lyrics and photographs in book form, an adaptation of Wedekind's Lulu plays with Metallica, concert performances and a film (directed by Julian Schnabel) of Berlin, and appearances on records by Gorillaz and the Killers and on tribute albums to Buddy Holly and to his great friend the songwriter Doc Pomus. Ornette Coleman, Jimmy Scott, Antony Hegarty and the Blind Boys of Alabama were guests on his records, and he took part in the most unlikely of projects, a live orchestral rendering of Metal Machine Music. He never renounced the habit of terrifying journalists who failed to ask questions that engaged his attention.</p><p>What Reed possessed was authenticity. When he sang about going up to Harlem to buy heroin or about transgressive sex, his writing came from first-hand experience. Drugs and drink were a constant companion for most of his adult life, and between his first and second marriages — to Bettye Kronstadt in 1973 and Sylvia Morales in 1980 — he lived openly for several years with a transvestite named Rachel. And he could turn it all into an unflinching poetry.</p><p>He gave up drink and drugs in his 50s, opting for T'ai Chi and studies with a Tibetan lama. He underwent a liver transplant earlier this year and died in the Long Island home he shared with Anderson, whom he married in 2008 and who survives him.</p><p>• Lou (Lewis Allen) Reed, singer, songwriter and guitarist, born 2 March 1942; died 27 October 2013</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421124882|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|4b61a91e5dc04baff71d61922094ba9ab239c773 -->",

        "headline":"Neil Gaiman on Lou Reed: 'His songs were the soundtrack to my life'",
        "body":"<p>'There are certain kinds of songs you write that are just fun songs – the lyric really can't survive without the music. But for most of what I do, the idea behind it was to try and bring a novelist's eye to it, and, within the framework of rock'n'roll, to try to have that lyric there so somebody who enjoys being engaged on that level could have that and have the rock'n'roll too.\" That was what Lou Reed told me in 1991.</p><p>I'm a writer. I write fiction, mostly. People ask me about my influences, and they expect me to talk about other writers of fiction, so I do. And sometimes, when I can, I put Reed on the list, and nobody ever asks what he's doing there, which is good because I don't know how to explain why a&nbsp;songwriter is responsible for so much of the way I view the world.</p><p>His songs were the soundtrack to my life: a quavering New York voice with little range singing songs of alienation and despair, with flashes of impossible hope and of those tiny, perfect days and nights we want to last for ever, important because they are so finite and so few; songs filled with people, some named, some anonymous, who strut and stagger and flit and shimmy and hitch-hike into the limelight and out again.</p><p>It was all about stories. The songs implied more than they told: they made me want to know more, to imagine, to tell those stories myself. Some of the stories were impossible to unpack, others, like The Gift, were classically constructed short stories. Each of the albums had a personality. Each of the stories had a&nbsp;narrative voice: often detached, numb, without&nbsp;judgment.</p><p>Trying to reconstruct it in my head: it wasn't even the music that sucked me in, initially, as much as it was a&nbsp;1974&nbsp;NME interview I read when I&nbsp;was 13. The opinions, the character, the street smarts, his loathing of the interviewer. He was in the Sally Can't Dance phase, drugged out, the most commercially successful and most mocked album of his career. I wanted to know who Reed was, so I bought and&nbsp;borrowed everything I could, because the interview was about stories, and stories that would become&nbsp;songs.</p><p>I was a Bowie fan, which meant that I had bought or borrowed Transformer when I was 13, and then someone handed me an acetate of Live at Max's Kansas City and then I was a Lou Reed fan and a Velvet Underground fan. I&nbsp;looked for everything I could. I&nbsp;hunted through record shops. Reed's music was the soundtrack to my teenage years.</p><p>I saw him at the New Victoria when I was 15, on the Rock'n'Roll Heart tour. He kept stopping to tune his guitar. The audience cheered and yelled and shouted \"Heroin!\" At one point, he leaned in to the mic and told us all to \"shut the fuck up. I'm trying to get this fuckin' toon right.\"</p><p>At the end of the night, he told us we'd been such a crummy audience we didn't deserve an encore, and he didn't do one. That, I decided, was a real rock'n'roll star.</p><p>I was 15 and playing Transformer in the art room at school. My friend Marc Gregory came over, with a request. His band covered Perfect Day, but he'd never heard the Reed original. I put it on for him. He listened for about a minute, then he turned around, puzzled, looking uncomfortable.</p><p>\"He's singing flat.\"</p><p>\"He can't be singing flat,\" I told him. \"It's his song.\"</p><p>Marc went off disgruntled, and I still believe I was right.</p><p>When I was 16 and had my first break-up with a girlfriend, I played Berlin over and over until my friends worried about me. Also, I walked in the rain a lot.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421151201'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/28/1382985393163/Lou-Reed-Performing-In-Br-008.jpg' alt='Lou Reed Performing In Brussels' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>His music always stayed a part of my life … Reed performing in Brussels in 1974. Photograph:   Bettmann/CORBIS</figcaption></figure><p>I was willing to sing in a punk band in 1977 because, I decided, you didn't have to be able to sing to sing. Reed did just fine with whatever voice he had. You just had to be willing to tell stories in song.</p><p>Brian Eno said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/27/lou-reed-velvet-underground-dies\" title=\"\">only 30,000 people bought the first Velvet Underground album when it came out, but they all formed bands</a>. That may have been true. But some of us listened to Loaded over and over and we wrote&nbsp;stories.</p><p>I would see Lou's songs surface in the stories I read. William Gibson wrote a short story called Burning Chrome, which is his take on a Velvet Underground song called Pale Blue Eyes. Sandman, the comic that made my name, would not have happened without Reed. Sandman celebrates the marginalised, the people out on the edges. And in grace notes that run through it, partly in the huger themes, Morpheus, Dream, the eponymous Sandman has one title that means more to me than any other. He's the Prince of Stories too, a title I stole from I'm Set Free (\"I've been blinded but now I can see/ What in the world has happened to me?/ The prince of stories who walked right by me\").</p><p>When I needed to write a Sandman story set in hell, I played Reed's Metal Machine Music (which I've described as \"four sides of tape hum, on the kinds of frequencies that drive animals with particularly sensitive hearing to throw themselves off cliffs and cause blind unreasoning panic in crowds\" all day for two weeks. It helped.</p><p>The things he sang about were transgressive, always on the edge of what you could say: people pointed to the mention of oral sex in Walk on the Wild Side, but the easy gender changes were more important in retrospect, the casual way that Transformer took nascent gay culture and made it mainstream.</p><p>Lou Reed's music stayed part of my life, whatever else was happening.</p><p>I named my daughter Holly after Warhol superstar Holly Woodlawn, who I'd discovered in Walk on the Wild Side. When Holly was 19, I made her a playlist of more songs she had loved as a small girl, the ones she'd remembered and the ones she'd forgotten, which led to our having the Conversation. I dragged songs from her childhood over to the playlist – Nothing Compares 2 U and I Don't Like Mondays and These Foolish Things, and then came Walk on the Wild Side. \"You named me from this song, didn't you?\" said Holly as the first bass notes sang. \"Yup,\" I said. Reed started singing.</p><p>Holly listened to the first verse, and for the first time, actually heard the words. \"Shaved her legs and then he was a she …? He?\"</p><p>\"That's right,\" I said, and bit the bullet. We were having the Conversation. \"You were named after a drag queen in a Lou Reed song.\" She grinned like a light going on. \"Oh Dad. I do love you,\" she said. Then she wrote what I'd said down on the back of an envelope, in case she forgot it. I'm not sure that I'd ever expected the Conversation to go quite like that.</p><p>I interviewed Lou in 1991, over the phone. He was in Germany, about to go on stage. He was interested, engaged, smart. Really smart. He'd published a&nbsp;collection of lyrics, with notes. They felt like a novel.</p><p>A year or so later, I had dinner with him and my publisher at DC Comics. Lou wanted to make Berlin into a graphic novel. He was hard work: prickly, funny, opinionated, smart and combative: you had to prove yourself. My publisher mentioned that she had been a friend of Warhol's and faced a third degree from Lou to prove that she had been a real friend. Before he talked to me about comics, he gave me something approaching an oral examination on 1950s EC Horror comics, and challenged me on using a phrase of his in an issue of Miracleman I'd written. I told him I'd learned more about Warhol's voice from Lou's lyrics in Songs for Drella than I had from all the biographies I'd read, all the Warhol diaries, and Lou seemed satisfied.</p><p>I passed the exam, but wasn't interested in taking it twice. I'd been around long enough to know that the person isn't the art. Lou Reed, Lou told me, was a persona he used to keep people at a distance. I&nbsp;was happy to keep my distance. I went back to being a fan, happy to celebrate the magic without the magician.</p><p>I'm sad today. Friends of his are sending me brokenhearted emails. The world is darker. Lou knew about days like this, as well. \"There's a bit of magic in everything,\" he told us: \"And then some loss to even things out.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421150868|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|518e19ae980995d4b14d3420e9107e164c3a3c5d -->",

        "headline":"Lou Reed: A career of being contrary",
        "body":"<p>In December 1964, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/lou-reed\" title=\"\">Lou Reed</a> released what was effectively a solo single under the name the Primitives. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r998weOUiM\" title=\"\">Do the Ostrich</a> wasn't the first record to bear his name. For a few months he'd been churning out made-to-order songs for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickwick_Records\" title=\"\">Pickwick, a label that specialised in bargain-basement albums</a> ripping off that period's prevalent pop styles. Before that, his teenage band the Jades had released two entirely unexceptional doo-wop tracks in 1958 and two years later he had chanced his arm as a solo singer, recording in the perky, post-rock'n'roll style that predominated in pre-Beatles America. Alas, Your Love and Merry Go Round went unreleased, possibly because Reed chose to sing their bright-eyed, scrubbed-clean lyrics – \"I walk you home every day from school\" – with the same dry, deadpan monotone in which he would later relate Sister Ray's saga of drag queens shooting up methedrine, giving blow jobs and murdering leather-clad sailors.</p><p>But if it wasn't the first Lou Reed record, Do the Ostrich was certainly the most remarkable  at the time. It was meant to be a quick knock-off of a novelty dance fad single, in the vein of Chubby Checker's It's Pony Time or Dee Dee Sharp's Do the Bird, and on one level, a quick knock-off was clearly what it was: Reed couldn't even be bothered to write his own riff, pinching it from the Crystals' 1963 smash <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE_jOD2Fxvs\" title=\"\">Then He Kissed Me</a>. But there, its resemblance to a chart hit ended. Reed had tuned all the strings on his guitar to the same note, resulting in an intense, clangourous din, he'd later use the same trick on the Velvet Underground's Venus in Furs and All Tomorrow's Parties. The lyrics aren't trying to start a novelty dance craze at all, they're the sound of a drugged-out New York smart-ass sneering at anyone stupid enough to indulge in a dance craze: \"Take a step forward, step on your face.\" There isn't a chorus, just a load of unsettling screaming. The ultra-primitive rhythm builds to a chaotic, pounding middle section that sounds remarkably like something off White Light/White Heat, still one of the great challenging listens in the classic rock canon 45&nbsp;years on. How anybody came to the conclusion that this was headed for the Top 10 is a mystery. It's an odd footnote in his career, but Reed never seemed embarrassed by it. Quite the contrary, on the Velvet Underground's debut album, he was credited as playing \"Ostrich guitar\"; in some of the last interviews he gave, a year before his death, he was still happily expounding on the power of the one-note \"ostrich tuning\". Perhaps it was because, in its own weird way, Do the Ostrich was Lou Reed in a nutshell: it should have been straightforward, but Reed had done the opposite of what he was expected to do. In the short term, the result was commercial oblivion: the single sank. In the long term, Reed had found his métier. He would make a career out of doing the opposite of what people expected, so endlessly contrary that it became impossible to pin down the real person behind the music. He was unknowable, which you suspect is exactly what he wanted to be: \"I don't have a personality of my own,\" he flatly told&nbsp;one interviewer.</p><p>Or perhaps the contrariness <em>was</em> his personality writ large. A friend who knew him when he was Lewis Reed, the eldest son of a middle-class Long Island Jewish couple, told his biographer Victor Bockris that Reed had a pronounced case of <a href=\"http://www.jewish-languages.org/jewish-english-lexicon/words/534\" title=\"\">shpilkes</a>: his nervous energy was such that \"he has to scratch not only his own itch, he can't leave any situation alone or any scab unpicked\". Certainly, from the start, he specialised in confounding the expectations of even his closest collaborators. In the Velvet Underground, John Cale had Reed pegged as \"very full of himself and faggy … queen bitch\", perfectly at home among the barbed gossip and camp put-downs of Andy Warhol's Factory. The minute he'd manouevered his creative partner out of the band, however, the man Cale called Lulu started writing songs on <a href=\"http://www.nerve.com/music/the-25-greatest-love-songs-of-the-1960s\" title=\"\">which he pined for his college sweetheart Shelly Albin like a lovesick teenager</a>. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWFgGxe-CjI\" title=\"\">Pale Blue Eyes</a> is about her, as is Beginning to See the Light and I Found a Reason; \"Shelley, if you'd just come back it would be alright,\" he sang, plaintively, on I Can't Stand It.</p><p>In their Cale years, the Velvet Underground themselves could sound like a band intent on overturning the established order of rock'n'roll, almost literally: on their 1967 debut, European Son bursts into frantic chaos with a&nbsp;verbatim crash, like the contents of an upended table hitting the floor. But Reed wasn't a musical iconoclast, he was a scholarly rock fan, a classicist who thought You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling was \"the best record ever made\"; \"there is no God and Brian Wilson is his son,\" he wrote in an essay published in December 1966. Ten minutes before the crash on European Son, you can hear Reed signpost his love of Motown by opening <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZH82l_ie9M\" title=\"\">There She Goes Again</a> with a musical quotation from Martha and the Vandellas' Hitch Hike. Perhaps that's why they ended up being so influential: because the Velvet Underground sounded like a rock'n'roll band, even when they sounded like no rock'n'roll band had ever done before.</p><p>Anyone who thought that things might become more straightforward and less contradictory when Reed became a solo artist was in for a major disappointment. The enduring image of Reed became that of the self-styled Rock'n'Roll Animal: tough, streetwise, clad in black leather and fuelled by amphetamine, possessed of an attitude that went far beyond rock-star arrogance or insouciant cool into the realms of real nastiness and cruelty. But Rock'n'Roll Animal was the possibly ironic title of a 1973 live album Reed apparently had no great love for. The stuff that reinforced that image – I'm Waiting for the Man, Street Hassle, Dirt, Kicks, Sad Song – was matched by songs of real tenderness, not in the grudging tears-of-a-tough-guy style, but open and honest and touchingly fragile (see Femme Fatale's ruined suitor warning others off to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrIulnAblk\" title=\"\">Coney Island Baby</a>, his lovestruck paean to <a href=\"http://dangerousminds.net/comments/rachel_lou_reeds_transsexual_muse\" title=\"\">Rachel, the beautiful drag queen who was his mid-70s companion</a>).</p><p>He embraced glam rock, a genre he'd done a great deal to invent, but the career-rescuing success of the David Bowie and Mick Ronson-produced Transformer was undercut by the unmistakable sense that Reed felt that glam was beneath him: you could somehow tell he wasn't wholeheartedly on board by the way he described glam as a \"bullshit dyed-hair faggot junkie trip\". In the middle of 1974's Sally Can't Dance, an album he described as \"a piece of shit\" which he \"slept through\", he dumped Kill Your Sons, as nakedly confessional and personal a song as he ever wrote, detailing a psychiatrist's attempts to cure the 17-year-old Reed of his homosexual urges and mood swings through electroshock treatments. It mentioned the mental hospital in which he was treated by name, and depicted the memory loss he suffered in the aftermath. Charged with making a more straightforward album to appease his new label Arista, whose intervention had apparently saved him from bankruptcy, he made Rock and Roll Heart, which if it was pallid enough to get on mid-70s radio spoiled its chances of doing so with its lyrics: \"I&nbsp;believe in the iron cross.\"  At the other extreme, as the 80s dawned, The Blue Mask simultaneously re-established his musical potency and focus and came up with the most unbelievable lyric since he offered to walk you home from school on Merry-Go-Round: \"I'm just an average guy,\" he sang, again and again.</p><p>From the late 80s onwards, he could have settled comfortably into the role of beloved elder statesman of rock that the scale of his influence and importance warranted. New York, from 1989, and the following year's Songs for Drella, an astonishing album-length eulogy for Andy Warhol that rekindled his partnership with Cale suggested he might, but it didn't work out like that. He seemed no more at ease with the elder statesman role than he had been as a&nbsp;make-up-caked glam star. He effectively scuppered a Velvet Underground reunion before they could make an album, which depending on your perspective was a squandered opportunity, or just as well. His shpilkes was clearly still raging, which explained how he could follow an album as good as Ecstasy with the scenery-chewing The Raven and his curious attitude to his own back-catalogue during concerts – no one except Reed wanted to hear All Tomorrows' Parties with a funk backbeat or Perfect Day as a soundtrack for his tai chi instructor to come on stage and perform the splits. He kept moving. You could never have accused him of cravenly coasting on past glories. Other artists performed their best-loved albums in their entirety live. Reed did an ear-splitting improvisation based on 1975's notorious Metal Machine Music, having come to the conclusion that what an hour of howling feedback needed was the addition of saxophone, and exorcised the commercial failure of his 1973 concept album Berlin: a nostalgic evening of speed addiction, spousal abuse, screaming children and suicide.</p><p>It might have made a more satisfying end to the story if his final album hadn't been Lulu, a collaboration with Metallica that Reed claimed was the best thing he'd ever done, but received some of the worst reviews of his career. But then, Reed didn't deal in happy endings, and instead he went out with one final confounding, antagonistic act of perversity. In the past, he'd only succeeded in baffling and pissing off his own fans. This time he managed to baffle and piss off millions of fans of one of the world's biggest bands as well: a triumph of sorts.</p><p>He ended his life as unknowable and contrary as the 22-year-old who made Do the Ostrich. In one of his last interviews – still on the news stands when he died – a journalist ventured to ask him why he didn't write an autobiography. \"Why would I?\" he snapped. \"Write about myself? I don't think so. Set what record straight? There's not a record to keep straight.\" And then he came up with a flat rejection of any attempt to make sense of a 55-year long recording career that had transformed rock, and a line that could stand as his epitaph: \"I am what I am, it is what it is. And,\" he added, \"fuck you.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421153601|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|caa3c817868cfb09f8cfcdb9979880a50011d6ac -->",

        "headline":"Lou Reed: a beginner's guide",
        "body":"<p>The tributes and retrospectives following Lou Reed's death will inevitably lead to many people discovering his music for the first time. But where to start? Some would point to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/nov/05/velvet-underground-nico-readers-review\">The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</a>, or solo album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/22/transformer-lou-reed\">Transformer</a>, as possible kicking off points.</p> <p>We asked Guardian readers to help compile a playlist of ten tracks for people who've never listened to Lou Reed of the Velvet Underground before. Here's what they came up with – listen via the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjjJcJNDIhap4ZTJxFinJujvECA7SL4d4&amp;feature=mh_lolz\">YouTube playlist</a>, or click the song title to play an individual track:</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjjJcJNDIhap4ZTJxFinJujvECA7SL4d4&amp;feature=mh_lolz\"> <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&amp;list=PLjjJcJNDIhap4ZTJxFinJujvECA7SL4d4\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwLlvcDi4PQ\">1. Coney Island Baby</a></h2> <p>&quot;It's probably Reed's most poignant reflection on and recollection of his childhood and youth. His spoken-word delivery is marvellous, often slightly behind the beat. You can tell this is a song that meant something special to him. It's there in the mood of the song, the careful and considered instrumentation and more than anything in the lyrics and their delivery.&quot; Mads Kj&aelig;r Larsen</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d69mDT11yI\">2. Sister Ray</a></h2> <p>&quot;It's almost as if Lou Reed defied the conventions of punk nearly a decade before it even began. The pounding, uncompromising riff the fulcrum for almost twenty minutes around a cacophony of demented organ, Maureen Tucker's relentless rhythm, and the bizarre and rather shocking lyrics. White Light/White Heat is the epitome of New York misanthropy set to wild, courageous sounds and Sister Ray is the jewel of the crown.&quot; Perry Hewitt</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkG9BKgDvNI\">3. Street Hassle</a></h2> <p>&quot;The cello ... a plaintive human voice caught in an endless loop of pain. And the song is daring beyond anything I'd ever heard. A window into a dark heart.&quot; Emily</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KaWSOlASWc\">4. Walk on the Wild Side</a></h2> <p>&quot;It was like a subliminal message as a gay male in my early teens … The lyrics suggested there was a language of diversity and rawness, lived out there in the world by real people.&quot; Bernie Harrison</p> <p>&quot;Original, hypnotic, ground-breaking and eye opening.&quot; Katy Rose</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2EgYq_NCY\">5. Satellite of Love</a></h2> <p>&quot;Lou's rich vocals coupled with Bowies ethereal chorus. The camp bit in the middle. Evocative memories of my misspent youth.&quot; Colin E</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffr0opfm6I4\">6. Heroin</a></h2> <p>&quot;The title; the lyrical imagery; the vocal delivery, at once mournful, knowing, amused; the juxtaposition of light and dark, musically and lyrically; the confession and the euphoria; the tempo changes; the quiet/loud dynamic; the fact that so much is wrung out of only TWO chords. He's writen many great, perhaps better, songs, but this is quintessential Reed.&quot; Anon</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcDuR9BF0Oc\">7. Pale Blue Eyes</a></h2> <p>&quot;A beautiful song which captures Lou Reed's ability to bring melancholy and ever present menace wrapped up in a deceptively soft delivery. Like a love song, that's about to punch you.&quot; Phil</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkumhBVPGdg\">8. Sweet Jane</a></h2> <p>&quot;One of the greatest riffs ever and some of Lou's best lyrics including an opening to match Jumpin' Jack Flash: 'Standing on the corner / suitcase in my hand / Jack's in his coat and Jane is in her vest / me? I'm in a rock 'n' roll band.' I think there's better stuff on the Velvet's first two albums but they don't really count since Cale's influence was huge. This song, for me, is quintessential Lou Reed, and is up there with the very best rock 'n' roll songs ever recorded.&quot; daldai</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwzaifhSw2c\">9. Venus in Furs</a></h2> <p>&quot;The S&amp;M subject matter, Cale's wailing violin and Reed's plaintive narration/singing make it so unlike anything that had come before.&quot; Alex McGillivray</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qK82JvRY5s\">10. Sunday Morning</a></h2> <p>&quot;For me it was the perfect song to encapsulate that morning after period during the second summer of love. Despite the feeling we had come up to the precipice of pure joy and love the night before, now, in the dawn's grey early light, came the restlessness and the feeling that it meant nothing at all – and now we are falling. But oh so sweetly. The song is that musical embodiment of bittersweet chemical comedown when you still feel divine but your heart skips a beat and you don't always quite catch your breath.&quot; Mikey Modface</p> <h2>More</h2> <p>There are a few more tracks to discover on this <a href=\"https://play.spotify.com/user/sjrichards99/playlist/59nnPd72LCwB8q16Hooir0\">Lou Reed Spotify playlist</a>, put together by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/oct/26/theguide\">The Guide's</a> music experts:</p> <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://play.spotify.com/user/sjrichards99/playlist/59nnPd72LCwB8q16Hooir0\" data-alt=\"Lou Reed Spotify playlist\"> <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:sjrichards99:playlist:59nnPd72LCwB8q16Hooir0\" width=\"460\" height=\"540\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/28/lou-reed-career-being-contrary\">Lou Reed: A career of being contrary: </a>The streetwise, tough image was matched by songs of real tenderness and touching fragility.

        "headline":"I met Lou Reed – and he was charm personified",
        "body":"<p>In August this year, just two months before his death, I was invited to interview Lou Reed (full disclosure: it was a joint interview with <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/13364-lou-reed-mick-rock-interview\" title=\"\">the Quietus</a>). It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up, but one I was also wary of accepting: after all, Lou didn't <a href=\"http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/lou-reed-made-me-fall-to-pieces-twice\" title=\"\">always get on too well with us journalists</a>.</p><p>Lou was being interviewed with his longtime friend and collaborator, the <a href=\"http://www.mickrock.com/\" title=\"\">photographer Mick Rock</a>. A book, called <a href=\"http://www.genesis-publications.com/transformer-by-lou-reed-and-mick-rock/default.htm\" title=\"\">Transformer</a> after Reed's 1972 album, had been published of Mick's photos, charting Lou's transformation from underground pin-up to cult icon between 1972 and 1980. I was, understandably, quite nervous. I fully expected to turn into my stammering, scarlet-faced teenage self, as I was a huge fan. I first bought Transformer on cassette at the age of 12 because I liked the cover, and I have now been listening to Lou's music for 20 years. He became a huge influence on my life, from how I dressed and the colour(s) of my hair to – at least to some degree – the course of my career.</p><p>Our turn to speak to Lou came at the end of a long press day, when subjects have invariably been weathered by answering the same questions over and over. After an anxious four-hour wait, Lou appeared with his wife, <a href=\"http://www.laurieanderson.com/home.shtml\" title=\"\">Laurie Anderson</a>. \"The thing I like about Lou,\" his manager had told me during the wait, \"is that he could have had any girl he wanted, but he loves Laurie so much.\" Gazing through the glass partition, I could see them talking sweetly  between the interviews. \"Don't mention David Bowie's album,\" his publicist warned, half-jokingly, as the interviewer before me left. \"The last guy who did that got the wrong side of Lou.\"</p><p>People always say you shouldn't meet your idols, that you'll only be disappointed. But when I walked in the room a peal of laughter greeted me. \"Finally!\" he leaned back. \"What I've been waiting for – a woman!\"</p><p>He was looked delicate. Quite startlingly so: traces of his liver transplant were easy to spot, and a huge bandage covering his belly was revealed when he used the edge of his shirt to clean his glasses. Still, his eyes – glassy and bright – danced around the room and softened as they fell onto <a href=\"http://eil.com/images/main/Blondie+-+Debbie+Harry+Wearing+Andy+Warhol%E2%80%99s+Bad+T-shirt+-+POSTER-336417.jpg\" title=\"\">my (lucky) T-shirt</a>  (which I wore especially) and his face, although creased like a well-loved toy, was still very handsome. He was sparkly, witty and happy to talk about the past. It was almost unnerving. \"I was a product of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Factory\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol's Factory</a>,\" he said. \"All I did was sit there and observe these incredibly talented and creative people who were continually making art, and it was impossible not to be affected by that.\" On Andy, he said, \"he was somebody who created himself. You know, there he was as a balding commercial artist who took himself off to God knows where and reinvented himself as this guy in a leather jacket and a wig.\"</p><p>We talked a while about the wig. \"I asked him about it because I thought it made him look older,\" he said, smiling, \"and Andy said: 'well that's fine because when I do get older it'll be perfect.'\" A bit like Robert Johnson's story, he was asked [see footnote]. \"I wish I could tell you it was like that for me. You know, that I heard a voice at midnight say, 'Lou … Lou … this is what you'll be doing for the rest of your life'\".</p><p>Lou was obviously thrilled to be with Mick, the pair riffing off each other and going over Mick's documentation of the past, particularly some of the clothes he wore back then. \"It was Angie Bowie who gave me the studded jacket and those velvet pants, but really it was just a more glamorous version of what I was wearing.\"</p><p>\"It's funny,\" he added, \"I see women doing now what I was doing then, like painting patterns on their fingernails, and it makes me laugh.\" And then, somehow, we got onto tattoos. \"Back then one person would, say, get a tattoo on their dick and everyone would say 'how's your dick doing?' Now everyone's got their dick tattooed.\"</p><p>It wasn't all light. As we talked about modern art, he seemed bored. Or, more to the point, keen to express his boredom. \"[Back then] it was punk rock the way it should be: adventurous. It was about being creative, offering something different. The problem is that no one is really making great art any more.\" So what was his main thrust in the beginning, his driving force? \"I was trying to smash through things. Music should come crashing out of your speakers and grab you, and the lyrics should challenge whatever preconceived notions that listener has.\" And how does that compare to now? \"We are living in a compressed age where people are perfectly happy to listen to the worst kind of recorded shit imaginable. And who buys albums anymore? People are too busy downloading singles or just single tracks and that isn't very healthy. I see people watching movies on their phones or iPads, and don't they realise that they're missing so much?\"</p><p>As I left the dark womb of the recording studio, I took stock of what had just happened. I'd met my punk rock hero, and he wasn't an arsehole. Just a really sweet, funny old man. Maybe he couldn't be bothered to be an arsehole anymore – and that's quite punk in itself, isn't it?</p><p>• The following footnote was added to this article on 31 October 2013: Julian Marszalek from The Quietus would like us to clarify that he posed several of the questions asked during the interview described above, at which both he and Hanna Hanra were present. These include the ones about Robert Johnson, Lou Reed's driving force at the onset of his career and how that compares to now. </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421217171|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|bd301eea5dce7828e2851cb50fcc5ff6639ad4ef -->",

        "body":"<p>We had communicated about a month ago when we were going to come by New York to play the Apollo, and Lou was going to come to the show and hang out. He didn't make it because his health took a turn for the worse, so I knew things were not good, but I didn't know it was that serious. So I was half shocked and half crushed – shocked that he went so quickly and crushed over the loss.</p><p>Most people in the rock'n'roll world know about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/28/neil-gaiman-lou-reed-sandman\" title=\"\">Lou Reed and his reputation</a>. I had met him briefly, socially, about a decade ago, where he was very cordial. Four years ago, when we were doing the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame concerts, we had invited Lou to come play with us because we were one of the hosts for one of the segments. We were aware of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/28/lou-reed-career-being-contrary\" title=\"\">reputation for being unfiltered and upfront</a>, and that he just says what he's thinking; he can be a bit standoffish, we were told. We were in a rehearsal room in midtown Manhattan – he walked in and was quite standoffish, quite short, quite like you would expect him. We started setting up, and waltzing around a few musical things, and he was complaining about how loud we were and that we were playing everything wrong. Every single thing we were doing was wrong. It wasn't limited to our entire approach to music, our existence was wrong. From the day we were born, our existence was wrong. Obviously I'm exaggerating for effect here …</p><p>But within an hour or so, me and him had a little chat, and I think I comforted him in the fact that nothing bad was going to happen. It dawned on me when I was talking to someone else about Lou, that a lot of people from his generation, they've just been so mistreated over the years by people who have taken advantage of them, both inside and outside the business – a lot of people his age are guarded. So when a bunch of musicians in their 40s welcome him with open arms and invite him to come in and jam, he's just suspicious that something's going to happen. I understand that and I'm not faulting him for that.</p><p>Things did thaw, me and him had a pow-wow in a corner, and it went very fast and became pretty cool. We realised we had so much in common. There was this trust. But he was a very guarded, mistrusting person, and spending the subsequent couple of years with him and being around everything from interviews to playing gigs I could just see that whenever there were new people who came on his radar that he would have to size them up first before he let himself be opened up. I've met half a dozen other artists from his generation, and if you talk to them for long enough they'll tell you stories about getting fucked over, by the man, the system, the business, bad deals, each other, whatever.</p><p>We were both outsiders, we both never felt comfortable going down the same path that everyone else was doing. Metallica's always been autonomous, and Lou Reed is the godfather of being an outsider, being autonomous, marching to his own drum, making every project different from the previous one and never feeling like he had a responsibility to anybody other than himself. We shared kinship over that. And we brought him something that he didn't have, or maybe hadn't experienced so much, which in his own words were 'energy' and \"weight\" and \"size\" and whatever it is that happens when we start playing. He was so into what we brought him. And, of course, he brought us this incredible piece of work that he had already written, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/27/lou-reed-metallica-lulu-review\" title=\"\">Lulu</a>, and about her escapades and sexual endeavours. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJlU_9Vyvqs\" title=\"\">We brought something to each other</a>, and we shared a common lack of ability to fit in with our surroundings.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fJlU_9Vyvqs\" title=\"\">Reading on mobile? Click to view</a></p><p>Jann Wenner threw a celebration of the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame, and U2 and Springsteen were there hosting little segments, and they asked us to host a segment, so we asked him to play with us. And that worked out very well, and I think he felt so comfortable with us. As we were leaving Madison Square Garden, he looked at me as we walked out into the car park in the bowels of Madison Square Garden and we ended up making the record a year-and-a-half after Madison Square Garden. But the Lulu escapades and everything that became our record was stuff he's had swirling in his mind for probably decades: the story of this character and the relationship with all the different men in her life.</p><p>I played the record for my kids yesterday in the car, and it sounded as relevant and more intense than ever; it sounded incredibly potent, very alive and impulsive. He brought this incredible lyrical story. I'm not so into who's \"best\" or \"No 1\", but he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/oct/27/lou-reed-six-of-his-greatest-songs\" title=\"\">the most accomplished poet within the world of rock'n'roll</a> over the last four decades. He brought this story he had spent a lot of time with, but on the counter side of that he brought an incredibly impulsive energy into the studio where he asked us to come up with stuff on the spot.</p><p>Nothing was thought about, nothing was laboured over, nothing was dissected or analysed. We just started playing, Lou started half-reciting, half-singing these beautiful poems, and off we went and this record came out. It taught me a different approach in the studio, of just doing it rather than thinking about it. We did the whole record in three weeks; three weeks in on a normal Metallica record we haven't even decided what corner of the studio we're going to set the drums in. The whole thing was very impulsive, and there wasn't a lot of analytical thought that went into it.</p><p>The hard rock community, they can be pretty harsh, so I'm pretty thick-skinned. And so when the hard rock community turned its back on the record I wasn't surprised. A lot of people were saying, \"oh, Lou Reed doesn't sing\". Yeah, no shit. What do you think he's been doing for the last 40 years? Did you expect him to sound like Robert Plant? That's not what he does. In the hard rock community I was not particularly surprised. But I was surprised that some more intellectual writers were pretty harsh to it.</p><p>But two years later, a lot of people have come around. Howard Stern did a whole episode about how wrong he was about Lulu, and how Junior Dad is his favourite song of last year even though it came out two years ago. Twenty-five years from now, you're going to have millions of people claiming they owned the record or loved it when it came out, of course neither will be true. I think it's going to age well – when I played it yesterday it sounded fucking awesome. In some ways it's almost cooler that people didn't embrace it, because it makes it more ours, it's our project, our record, and this was never made for the masses and the masses didn't take to it. It makes it more precious for those who were involved.</p><p>I'll always remember his fragility. I felt in some way that I connected to his fragility, and identified with it. He was very open, he would say, \"Lars, I love you\", and text me a heart. It was so beautiful. The way he was so unfiltered is what I will remember most, and his fragility, and how I've never met anybody who, no matter what he was saying, he was always speaking his truth. It never felt cerebral, it always felt like it came from some other place somewhere. When people talk, it comes from their brain; I don't know where his words came from, but they came from somewhere else. Emotional, physical, everything – it really resonated with me. I wanted to give him strength, and I think Metallica gave him strength. His being was so beautiful once that guard went away, and it was childlike.</p><p>• Lars Ulrich was speaking to Ben Beaumont-Thomas</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421273370|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|831165fd9f9c47de840904a9ff789e2007afe240 -->",

If this doesn't get me in Pseuds Corner, nothing will. Indeed, other female performers have garnered more complaints, so if Gaga is working overtime to shock us, it just isn't happening. We are familiar with the panto of The X Factor and with Gaga's turns. We expect her to look bonkers, cram in a ADHD medley and probably get naked. The soundtrack/product that comes with it is pedestrian, but her USP is that she doesn't have to&nbsp;look pretty all the time.</p><p>Of course her hint of freakshow fits in perfectly with a good old-fashioned variety show. It's all very postmodern, for although she may reference Andy Warhol as easily as she references <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/27/miley-cyrus-twerking-cultural-appropriation\" title=\"\">Miley Cyrus's flesh-coloured bikini</a>, she can be incorporated into primetime TV. Gaga is deemed suitable for \"a family show\". The promise of subversion is brought into the arena of light entertainment and demands little more than that we applaud the&nbsp;spectacle.</p><p>To demand a bit more from the audience, that they work it out, even stay with it, is not where it's at. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/28/neil-gaiman-lou-reed-sandman\" title=\"\">When Lou Reed died</a>, I watched some Warhol movies on YouTube and one wishes Warhol were still alive to see the comments. The YouTube generation are baffled by Warhol. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eChaxl-9pvg\" title=\"\">A film of the artist eating a hamburger</a> is exactly that. \"WTF? Is this it?\" they demand, short-changed. \"Is that all there is?\" Sometimes.</p><p>Reed's death has hit my generation because his presence anchored us into a time and a place when the avant garde was still meaningful. He was a touchstone of what it means to be modern, a significant and uncompromising artist whose works challenge social and artistic values. The Velvet Underground could have been formed at any time since 1966. They still sound utterly new. His death made us remember the music that made us want to leave our small towns and our small lives, a time when transgression was not simply a marketing technique.</p><p>The insane focus on whether he was nice or not seems misplaced, an attempt to jerk him back into the comfort zone. His music took us to dark places and we wanted to go. \"Here is a song about taking heroin that is just like taking heroin,\" we wisely told each other on the bus in our school uniforms. \"Here is a song about changing sex,\" we nodded wisely. He was not our mirror at all, but rather our compass. Now we have lost our bearings.</p><p>He did not need to explain himself in interviews, the work is there, already divided into the listenable/hits and the unlistenable/difficult. But here was a man whose cultural value far exceeded his commercial value.</p><p>There is not much of this any more. Marketing is now part of what artists do. They \"play\" with the market; their lifestyles and rebellions key into the corporate world. Art about art, art about money and value is now familiar. It was easy enough to walk around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/02/damien-hirst-tate-review\" title=\"\">Damien Hirst's big retrospective</a> and see precisely the point at which the money becomes both subject and object.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00729d9\" title=\"\">Grayson Perry's Reith Lectures</a> have been poking at this can of worms, with Perry himself the most slippery of worms, wriggling between the roles of establishment insider and snarky outsider. He says we are at the end point, where the avant garde no longer exists. Rather, he evokes a horizontal, flattened-out globalised art world. Here sincerity is but one tactic, shock another. Innovation is more likely to come from technology than anything that artists are doing. Artists, he explains, operate as the shock troops of gentrification, moving into an area and clearing a path for developers. The web, he argues, echoes Joseph Beuys' famous statement: \"Everyone can be an artist.\" Perry's view of art history is not one \"ism\" replacing another. Rather, we are living with all of this in the present. It is almost as if postmodernism has finished off the avant garde completely.</p><p>The jolt of Reed's death is to do with this. Lou Reed was avant garde precisely because he came out of modernism, because he changes for ever how things look and how they sound. A lodestar. His loss resonates because we can vaguely recall a time when not everything had been subsumed by the market.</p><p>So we are remembering his songs as if we heard them for the first time. Actually it's fitting. No one who ever heard the Velvet Underground could unhear them.</p><p>Watching Gaga writhe on the neuro-disco is a daft parody of Walk on the Wild Side. Amusement. Art does not have to be about transgression, it can be about anything – of course, it can. But look at us mourn the time when it felt that way; this loss is immense. As Robert Hughes said in the 80s in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jun/30/art1\" title=\"\">The Shock of the New</a>: \"What does one prefer? An art that struggles to change the social contract but fails? Or one that seeks to please and amuse and succeeds?\"</p><p>You can answer that by pressing the red button on any remote.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421297945|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a2cfbaafb8ca3c4c038cbf064b60ef0576f00e33 -->",

        "body":"<h2>Snapshot<strong>:</strong> The last of the family sea dogs<br /></h2><p>Sifting through an envelope labelled family, I found this photo. I was immediately struck by the man on the left – he reminded me of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntzxbf_NhUM\" title=\"\">Captain Birdseye in the old TV adverts</a>. On the back, my father has written, <em>Ayr circa 1918/1920? Frederick (?) Timbury at 90+, Henry Thomas Timbury</em>.</p><p>Henry was my great-grandpa and I have a vague recollection that Frederick was my great-great-grandpa. Looking at this photo, though, brings back many happy memories of my own Grandpa Timbury of whom I was particularly fond; Montague Charles Timbury, known as Mont, son of Henry.</p><p>I still smile to myself remembering, as a wee girl, how I thought it was very clever to call Grandpa \"Polo Mont\" and giggled and squealed with delight as he laughed along with me. My father, Gerald, told me that Grandpa's love of making model ships was a result of his disappointment at not being accepted for the Royal Navy, like most of his predecessors, because of his childhood asthma or \"weak chest\". The model ships became his way of maintaining a connection with the navy. A man who was very neat, tidy and hyper-organised (rather like me!), making models – including a replica of the Cutty Sark in a bottle – played to his strengths of exactitude and attention to detail.</p><p>Starting out as a boy apprentice in the Glasgow optical engineering firm Barr and Stroud, Grandpa eventually became managing director. One of the greatest prides of his career was that one of his radar designs was stationed in Singapore in the second world war to detect enemy ships for the Royal Navy. My own father broke with the nautical tradition and became a consultant psychiatrist, but he too loved boats. Together we went fishing and sailing while he, upholding Timbury tradition, puffed on his pipe.</p><p>Along with the naval heritage, there is a long history of only children through the Timbury generations, and I feel sad that, having no other Timbury relatives nor children of my own, this family of seamen will end after my passing. How special, therefore, to have this old photograph and mark its significance with this story.</p><p><em>Judy McCulloch</em></p><h2>Playlist<strong>:</strong> Dad doing the funny voices</h2><p><strong>New York Telephone Conversation by Lou Reed </strong></p><p><em>\"I was sleeping, gently napping / when I heard the phone / Who is on the other end talking / am I even home\"</em></p><p>My mother's side of the family is the creative half. The eldest sister is (still) a hippie, the second was so deeply immersed in Berlin's art scene in the 70s and 80s that she told me to call David Bowie \"uncle\" – they had an affair – the third is a singer and musician and my mother is a theatre and TV actress. My father is a professor of immunology.</p><p>But it was he who introduced me to the records that first shaped me. I was five when my parents separated, after which my father moved into flatshares with a handful of other twenty and thirtysomethings. It was incredibly fun – I was allowed to ride a bicycle in the hallway. Play Sim City on his boxy Macintosh. Hang self-made anti-George Bush Sr posters in the hallway.</p><p>I also got to run my fingers through his record collection. If I washed and dried my hands first and was supervised, that is. Lou Reed's Transformer and the Beatles' White Album both got me, immediately. Nothing made me giggle as much as my father replying to my early morning requests with a rendition of I'm So Tired.</p><p>The lyrics of Transformer were too mature for me, but I learned that Holly went from a he to a she and someone was bold with Harry, Mark and John.</p><p>New York Telephone Conversation was the track my dad found particularly funny. He'd sing it to me – he doesn't sing often – in a nursery-rhyme manner. It was funny because he would act out the voices (\"Did you see what she did to him / did you hear what they said?\") and it was poignant because I only saw him every second weekend (\"I am calling, yes I am calling just to speak to you / For I know this night will kill me if I can't be with you\").</p><p><em>Johanna Kamradt</em></p><h2>We love to eat<strong>:</strong> Auntie's Yorkshire parkin</h2><p><strong>Ingredients </strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421372326'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/25/1382711308801/Yorkshire-parkins-001.jpg' alt='Yorkshire parkins' width='230' height='230' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Auntie Kath's Yorkshire parkin.</figcaption></figure><p><em>2 cups medium oatmeal </em><br /><em>1 ½ cups plain flour </em><br /><em>¾ cup sugar </em><br /><em>1 tsp ground ginger</em><br /><em>1 tsp baking powder</em><br /><em>6oz (170g) margarine </em><br /><em>12oz (340g) golden syrup</em><br /><em>2 eggs, plus a drop of milk</em></p><p>Mix the dry ingredients in a big mixing bowl. Spoon the syrup into a small pan. (Be generous: the stickier the parkin, the better.) Add the margarine, heat until melted, then pour on to the dry ingredients, along with the beaten eggs and milk. Combine to a sloppy mixture, turn into a greased and lined 9in square tin and bake at gas mark 3/160C for 1-1¼ hours. Time to lick the spoon! The parkin is ready when the top is firm to the touch and a glorious golden brown – see my photograph.</p><p>Every bonfire night, when I was a child, we used to fatten ourselves up with layers of clothes, pull on our wellies and stomp to the end of the cul-de-sac where our friends lived. They had a sprawling back garden on two tiers and with a steep bank down to the main road below; this was where the big bonfire used to burn.</p><p>We'd gather on the top tier for the fireworks display, watching catherine wheels spitting and fizzling out on the tree trunks, sparklers dancing in our hands. Then it was time for the food: the crisped, blackened shells of jacket potatoes full of fallen fluff and melting butter; the brittle, dark bonfire toffee and my mum's sticky, grainy parkin.</p><p>This was Auntie Kath's recipe – my children love it and we don't wait for bonfire night to bake it!</p><p><em>Lisa Fisher</em></p><h2>We'd love to hear your stories<br /></h2><p>We will pay £25 for every Letter to, Playlist, Snapshot or We love to eat we publish.

        "headline":"Transformer: Lou Reed's death prompts sales surge",
        "body":"<p>\"At the record company meeting, on their hands – at last! – a dead star.\" Morrissey's lyrics in the Smiths' <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uxP8h0SZRw\" title=\"\">Paint a Vulgar Picture</a> are always brought to mind in the aftermath of a singer dying –  not to mention the apocryphal tale of a nameless music executive who, on hearing of Elvis's passing in 1977, proclaimed it a \"good career move\" with chilling curtness.</p><p></p><p>The death of Lou Reed on Sunday may not be triggering <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/retail/1177325/michael-jackson-two-years-since-his-death-how-much-has-he-sold\" title=\"\">Michael Jackson-style figures</a>, but the late singer <em>is</em> experiencing what chart analysts term a \"significant uptick\" in sales. This would surely have been met with an arched eyebrow by the wonderfully obstinate artist, who was more comfortable in the margins. He only scored two solo hits in the UK during his life – <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkwD261MHsc\" title=\"\">Walk on the Wild Side</a> reached No 10 in 1973 and a reissue of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2EgYq_NCY\" title=\"\">Satellite of Love</a> peaked at the same position in 2004 – although the all-star cover of <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Perfect Day</a> for Children in Need rocketed to No 1 in 1997. And while the Velvet Underground might not have sold many copies of their 1967 debut album on its release (anything between 1,000 and 30,000 are cited), \"everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band\" – as Brian Eno stated in a famous 1982 interview.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Despite Reed's relatively cult status, the music marketing and retail machine has inevitably creaked into gear. Apple's iTunes Store has a \"Remembering Lou Reed\" promotional link on its homepage, which cynics will read as avaricious, even while pragmatists see it as the world's biggest music store simply catering to consumer demand. The demand is clearly there for Lou Reed's music – just not on a multi-platinum level.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.officialcharts.com\" title=\"\">Official Charts Company</a> reports that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYEC4TZsy-Y\" title=\"\">Perfect Day</a> has sold 4,700 copies so far this week in the UK (as of Thursday morning) and Walk on the Wild Side has sold 4,000, which means they are both on course to enter the top 40 in Sunday's chart. The next biggest seller is 1973's original <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2EgYq_NCY\" title=\"\">Satellite of Love</a> (700 copies), but these sales put it outside the top 100. Reed's 1972 breakthrough album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/22/transformer-lou-reed\" title=\"\">Transformer</a>, sold fewer than 100 copies last week but has sold around 2,500 copies this week so far, with roughly 80% of sales being digital. It was at No 24 in the album charts on Wednesday but had slipped to 26 this morning. \"The immediate surge of interest has dissipated slightly,\" says Martin Talbot, MD of the Official Charts Company. \"But if it makes top 30 [by the end of the week], that's still quite an achievement in itself.\" Interestingly, there are no Velvet Underground tracks at all in the top 200, so the sales emphasis is almost entirely on Reed's solo work.</p><p></p><p>On Spotify, streams of his music (solo and with the Velvet Underground) were reported by <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/\" title=\"\">Business Insider</a> to have jumped 3,000% following news of his death, and overall it is Transformer that is becoming the default destination for streamers (nine of the 10 most played Lou Reed songs on the service come from it – albeit with Walk on the Wild Side counting twice due to a compilation album inclusion). Tracks from Transformer are equally dominating iTunes downloads and it's the same for online video views, with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYEC4TZsy-Y\" title=\"\">Perfect Day</a> (22.4m plays to date), Walk on the Wild Side (6m plays) and Satellite of Love (2.8m plays) proving the most popular songs on YouTube.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the social and online media data tracked by analytics company <a href=\"http://www.musicmetric.com\" title=\"\">Musicmetric</a>, Reed jumped from adding around 1,500 Facebook fans a day this year to adding 37,864 on Monday alone. (Although what newcomers expect from his Facebook page is not clear.)</p><p></p><p>It is crass to reduce Reed's astonishing influence and art to downloads, streams, views and social media \"engagement\" – but they do tell us part of the story of what his posthumous legacy will be. Even those who feel most protective towards his position and his outsider status surely don't wish to deny a whole new audience the opportunity to go down the rabbit hole of his music. Many will naturally stop at the \"greatest hits\" (as the iTunes, Spotify and iTunes figures suggest), but others will burrow deeper and discover for the first time Berlin, White Light/White Heat, Songs for Drella and The Blue Mask – and maybe even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Machine_Music\" title=\"\">Metal Machine Music</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421397545|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|b9a03dac2fa341325e01fc02e5f48e4259933d99 -->",

Funeral plans have not been announced.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To our neighbors:</p> <p>What a beautiful fall! Everything shimmering and golden and all that incredible soft light. Water surrounding us.</p> <p>Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the past few years, and even though we’re city people this is our spiritual home.</p> <p>Last week I promised Lou to get him out of the hospital and come home to Springs. And we made it!</p> <p>Lou was a tai chi master and spent his last days here being happy and dazzled by the beauty and power and softness of nature. He died on Sunday morning looking at the trees and doing the famous 21 form of tai chi with just his musician hands moving through the air.</p> <p>Lou was a prince and a fighter and I know his songs of the pain and beauty in the world will fill many people with the incredible joy he felt for life. Long live the beauty that comes down and through and onto all of us.</p> <p>— Laurie Anderson</p> <p>his loving wife and eternal friend</p> </blockquote> <p>John Cale, Reed's longtime friend and a founding member of the Velvet Underground, said on Sunday: &quot;The world has lost a fine songwriter and poet … I've lost my school-yard buddy.&quot;</p> <p>Tributes to the Velvet Underground co-founder poured in following his death, with musicians including Neil Young, Elvis Costello and Arctic Monkeys performing his songs at concerts this week.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFaTN9V833o\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IFaTN9V833o?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421415653|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|eff400dfb353596e7b3ddbe0ff8c34bd735db6e7 -->",
