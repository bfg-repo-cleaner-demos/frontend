        "body":"<p>David Cameron has accused Facebook of being irresponsible following its decision to allow a video of a beheading to remain on its website.</p><p>The prime minister's criticism was echoed by a hostage charity, which warned of the \"acute distress\" such images would cause to the families of victims.</p><p>After complaints were first made about the video depicting a killing in Mexico, Facebook added captions to the front of videos warning that they contained extremely graphic content and that they \"may be upsetting\".</p><p>The website owners resisted suggestions the video should be taken down.</p><p>The inaction was condemned by Cameron, and Hostage UK, a charity representing the families of people who have been kidnapped and killed.</p><p>A Hostage UK statement said: \"The public are well aware of the brutalities committed, and a public showing â€¦ adds nothing other than to cause further unimaginable suffering.\"</p><p>Cameron said Facebook should explain its decision to \"worried parents\". Facebook allows people to use the site from the age of 13, although many 11-year-olds join when they go to secondary school.</p><p>The shadow crime and security minister, Diana Johnson, also condemned the inaction, saying: \"It is entirely unacceptable for Facebook to be hosting these disgraceful videos. Not only do they glorify violence, but they will be horrifying to people who accidentally view them. It is especially worrying to see Facebook allowing this content, given the huge number of children who are regular users. They should remove it now.\"</p><p>Facebook introduced a temporary ban on such videos in May but has since decided to remove the block on grounds that the site is used to share information about world events.</p><p>Hostage UK said Facebook's ban reversal was wrong. \"Many of us at Hostage UK have worked with the families and friends of hostages who have been tortured and beheaded, with the execution having been recorded on video and made widely available. We know firsthand the acute distress these videos and images cause.\"</p><p>The charity said that it strongly urged Facebook to reconsider its decision to show the video.</p><p>Facebook has said the public should be free to view beheading videos then condemn the content; it would take a different approach if the actions in the footage were \"encouraged or celebrated\".</p><p>Sources close to Facebook have indicated that the company is keeping its policies under close review amid the furore over the posting of the video.</p><p>Meanwhile other Facebook rules, under the listing of \"nudity and pornography\", ban displays of topless photos on its site.</p><p>Stephen Balkam, a member of the Facebook safety advisory board, urged the company to rethink its policy change. He told Sky News: \"They have some very strict rules about nudity, about sex and even about violence, too. I just think in this case they really need to rethink how they use and adopt their own policies.\"</p><p>However, the pressure group Index On Censorship said: \"The decision to show beheadings is part of a much wider debate on whether companies like Facebook should moderate the content they host. With over a billion users worldwide, Facebook's decisions about what can and can't be shown have a huge impact on global freedom of expression.\" A spokeswoman said: \"Some of these videos are produced in a reporting context.\"</p><p>Padraig Reidy, a senior writer at Index On Censorship, commented: \"One can see a certain logic behind not allowing pictures of bare breasts; Facebook doesn't want its platform to be given over to soft and hard porn.\"</p><p>While it does have a \"like\" button, to indicate approval, Facebook does not have a clear way for users to indicate dislike of content so it would be difficult to know how the company could measure the basis on which people viewed a video.</p><p>A spokesperson for Facebook told the Guardian: \"We look at what [people] say in the comments with a clear expectation they must be condemnatory. There are a lot of videos being removed where the comments aren't [condemnatory].\"</p><p>John Baptista, associate professor of information systems at Warwick Business School, said: \"It is impossible to create rules for everything on the web, so I mostly believe in self regulation based on common sense and guiding principles.</p><p>\"This relies on companies like Facebook being sensible and responsible, however in this case sadly I think Facebook is late in responding to feedback and it is very disappointing to see them not being proactive in addressing a serious issue such as this. I hope they do take the feedback seriously and respond positively.\"</p><p>A Facebook spokeswoman said: \"Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420624222|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|c1473736de271722ea21048c975102b946e478d5 -->",

        "headline":"Cruelty and the crowd: beheading videos on Facebook",
        "body":"<p>\"I feel myself ashamed and degraded at the brutal curiosity which took me to that brutal sight,\" wrote Thackeray after witnessing what must have been 1840's most literary hanging. The poet Richard Monckton Milnes also took his place in the thronging crowd, as did Dickens, who subsequently agitated for the abolition of public executions.</p><p>What an irony that modern communications should have put primeval displays of bloodlust back in front of a mass audience which, in places like Britain, they haven't had in 150 years. This week it is the criminal, misogynist beheading of a woman in Mexico that was doing the rounds on Facebook, and provoking a disapproving prime ministerial intervention (or more precisely a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/392573625750265857\" title=\"\">prime ministerial tweet</a>). But since the turn of the millennium, other similarly savage spectacles have been widely shared on the web. There was the videoed decapitation of British hostage <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/oct/09/iraq.world1\" title=\"\">Ken Bigley</a> in Iraq, and a little later mobile phone footage of the judicial slaughter of Saddam Hussein.</p><p>Libertarian voices were <a href=\"http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/10/facebook-video-policy-attempts-draw-line-free-speech/\" title=\"\">yesterday raised</a> to say that \"if one wants to discuss brutality, one must be able to see it\". There is something in that, and the Guardian has sometimes featured grotesque images of grotesque acts â€“ including the deaths of Saddam and, more recently, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/22/libya-gaddafi-dead-body-treatment\" title=\"\">Colonel Gaddafi</a>. But there is, perhaps, some distinction between restricting graphic images and censoring the free flow of facts and reportage. Eminent Victorians like Dickens who wished to take hangings away from public view were concerned about the \"odious levity\" with which a crowd would gawp at a man being put to death. They had concerns about the dignity of the deceased, and the brutalising effect on the sensibilities of the viewer. Both worries apply with the Mexican murder video. So, too, does the need to respect the dead woman's family, the danger of winning the killers the notoriety they crave, and the psychological scars of youngsters that&nbsp;parents cannot heal with the usual horror-film balm â€“ \"it's only a movie\".</p><p>An individual wishing to share such material â€“ perhaps out of an urge to expose wicked misdeeds â€“ ought to pause. If self-interrogation suggests that the real motivation is more an urge to share gory fascination than anything else, then to paste the offending link is to start slipping back into the mindset of public hangings. Faced with such footage, newspapers apply (or ought to apply) a \"public interest test\", another way of describing the process of weighing its offensiveness against any good that its release may do. From years of making such judgments, an editorial culture develops which would make mainstream news organisations deeply reluctant to play host to a beheading. Facebook, however, is another matter â€“ for it is not a news organisation, but a company in the emerging field of communications engineering. It protests, with some justice, that it does not edit, but merely facilitates.</p><p>The company regards its role as that of the pub landlord â€“ to host the full range of human conversations, whether uplifting or ugly, booting out customers only where they are completely out of hand. They say there is not the capacity to edit the content of a billion users, and â€“ even if there were â€“ it would not be Facebook if this were done. Previous bans on bloody content were eased to allow witnesses to the Boston marathon bombing to share what they saw, and the consensus was that this worked to the good.</p><p>The firm's difficulty, however, is that the site does have its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards\" title=\"\">strictures</a>: it censors nudity vigorously. It cannot be right for it to maintain rules that regard nipples as more problematic viewing than real-life video nasties. The move to add a warning to the beheading footage may only redouble interest. Coming days after <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/10380631/Facebook-is-a-major-location-for-online-child-sexual-grooming-head-of-child-protection-agency-says.html\" title=\"\">a dubious decision</a> to enable child users' profiles to go on full public view, rather than being restricted to their social network, the intransigence over the Mexican footage smacks of a commercial desire not to lose out on customers inspired by \"brutal curiosity\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420687904|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|3212f40156eb034b852c1de19ab867b775dce62b -->",

        "body":"<p>Facebook is notorious for policing what people can and cannot post to its site. The latest controversy â€“ <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/22/facebook-irresponsible-beheadings-david-cameron\" title=\"\">an apparent change in policy to allow beheading videos to be shared</a> â€“ is just the most recent in a string of accusations that the site bans things it should allow while allowing things it should ban.</p><p></p><h2>Breastfeeding</h2><p>In 2012, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/21/facebook-nudity-violence-censorship-guidelines\" title=\"\">Facebook's image censorship guidelines were leaked</a>. They revealed that the site's moderators were told to ban images of breastfeeding if the nipples were exposed, while allowing \"graphic images\" of animals if shown \"in the context of food processing or hunting as it occurs in nature\".</p><p>At the same time \"deep flesh wounds\" and \"crushed heads/limbs\" were allowed, but pictures of human bodily fluids banned if a person is visible. And semen cannot be shown anywhere.</p><p>Mothers were not surprised to hear that Facebook banned images of breastfeeding, because the site had gained notoriety for marking such pictures as inappropriate. \"A mother who is told by Facebook that her breastfeeding photos have been removed because her nipples were showing is quite likely to be humiliated, upset and one step closer to giving up on breastfeeding,\" said Rowan Davies.</p><p>But recently, the site appears to have changed its tune. Its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards\" title=\"\">community standards</a> now say that it aspires \"to respect people's right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.\"</p><p></p><h2>Violence against women</h2><p>Even while Facebook was removing images of breastfeeding for explicit content, the site was being accused of moving far too slowly to remove pages which glorified violence against women.</p><p>A page of violent jokes about abuse of female marines, for example, <a href=\"http://www.themarysue.com/facebook-female-marine-violence/\" title=\"\">stayed up for three years</a>. Even when it was removed, it was because the administrators were using fake accounts, rather than for violating the site's rules against bullying or hate speech.</p><p>In May, the site came under more fire for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/facebook-locks-out-campaigner-women\" title=\"\">blocking the administrator</a> of an Australian feminist page after she posted a picture protesting the site's double standards. \"My problem is that when we report things like violence against women or sexism against women or misogyny against women, they just say it's totally fine,\" said Jenna Price, co-founder of the Destroy the Joint group.</p><p>The same month, the site relented in the face of calls from over a hundred advocacy groups, and updated its policies on hate speech. \"We need to do better â€“ and we will,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p></p><h2>Political protest</h2><p>Facebook's event tools are extremely useful for arranging political protests, but the site has been known to interfere in what users can promote. In 2011, the page for UK Uncut was deactivated, along with a number of other groups including Chesterfield Stop the Cuts, Tower Hamlet Greens, and the London Student Assembly.</p><p>A Facebook spokeswoman \"explained that the profiles were suspended because they had not been registered correctly and denied that the removal of pages was politically motivated\", reported Shiv Malik at the time.</p><p>In 2007, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/03/farrightpolitics.digitalmedia\" title=\"\">advertisers</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/02/digitalmedia.facebook\" title=\"\">including Vodafone</a> pulled their ads from the site in protest at its refusal to remove groups promoting the BNP.</p><p>Even then, Facebook's terms of service banned users from sharing content which was \"harmful, threatening, unlawful â€¦ inflammatory â€¦ hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable\", but the site dealt with material posted on the groups' pages in a piecemeal manner.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420647619|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|a96a73b126d1697ee884138e7664ac94ecea2c8f -->",

        "body":"<p>So now we know. In Facebook's world, a beheading is OK but an exposed nipple is not. The social media behemoth has decided that a 13-year-old â€“ for that is the permitted minimum age of a Facebook user â€“ can watch a video of a decapitation, but must be protected from the potentially scarring effects of seeing a breastfeeding mother and child briefly pause for breath.</p><p>How else to read its latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/22/facebook-allows-beheading-videos\" title=\"\">decision to lift restrictions in place since May and allow users once again to post head-chopping videos</a>, even as it maintains its <a href=\"http://en-gb.facebook.com/help/340974655932193\" title=\"\">ban on images of the most mild form of naturally occurring nudity</a>? (\"Photos that show a fully exposed breast where the child is not actively engaged in nursing do violate the Facebook terms\" is how the site puts it.)</p><p>The absurdity of that position shows just how confused even the masters of the online universe become when confronted with the perennial dilemmas of free expression. The simplest, most logically consistent position would be one of absolute free speech, in which Facebook would allow everything within the law. Beheading videos would take their place alongside porn in a great, unfettered free-for-all.</p><p>But that's not what Facebook does. It knows that if it did, it would lose vast chunks of its huge, global customer base: parents especially wouldn't let their kids go anywhere near it. So it imposes rules and \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards\" title=\"\">community standards</a>,\" meaning it allows some things and forbids others.</p><p>Once it's made that move, deciding that there are lines that should not be crossed, then Facebook is in the business of deciding where to draw those lines. In this case, it has got the decision spectacularly wrong.</p><p>The lunacy of allowing beheadings while banning nursing mothers would be bad enough. But Facebook has tied itself up in further knots of illogic by explaining that such snuff videos are OK if they are posted to \"condemn\" the killing rather than glorify it. But that distinction is not always so obvious. A bit of lip-service condemnation would not be hard to construct for someone whose motive was altogether less benign. Besides, isn't it possible to condemn a decapitation without actually showing it? When the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl was brutally murdered that way in 2002, news media around the world managed to denounce it without airing the video.</p><p>Which brings us to the nub of the matter. Facebook and the other social media giants are reluctant to be thought of as akin to news organisations or even publishers. They want to be seen as something looser and vaguer, a mere arena for others. There are good reasons for that: social media are indeed different.</p><p>But there is a less noble motive behind that reluctance too. Publishers are responsible for the content they publish and Facebook and the others don't want that level of responsibility: for one thing, maintaining standards requires people, which costs money.</p><p>But it's getting harder and harder to maintain the pretence that Facebook doesn't make editorial judgments, including ones that have serious consequences. It does â€“ and it's just made a very bad one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420614602|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|534303779e417e27bbfce07194334a7b380908d8 -->",

        "body":"<p>David Cameron has accused Facebook of being irresponsible following its decision to allow a video of a beheading to remain on its website.</p><p>The prime minister's criticism was echoed by a hostage charity, which warned of the \"acute distress\" such images would cause to the families of victims.</p><p>After complaints were first made about the video depicting a killing in Mexico, Facebook added captions to the front of videos warning that they contained extremely graphic content and that they \"may be upsetting\".</p><p>The website owners resisted suggestions the video should be taken down.</p><p>The inaction was condemned by Cameron, and Hostage UK, a charity representing the families of people who have been kidnapped and killed.</p><p>A Hostage UK statement said: \"The public are well aware of the brutalities committed, and a public showing â€¦ adds nothing other than to cause further unimaginable suffering.\"</p><p>Cameron said Facebook should explain its decision to \"worried parents\". Facebook allows people to use the site from the age of 13, although many 11-year-olds join when they go to secondary school.</p><p>The shadow crime and security minister, Diana Johnson, also condemned the inaction, saying: \"It is entirely unacceptable for Facebook to be hosting these disgraceful videos. Not only do they glorify violence, but they will be horrifying to people who accidentally view them. It is especially worrying to see Facebook allowing this content, given the huge number of children who are regular users. They should remove it now.\"</p><p>Facebook introduced a temporary ban on such videos in May but has since decided to remove the block on grounds that the site is used to share information about world events.</p><p>Hostage UK said Facebook's ban reversal was wrong. \"Many of us at Hostage UK have worked with the families and friends of hostages who have been tortured and beheaded, with the execution having been recorded on video and made widely available. We know firsthand the acute distress these videos and images cause.\"</p><p>The charity said that it strongly urged Facebook to reconsider its decision to show the video.</p><p>Facebook has said the public should be free to view beheading videos then condemn the content; it would take a different approach if the actions in the footage were \"encouraged or celebrated\".</p><p>Sources close to Facebook have indicated that the company is keeping its policies under close review amid the furore over the posting of the video.</p><p>Meanwhile other Facebook rules, under the listing of \"nudity and pornography\", ban displays of topless photos on its site.</p><p>Stephen Balkam, a member of the Facebook safety advisory board, urged the company to rethink its policy change. He told Sky News: \"They have some very strict rules about nudity, about sex and even about violence, too. I just think in this case they really need to rethink how they use and adopt their own policies.\"</p><p>However, the pressure group Index On Censorship said: \"The decision to show beheadings is part of a much wider debate on whether companies like Facebook should moderate the content they host. With over a billion users worldwide, Facebook's decisions about what can and can't be shown have a huge impact on global freedom of expression.\" A spokeswoman said: \"Some of these videos are produced in a reporting context.\"</p><p>Padraig Reidy, a senior writer at Index On Censorship, commented: \"One can see a certain logic behind not allowing pictures of bare breasts; Facebook doesn't want its platform to be given over to soft and hard porn.\"</p><p>While it does have a \"like\" button, to indicate approval, Facebook does not have a clear way for users to indicate dislike of content so it would be difficult to know how the company could measure the basis on which people viewed a video.</p><p>A spokesperson for Facebook told the Guardian: \"We look at what [people] say in the comments with a clear expectation they must be condemnatory. There are a lot of videos being removed where the comments aren't [condemnatory].\"</p><p>John Baptista, associate professor of information systems at Warwick Business School, said: \"It is impossible to create rules for everything on the web, so I mostly believe in self regulation based on common sense and guiding principles.</p><p>\"This relies on companies like Facebook being sensible and responsible, however in this case sadly I think Facebook is late in responding to feedback and it is very disappointing to see them not being proactive in addressing a serious issue such as this. I hope they do take the feedback seriously and respond positively.\"</p><p>A Facebook spokeswoman said: \"Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420624222|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|c1473736de271722ea21048c975102b946e478d5 -->",

It said it would take a different approach if the actions in the footage were \"encouraged or celebrated\". </p><p>Following complaints, the website's owners added captions to the front of videos warning that they contained extremely graphic content and that they \"may be upsetting\". But that was not enough to mollify the prime minister, who said Facebook should explain its decision to \"worried parents\". Facebook allows people to use the site from the age of 13, although many 11-year-olds join when they go to secondary school. </p><p>Hostage UK, a charity representing the families of people who have been kidnapped and killed, said: \"The public are well aware of the brutalities committed, and a public showing â€¦ adds nothing other than to cause further unimaginable suffering.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Facebook caved into the pressure and admitted  it had been wrong to refuse to remove the beheading video.  </p><p>\"Based on these enhanced standards we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason we have removed it,\" the company said.</p><p>Facebook had introduced a temporary ban on such videos in May but later decided to remove the block on the grounds that the site is used to share information about world events.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420714684|2013-10-23T17:15:05Z|4437680ea4052a051c85321f1113b80bced4a015 -->",
