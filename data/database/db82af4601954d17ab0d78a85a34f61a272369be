A senior Fed official said today that the bank wants to make sure the improvement in the US jobs market is not just temporary before scaling back the bond buying. In <a href=\"http://www.stlouisfed.org/newsroom/displayNews.cfm?article=1973&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SM&amp;utm_campaign=Twitter\">a speech at a financial forum&nbsp;</a> St Louis Fed president James Bullard said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To the extent that key labour market indicators continue to show cumulative improvement the likelihoodof tapering asset purchases will continue to rise. The committee also wants reassurance that nay progress made in labour markets will stick.</p> </blockquote> <p>Those comments suggested to some that Bullard was becoming less dovish. Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Bullard’s views are highly relevant as he has been a bellwether for investors: at the beginning of this year, he was one of the first Fed officials to discuss the need to taper. Since the summer, however, he became much more dovish, highlighting concerns about the too low inflation rate. Today’s remarks suggest that Mr Bullard has again abandoned his dovish bias and is – under certain conditions – willing to support the tapering.</p> <p>In short, his speech and the presented slides indicate that to him average monthly payroll gains of about 180,000 would represent a substantial improvement in the labor market, the necessary condition for the Fed to wind-down its asset purchase program.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T16:34:44.267Z\">at 4.34pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5273bd15e4b0ad7c52b60506\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T14:51:23.990Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-54f4114c-24a0-4fae-80d6-6e17e4da06cf\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/8/22/1377166412900/Shopper-pushes-a-trolley--010.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad is 412th on the Forbes list of billionaires.

And however much people care about inequality, almost every place on Earth would like to be the kind of place where successful new firms are born and raised.</p> <p>The good news about Sweden is that it’s exactly that kind of place. High taxes go to finance cheap health care and education, an excellent system of public transportation, and relatively generous subsidies to low-income households that keep the poverty rate and inequality low. But they haven’t stopped Swedish entrepreneurs from building giant firms like H&amp;M, Ikea, and&nbsp;Tetra Pak.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read his full piece <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/billion_to_one/2013/10/sweden_s_billionaires_they_have_more_per_capita_than_the_united_states.html\">here</a>.</p> <p><em>I am passing onto Nick Fletcher now.

to plug a fiscal gap that it says can been easily fixed by better control of social security contributions.</p> <p>Earlier this week tensions were raised a notch further when the country’s normally mild-mannered president <strong>Carolos Papoulias</strong> used an annual commemoration of the country’s stand against fascism to insist that “<a href=\"http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/10/28/greece-says-cant-take-any-more-austerity-will-not-be-blackmailed/\">Greek people cannot give anymore</a>”.&nbsp;</p> <p>Athens’ outright rejection of new belt-tightening measures has outraged creditors who in private insist that fresh cuts are the only way forward.&nbsp;</p> <p>Indicative of the mood in a country where disposal incomes have been slashed by up to 50%, the government has been forced to backtrack on a new bill outlining property taxes with the finance minister, <strong>Yannis Stornaras</strong>, promising to amend the legislation in the coming days.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5273a02be4b01fc33230d44e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T12:41:17.604Z\">12.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sterling extends its losses</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>The pound is down 0.5% against the dollar to $1.5958</strong>, as investors shrug off Friday's economic good news. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/chinas-manufacturing-at-18-month-high-live#block-527375b9e4b01fc33230d43b\">Manufacturing data showed the fastest growth in export orders for two years</a>, but many traders are not convinced the pick-up in the UK economy will be sustained.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527398cee4b0020e1b71993d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-01T12:29:27.120Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Belfast relieved over RBS plan</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6b944428-975d-40db-88ce-297dbf2a291a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383309142056/91cc8fb2-3dd1-44cf-9d8b-17f63f464610-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ulster Bank HQ in Belfast.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph: Paul Faith/PA</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>The RBS bad bank is also an important move for Ulster Bank, the largest bank in Northern Ireland. </strong>Around &pound;9bn of Ulster Bank's bad loans will find a home in the RBS internal bad bank.</p> <p><strong>The Guardian's </strong>Ireland correspondent<strong> Henry McDonald</strong>&nbsp;writes that Ulster Bank is critical for both states on the island.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Northern Ireland secretary <strong>Theresa Villiers</strong> has welcomed RBS' decision to continue operating as the Ulster Bank on both sides of the Irish border.&nbsp;The secretary of state said today she had been working closely with colleagues in the Treasury &quot;to ensure the importance of this decision to Northern Ireland was clearly understood and properly considered.&quot;&nbsp;She said the restructuring of RBS overall would &quot;give Ulster Bank a greater ability to lend, providing extra help to Northern Ireland business and the economy.&quot;</p> <p>The Northern Irealnd Finance Minister Simon Hamilton said the news that RBS was not being split up was &quot;far better than many people feared&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;We do have the opportunity as a result of the review that will take place to shape Ulster Bank into the bank that we need it to be,&quot; he added.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SimonHamilton/statuses/396207416649719808\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Decision to keep Ulster Bank as a core part of RBS business is a positive result for Northern Ireland.

        "body":"<p>The Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, has welcomed  Royal Bank of Scotland's decision to continue operating as the Ulster Bank on both sides of the Irish border.</p><p>The secretary of state said on Friday she had been working closely with colleagues in the Treasury \"to ensure the importance of this decision to Northern Ireland was clearly understood and properly considered\".</p><p>She said the restructuring of RBS overall would \"give Ulster Bank a greater ability to lend, providing extra help to Northern Ireland business and the economy\".</p><p>The Northern Ireland finance minister, Simon Hamilton, said the news that RBS was not being split up was \"far better than many people feared\".</p><p>\"We have the opportunity, as a result of the review that will take place, to shape Ulster Bank into the bank that we need it to be,\" he said.</p><p>RBS will create an internal \"bad bank\", ringfencing £38bn of toxic assets such as loans not expected to be repaid. About £9bn of those toxic assets are from Ulster Bank.</p><p>Ulster Bank will also face a further review aimed at finding a viable and sustainable business model.</p><p>The Ulster Bank also revealed it lost a further £132m in the third quarter of this year as it continues to suffer from the impacts of the property crash, particularly in the Irish Republic.</p><p>The bank's importance to the economies of both states on the island of Ireland is critical to the banking sector. Ulster Bank is the largest bank in Northern Ireland and the third largest in the Republic. Most of its debts on the island were generated when it lent billions in commercial property loans during the Celtic Tiger years before the crash.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421452363|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|4891b26c485a85992a9f9cb32b5ea5de68e19cdd -->",

        "body":"<p>Royal Bank of Scotland's new capital resolution division (RCR) will contain £38bn of the bailed-out bank's most troublesome loans.</p><p>The bank already had a \"non-core\" division, which Stephen Hester created on joining RBS five years ago when the bank was on the brink of collapse. At that time it had £258bn of unwanted businesses and assets, which had shrunk to £35bn by the time Hester left in September. These businesses included substantial operations such as its commodity trading business, plane leasing and pub chains.</p><p>Some £14.8bn of those remaining non-core assets will go into the RCR together with another £23.5bn of loans that look as if they will not be repaid.</p><p>That £23.5bn is largely made up of commercial property loans - some 47% of the total - split between four of the bank's divisions. UK corporate, which lends to big business, will put £5.5bn of loans in, while Ulster bank will put in £4.1bn. The investment banking arm has £2.6bn of troubled positions that will go into the RCR, while £2.6bn will come from international markets.</p><p>The addition of the new legacy positions mean that £9bn loans from Ulster Bank are now included in the division. While half of the RCR will be comprised of commercial property, a quarter is corporate lending with the other quarter made up of shipping loans (8%) and trading positions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421448040|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|612f20176b4c8920190fdc749429c68478262568 -->",

        "body":"<p>With Royal Bank of Scotland under pressure, the <strong>Direct Line</strong> insurance business it spun off last year is heading in the other direction.</p><p>Shares in Britain's largest motor insurer have climbed 3.1p to 228.1p after it reported a 6% rise in third quarter operating profits and said restructuring costs for the next two years would be 12% lower than expected. Direct Line, where RBS still owns 28%, said it was too early to assess the cost of the recent St Jude's Day storm but it should fall within its expectation of around £25m from major weather events. Analysts were divided on the business. Canaccord Genuity's Ben Cohen said:</p><p><blockquote>Nine month on-going operating profit was £418m versus £419m consensus, while the net income was a clear beat at £243m versus £209m estimated, driven by higher run-off profits and lower restructuring charges. The underwriting result of £122m versus £136m included £9m loss on German hail in July, which we do not believe was in forecasts. Light underwriting was made up by better investment income, helped by realised gains.<br /><br />We continue to see Direct Line as well placed to produce attractive returns to shareholders, even in competitive end-markets, helped by cost-cutting and strong starting reserving. We would not expect consensus forecasts to move materially, absent the benefit from lower restructuring charges, but expect the mix of profit contribution near-term to continue to shift from motor to other lines.<br /><br />With Direct Line expected to pay a special dividend of 4p per share after the sale of its life division, we see the 7.3% dividend yield as attractive, and well-supported by an underlying payout ratio below 60%. RBS's residual stake remains an overhang. <br /></blockquote></p><p>But Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas was more negative;</p><p><blockquote>Headline operating profits were better than expected for the third quarter but only due to greater investment gains. Lower restructuring costs also flattered the pre-tax profits. Excluding these one-offs, underlying results were below expectations.<br /><br />Our concern regarding the sustainability of earnings remains due to: 1) the high prior year profits and motor reforms; and 2) rapidly falling new business prices will slowly impact the business.</blockquote></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421447200|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|5952cd9d7fbe761a2e22f87547e8584705d28490 -->",

        "headline":"RBS places troublesome assets worth £38bn in internal 'bad bank'",
        "body":"<p>Royal Bank of Scotland warned on Friday that it would make a substantial loss this year after its new chief executive, Ross McEwan, announced £38bn of troublesome assets would be ringfenced inside the bailed out bank.</p><p>In a move that was seen as an attempt to restore the often strained relationships with the government and regulators, McEwan also made clear he wanted to draw a line under lingering concerns about the bank's capital position. On a number of occasions he talked about \"resetting\" relationships with the Treasury and the Bank of England.</p><p>Chancellor George Osborne was in the main London office of RBS as the figures were released and conceded that any sell-off of the shares was unlikely before the election. McEwan said he wanted to move away from the \"weariness\" and \"defensiveness\" that had crept into RBS.</p><p>McEwan acknowledged the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/rbs-business-lending-attacked\" title=\"\">stinging criticism contained in a report into the bank's lending practices</a>, which found it was turning away three out of every four applications for business loans from small and medium-sized businesses and was too aggressive towards existing customers facing financial difficulty. McEwan said that while the report made uncomfortable reading, the bank had to confront the problem.</p><p>The review into creating a bad bank – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/19/osborne-lloyds-rbs-sell-off\" title=\"\">commissioned by Osborne after his Mansion House speech in June</a> – had concluded the \"effort, risk and expense involved in the creation of an external bad bank is not justified\". Investment bank Rothschild, which conducted the review recommended by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, said it would \"do more harm than good\".</p><p>Pat McFadden, the Labour MP who sat on the commission, tweeted: \"So RBS will have an internal bad bank, as it has had for five years.\"</p><p>RBS shares were the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 3.5% at 355p – well below the 500p average price the taxpayer paid for them – after the bank reported a third-quarter loss of more than £600m.</p><p>Osborne, who through UK Financial Investments owns 81% of RBS, said the bailed-out bank was on a \"new direction\". A Treasury report showed RBS would become more UK-focused with an even smaller investment bank – which employed 25,000 staff before the bailout but now employs 10,900. Osborne said the bank should not be involved in \"speculating and punting on the markets\".</p><p>Instead of the bad bank, which the taxpayer would have had to fund, about £38bn of troublesome loans – including £9bn from Ulster Bank – will be placed into a new non-core division to be known as the capital resolution division, which will aims to be wound down in two years. Some £11bn of capital should be released as a result.</p><p>McEwan – who said he wanted to \"reset the key relationships\" with government and regulators – will accelerate the spin-off of RBS's US arm, Citizens, to next year rather than 2015 and signalled a review of a large number of businesses, the outcome of which will be announced in February. Ulster Bank is likely to remain part of RBS Group.</p><p>The New Zealander, who has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/rbs-ross-mcewan-stephen-hester\" title=\"\">chief executive since 1 October</a>, would not comment on the potential impact on jobs as he discussed the need to cut costs.</p><p>Creating the new non-core division would mean the bank has to write off up to £4.5bn of problem loans in the next year – driving the bank to a \"substantial loss\" for the full year.</p><p>Despite the warning of losses, Osborne said: \"Today RBS sets out a new direction – a new direction that will lead it to being a boost to the British economy instead of a burden. This is part of our economic plan for sustaining the economic recovery and creating a banking system that works for Britain.\" He conceded though that a sale of the government's stake was unlikely to happen before the next election.</p><p>The bank took a fresh provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling of £250m – taking its total bill so far to £2.65bn and admitted it was involved in new investigation into alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets. McEwan would not comment on reports two traders had been suspended.</p><p>McEwan said the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority was preparing to ask banks to hold more capital and so RBS was acting in a \"pro-active manner\". The Bank of England had found RBS would have had a £13.5bn capital shortfall at the end of December 2013, which is why it taking steps to bolster its financial strength.</p><p>The review into a possible bad bank had been conducted with the regulator. \"The good bank/bad bank review has from the start been carried out in conjunction with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). This has allowed us to address our shared objective of identifying ways in which to strengthen the capital position of the bank, speed up the recovery in our core UK businesses and accelerate the path to privatisation,\" McEwan said.</p><p>RBS is now in discussions about releasing the dividend access share that would have forced the bank to pay dividends – when it could afford them – to the government before its other shareholders.</p><p>McEwan's own review into the business will be unveiled in February and will cover customer-facing businesses, IT and operations and decision-making structures.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421434497|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|bda1cbca0e5a987b9b9f9dee60ca911fc46d0d0b -->",

        "headline":"UK manufacturing sector boosted by rising demand for exports",
        "body":"<p>Britain's manufacturers enjoyed rising export demand and hired new workers in October, according to a survey.</p><p>The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI report suggested export orders grew at their fastest pace in more than two years, although overall activity rose at a slightly softer pace.</p><p>Although manufacturing output remains well below the level enjoyed before the recession, it notched up its seventh straight month of improvement with a reading of 56.0. That was well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and down slightly from 56.3 in September. Economists had forecast a reading of 56.1 in a Reuters poll.</p><p>The survey follows the latest official data showing the UK economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter. With households under pressure from stagnant wages and rising bills and prices, there have been questions over whether that pace of growth can be maintained in the consumer-dependent UK economy. But economists said manufacturing could help drive overall growth.</p><p>Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said: \"Despite only accounting for less than 11% of the economy, the current strength of growth seen in manufacturing means the sector will still provide a major boost to the economy in October, boding well for the strong pace of economic growth we saw in the second and third quarter being sustained into the fourth quarter.</p><p>\"The survey suggests manufacturing output is growing at a quarterly rate of around 1%-1.5%.\"</p><p>But he also highlighted the challenges facing the government as it vows to shift economic dependence towards manufacturing and exports.</p><p>\"Maintaining this solid expansion will be important if we are to see any real signs of the economy rebalancing, as manufacturing remains 9% smaller than its pre-crisis peak, while services have already closed the gap,\" added Dobson.</p><p>The survey suggested manufacturing employment rose for the sixth consecutive month as total new orders for the sector continued to rise. Within that, export orders increased at the fastest pace since February 2011 as companies reported growing demand from Asia, the US, mainland Europe, Ireland, the Middle East and Russia.</p><p>EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, welcomed the export growth.</p><p>\"Manufacturers' focus on developing new products and services to support their expansion into new export markets is making a strong contribution to this trend,\" said the EEF's chief economist, Lee Hopley.</p><p>\"Buoyant output across all sectors and an upbeat view of demand at home and in overseas markets bodes well for a sustained recovery in the fourth quarter and into 2014. While we expect to see a mild contraction in output overall for 2013, we are forecasting growth to bounce back to over 2% next year.\"</p><p>Economists said the latest show of continued growth in the sector would probably boost market speculation that the Bank of England will have to raise borrowing costs from their current record low of 0.5% sooner than suggested.</p><p>\"With orders and production indices remaining firm, the PMI is consistent with an acceleration in GDP growth in the fourth quarter from the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter rate recorded in the third quarter, which should keep early rate hike expectations and sterling supported, particularly against the euro,\" said James Knightley at ING Financial Markets.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421444015|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|4f25d47c2dbaa1e867e9b3467ca5e0eae251ef8c -->",

        "body":"<p>With <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> reporting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/royal-bank-scotland-losses-internal-bad-bank-rbs\" title=\"\">a hefty third quarter loss of more than £600m</a>, it takes some doing to be the recipient of the market's wooden spoon.</p><p>But aircraft parts supplier <strong>Meggitt</strong> has done it, falling more than 8% to 525.5p to make it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. Meggitt said it expected revenues to grow in the low single digits this year, down from its prediction in August of mid-single digit gains.</p><p>The company, which makes avionics and wheels for the likes of Airbus and Boeing, said trading in the four months to the middle of October had fallen slightly below expectations. It said:</p><p><blockquote>[This was] principally due to short term production difficulties at Meggitt Sensing Systems and the timing of contract wins and project milestones in one of our energy businesses.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>It said military revenues remained flat despite the US budget issues, but the strengthening of the pound against the dollar in the second half also had an effect. But it identified a raw material supply issue dating back to 2012, involving replacing various parts over the next few years at a cost of £20m. Analyst Chris Dyett at Investec said:</p><p><blockquote>Meggitt's third quarter management statement is a disappointment, leading us to make pretax profit downgrades of around 7% for this year and next. Underlying trading is largely as expected, but a number of newly identified issues have impacted the second half and also 2014. In addition, a foreign exchange headwind has compounded the issues. Our new price target is 515p and we move to hold, expecting the stock to unwind part of the recent re-rating as well as reflecting the downgrade.<br /><br /></blockquote></p><p>RBS meanwhile is indeed down after its figures, the second biggest faller after Meggitt with a 12.9p or 3.5% decline to 354.7p. Barclays is also lower, down 7.75p at 255.85p. Both banks are among those being sued by US group Fannie Mae over the libor scandal.</p><p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 11.36 points at 6720.07 as investors continue to be concerned about the US Federal Reserve easing its bond buying programme after some recent upbeat data, albeit the central bank made no changes at its meeting earlier this week.</p><p>Better than expected Chinese PMI figures failed to lift the mining sector, with <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> down 4.5p at 3153.5p. Fears of Fed tapering outweighed the positive signs from China.</p><p>But <strong>Vodafone</strong> jumped 4.65p to 229.15p on renewed talk of possible bid interest from US group AT&amp;T, in the wake of the UK mobile group's sale of its stake in its American wireless joint venture to partner Verizon.</p><p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> B shares have recovered 12.5p to £20.89 in the wake of Thursday's disappointing figures, while <strong>BG</strong> has added 8p to 1281.5p.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421441247|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|fc5ab4232609fe27cc4f820816b817cee18dd782 -->",

We need to invest in new industries to create decent jobs and provide better early years careers support.\"</p><p>Katy Jones from the Work Foundation, which conducted the study, said: \"The gender gap starts early in working lives and is particularly striking in the lower half of the labour market. Young women tend to start work and remain in sectors with lower pay and fewer prospects.</p><p>\"Unemployment for both young men and women remains at crisis levels.

        "body":"<p>Royal Bank of Scotland received stinging criticism on Friday for turning away too many small business customers as a result of overly strict lending criteria and a complex management structure.</p><p>The 81% taxpayer-owned bank failed to meet its own goals for lending to small businesses – regarded as a potential engine of growth for the economy – and has been too aggressive towards existing customers facing financial difficulty, according to the report by Sir Andrew Large, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England.</p><p>Outlining nine recommendations, Large suggests the bank conduct a forensic inquiry into the way it has treated customers in distress. He also says it should  create more coherent and realistic targets for lending to the small and medium-size enterprise (SME) sector.</p><p>Ross McEwan, presenting his first set of results since being promoted to chief executive, said: \"The picture Sir Andrew Large paints is not an entirely comfortable one, but it's one we have to confront. A successful, vibrant and well-regarded SME bank is central to the overall value and reputation of this company.\"</p><p>McEwan said he was conducting a review of the bank and would report back in February. In the meantime the bank is to write to customers and speed up the time it takes to grant loans after Large said the bank should give staff more confidence to lend.</p><p>Large said one person should be put in charge of the SME business, which is currently split across the business bank, the non-core division, the 315 branches that must be sold off to meet EU rules and a division  which looks after financially stretched customers.</p><p>The bank has faced repeated criticism over its lending to SMEs. The report said RBS had been losing market share – from 42% of net lending in the months before its 2008 bailout to 27% five years later – after reducing the period of time over which it was prepared to lend. It added that \"risk aversion\" among its bankers meant credit-worthy customers were turned away.</p><p>The report, commissioned by the bank following repeated criticism from politicians and small businesses bosses, said RBS's stock of lending has continued to fall this year, by £1.8bn in the first half, when rivals were expanding their SME lending.</p><p>\"RBS should look afresh at the manner in which it delivers lending to SMEs and make sure that the various components of its offering to customers are aligned,\" said Large.</p><p>RBS's lending before the 2008 crash was unsustainable when it reached £55bn but it then fell too quickly to £38bn. The bank had been trying to reduce its exposure to commercial property lending but as a result had turned away creditworthy customers.</p><p>\"The bank failed to meet its own SME lending targets, partly because they were unrealistic and also because of weakness in its lending operations,\" Large said.</p><p>Until 2012, the RBS small business bankers had been focused on gathering deposits and worrying about risk rather than issuing new loans. The processes inside the bank meant that credit controllers were turning away applications too quickly.</p><p>The report said RBS had been more active than its rivals in renegotiating loans after the crisis. \"RBS has also changed the way it manages its relationship with customers that it believes have shown signs of financial deterioration or distress. A small minority of customers who have experienced this have made serious allegations about the actions that RBS has taken,\" the report said.</p><p>The inquiry needed to substantiate or refute these allegations, the report said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421424810|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|5f018c5765a0d76f9b564ef1bd96476cbcfb1601 -->",

        "headline":"RBS places troublesome assets worth £38bn in internal 'bad bank'",
        "body":"<p>Royal Bank of Scotland warned on Friday that it would make a substantial loss this year after its new chief executive, Ross McEwan, announced £38bn of troublesome assets would be ringfenced inside the bailed out bank.</p><p>In a move that was seen as an attempt to restore the often strained relationships with the government and regulators, McEwan also made clear he wanted to draw a line under lingering concerns about the bank's capital position. On a number of occasions he talked about \"resetting\" relationships with the Treasury and the Bank of England.</p><p>Chancellor George Osborne was in the main London office of RBS as the figures were released and conceded that any sell-off of the shares was unlikely before the election. McEwan said he wanted to move away from the \"weariness\" and \"defensiveness\" that had crept into RBS.</p><p>McEwan acknowledged the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/rbs-business-lending-attacked\" title=\"\">stinging criticism contained in a report into the bank's lending practices</a>, which found it was turning away three out of every four applications for business loans from small and medium-sized businesses and was too aggressive towards existing customers facing financial difficulty. McEwan said that while the report made uncomfortable reading, the bank had to confront the problem.</p><p>The review into creating a bad bank – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/19/osborne-lloyds-rbs-sell-off\" title=\"\">commissioned by Osborne after his Mansion House speech in June</a> – had concluded the \"effort, risk and expense involved in the creation of an external bad bank is not justified\". Investment bank Rothschild, which conducted the review recommended by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, said it would \"do more harm than good\".</p><p>Pat McFadden, the Labour MP who sat on the commission, tweeted: \"So RBS will have an internal bad bank, as it has had for five years.\"</p><p>RBS shares were the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 3.5% at 355p – well below the 500p average price the taxpayer paid for them – after the bank reported a third-quarter loss of more than £600m.</p><p>Osborne, who through UK Financial Investments owns 81% of RBS, said the bailed-out bank was on a \"new direction\". A Treasury report showed RBS would become more UK-focused with an even smaller investment bank – which employed 25,000 staff before the bailout but now employs 10,900. Osborne said the bank should not be involved in \"speculating and punting on the markets\".</p><p>Instead of the bad bank, which the taxpayer would have had to fund, about £38bn of troublesome loans – including £9bn from Ulster Bank – will be placed into a new non-core division to be known as the capital resolution division, which will aims to be wound down in two years. Some £11bn of capital should be released as a result.</p><p>McEwan – who said he wanted to \"reset the key relationships\" with government and regulators – will accelerate the spin-off of RBS's US arm, Citizens, to next year rather than 2015 and signalled a review of a large number of businesses, the outcome of which will be announced in February. Ulster Bank is likely to remain part of RBS Group.</p><p>The New Zealander, who has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/rbs-ross-mcewan-stephen-hester\" title=\"\">chief executive since 1 October</a>, would not comment on the potential impact on jobs as he discussed the need to cut costs.</p><p>Creating the new non-core division would mean the bank has to write off up to £4.5bn of problem loans in the next year – driving the bank to a \"substantial loss\" for the full year.</p><p>Despite the warning of losses, Osborne said: \"Today RBS sets out a new direction – a new direction that will lead it to being a boost to the British economy instead of a burden. This is part of our economic plan for sustaining the economic recovery and creating a banking system that works for Britain.\" He conceded though that a sale of the government's stake was unlikely to happen before the next election.</p><p>The bank took a fresh provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling of £250m – taking its total bill so far to £2.65bn and admitted it was involved in new investigation into alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets. McEwan would not comment on reports two traders had been suspended.</p><p>McEwan said the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority was preparing to ask banks to hold more capital and so RBS was acting in a \"pro-active manner\". The Bank of England had found RBS would have had a £13.5bn capital shortfall at the end of December 2013, which is why it taking steps to bolster its financial strength.</p><p>The review into a possible bad bank had been conducted with the regulator. \"The good bank/bad bank review has from the start been carried out in conjunction with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). This has allowed us to address our shared objective of identifying ways in which to strengthen the capital position of the bank, speed up the recovery in our core UK businesses and accelerate the path to privatisation,\" McEwan said.</p><p>RBS is now in discussions about releasing the dividend access share that would have forced the bank to pay dividends – when it could afford them – to the government before its other shareholders.</p><p>McEwan's own review into the business will be unveiled in February and will cover customer-facing businesses, IT and operations and decision-making structures.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421434497|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|bda1cbca0e5a987b9b9f9dee60ca911fc46d0d0b -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's manufacturers enjoyed rising export demand and hired new workers in October, according to a survey.</p><p>The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI report suggested export orders grew at their fastest pace in more than two years, although overall activity rose at a slightly softer pace.</p><p>Although manufacturing output remains well below the level enjoyed before the recession, it notched up its seventh straight month of improvement with a reading of 56.0. That was well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and down slightly from 56.3 in September. Economists had forecast a reading of 56.1 in a Reuters poll.</p><p>The survey follows the latest official data showing the UK economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter. With households under pressure from stagnant wages and rising bills and prices, there have been questions over whether that pace of growth can be maintained in the consumer-dependent UK economy. But economists said manufacturing could help drive overall growth.</p><p>Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said: \"Despite only accounting for less than 11% of the economy, the current strength of growth seen in manufacturing means the sector will still provide a major boost to the economy in October, boding well for the strong pace of economic growth we saw in the second and third quarter being sustained into the fourth quarter.</p><p>\"The survey suggests manufacturing output is growing at a quarterly rate of around 1%-1.5%.\"</p><p>But he also highlighted the challenges facing the government as it vows to shift economic dependence towards manufacturing and exports.</p><p>\"Maintaining this solid expansion will be important if we are to see any real signs of the economy rebalancing, as manufacturing remains 9% smaller than its pre-crisis peak, while services have already closed the gap,\" added Dobson.</p><p>The survey suggested manufacturing employment rose for the sixth consecutive month as total new orders for the sector continued to rise. Within that, export orders increased at the fastest pace since February 2011 as companies reported growing demand from Asia, the US, mainland Europe, Ireland, the Middle East and Russia.</p><p>EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, welcomed the export growth.</p><p>\"Manufacturers' focus on developing new products and services to support their expansion into new export markets is making a strong contribution to this trend,\" said the EEF's chief economist, Lee Hopley.</p><p>\"Buoyant output across all sectors and an upbeat view of demand at home and in overseas markets bodes well for a sustained recovery in the fourth quarter and into 2014. While we expect to see a mild contraction in output overall for 2013, we are forecasting growth to bounce back to over 2% next year.\"</p><p>Economists said the latest show of continued growth in the sector would probably boost market speculation that the Bank of England will have to raise borrowing costs from their current record low of 0.5% sooner than suggested.</p><p>\"With orders and production indices remaining firm, the PMI is consistent with an acceleration in GDP growth in the fourth quarter from the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter rate recorded in the third quarter, which should keep early rate hike expectations and sterling supported, particularly against the euro,\" said James Knightley at ING Financial Markets.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421444015|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|4f25d47c2dbaa1e867e9b3467ca5e0eae251ef8c -->",

        "headline":"British energy suppliers' explanations for price hikes just don't add up",
        "body":"<p>Compare and contrast. In the euro area, falling energy prices are cited as one of the reasons why the annual inflation rate has dropped to a four-year low of 0.7%. Energy bills in the 17-nation single currency zone were 1.7% lower in September than they were a year earlier, continuing a downward trend in recent months.</p><p>In the UK, the Office for National Statistics says that the average consumer could expect to pay 8% more for both gas and electricity in September than a year earlier. Fuel makes up only 5% of the average family's weekly spending (rather more for those on lower incomes) but as the ONS pointed out earlier this week, rising gas and electricity bills are having a dampening impact on the economy because households have less left over at the end of the month for discretionary spending.</p><p>So what's going on? When pressed to explain why they are raising domestic energy tariffs by 10%, the Big Six energy companies tend to say either that they are being forced to pass on green levies to their customers, that they are being forced to pay more for fuel on the world's wholesale energy markets or that above-inflation increases are needed for investment in new capacity.</p><p>Stephen Fitzpatrick, managing director of Ovo energy, blew the gaff on the \"it's all down to global forces\" explanation when giving evidence to a parliamentary committee this week, noting that wholesale prices have been going down not up. This is now underlined by the data from Eurostat, which shows that across the Channel these lower wholesale prices are being reflected in lower bills to consumers and falling inflation.</p><p>Green levies, which make up just 9% of the average energy bill, could not possibly explain such a disparity. Nor could movements in the pound, since sterling has moved slightly higher on the foreign exchanges this year. All of which means that the energy companies had better get started on building all the new power plants they have been promising. Before people draw the obvious conclusion: that they are using their market power to rook the customer.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421402824|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|6e223b59ad170646a7bb4182013e782865083a8f -->",

        "body":"<p>Three times more young women are employed in low-paid, low-skilled jobs than 20 years ago, according to a new study.</p><p>The TUC said the proportion of 16 to 24-year-old women in jobs such as office and hotel cleaning has increased from 7% to 21%, while the figure for young men has increased from 14% to 25%.</p><p>The research also showed that gender plays a huge part in career choice, with only 1% of women working in skilled trades compared with a fifth of young men.</p><p>Four times as many young women worked in occupations such as hairdressing, leisure and travel, said the report.</p><p>The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"The youth labour market has become a much harsher place for young people over the past 20 years, especially for young women.</p><p>\"While there has been a welcome rise in the number of females gaining qualifications, many still find themselves trapped in low-skill, low-wage jobs.</p><p>\"This is because there are fewer good jobs out there and because young women are still being channelled down 'traditional' routes.</p><p>\"Unless we create better training and employment opportunities for young people, as well as challenging gender roles from the outset, the situation will not improve. We need to invest in new industries to create decent jobs and provide better early years careers support.\"</p><p>Katy Jones from the Work Foundation, which conducted the study, said: \"The gender gap starts early in working lives and is particularly striking in the lower half of the labour market. Young women tend to start work and remain in sectors with lower pay and fewer prospects.</p><p>\"Unemployment for both young men and women remains at crisis levels. While it is higher for young men, young women are more likely to quit an active job search and move into inactivity from unemployment.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421438332|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|d20b90e405fd4cd9b84234761f5f5504fd193fee -->",

        "body":"<p>BT's multimillion-pound venture into sports broadcasting has rekindled its consumer business, with 2 million viewers now signed up to the BT Sport channels.</p><p>Revenues from consumer sales are up 4% in the September quarter, the best performance for 10 years, and BT's television service has added 70,000 subscribers, more than in any quarter since 2008. A further 156,000 customers signed for broadband, meaning BT grabbed the lion's share of new internet subscribers in the quarter.</p><p>BT is spending an estimated £1.5bn over three years on premier league football rights, big name presenters Jake Humphries and Clare Balding and lavish television studios in the former Olympic park, in an effort to stop the leakage of customers to rivals Sky and TalkTalk.</p><p>The loss of customers with a BT telephone line – a key measure of defections from the company – fell to 65,000 for the quarter, the best performance in five years. The telecoms firm beat City forecasts to report revenues flat at £4,491m, comfortably outstripping the consensus forecast of £4,440m, while profit before tax was also ahead at £499m.</p><p>\"BT Sport has made a confident start and is already delivering for viewers,\" said chief executive Gavin Patterson, presenting his first financial results since taking over from Ian Livingston. \"More than 2 million of our customers are signed up to it and our wholesale contract with Virgin Media means it is available to around four million homes in total.\"</p><p>BT now has 900,000 television customers – still some way behind Virgin's 3.8m and Sky's 10.5m. But its broadband and TV signings were ahead of Sky for September – the satellite broadcaster added 111,000 broadband customers and 37,000 to its television service.</p><p>Jerry Dellis, an analyst at Jefferies bank, said fears Sky had successfully countered the impact of BT Sport by giving away broadband free to TV subscribers had been overblown. \"Robust broadband net adds from BSkyB … had raised some concern that BT's heavy investment in TV might be having rather limited initial impact at stemming the loss of retail lines within the BT base. In fact BT Retail KPIs are quite encouraging.\"</p><p>BT increased its interim dividend by 13% to 3.4 pence per share, and investors bumped the stock up 6.5p to 376p in early trading before the shares fell back to 372p.</p><p>Days after its August launch, BT Sport reached  1 million direct subscribers. That number has now doubled to 2 million. More than half are Sky subscribers watching via satellite, while others are viewing the programmes online or via the BT Sport app.</p><p>Following a deal signed a £75m a year deal with Virgin Media, which is offering the channels free to the 2 million customers who are already signed up to its most expensive TV package, the BT channels now have a potential audience of 4 million.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421350551|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|8cee54e751b6562882d33539d9f631108be814ae -->",

        "headline":"Bill Adderley unmasked as Marks &amp; Spencer's biggest private shareholder",
        "body":"<p>Bill Adderley, the billionaire founder of the homeware chain Dunelm, has secretly built a near £250m stake in Marks &amp; Spencer, it has emerged.</p><p>The entrepreneur acquired the shares during the past 18 months, a period in which the M&amp;S share price has risen by almost 40%.</p><p>The disclosure, triggered by stock market rules that unmask shareholders who own more than 3% of a company, revealed Adderley as M&amp;S's largest private shareholder. He will receive dividends on his stake of more than £8m a year.</p><p>An M&amp;S insider said: \"We do know him and have met him, being as he has been our largest private shareholder for some time. It was a small purchase [that took Adderley over the 3% disclosure threshold] so this has not come out of the blue.\"</p><p>Adderley founded Dunelm on a Leicester market stall with his wife Jean in 1979 after leaving his job as manager of Woolworths in the city, eventually floating the business on the stock exchange.</p><p>The business is now worth about £1.8bn and boasts more than 100 stores making sales of £677m and profits of £108m. It is still majority owned by the Adderley family, who live near Uppingham, Rutland, and are collectively worth £1.1bn, according to the 2013 Sunday Times Rich List. Shares in Dunelm have more than doubled since the financial crisis and risen by about 30% during 2013.</p><p>Adderley, who has avoided the public spotlight, was not available to comment but sources close to the family suggested he had merely spotted an investment opportunity and taken it. When asked if he was planning to lead a consortium to bid for control of M&amp;S, the source said: \"This would be an extraordinarily clumsy way of going about it.\"</p><p>The news that M&amp;S has attracted such a large private shareholder comes at a propitious time for the retailer, which has struggled to impress the City under the leadership of chief executive Marc Bolland.</p><p>The Dutchman is in the final year of a three-year, £2.3bn plan designed to address decades of under-investment. His efforts were insufficient to prevent clothing sales falling for eight straight quarters, although this week it emerged that M&amp;S has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/29/marks-and-spencer-clothing-sales\" title=\"\">stemmed the erosion of its share of the clothing market</a> – albeit while suffering continued declines in its share of the women's clothing market. It is due to report its half-year figures next week.</p><p>Efforts to repair flagging clothing sales and pull in younger shoppers have also been knocked by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/20/marks-and-spencer-womenswear-executive-clothing-sales\" title=\"\">imminent departure of Gillian Ridley Whittle</a>, development and buying director for womenswear, which was announced last week.</p><p>Next week M&amp;S is expected to report a 1.5% fall in underlying sales of general merchandise – a category mainly made up of clothing – for the six months to the end of September. That would be on a par with the 1.6% slide reported in the three months to the end of June. Some analysts have downgraded their sales expectations amid unseasonably warm autumn weather.</p><p>The retailer is also launching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/30/marks-and-spencer-christmas-advert-launch\" title=\"\">its Alice in Wonderland-inspired Christmas adverts</a>, featuring actor Helena Bonham Carter and models David Gandy and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.</p><p>M&amp;S shares added 2.09% yesterday to close at 503.5p. Adderley's 48.5m shares are therefore worth £244m.</p><p>City analysts have a mixed view on the shares. Of the 23 following the company, 11 rate the shares as a buy, seven as a sell, while five are neutral, according to the financial website Digital Look.</p><p>Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst in London, told Bloomberg: \"He's brave to take such a big punt on an M&amp;S recovery.\"</p><p>Recent M&amp;S successes have included its food business - Bolland's area of expertise, having joined from the grocer Morrisons - that has enjoyed 17 consecutive quarters of underlying sales growth and contributes 54% of group sales. Meanwhile, online sales growth is running ahead of the market and solid progress has been made overseas.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421399765|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|bda0e0b4a0530a9892cbcdcd292b9caf021aa0a0 -->",

        "headline":"Consumer borrowing grows at fastest rate since 2008 crash",
        "body":"<p>The Bank of England has admitted to an error in its data and said consumer borrowing has been growing at its fastest rate since before the financial crisis five years ago.</p><p>The Bank said on Thursday that net unsecured lending to consumers – overdrafts, personal loans and credit cards – rose by £864m last month, the biggest increase since December and more than double the £411m figure it first reported.</p><p>The jump meant unsecured lending in the three months to September increased by 5.8% on an annual basis, the strongest growth since April 2008.</p><p>The surge in borrowing will raise concerns that Britain is relying on a debt-fuelled recovery at a time when policymakers have repeatedly stressed the need to rebalance the UK economy away from spending and towards manufacturing and exports.</p><p>Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"There is an amber warning light here – not an immediate risk but a medium-term financial stability concern. The notion that we have gone through a full deleveraging cycle is abject nonsense.\"</p><p>On Thursday, new data showed UK consumer confidence has risen to its highest level for six years despite the ongoing squeeze on disposable incomes. While levels of confidence lag those reported in Germany, Australia and the US, and a degree of pessimism remains, confidence has grown at a faster rate in the UK than in most European countries, according to figures from the market research firm Nielsen.</p><p>Its survey of more than 30,000 online consumers in 60 countries found those in the UK rated their confidence at 87 in the three months to the end of September, with levels above 100 indicating optimism and below pessimism. German confidence stands at 92 and the US at 98, France stands at 61 and Portugal and Spain at 55 and 56 respectively.</p><p>Chris Morley, managing director of Nielsen in the UK and Ireland, said British consumers had coped with rising household costs and falling real-term wages by shopping carefully and hunting bargains.</p><p>He added: \"Throughout this period, British consumer confidence remained stubbornly weak, but in recent months it has finally taken an upward turn as the green shoots of economic recovery start to show.\"</p><p>Positive news on the UK housing market has boosted sentiment. But Nielsen also revealed a growing perception that the economic downturn in Britain is over.</p><p>With a move towards optimism, the proportion saying they were willing to spend crept up five percentage points to 39%.</p><p>Utility bills are now by far the biggest concern for people living in the UK. Energy and water bills were highlighted as a top concern by 31% of those questioned, compared with 27% a year ago as several of the major gas and electricity providers have raised prices in recent weeks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421397912|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|aaea5cc73d55a69a852ba8a20866757a4a5f67cb -->",

        "body":"<p>AstraZeneca is being investigated by US authorities over a clinical trial that was used to win marketing approval for its heart drug <a href=\"http://www.brilinta.com/\" title=\"\">Brilinta</a>, casting fresh doubts over the medicine.</p><p>Brilinta sales have been a disappointment since its launch two years ago, although AstraZeneca has recently stepped up marketing efforts and hopes that further clinical tests will underscore its value in preventing heart attacks.</p><p>The British drugmaker said on Thursday it received a civil investigative demand from the US department of justice, seeking documents and information regarding the Plato (platelet inhibition and patient outcomes) study.</p><p>AstraZeneca plans to co-operate with the DOJ and its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said he was \"very confident\" in the findings of the trial. \"It was guided by a strong academic group who oversaw the trial and its conduct,\" he told reporters  after announcing third-quarter results.</p><p>AstraZeneca did not disclose the exact nature of the investigation and DOJ spokesman Peter Carr in Washington said he had no immediate comment on the case.</p><p>The results of the 18,000-patient trial were first reported in 2009 and went on to form the basis of successful new drug applications in the US, Europe and other markets. Brilinta was launched in 2011.</p><p>Aspects of the study, which relied heavily on patients recruited in eastern Europe, have been criticised by medical experts. Poland and Hungary together accounted for 21% of the subjects studied – more than double the US and Canada combined.</p><p>James DiNicolantonio of Ithaca New York and Ales Tomek of Charles University in Prague raised several questions about the conduct of the study in a recent paper in the <a href=\"http://www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com/inpress\" title=\"\">International Journal of Cardiology</a>.</p><p>In particular, their analysis found that patients in the Plato trial who were monitored by AstraZeneca were reported as having more beneficial effects from taking Brilinta than those monitored by an independent clinical research organisation.</p><p>Those conclusions, however, have been strongly disputed by Lars Wallentin of Uppsala clinical research center in Sweden, the principal investigator on Plato.Brilinta is a key product for AstraZeneca but its progress to date has been slow, with sales in the third quarter edging up to just $75m (£47m) from $65m in the three months to end-June – a long way from the multibillion-dollar sales potential that analysts once predicted.</p><p>Among the challenges it faces is the fact that US doctors tend to use high-dose aspirin for cardiovascular patients, and clinical trials suggest AstraZeneca's new drug does not work as well in this setting.</p><p>AstraZeneca hopes that a new clinical study called Pegasus will put to rest any uncertainties about the effectiveness of Brilinta and also increase uptake of the medicine. Results are expected in 2014.</p><p>In addition to the DOJ inquiry into Brilinta, AstraZeneca also disclosed it had received a subpoena from the US Attorney's Office in Boston, seeking documents and information related to the safety of its antipsychotic drug <a href=\"http://www.seroquelxr.com/\" title=\"\">Seroquel</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The news came as AstraZeneca promoted Marc Dunoyer to chief financial officer, plugging a gap in the management team as it grapples with falling sales and profits.</p><p>Dunoyer, 61, who joined from rival GlaxoSmithKline in June, will replace well-respected finance chief Simon Lowth, whose departure to join BG Group had been announced.</p><p>Hit by generic competition to key drugs, sales and profits at AstraZeneca continued to slide in the third quarter, underscoring the challenge facing Soriot, who has been in the job for just over a year. Lowth has been viewed as a steady hand on AstraZeneca's finances, and the appointment of Dunoyer, who lacks recent direct CFO responsibility, may concern some investors. Soriot and Dunoyer have their work cut out to turn around AstraZeneca after years of failure to come up with new drugs to replace those reaching the end of their patent life.</p><p>Improving AstraZeneca's record in drug research is Soriot's top priority, but he told Reuters in June that turning around the company would take three to four years.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It will also require investment in the science behind new medicines and AstraZeneca said it expected to spend more, with 2013 spending increasing at the upper end of its prior guidance range of a low-to-mid single-digit percentage rise on 2012.</p><p>Mark Clark of Deutsche Bank said higher operating costs suggested there would be \"minor\" downgrades in earnings forecasts.</p><p>Sales in the quarter slid by 6% to $6.25bn, weighed down by the loss of patent protection on several drugs – including, in some markets, its top-selling cholesterol fighter Crestor.</p><p>\"Core\" operating profit was $2.03bn.</p><p>Growth in drug sales in China, where destocking and an anti-corruption drive disrupted business, slowed to 13% from 21% in the second quarter. But AstraZeneca fared a lot better than GlaxoSmithKline, the company at the centre of the scandal, whose China sales crashed 61% percent in the third quarter.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421412204|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|31d8142be869159339de633f287c5653d11c110b -->",

        "body":"<p>The flop of the film White House Down has added to earnings woes at Sony in the latest quarter, dragging the entertainment and electronics giant to a 19.3bn yen (£122m) loss.</p><p>The action movie's lacklustre box office performance, especially compared with last year's releases of 21 Jump Street and The Amazing Spider Man, contributed to a 17.8bn yen operating loss for Sony's pictures division, according to figures released on Thursday.</p><p>The company slashed its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending in March to 30bn yen from 50bn yen, reflecting deep-seated problems in its electronics business – televisions in particular – and the disappointing performance at Sony Pictures.</p><p>White House Down starred Jamie Foxx as president of the United States and Channing Tatum as a police officer who becomes the president's impromptu bodyguard while touring the executive residence with his daughter just as a band of rogue former soldiers and government employees attack. The film appeared to suffer by comparisons with Olympus Has Fallen, a slightly earlier release with a similar plot, featuring a former North Korean terrorist who takes the president hostage.</p><p>Sony's sales for the July to September quarter rose 10.6% from a year earlier to 1.78tn yen, thanks mainly to the favourable impact of the yen's decline against the US dollar. Adjusted for the 20% drop in the value of the yen, revenue fell 9%.</p><p>The company's sales of digital cameras and video cameras fell while its television, music and smartphone businesses improved. Sales of its Xperia Z smartphone helped and are expected to remain strong, a spokesman for the company said.</p><p>But although sales of televisions and personal computers improved slightly from earlier in the year, they were lower than the same quarter of 2012.</p><p>\"The electronics business is declining beyond expectations\" due to shrinking sales of televisions and other audio-visual equipment, along with slowing growth in major emerging markets such as China, the spokesman said.</p><p>\"Sony expects its business environment to continue to be severe in the second half of the fiscal year,\" he added.</p><p>Sony said it is striving to improve profitability at its troubled television division by focusing on sales of higher cost products, including its LCD (liquid crystal display) TVs.</p><p>The company, which has suffered declining fortunes for several years, is also gearing up for the introduction of its PlayStation 4 game machine.</p><p>But it faces fierce competition from Apple's iPad and iPhone as well as from its powerful South Korean rival Samsung.</p><p>Sony made record losses for the fiscal year ending March 2012, reporting the worst result in the company's six-decade history.</p><p>Still, its loss for April to September narrowed to 15.8bn yen from 40bn yen in the first half of the previous fiscal year.</p><p>Its rival Panasonic, meanwhile, said its quarterly profit improved to 63.3bn yen from a 698.6bn yen loss the year before.</p><p>Panasonic, like Sony, has benefited from weaker yen. While its domestic sales fell 4%, sales overseas climbed 11%. Total revenue of 1.88tn yen was up 3% from a year earlier after taking a hit from the sale of Sanyo businesses carried out in the current fiscal year.</p><p>Panasonic raised its sales forecast to 7.4tn yen and doubled its profit forecast for the fiscal year to 100bn yen.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421377025|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|a7aedb8e2a1aadf764194ef1c8c08100dc58b033 -->",

        "body":"<p>Six of the world's leading central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, say they will provide each other with ready supplies of their currencies on a standing basis, extending arrangements set up to steady the global financial system during post-2007 turbulence.</p><p>The decision, announced on Thursday, extends currency swap arrangements that until now had been considered temporary measures.</p><p>The central banks are: the Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank.</p><p>The so-called swap lines enable those central banks to make sure banks in their home countries can always borrow ready cash from them in any of the currencies involved, should they need it.</p><p>The ECB said the arrangements \"have helped to ease strains in financial markets\" and \"will continue to serve as a prudent liquidity backstop\".</p><p>The Fed and the ECB started their first dollar-euro swap arrangement in December 2007 as the losses on mortgage-backed bonds began to shake the banking system. Subsequent bilateral deals between the different banks were added during the financial turbulence that followed, which included the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008, sudden extreme falls on stock markets, the subsequent recession and Europe's crisis over too much government debt in several countries.</p><p>Central banks serve as custodians of their countries' currencies and play an important role in supporting the stability of banks so companies can do business and the economy can function properly.</p><p>They typically provide liquidity – ready cash to meet the demands of everyday business – to their banks, even when banks may be having trouble borrowing elsewhere due to market trouble. With the new currency arrangements, they can do this in currencies other than their own.</p><p>For example, the European Central Bank holds credit offerings in US dollars for periods of seven days and three months, offering as much in dollars as European banks may want in return for collateral such as bonds or other securities.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421361156|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|6d090c719e098d354347639d2eaa089ab99f5975 -->",

Routes in and out of London saw the biggest increase in numbers, particularly to and from airports.</p><p>Coach revenue had already grown 9% during the third quarter of 2013, the transport group announced, bolstered by the best August bank holiday figures on record.</p><p>National Express has also seen improved coach revenue in Morocco and its US school bus operations.</p><p>The group is also pursuing multiple rail franchises in Germany, where it has been shortlisted for the Berlin Ringbahn contract.</p><p>News that coach links from London to the airports are booming may further aggrieve rival Arriva, which is suing Luton airport for putting the coach service it previously ran out to tender this year. The franchise was won by National Express.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421370263|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|483e577db044ec08edd21842c594a96bc4169104 -->",

        "body":"<p>Mobile advertising now accounts for just short of half of Facebook's revenues, the social network company announced Wednesday sending shares soaring in after hours trading.</p><p>Releasing its latest quarterly results, Facebook said mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 49% of $1.8bn in ad revenue the company made in the third quarter of 2013.</p><p>Fears that Facebook was facing difficulties adapting to the rapidly growing mobile market contributed to its rocky share sale last year. It took Facebook close to a year to surpass the $38 price its shares initially sold for. Facebook's shares soared close to 10% to $53.88 in after-hours trading as investors digested the mobile figures.</p><p>Facebook is expected to account for a 15.8% share of worldwide mobile ad spending in 2013, up from a 5.35% share last year, according to analyst eMarketer. Google is expected to grab 53.17% of the worldwide mobile ad market this year, up slightly over a 52.36% share in 2012.</p><p>Mobile advertising is the fastest growing advertising category. The overall mobile ad market worldwide is expected to grow 89% to $16.65bn in 2013, eMarketer estimates, up from just $8.8bn in 2012.</p><p>Overall, Facebook's revenues were over $2bn for the quarter, up from $1.26bn for the same period last year. Net income was $425m, compared to a loss of $59m last year.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, said: \"The strong results we achieved this quarter show that we're prepared for the next phase of our company, as we work to bring the next five billion people online and into the knowledge economy.\"</p><p>The company said there was an average of 728m daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook in September 2013, an increase of 25% year-over-year. The number of monthly active users was 1.19bn as of September 30, 2013, an increase of 18% year-over-year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421325385|2013-11-01T16:42:45Z|08c97e2906a336eb54edf3fe004656497a4a2522 -->",
