We expect it to move below 7% by mid-2015, a year ahead of the Bank of England's current forecast. However, given the positive developments in the last couple of months, the Bank is likely to downgrade its unemployment forecast in its next Inflation Report due next Wednesday. This will probably be accompanied with upward revisions to growth as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers, World First, said:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The services sector is flying.&nbsp;Records in both output and employment have guided the PMI to the highest level since Tony Blair took power in the UK back in 1997, as confidence around the long-term ability for recovery continues to increase. Combined with the manufacturing figure from Friday and yesterday’s 6 year record construction number, we can safely say that momentum is firmly gathering in the UK economy. The wind is very much in our sails.</p> <p>We would have to say that growth is now running at close to 5% on an annualised basis, on these initial estimates, and, at the moment, shows little sign of abating. We must now wait for the Bank of England’s appraisal of this run of numbers. There will be a fair few of the economic fraternity of who will be looking forward to next week’s Quarterly Inflation Report and expecting some form of outlook change from the MPC; a change that will see rates rising sooner than the 2016 expectation that was originally forecast…</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andy Scott, associate director at HiFX:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following positive surprises in the manufacturing and construction sector indexes, the early indicators for the fourth quarter look like 2013 could see the economy grow at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Markit, the company that measures and releases the data for all three sectors, said that combining the three indexes points to GDP growth this quarter of 1.3%. This should serve to ease some concerns that have arisen over the past few weeks that the recovery won’t be sustained. The buoyancy of the housing market where prices have been rising steadily helped by increasing mortgage approvals and the government’s help to buy scheme has been what a lot of commentators have put the recovery down to but clearly it’s broader based. With unemployment continuing to fall at a modest but steady pace, confidence will be maintained which should boost consumer spending and corporate investment. </p> </blockquote> <h2>And here's our full story:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\">Service sector growing at fastest pace since 1997</a></h2> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c878e4b08cac6a3300fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:29:47.754Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">MPs grill Wonga: Payday lenders admit making changes</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Wonga has also admitted it was forced to make changes to its sales practices following an Office of Fair Trading investigation,as the hearing before MPs continued...</strong></p> <p>It was told to highlight risk factors more prominently on its website and make clearer disclosures around APRs (percentage interest rates).</p> <p><strong>QuickQuid</strong> and <strong>Mr Lender</strong> admits that they have been ordered by the Office of Fair Trading to change their procedures on 'roll overs' where hard-pressed borrowers ask for a loan to be rolled over at the end of the term.</p> <p>In total, Mr Lender admits that it was told to make around 30 changes to its procedures.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:31:44.278Z\">at 10.31am GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5278c778e4b00d1cb164472b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:28:59.928Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Back to parliament, and&nbsp;MPs are pressing payday lenders on how they check whether borrowers can afford a payday loan. </strong></p> <p>Adam Freeman, chief executive of Mr Lender, admits that it has no idea if a borrower is taking out new loans from Wonga or other lenders at the same time.&nbsp;</p> <p>He gives an example of a person taking home &pound;1,500 a month with &pound;600 left after rent and other expenses.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We might then lend them &pound;300 or &pound;350.

        "body":"<p>Britain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\" title=\"\">services sector appears to be booming</a>. Growth in services activity and employment rose at the fastest rate in more than 16 years in October.</p><p></p><p>The Markit/CIPS PMI for September jumped to 62.5 from 60.3 – well ahead of City expectations. It signalled further improvement for a sector which accounts for more than three-quarters of the UK economy.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Nida Ali, economic adviser to the</strong> <strong>Ernst &amp; Young Item Club</strong>,<strong> </strong>says the data suggest the fourth quarter got off to a positive start, with unemployment likely to fall below 7% ahead of the Bank of England's current expectations.</p><p></p><p>\"The services sector has started the fourth quarter with a bang. These figures beat even the most optimistic expectations, as most commentators, after strong out-turns in the past couple of months, were expecting the pace of services growth to slow in October.</p><p></p><p>\"The all-sector PMI, which covers service, manufacturing and construction, rose 1.3 points in October to be 61.5, hitting its highest ever level, suggesting that growth is set to accelerate further in Q4. But there appears to be some divergence in the survey results and actual data. For instance, the PMI results in Q3 had suggested output growth of more than 1.5%, but official data was only half of that. So we would be wary of drawing any firm conclusions about Q4 growth just yet.</p><p></p><p>\"The strong increase in employment supports our view that the unemployment rate is on track to drop below the 7% forward guidance threshold well ahead of schedule. We expect it to move below 7% by mid-2015, a year ahead of the Bank of England's current forecast. However, given the positive developments in the last couple of months, the Bank is likely to downgrade its unemployment forecast in its next Inflation Report due next Wednesday. This will probably be accompanied with upward revisions to growth as well.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Blerina Uruçi, a Barclays economist</strong>, said it was a positive sign for the months ahead.</p><p></p><p>\"Strength in the services survey was spread across the board. The new business index rose by 2.8 points to 63.4, reaching the highest since the survey began in 1997. This rise in the pace of growth of new business bodes well for overall activity in the coming months and makes today's outturn appear more grounded.</p><p></p><p>\"The firms surveyed attributed this increase in new business mainly to an improvement in market sentiment and again noted the housing market as a driver of new orders growth.</p><p></p><p>\"The employment index was also strong, rising to 56.2, its highest in over 16 years. The services PMI survey has reported rising payroll numbers for 10 consecutive months and the latest reading is consistent with employment rising significantly faster than would be consistent with its long-term average (51.1).\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Alan Clarke, director of fixed income strategy at Scotiabank,</strong> says official data for the services sector is unlikely to be as strong as the PMI.</p><p></p><p>\"The UK services sector CIPS survey is flying! Nonetheless, it is worth keeping the reading in context. Why do we care about the PMI? Because it tells us where GDP is likely to go.</p><p></p><p>\"What does the relationship look like now? It suggests that business services output should be surging by around 3% quarter on quarter (q/q) compared to the near-1% q/q we saw during Q3. If we get that sort of growth in services output (and I'm not saying we will - it looks like an overshoot to me) then other things equal q/q GDP would be close to 1.5% q/q – almost double Q3's decent pace.</p><p></p><p>\"The survey feels a bit frothy. No doubt conditions are robust, improving and better than thought at the start of the year. But I am a little wary that the hard data lives up to what the surveys suggest they should be doing.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight</strong>, said it was a \"mightily impressive\" set of figures.</p><p></p><p>\"Particularly given the dominant role of the services sector in the economy (it accounts for 77.8% of total output, the survey suggests that there is a very real possibility that GDP growth in the fourth quarter could rival the 0.8% quarter-on-quarter growth rate achieved in the third quarter.</p><p></p><p>\"At this stage though, we expect GDP growth to ease back to a still very decent 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, partly due to some moderation in consumer spending. Lacklustre October retail surveys from the BRC and the CBI reinforce our view that consumers may be taking a breather at least until Christmas.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>James Knightley, ING economist</strong>, said the services PMI would likely provide a boost to the pound.</p><p></p><p>\"The UK service sector PMI has surprised yet again in October with the headline number up at 62.5, well ahead of the 60.0 consensus and up from the 60.3 reading last month. The new business component is at its highest level since the series began in 1996 and taking all of the PMIs together the composite reading is suggesting that 4Q GDP growth could rise as much as 1.5% – equivalent to around 6% annualised growth.</p><p></p><p>\"It is difficult to believe that any other major economy will come close to that in the fourth quarter so sterling is likely to remain strong, particularly against the euro. It will also inevitably lead to further questions over whether the Bank of England seriously believes that it will be three years before the unemployment rate falls to 7%. We still think interest rates could rise in early 2015.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics</strong>, said the services PMI had implications for the Bank of England.</p><p></p><p>\"The CIPS business surveys suggest that the UK economy got off to a very strong start in Q4. An improvement on Q3's 0.8% expansion would seem eminently possible.</p><p></p><p>\"Evidence of robust jobs growth strengthens the likelihood that next week's Bank of England Inflation Report will see the MPC bring forward the date at which it expects the unemployment rate to fall to the 7% threshold.</p><p></p><p>\"The strong survey data is also likely to support a rise in the MPC's forecast for GDP growth in 2013. Indeed, a weighted average of all three surveys points to quarterly GDP growth in Q4 perhaps exceeding 1.5%.</p><p></p><p>\"Admittedly, the surveys have recently presented a more upbeat picture of the economy than the official GDP estimates. But, with activity in the economy accelerating and the recovery remaining broad-based, an improvement on Q3's 0.8% quarterly expansion would seem to be on the cards.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421711293|2013-11-05T16:07:01Z|593c1b1ce22d72fb0ec7ddc1528a35d1846f74c0 -->",

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/howslife.htm\" title=\"\">How's Life? report </a>on wellbeing from the OECD thinktank attempts to count the human cost of the global financial crisis. The wide-ranging report ranks countries on a range of criteria from housing and health to crime and social engagement.</p><p><strong>Income inequality</strong> was highest in Chile, Mexico and the Russian Federation – and lowest in Eastern European and Nordic countries. The UK's income inequality was above the OECD average and has risen over the last 15 years.</p><p></p><p><strong>Life satisfaction</strong> is highest in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. People in Hungary, Portugal and Greece report the lowest levels of life satisfaction. In the UK satisfaction rates are higher than before the crisis, with 64% British people declaring being very satisfied with their lives.</p><p></p><p><strong>Life expectancy</strong> is highest in Switzerland followed by Italy, Japan and Spain.</p><p></p><p><strong>Work-life balance</strong> is deemed worst in Turkey, by far and away the country with the highest proportion of employees working very long hours. Mexico and Israel are next and the UK is also ahead of the OECD average. In the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, very long working hours are rare.</p><p></p><p><strong>Leisure time</strong> is highest in Norway and Denmark and lowest in France and Japan.</p><p></p><p><strong>Education</strong> is the UK's weakest area when compared with other OECD countries. The UK is only just above average for educational attainment and behind 19 other countries. It is below average for educational expectancy – the average duration of education a five-year-old can expect to get by the age of 39. Teenage students' average score in reading, mathematics and science in the UK is above average but behind 14 other countries, with Finland and Korea top. Numeracy and literacy levels among adults in the UK are below the OECD averages but ahead of those in the US.</p><p></p><p><strong>Health</strong> was again a stand-out area for Switzerland. In 2011, the percentage of adults reporting good or very good health was 85% or more in Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, but only half as high in Korea and Portugal. Japan ranked last with only one in three respondents reporting being in \"good\" or \"very good\" health.</p><p></p><p><strong>Employment rates</strong> increase with education but some countries do better than others on offering equal job chances. Since 2000 the employment gap between people with tertiary education and people with below upper secondary education has remained stable on average in the OECD area. But it has increased substantially in Slovenia, the UK, Sweden, Iceland and Korea.</p><p></p><p><strong>Homicide rates</strong> are low in most countries and the OECD average is 2.23 homicides per 100,000 people. They are, however, more than twice as high in the United States and even higher in Mexico, Brazil and in the Russian Federation. Iceland, Japan and Norway are the least likely places to get murdered. Over the last 10 years Mexico's homicide rate has almost doubled.</p><p></p><p><strong>Housing conditions</strong> vary greatly between countries. In Canada, Belgium, Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands, households report on average two or more rooms per person. In Turkey, Hungary and Poland, however, people live in smaller houses with one room per person or less. The UK is above average on this.</p><p></p><p><strong>Social support networks</strong> appear to be weakest in Turkey, Mexico, Korea and Greece, and strongest in Iceland, Ireland, the UK and Switzerland.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421707629|2013-11-05T16:07:01Z|de5127a173c218724d0448fe14439abed2dec3cd -->",

It added that there were encouraging signs that the recovery would continue but said the legacy of Europe's debt crisis would continue to act as a brake on growth.</p><p>Only in 2015, when growth is expected to increase to 1.7%, does the commission see a dent being made in the jobless total, with unemployment predicted to drop to 11.8%.</p><p>Olli Rehn, the commission's vice-president for economic and monetary affairs and the euro, said: \"There are increasing signs that the European economy has reached a turning point. The fiscal consolidation and structural reforms undertaken in Europe have created the basis for recovery.</p><p>\"But it is too early to declare victory: unemployment remains at unacceptably high levels. That's why we must continue working to modernise the European economy, for sustainable growth and job creation.\"</p><p>The commission, publishing forecasts three times a year for the eurozone and the EU, stresses that the return to solid growth in the countries that belong to the monetary union is set to be gradual, with big differences in economic performance across member states. Financial markets believe the combination of sluggish growth, high unemployment and the threat of deflation will prompt the European Central Bank into fresh efforts to boost activity.</p><p>Of the bigger euro area countries, only Germany is forecast to grow by more than 1% in 2014. Spain is expected to expand by 0.5%, Italy by 0.7% and France by 0.9%.</p><p>By contrast, the commission said the outlook for the UK – which has exceeded expectations in 2013 – was \"quite bright\". Growth of 2.2% is pencilled in for 2014, rising to 2.4% in 2015.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421702308|2013-11-05T16:07:01Z|038742110316dd01cfe3ddd01a01807e70f6ade0 -->",

Whether it has been the Funding for Lending scheme prising open the banks' purse strings; the housing recovery helping to tempt shoppers back into the spending habit; or the halt to doom-laden headlines about the imminent collapse of the eurozone, confidence appears to have flooded back.</p><p>Some of this new euphoria must be froth: there's a bad-tempered argument raging between City economists about how much the latest run of Panglossian survey results can be believed.</p><p>But something has clearly happened to unleash the \"animal spirits\" that can power economic growth, by prompting firms to ramp up production, invest in new equipment and - hopefully - hire new staff.</p><p>GDP may not be expanding at the boomy 1.3%-per-quarter rate that would be suggested by a direct read-across from the PMIs; but it does seem to be accelerating.</p><p>There is a clear risk, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/uk-growth-2014-niesr\" title=\"\">highlighted once again by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research on Monday</a>, that this is the \"wrong sort of growth\": too dependent on consumers running down their savings – and indeed, as the Bank of England has suggested, starting to borrow again against the rising value of their homes.</p><p>Much will turn on firms' behaviour: no one quite knows how much they could crank up output using their existing workforce, without resorting to bringing in new workers or bidding up wages.</p><p>The shortfall in business investment, and the relentless squeeze on wages, which in turn deadens consumer demand, have been key factors in holding back the recovery since 2009.</p><p>NIESR believes it will be 2019 before real wages return to their pre-recession levels. That could mean that sluggish wage growth and a stagnating jobs market eventually call a halt to both the housing upturn and the closely related consumer recovery.</p><p>However, it is likely to be many months before we know whether this period of running on air is giving the economy a leg-up towards more solid, sustainable growth, or laying the foundations for a future crisis. Meanwhile, there will be plenty more sunny-sounding surveys to come.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421699953|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|c567ec9aee2ee31d8e0e5d483bcfdbc144d3c21b -->",

        "body":"<p>UK authorities have acted to give more power to minority investors in listed companies dominated by a controlling shareholder.</p><p>There have been concerns about the likes of ENRC and Bumi, controlled by various tycoons and subsequently caught up in rows about corporate governance.</p><p>Now the Financial Conduct Authority has announced <a href=\"http://www.fca.org.uk/news/cp13-15-enhancing-the-effectiveness-of-the-listing-regime\" title=\"\">it is strengthening the listing rules for top companies</a> to give minority shareholders additional voting rights and greater influence over key decisions. David Lawton, the FCA's director of markets, said:</p><p><blockquote>Active engagement by all shareholders is essential to make markets work well. By safeguarding minority interests from abuse by controlling shareholders, these changes will promote market integrity and empower minority shareholders to hold the companies they invest in to account.<br /></blockquote></p><p>After months of consultations, the FCA believes it has addressed concerns about controlling shareholders without turning minority protection into minority control. The proposals include:</p><p><em>• Ensuring listed companies are run independently of their controlling shareholders, including measures that give independent shareholders a veto over transactions between listed companies and a controlling shareholder when this independence is threatened.</em></p><p><em>• Requiring separate approval of independent directors by independent shareholders, in addition to gaining approval from shareholders as a whole.</em></p><p></p><p><em>• Enhanced voting power for minority shareholders where a company with a controlling shareholder seeks to cancel its listing or remove minority shareholders' rights. </em></p><p></p><p><em>• Requiring greater transparency for listed companies to ensure shareholders have the information they need to exercise their voting rights. </em></p><p></p><p>The City is expected to be relieved at the FCA decision following the consulation, said Richard Weaver at PWC. He said:</p><p><blockquote>The City will largely breathe a sigh of relief that the FCA has resisted calls to significantly increase the current free float requirement of 25% of shares to be held in public hands, allaying concerns that such an increase could seriously threaten the attractiveness of UK capital markets.<br /><br />Some of the proposed rules, such as the requirement for a formal agreement with the controlling shareholder, may be little more than the codification of existing practice in many cases and hence may not  be especially onerous.<br /><br />The consequences of other rule changes such as the appointment of independent directors involving a separate vote by minority shareholders are more difficult to anticipate and we will need to see how they operate in practice.</blockquote></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421699386|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|d3820c2d0965402313d1945a89019dac4b24d641 -->",

It says the UK ranks above the OECD country average on environmental quality, personal security, jobs and earnings and housing among other measures. It is close to average for work-life balance, but below in education and skills.</p><p>That puts the UK alongside Switzerland, Australia, Nordic European countries, Canada and New Zealand in a clutch of highest-performing countries on the latest work for the OECD's <a href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\" title=\"\">Better Life Index</a>.</p><p>The thinktank's &quot;traffic light&quot; system for how countries perform on various elements ranks the US, Ireland, Germany and France as average. Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Estonia, Hungary, Greece and Chile are among the countries with a relatively low performance.</p><p>Overall, the latest part of the OECD's attempt to find new ways to measure wellbeing beyond simple GDP numbers, paints a picture of substantial pain caused by the financial crisis.</p><p>&quot;This report is a wake-up call to us all,&quot; said the OECD secretary-general, Angel Gurr&iacute;a.</p><p>&quot;It is a reminder that the central purpose of economic policies is to improve people's lives. We need to rethink how to place people's needs at the heart of policy-making.&quot;</p><p>The average British household was only &quot;modestly&quot; affected by the crisis, said the OECD, but looking across its club of mostly rich nations many people were blighted by higher unemployment, involuntary part-time work, financial insecurity and poverty.</p><p>&quot;Life satisfaction and confidence in institutions declined substantially in countries severely hit by the crisis, while people reported soaring stress levels,&quot; the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/howslife.htm\" title=\"\">How's Life 2013</a> report says.</p><p>&quot;However, there was little or no change in health outcomes for the population at large.&quot;</p><p>Looking at the UK, the OECD says that over 2007 to 2011 there was a cumulative increase in real household disposable income of around 1%, while in the euro area, income dropped by 2%.</p><p>However, income inequality increased by more than average in the UK over that period.</p><p>The report adds: &quot;In the OECD as a whole, the poor employment situation had a major impact on life satisfaction. This trend is not visible in the United Kingdom where, from 2007 to 2012, the percentage of British people declaring being very satisfied with their lives increased from 63% to 64%.&quot;</p><p>In OECD countries most severely hit by the crisis, people's trust in institutions and in the way democracy works had also declined during the crisis. But the percentage of British people reporting that they trust the government increased from 36% to 47% between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>Looking at gender gaps in OECD countries, the research found British women were still less likely than men to have a paid job or be elected to parliament, and more likely to spend many hours performing household tasks.</p><p>Its analysis of the crisis suggested new forms of solidarity and engagement emerged in the countries that were hardest hit. This trend was less clear cut in the UK, however. The percentage of people reporting having helped someone decreased by 3 percentage points while the share of people reporting having volunteered their time increased by 3 percentage points between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>When it comes to education and job prospects the UK lags behind. On average the employment gap between those people in OECD countries with tertiary education and those with below upper secondary education had remained stable since 2000. But in the UK the gap had widened &quot;substantially&quot;.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680273|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|2bbf4bad794c314e2698636d8c99a30321583d36 -->",

        "body":"<p>Shares in pharmaceuticals group <strong>Shire</strong> have hit an all time high after news one of its drugs was successful in treating binge eating.</p><p>The company said Vyvanse, used in cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had proved superior to a placebo in reducing binge eating in two late stage trials. It now plans to submit an application to US regulator the Food and Drug Administration for approval of the drug by the third quarter of next year. Chief executive Flemming Omskov said:</p><p><blockquote><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Binge-eating/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">Binge eating disorder</a> is a condition for which there is no currently approved pharmacologic treatment and yet there is a significant unmet patient need, as was demonstrated with the faster than expected enrolment of participants in our clinical trial programme.<br /><br />Our development of Vyvanse for [the disorder] also aligns well with Shire's growth strategy of developing innovative treatments to address significant unmet patient needs.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>The disorder was officially recognised as a psychiatric disorder in the US in May, affecting 2.8% of adults in their lifetime. Shire added:</p><p><blockquote>[It] is characterized by recurring episodes of binge eating, feeling out of control while binging, and feeling guilt and shame afterward.<br /></blockquote></p><p>With positive updates on other treatments in its pipeline, Shire's shares climbed to a record £28.92 before slipping back to £28.71, still 51p higher on the day so far. Brian White at Shore Capital issued a buy note, saying:</p><p><blockquote>Reassuringly the safety for Vyvanse in these two studies appears to be generally consistent with the known profile established in studies in adults with ADHD.<br /><br />Our Shire model includes risk adjusted forecasts for Vyvanse in binge eating disorder with the first revenues ($50m) expected for 2015, in line with current filing timelines. Although with positive phase 3 data we can foresee the potential for off label prescribing of Vyvanse by physicians in the disorder to begin ahead of regulatory approval.<br /></blockquote></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421690640|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|5f164903b52800d47a92fe56539c694dee3241df -->",

        "headline":"UK a great place to live and work, says OECD",
        "body":"<p>The UK is one of best places to live and work, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, although income inequality has risen by more than in other countries since the global financial crisis struck in 2007.</p><p>The Paris-based thinktank has been seeking to measure wellbeing for the 34 nations of the OECD, based on aspects of life such as incomes, education, housing and security. It says the UK ranks above the OECD country average on environmental quality, personal security, jobs and earnings and housing among other measures. It is close to average for work-life balance, but below in education and skills.</p><p>That puts the UK alongside Switzerland, Australia, Nordic European countries, Canada and New Zealand in a clutch of highest-performing countries on the latest work for the OECD's <a href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\" title=\"\">Better Life Index</a>.</p><p>The thinktank's &quot;traffic light&quot; system for how countries perform on various elements ranks the US, Ireland, Germany and France as average. Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Estonia, Hungary, Greece and Chile are among the countries with a relatively low performance.</p><p>Overall, the latest part of the OECD's attempt to find new ways to measure wellbeing beyond simple GDP numbers, paints a picture of substantial pain caused by the financial crisis.</p><p>&quot;This report is a wake-up call to us all,&quot; said the OECD secretary-general, Angel Gurr&iacute;a.</p><p>&quot;It is a reminder that the central purpose of economic policies is to improve people's lives. We need to rethink how to place people's needs at the heart of policy-making.&quot;</p><p>The average British household was only &quot;modestly&quot; affected by the crisis, said the OECD, but looking across its club of mostly rich nations many people were blighted by higher unemployment, involuntary part-time work, financial insecurity and poverty.</p><p>&quot;Life satisfaction and confidence in institutions declined substantially in countries severely hit by the crisis, while people reported soaring stress levels,&quot; the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/howslife.htm\" title=\"\">How's Life 2013</a> report says.</p><p>&quot;However, there was little or no change in health outcomes for the population at large.&quot;</p><p>Looking at the UK, the OECD says that over 2007 to 2011 there was a cumulative increase in real household disposable income of around 1%, while in the euro area, income dropped by 2%.</p><p>However, income inequality increased by more than average in the UK over that period.</p><p>The report adds: &quot;In the OECD as a whole, the poor employment situation had a major impact on life satisfaction. This trend is not visible in the United Kingdom where, from 2007 to 2012, the percentage of British people declaring being very satisfied with their lives increased from 63% to 64%.&quot;</p><p>In OECD countries most severely hit by the crisis, people's trust in institutions and in the way democracy works had also declined during the crisis. But the percentage of British people reporting that they trust the government increased from 36% to 47% between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>Looking at gender gaps in OECD countries, the research found British women were still less likely than men to have a paid job or be elected to parliament, and more likely to spend many hours performing household tasks.</p><p>Its analysis of the crisis suggested new forms of solidarity and engagement emerged in the countries that were hardest hit. This trend was less clear cut in the UK, however. The percentage of people reporting having helped someone decreased by 3 percentage points while the share of people reporting having volunteered their time increased by 3 percentage points between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>When it comes to education and job prospects the UK lags behind. On average the employment gap between those people in OECD countries with tertiary education and those with below upper secondary education had remained stable since 2000. But in the UK the gap had widened &quot;substantially&quot;.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421680273|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|2bbf4bad794c314e2698636d8c99a30321583d36 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's services sector enjoyed its strongest growth since 1997 as new business flowed in at a record pace last month, according to the latest survey to suggest the recovery is strengthening.</p><p>The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK services PMI beat City forecasts to jump to a headline activity reading of 62.5 in October, from 60.6 in September. The forecast was for a slight slowdown to 59.8.</p><p>The index for new work was the highest since records began in 1996 and companies took on new staff at the fastest pace since 1997, according to the survey of a range of businesses in Britain's dominant service sector such as transport, IT and restaurants.</p><p>The report follows upbeat news in recent days on the smaller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/uk-construction-output-property-market\" title=\"\">construction</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/01/uk-manufacturing-demand-exports-employment-pmi\" title=\"\">manufacturing</a> sectors in sister PMI surveys and is likely to raise expectations that the UK economy can keep up its recent pace of growth.</p><p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit, said the reports suggested growth would accelerate further in the final quarter of this year.</p><p>\"The UK economic recovery moved up a gear again in October, with the PMIs indicating record growth of output and employment,\" he said.</p><p>\"Historical comparisons of the PMI against gross domestic product suggest the latest survey data are consistent with a 1.3% quarterly rate of GDP growth, up sharply from previous quarters.\"</p><p>The latest official data put GDP growth at 0.8% in the third quarter. Some economists have questioned whether that can be matched in the final months of the year, especially given the pressures on consumers from soaring bills and slow pay growth.</p><p>But Markit suggested that pressures on consumers from the tough labour market were easing with the surveys signalling the private sector is creating more than 100,000 jobs per quarter.</p><p>Economists said the recent run of mostly upbeat indicators would likely prompt the Bank of England to raise its outlook for growth when it publishes its latest forecasts next week.</p><p>James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets, said the survey cast doubt over the Bank's outlook for unemployment. Policymakers have said that they will not raise interest rates from their record low at least until the jobless rate falls to 7%, barring various knock-out clauses being triggered.</p><p>\"Taking all of the PMIs together, the composite reading is suggesting that fourth quarter GDP growth could rise as much as 1.5% - equivalent to around 6% annualised growth,\" said Knightley.</p><p>\"It is difficult to believe that any other major economy will come close to that in the fourth quarter so sterling is likely to remain strong, particularly against the euro. It will also inevitably lead to further questions over whether the Bank of England seriously believes that it will be three years before the unemployment rate falls to 7%. We still think interest rates could rise in early 2015.\"</p><p>But Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, questioned how much markets and policymakers should read into Tuesday's report.</p><p>\"The survey feels a bit frothy,\" he said.</p><p>\"No doubt conditions are robust, improving and better than thought at the start of the year. But I am a little wary that the hard data lives up to what the surveys suggest they should be doing.\"</p><p>Experts have also questioned the sustainability of the UK's recovery, arguing the government's much espoused rebalancing towards manufacturing and exports is a long way off.</p><p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said on Tuesday that while it expects growth to pick up from 1.4% this year to 2% in 2014, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/uk-growth-2014-niesr\" title=\"\">the economy will remain over-dependent on squeezed consumers</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421689020|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|9568e276b62d8d0b709553995aab54be4da0ee57 -->",

        "body":"<p>It conjures up those blissful, carefree days when Things Could Only Get Better, and the name Lehman Brothers meant nothing to anyone in Britain outside a tiny cadre of City workers: according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\" title=\"\">the latest survey of the services sector</a>, its companies are now more optimistic than at any time since 1997.</p><p>If this latest survey is to be believed, the services sector – long the engine of our out-of-kilter economy – is booming. Whether it has been the Funding for Lending scheme prising open the banks' purse strings; the housing recovery helping to tempt shoppers back into the spending habit; or the halt to doom-laden headlines about the imminent collapse of the eurozone, confidence appears to have flooded back.</p><p>Some of this new euphoria must be froth: there's a bad-tempered argument raging between City economists about how much the latest run of Panglossian survey results can be believed.</p><p>But something has clearly happened to unleash the \"animal spirits\" that can power economic growth, by prompting firms to ramp up production, invest in new equipment and - hopefully - hire new staff.</p><p>GDP may not be expanding at the boomy 1.3%-per-quarter rate that would be suggested by a direct read-across from the PMIs; but it does seem to be accelerating.</p><p>There is a clear risk, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/uk-growth-2014-niesr\" title=\"\">highlighted once again by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research on Monday</a>, that this is the \"wrong sort of growth\": too dependent on consumers running down their savings – and indeed, as the Bank of England has suggested, starting to borrow again against the rising value of their homes.</p><p>Much will turn on firms' behaviour: no one quite knows how much they could crank up output using their existing workforce, without resorting to bringing in new workers or bidding up wages.</p><p>The shortfall in business investment, and the relentless squeeze on wages, which in turn deadens consumer demand, have been key factors in holding back the recovery since 2009.</p><p>NIESR believes it will be 2019 before real wages return to their pre-recession levels. That could mean that sluggish wage growth and a stagnating jobs market eventually call a halt to both the housing upturn and the closely related consumer recovery.</p><p>However, it is likely to be many months before we know whether this period of running on air is giving the economy a leg-up towards more solid, sustainable growth, or laying the foundations for a future crisis. Meanwhile, there will be plenty more sunny-sounding surveys to come.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421699953|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|c567ec9aee2ee31d8e0e5d483bcfdbc144d3c21b -->",

        "body":"<p>The European commission is warning that it is too early to claim victory in the euro area's fight against recession after its latest forecasts showed it would be 2015 before weak growth generated a fall in the jobless total.</p><p>Although the 17-nation single currency zone started to expand in the summer after a six-quarter double-dip recession, Brussels said there will be a lag before the pickup in activity leads to a fall in unemployment.</p><p>The commission trimmed its growth forecast for the euro area in 2014 from 1.2% to 1.1% and said unemployment will remain stuck at a record 12.2% next year. It added that there were encouraging signs that the recovery would continue but said the legacy of Europe's debt crisis would continue to act as a brake on growth.</p><p>Only in 2015, when growth is expected to increase to 1.7%, does the commission see a dent being made in the jobless total, with unemployment predicted to drop to 11.8%.</p><p>Olli Rehn, the commission's vice-president for economic and monetary affairs and the euro, said: \"There are increasing signs that the European economy has reached a turning point. The fiscal consolidation and structural reforms undertaken in Europe have created the basis for recovery.</p><p>\"But it is too early to declare victory: unemployment remains at unacceptably high levels. That's why we must continue working to modernise the European economy, for sustainable growth and job creation.\"</p><p>The commission, publishing forecasts three times a year for the eurozone and the EU, stresses that the return to solid growth in the countries that belong to the monetary union is set to be gradual, with big differences in economic performance across member states. Financial markets believe the combination of sluggish growth, high unemployment and the threat of deflation will prompt the European Central Bank into fresh efforts to boost activity.</p><p>Of the bigger euro area countries, only Germany is forecast to grow by more than 1% in 2014. Spain is expected to expand by 0.5%, Italy by 0.7% and France by 0.9%.</p><p>By contrast, the commission said the outlook for the UK – which has exceeded expectations in 2013 – was \"quite bright\". Growth of 2.2% is pencilled in for 2014, rising to 2.4% in 2015.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421702308|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|1f8bfac2f53964f75062a196aa4023e4ab1c7ab4 -->",

        "body":"<p>Marks &amp; Spencer has suffered its ninth consecutive quarter of falling sales, with chief executive Marc Bolland warning on Tuesday that there was little evidence of improved confidence boosting consumer demand.</p><p>Bolland, now in the final year of his three-year turnaround plan for Britain's biggest clothing retailer, said he remained cautious on the outlook for the rest of the year, although he pointed to some \"early signs of improvement\" in womenswear as it battles to revive its ailing clothing business.</p><p>Bolland said: \"While consumer confidence appears to be improving, there is little evidence as yet of this translating to increased spending in the retail sector.</p><p>\"Given continued pressure on disposable incomes, we remain cautious about the outlook for the remainder of the year.\"</p><p>The retailer reported a 1.5% fall in underlying sales of general merchandise – mainly clothing – in the six months to the end of September. The second quarter decline was 1.3%, only a slight slowdown on the first quarter fall of 1.6%, despite the much-vaunted new clothing range.</p><p>This was in the stores for three weeks of the first half and Bolland said it had been well received by customers. He would not be drawn on whether management are expecting third quarter like-for-like clothing sales to grow.</p><p>\"This is the start. We are seeing gradual improvement and we expect that to continue step by step. We should [see] gradual progression, improving over quarters. That's the journey we're on,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p><p>Groups sales rose to £4.9bn in the first half, up 4% compared with the same period last year, boosted by growth in its food and international businesses.</p><p>Like-for-like food sales were up 2.5% in the first half, pushing overall UK like-for-like sales up 0.7%.</p><p>International sales grew by 8% over the period.</p><p>Pre-tax profit fell to £261.6m from £287.3m on an underlying basis and the retailer said the trading backdrop was \"challenging\" throughout the first half of the year, with high levels of discounting among retailers. Despite the results, the company's shares were up 2.2% at 498p in morning trading.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/17/marks-spencer-belinda-earl\" title=\"\">Bolland has revamped his team</a> in an effort to revive the fortunes of the women's clothing ranges, but remains under pressure to transform declining sales into growth.</p><p>The performance was in contrast to clothing retailer Primark, where like-for-like sales rose 5% in the year to 14 September.</p><p>Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: \"The underlying picture is one of flattish sales, rising operating costs and gross margin pressure, trends that obviously need to change for the better in the second half if M&amp;S want to meet full-year profit expectations.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421682670|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|9b395a22f8c2868da2c110c38713c6f9c9dc57fc -->",

A Primark supplier occupied the second floor of the eight storey building.</p><p>Success has also been achieved despite Primark's focus on the high street and not online, in contrast to other retailers.</p><p>ABF's group revenue rose 9% to £13.3bn for the full year, while pre-tax profit rose 15% to £876m.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421700325|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|6db7916125b11b38760271d3019e36c12c8f6400 -->",

        "headline":"Apple creates 2,000 jobs shifting production back to US",
        "body":"<p>Nearly a decade after the closure of its last US factory, Apple is to create 2,000 manufacturing, engineering and construction jobs at a new plant in Arizona.</p><p>The California technology titan is beginning to shift production back to its home market, with the creation of its second US plant in under a year. It is understood the renewable energy powered facility in Mesa, Arizona, will produce laboratory grown sapphire crystals of the kind used in the iPhone 5S fingerprint scanner.</p><p>The initiative is a joint venture with crystal growth equipment specialist GT Advanced Technologies, which said Monday it had signed a multi-year agreement with Apple to provide furnaces to make sapphire. The material, which has been used in watch faces, is more scratch-resistant than glass and may eventually be used to make Apple's screens.</p><p>\"Apple will have an incredibly positive economic impact for Arizona,\" said governor Janice Brewer. \"Their investment in renewable energy will also be greening our power grid, and creating significant new solar and geothermal power sources for the state.\"</p><p>Run with solar and geothermal energy, which uses heat from deep underground, the plant has been designed in collaboration with local utility Salt River Project.</p><p>The building will be owned by Apple, while the furnaces will be supplied by GT Advanced, with a $578 down payment from Apple which will be reimbursed over five years starting in 2015 and is understood to come with certain exclusivity rights.</p><p>Demand for industrially produced sapphire has rocketed since Apple began using the material to protect camera lenses in 2012, according to research firm IHS Suppli. The deal will help Apple secure control over a scarce resource.</p><p>Next month, the first Macintosh computer made in America since 2004 will go on sale. The Mac Pro, whose internal parts are contained in an unusual cylindrical shell, has been produced from a purpose-built plant in Austin, Texas, in a joint venture with contract manufacturer Flextronics which has created 1,700 jobs.</p><p>Apple closed its last American computer assembly plant in Elk Grove, California, in June 2004, having by then shifted much of its production to contract manufacturers in Asia. By then, the company had given up making its own products and outsourced the work to sub-contractors such as Foxconn.</p><p>But bad publicity surrounding the treatment of workers at the plants owned by Foxconn and other companies operating in China have led Apple to take more control over production.</p><p>Other companies have followed suit. Google, which now owns the Motorola smartphone group, has opened a site in Texas, where its latest smartphones are being assembled. Caterpillar, the construction and mining equipment maker, and General Electric, have been opening factories at home in recent years. Samsung has also opened a semi-conductor fabrication plant in Texas, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/16/apple-a5-chip-made-by-samsung\" title=\"\">it makes chips for Apple</a>.</p><p>\"We are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in Arizona, creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering, manufacturing and construction,\" Apple said in a statement. \"This new plant will make components for Apple products and it will run on 100% renewable energy from day one.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421707511|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|3a43a884b31b5db0ba573cce3ba86af05a72793e -->",

        "body":"<p>The Department for Transport and HS2 Ltd should have raised serious concerns about the methodology in a report claiming the high-speed rail project would bring £15bn in additional benefits to the UK, one of HS2's former advisers has told MPs.</p><p></p><p>A panel of academic experts told the Treasury select committee that a KMPG report into HS2's regional economic impacts published in September overstated the benefits by six to eight times.</p><p></p><p>The findings, widely cited by the government – including in the new strategic case for HS2 published last week – used a procedure that was \"essentially made up\", said Henry Overman, professor of economic geography at the LSE.</p><p></p><p>Overman, who was an adviser to HS2 Ltd until 2012, said: \"At some point HS2, DfT and the peer review should have pointed out that parts of the report were problematic&nbsp;… I don't understand why the £15bn figure was allowed to go out.\"</p><p></p><p>He said that even the reduced figure should not be presented as additional to the benefit cost ratio with wider economic benefits published by the DfT, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/29/hs2-economic-case-downgraded-benefits\" title=\"\">which was revised downward to 2.3:1 last week</a>.</p><p></p><p>Dan Graham, professor of statistical modelling at Imperial College, told the committee he shared that view. He said of the KPMG work: \"I don't think the statistical work is reliable.\"</p><p></p><p>Earlier, the KMPG partners who produced the report defended their work as robust as MPs queried the scale and viability of the report, which was produced over four months for a total fee of £242,000.</p><p></p><p>Committee chair Andrew Tyrie asked: \"You don't normally do work of this scale for a couple of hundred thousand do you?\"</p><p></p><p>KPMG's Richard Threlfall replied: \"We didn't quite anticipate the degree of debate the report would create.\"</p><p></p><p>Tyrie asked KPMG to explain a line in the report admitting: \"We recognise that this approach does not have a firm statistical foundation.\"</p><p></p><p>The consultants said they had been transparent about their workings. KPMG's Lewis Atter said he believed the work was a \"reasonable, probably conservative approach\". He said: \"There is no perfect way of answering the exam question we are posed.\"</p><p></p><p>He said that they stood by the £15bn figure as a forecast, despite a disclaimer that the findings should be regarded only as an estimate. Atter said it was a standard disclaimer.</p><p></p><p>The KPMG pair denied cherrypicking figures, after a Newsnight freedom of information request showed that cities and towns which would lose out economically from the creation of the HS2 network were omitted from a table in the report which showed only potential gains.</p><p></p><p>Threlfall pointed to a map included in the report marking with red dots places that would be negatively affected in 2037. He said he thought that a map was more illustrative than a table.</p><p></p><p>Asked their opinion of the HS2 project, Threlfall said: \"Based on the work we've done HS2 is a good thing and we should get on with it.\"</p><p></p><p>Atter, who said he started in the sceptical camp, said he now believed HS2 should be built, especially in the context of the wider transport and infrastructure spending ahead.</p><p>He said: \"The question is not is it the very best thing to do, but would you find space for it in your £1.2tn [spending] over 20 years.\"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, was speaking at a supply chain conference in Birmingham attended by over 800 companies looking to win contracts totalling more than £10bn.</p><p></p><p>McLoughlin said businesses from across the UK could be part of building HS2, saying the project would bring jobs and growth to communities across the country for generations to come.</p><p></p><p>The HS2 network linking London with Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds is scheduled for full completion in 2033 at a cost of £42.6bn, including £14bn in contingencies.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421702356|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|2bcca15648003bd240f22fb0ef1616e86e7e98cc -->",

        "headline":"Co-op Bank scrambles to convince customers its ethical stance will survive",
        "body":"<p>The Co-operative Group was scrambling late on Monday to convince the 4.6 million customers of its banking arm that its ethical stance could survive aggressive US hedge funds taking a stake in the troubled bank.</p><p>As details of a £1.5bn rescue package were announced, the group disclosed the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, was asking questions about information it provided about its financial strength in its 2012 annual report. The bank had concluded it did not need to reissue the accounts.</p><p>About 50 of the 324 Co-op bank branches are to close and a significant number of jobs from the 10,000-strong workforce are under threat as the new management team attempts to reverse steep losses. It could take five years to make the bank profitable again after losses caused by bad lending and the merger with the Britannia building society in 2009.</p><p>The troubles at the bank are forcing the wider Co-operative Group, which owns supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes, to pump £462m into the bank – equivalent to around £60 for each of the group's 7.9 million owner-members.</p><p>While this is less than the £1bn the group originally expected to stump up, it means the UK's largest mutual will own just 30% of the bank; the rest will be owned by its bondholders. Those include a group of hedge funds, led by the US-based Silver Point and Aurelius, that has forced the rewriting of a radical proposal first outlined in June, when the £1.5bn shortfall was identified.</p><p>Despite concerns that the millions of pounds being used to prop up the bank would starve the Co-op of cash to invest in its other businesses, the finance director, Richard Pennycook – part of a new management team installed in the last six months – said the alternative would have been worse.</p><p>\"We are all extremely sorry about what has happened,\" said Pennycook. \"But there is a difference between today and June. In June, if we hadn't taken this action the bank was going to go bust … the impact on the wider group would have been disastrous.\"</p><p>Bondholders including 30,000 retail investors, largely pensioners, still need to back the deal, without which the bank fears it would fall under control of the Bank of England, or could be nationalised.</p><p>In an attempt to demonstrate commitment to the ethical stance the bank has been known for since 1992, the new bank will poll its customers in the spring about the businesses it should turn away on ethical grounds. Since 1992 it has turned away £1.2bn of business, including backing for arms shipments, coalmining and cleaning products tested on animals.</p><p>But Andre Spicer, a professor at Cass Business School, warned: \"With hedge funds at the wheel, the bank will become more ruthlessly commercial. Cutting 1,000 jobs at the same time as you launch an ethics policy is quite a contradiction.\"</p><p>The bank will be able to use the Co-operative name only if it keeps an ethical stance that will be overseen by an independent director who will chair an ethics and values committee. The bank said \"customer power\" would keep it ethical.</p><p>The Co-operative Group on Monday warned its brand could be  damaged by the bank continuing to use the Co-op name. The City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority and the business secretary, Vince Cable, can force the bank to change its name if the description is misleading.</p><p>The bank's constitution will be written from 15 November to force it to take account of the \"highest standards of ethical principles\" and being a \"good corporate citizen … contributing to building a stronger and sustainable society\".</p><p>It will not be able to pay dividends to shareholders unless it also considers its commitment to society and the environment. The group of hedge funds, advised by Caroline Silver of the Wall Street investment bank Moelis, and known as LT2, stressed that it was determined to maintain the ethical stance, which Silver described as a \"unique mission\".</p><p>The hedge funds will put in an extra £125m of capital in addition to their bonds. The secretive group admitted only  on Monday that it included Aurelius  – known for a long-running battle to force Argentina to pay out £800m – and Silver Point, linked to troubled financial firms such as Lehman Brothers. Others, including Beach Point Capital Management, Caspian Capital, Canyon Capital Advisors and Monarch Alternative Capital, then stepped forward.</p><p>Euan Sutherland, who arrived from B&amp;Q to run the Co-op in May, refused to criticise the hedge funds, describing them as \"very economically rational people\" who were investing in the bank because they believed it could become profitable again. He said the bank had lost its way over the previous five years, during which it had expanded rapidly, merging with the Britannia and then attempting the audacious but ill-fated takeover of more than 600 so-called Verde branches <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/24/coop-pulls-out-talks-buy-lloyds-bank-branches\" title=\"\">from Lloyds Banking Group, in a move that would have given the Co-op a 1,000-strong network</a>.</p><p>Under Niall Booker, who also joined in May, the bank's high-street presence will shrink. At least 15% of the 324 branches are to be shut, and £500m ploughed into investing in IT systems that previous management neglected.</p><p></p><p>Sutherland said it was his idea for Co-op Group would use £130m of the £462m it is pumping into the bank to issue new bonds to some 30,000 private investors who would otherwise have been wiped out.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421599156|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|d9f39eef28410054a94922c3e59fdcd17c1df79e -->",

        "body":"<p>The Serious Fraud Office has launched a formal criminal investigation into two of the government's biggest suppliers, G4S and Serco, following claims by the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, of tens of millions of pounds of overcharging on electronic tagging contracts for offenders.</p><p>Grayling asked the SFO to look into the billing allegations in July when he told MPs that an external audit had revealed that the overcharging included billing for tracking the movements of criminals who had moved abroad, who were back in prison, who had had their tags removed and even, in a few cases, those who had died.</p><p>The justice secretary said that in some cases the bills had continued to be presented years after active monitoring had stopped.</p><p>Whitehall sources have confirmed that the central allegation in the case revolves around charges for 3,000 phantom offenders. The justice ministry was being billed by the two companies for the tagging of 18,000 offenders a day under the &pound;700m contract when only 15,000 were actually being monitored.</p><p>G4S said it would co-operate with the investigation and had been notified by the SFO director, David Green, that it would cover &quot;the contract for the provision of electronic monitoring services which commenced in 2005 as amended and extended until the present day&quot;.</p><p>In July Grayling asked the SFO to look into the situation after G4S refused to co-operate with a justice ministry internal forensic audit to establish whether any dishonesty had taken place. The decision to refer Serco, which did co-operate with the MoJ audit, to the SFO was taken in September.</p><p>In July Serco said senior management had not been aware of the discrepancies but they did not believe anything dishonest had taken place. The company agreed with the MoJ that if the forensic audit showed dishonesty had taken place they would jointly call in the SFO.</p><p>The pattern of overcharging was revealed by a PricewaterhouseCoopers external audit commissioned by Grayling in May after billing discrepancies were discovered during the re-tendering process.</p><p>Under the contracts, more than 20,000 offenders are monitored on electronic tags at any one time. They are a key element in the criminal justice system's menu of community punishments as they are used to enforce curfews for prisoners on early release as well as some court orders.</p><p>In a small number of cases they have been used to track the movements of terror suspects and paedophiles. Last week prosecutions were halted against three terror suspects accused of tampering with their G4S-supplied GPS tags amid claims of faults with the tags and their straps.</p><p>The two companies are among the government's biggest suppliers. Both have already agreed to withdraw from bidding for the &pound;3bn next-generation tagging contract.</p><p>The Cabinet Office has also been reviewing the 28 contracts that the two companies currently hold with the government worth a total of &pound;9bn, including the management of the atomic weapons establishment at Aldermaston. Grayling has said that both companies can bid for contracts to run 70% of the probation service but will not be awarded them unless the SFO give them a clean bill of health.</p><p>Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, said the SFO decision was a major development. &quot;In July I wrote to the SFO calling on them to investigate claims against G4S and to act swiftly to secure any possible evidence that might be needed. I hope that the time taken to launch this investigation hasn't resulted in the loss of important evidence,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;With future Ministry of Justice contracts up for grabs, including more than &pound;600m of probation contracts, the government must act swiftly and bar G4S from bidding for any more until the SFO has concluded its investigation. By failing to do so, David Cameron risks undermining public confidence in our justice system.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421618253|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|91b053b26838896921efd78405999bf9d79adb4c -->",

        "body":"<p>The boss of Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has waived his bonus this year after admitting that the energy industry urgently needs to rebuild trust with consumers.</p><p>Sam Laidlaw, who was paid a total of nearly £5m last year including almost £1.5m in cash bonuses, said he understood the anger and frustration felt by many after bills rocketed by more than three times the rate of inflation in 2013.</p><p>Speaking at the CBI's annual conference in London, he said trust in the energy sector is at an \"all-time low\" and acknowledged an urgent need to rebuild it.</p><p>He said the reputation of the company and the industry had been damaged by the furore over rising bills and industry leaders needed to tackle the issue head on. But Centrica, which has almost 9 million UK customers of its British Gas subsidiary, was innocent of profiteering, he said, and was unable to subside retail prices from profits in other parts of the business.</p><p>He said Centrica's gas exploration business, which has been mentioned as a possible cash cow for the retail arm, lost £130m last year. Other parts of the organisation were also less profitable than critics imagined, while profit margins on worldwide sales were a modest 5.9%, he said. Laidlaw pledged to cut bills if the chancellor goes ahead in his autumn statement with plans to absorb the green levy into general taxation. He said British gas would cut bills by the amount of the levy if the rumoured change goes ahead.</p><p>Currently the green levy, which is used to subsidise the extra costs of generating electricity from renewable sources, is imposed on the larger energy providers, which pass on the bill to customers.</p><p>The commitment appeared to give a boost to proposals circulating inside the Treasury for an immediate cut in household bills by transferring the green levy to the government budget. Officials had feared that energy companies would absorb the cut and boost profits rather than pass on the benefit to customers.</p><p>Laidlaw said there was a need for leadership in the current environment, though a decision to deny bonuses needed to be balanced with being able to attract employees.</p><p>\"Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it.\"</p><p>Laidlaw said the energy industry was \"in the eye of the storm\", conceding that firms should be more transparent, explain how bills are made up and improve the process of switching suppliers.</p><p>Laidlaw said he was focused on helping customers struggling to pay bills this winter. More than half a million British Gas customers will receive a special discount of £60, on top of a £135 warm home discount, he said.</p><p>Laidlaw said his company had reduced its costs by £300m over the past few years, and would immediately pass on any reductions in the social and environmental part of energy bills. \"We are listening – we get it, absolutely. We know there is a problem.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421630833|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|76192004ff2c765cec9e497ebb223e2ea0f92144 -->",

        "headline":"Twitter claims $13.6bn market valuation as tech rivals take aim",
        "body":"<p>Twitter, after canvassing professional investors for a week on how much they would be willing to pay for its shares, raised the asking price of its stock by 25% on Monday.</p> <p>The company said it would value its IPO at between $23 and $25 a share, up from the&nbsp;$17 to $20 range, indicating that it was a popular potential investment. Traditionally, however, the banks advising companies on their public debuts start out with a modest asking price, in the hopes that investors will prove willing to pay more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter also stopped selling its shares a day early, according to a news report by Reuters. It's common for companies to keep order books open for investors until the day before the IPO, but Twitter plans to close the books on Tuesday at noon, Reuters said. In the traditional signals of Wall Street, that move could be interpreted in two ways: it could indicate either high demand for the shares or that investors are tapped out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter, which plans to list its shares for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, can now claim a market value of $13.6bn before its shares have even started trading. The company could raise as much as $1.4bn in the offering.&nbsp;</p> <p>MKM Partners, a research firm for professional investors, said Twitter will be in the competitive \"elite\" of tech companies by its market value.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"We look at a [comparison] group including Facebook, LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Yelp and Zillow,\" MKM analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a client note late last week. \"These companies are regarded as 'category killers', each with very strong operating momentum, disruptive characteristics and open-ended opportunities.\"</p> <p>That doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing ahead, however. Twitter is facing business challenges from rivals as well as skepticism from investors burned by the Facebook IPO.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter is not seen as a good investment by nearly half of active investors, according to<a href=\"http://marketingland.com/poll-public-skeptical-about-twitter-ipo-63942\"> a new CNBC-AP poll out Monday</a>.</p> <p>\"That sentiment is stronger from higher-income respondents; some 56% of those with incomes of $75,000 a year have doubts about its investment prospects,\" <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101165620\">CNBC wrote</a>.</p> <p>In addition, as Twitter's profile rises, rivals are taking aim at its business prospects. \"We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow,\" the company said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter revealed on Monday, for instance, that <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312513424297/d564001dfwp.htm\">tech giant IBM has claimed that Twitter has violated three of its patents</a>. The patents involve the presentation of advertising and the process of searching for user contacts.&nbsp;</p> <p>By striking at Twitter's advertising plans, IBM is striking at the company's heart. Twitter gained&nbsp;85% of its revenue from advertising in 2012, and an even higher percentage &ndash; 89% &ndash; in the first nine months of this year. \"We generate substantially all of our advertising revenue through the sale of our three promoted products: promoted Tweets, promoted accounts and promoted trends.\"</p> <p>Twitter said IBM was not suing, however, and only inviting a negotiation. In its public filing, Twitter said \"we believe we have meritorious defenses,\" although it also said \"there can be no assurance that we will be successful\" in resolving the dispute.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421639031|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|5da1f27d91cd822a13b88488594c4ae355341a47 -->",

        "headline":"SAC Capital agrees to plead guilty to insider trading charges",
        "body":"<p>SAC Capital has become the first hedge fund to plead guilty to insider trading after an extensive six-year dragnet by government regulators, who issued a warning to future \"Gordon Gekkos\" and imposed fines that totalled $1.8bn.</p> <p>\"No institution should rest in the belief that is too big to jail,\" said Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York. \"That is a moral hazard.\"</p> <p>April Brooks, who heads the New York field office of the FBI, said the proposed settlement should act as a warning to \"those who venerate Gordon Gekko\", referring to the Machiavellian capitalist in the 1987 movie Wall Street who popularized the phrase \"greed is good\".&nbsp;</p> <p>SAC has agreed to a passel of penalties, which follow a July indictment by Bharara's office. It must pay a&nbsp;$900m fine and forfeit another $900m to the federal government, though $616m that SAC companies have already agreed to pay to settle parallel actions by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be deducted from the $1.8bn.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most of the money will come from founder&nbsp;Steven A Cohen rather than outside investors. Bharara said the fine would not be tax-deductible.</p> <p>Anyone working at SAC currently will also have to face obstacles to their futures. No one at the firm, even those who co-operated, will have immunity from further prosecution, Bharara said.</p> <p>SAC also agreed to accept a five-year probation period &ndash; in which any employee seeking to start a new investing business would require government permission &ndash; and agreed to shut down its advisory business, which accepts money from outside investors.&nbsp;</p> <p>The agreement still has to be approved by a judge, officials said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The move isolates SAC, which once reigned at the center of the hedge-fund world and whose founder was listed by Forbes as being worth $8.8bn. \"SAC will no longer be able to invest anyone's money but their own,\" said Brooks.</p> <p>Brooks quoted the July indictment, which called the insider trading at SAC \"substantial, pervasive and on a scale without known precedent\", adding that \"it was nothing short of institutional failure\".&nbsp;</p> <p>She also indicated that government regulators, including the Department of Justice, FBI and the SEC, plan to use SAC as a lesson to other fund managers. Brooks said officials will \"relentlessly pursue\" insider traders. \"How your employees make their money is just as important as how much they make,\" she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a statement, FBI assistant director George Venizelos said SAC Capital's plea demonstrates \"that cheating and breaking the law were not only permitted but allowed to persist\".</p> <p>In the July indictment, prosecutors said evidence against SAC was \"voluminous\" and included electronic messages, instant messages, court-ordered wiretaps and consensual recordings.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prosecutors said a work culture at SAC permitted, if not encouraged, insider trading. Authorities alleged that SAC Capital earned hundreds of millions of dollars illegally from 1999 to 2010 as its portfolio managers and analysts traded on inside information from at least 20 public companies. Bharara in July said SAC Capital \"trafficked in inside information on a scale without any known precedent in the history of hedge funds&rdquo;.</p> <p>Of the roughly $15bn in assets that SAC managed as of earlier this year, about half belonged to Cohen and his employees. The rest was client money.</p> <p>Cohen was not named as a defendant in the case. He was repeatedly referenced in court papers at the \"SACowner\" who \"enabled and promoted\" insider trading practices.</p> <p>In a separate case, the SEC is pursuing Cohen, SAC's founder, in an attempt to ban him from the securities industry for failing to prevent insider trading at the company, which he founded in 1992. Cohen has disputed the SEC's allegations. That case remains unresolved.</p> <p>As part of the deal announced Monday, prosecutors said they will not assert claims for financial recovery against any present owner or shareholder of the SAC defendants for insider trading on behalf of the SAC up to 21 December last year, except for criminal fines or forfeiture claims related to insider trading profits or avoided losses. The agreement also reserved the right of prosecutors to charge others criminally.</p> <p>Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business who studies corporate reputation, said the settlement, despite its size and impact, would likely not serve as a deterrent to others who might be pondering insider trading.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Think about how many people didn't get fined today that should have,\" Argenti said. \"Think about how many companies have done things like this before, over a long period of time. When I track how people think of reputation in the financial sector and business, it's never been worse. Trust in business is at an all-time low. People look at this and say, 'Look at this. They made tons of money and now we know how.'\"</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421649512|2013-11-05T16:07:02Z|76f462cdfb6ce7731fbc76a449c1216094efb09c -->",
