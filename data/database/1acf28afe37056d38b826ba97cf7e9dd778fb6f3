        "body":"<p>I wonder if any of the 260 complaints about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/29/lady-gaga-x-factor-itv-complaints-watershed\" title=\"\">Lady Gaga's performance on The&nbsp;X&nbsp;Factor</a> were about the death of the avant garde, because that's mine. If this doesn't get me in Pseuds Corner, nothing will. Indeed, other female performers have garnered more complaints, so if Gaga is working overtime to shock us, it just isn't happening. We are familiar with the panto of The X Factor and with Gaga's turns. We expect her to look bonkers, cram in a ADHD medley and probably get naked. The soundtrack/product that comes with it is pedestrian, but her USP is that she doesn't have to&nbsp;look pretty all the time.</p><p>Of course her hint of freakshow fits in perfectly with a good old-fashioned variety show. It's all very postmodern, for although she may reference Andy Warhol as easily as she references <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/27/miley-cyrus-twerking-cultural-appropriation\" title=\"\">Miley Cyrus's flesh-coloured bikini</a>, she can be incorporated into primetime TV. Gaga is deemed suitable for \"a family show\". The promise of subversion is brought into the arena of light entertainment and demands little more than that we applaud the&nbsp;spectacle.</p><p>To demand a bit more from the audience, that they work it out, even stay with it, is not where it's at. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/28/neil-gaiman-lou-reed-sandman\" title=\"\">When Lou Reed died</a>, I watched some Warhol movies on YouTube and one wishes Warhol were still alive to see the comments. The YouTube generation are baffled by Warhol. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eChaxl-9pvg\" title=\"\">A film of the artist eating a hamburger</a> is exactly that. \"WTF? Is this it?\" they demand, short-changed. \"Is that all there is?\" Sometimes.</p><p>Reed's death has hit my generation because his presence anchored us into a time and a place when the avant garde was still meaningful. He was a touchstone of what it means to be modern, a significant and uncompromising artist whose works challenge social and artistic values. The Velvet Underground could have been formed at any time since 1966. They still sound utterly new. His death made us remember the music that made us want to leave our small towns and our small lives, a time when transgression was not simply a marketing technique.</p><p>The insane focus on whether he was nice or not seems misplaced, an attempt to jerk him back into the comfort zone. His music took us to dark places and we wanted to go. \"Here is a song about taking heroin that is just like taking heroin,\" we wisely told each other on the bus in our school uniforms. \"Here is a song about changing sex,\" we nodded wisely. He was not our mirror at all, but rather our compass. Now we have lost our bearings.</p><p>He did not need to explain himself in interviews, the work is there, already divided into the listenable/hits and the unlistenable/difficult. But here was a man whose cultural value far exceeded his commercial value.</p><p>There is not much of this any more. Marketing is now part of what artists do. They \"play\" with the market; their lifestyles and rebellions key into the corporate world. Art about art, art about money and value is now familiar. It was easy enough to walk around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/02/damien-hirst-tate-review\" title=\"\">Damien Hirst's big retrospective</a> and see precisely the point at which the money becomes both subject and object.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00729d9\" title=\"\">Grayson Perry's Reith Lectures</a> have been poking at this can of worms, with Perry himself the most slippery of worms, wriggling between the roles of establishment insider and snarky outsider. He says we are at the end point, where the avant garde no longer exists. Rather, he evokes a horizontal, flattened-out globalised art world. Here sincerity is but one tactic, shock another. Innovation is more likely to come from technology than anything that artists are doing. Artists, he explains, operate as the shock troops of gentrification, moving into an area and clearing a path for developers. The web, he argues, echoes Joseph Beuys' famous statement: \"Everyone can be an artist.\" Perry's view of art history is not one \"ism\" replacing another. Rather, we are living with all of this in the present. It is almost as if postmodernism has finished off the avant garde completely.</p><p>The jolt of Reed's death is to do with this. Lou Reed was avant garde precisely because he came out of modernism, because he changes for ever how things look and how they sound. A lodestar. His loss resonates because we can vaguely recall a time when not everything had been subsumed by the market.</p><p>So we are remembering his songs as if we heard them for the first time. Actually it's fitting. No one who ever heard the Velvet Underground could unhear them.</p><p>Watching Gaga writhe on the neuro-disco is a daft parody of Walk on the Wild Side. Amusement. Art does not have to be about transgression, it can be about anything â€“ of course, it can. But look at us mourn the time when it felt that way; this loss is immense. As Robert Hughes said in the 80s in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jun/30/art1\" title=\"\">The Shock of the New</a>: \"What does one prefer? An art that struggles to change the social contract but fails? Or one that seeks to please and amuse and succeeds?\"</p><p>You can answer that by pressing the red button on any remote.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421297945|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|104e474751593fad6da773013fe963573c3e465d -->",

        "body":"<h2>Givenchy and Marina Abramovic</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420660561\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/22/1382452087278/Marina-Abramovic-with-Ric-009.jpg\" alt=\"Marina Abramovic with Riccardo Tisci\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Riccardo Tisci, artistic director of Givenchy, with his muse Marina Abramovic. Photograph: Jamie Mccarthy/WireImage</figcaption></figure><p>When Jay-Z staged the Picasso Baby gallery setup for his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMG2oNqBy-Y\" title=\"\">&quot;performance art film&quot;</a> (aka video) back in August, Marina Abramovic was one of the first through the door. The 66-year-old performance artist is a favourite of fashion's power players â€“ and it's nothing to do with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JvdsNpkMcU\" title=\"\">the episode of Sex and the City</a> she inspired or, if we're honest, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/jul/31/jonathan-jones-blog-marina-abramovic\" title=\"\">any of her art</a>. Abramovic is one of Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci's muses and regularly wears his clothes accessorised with red lipstick and a long plait in a rather fabulous way. And that's something fashion â€“ and art-inclined hip-hop â€“ can appreciate.</p><h2>Chanel at Frieze</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420660562\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2013/10/17/1382023763875/Chanel-at-Frieze.-Picture-001.jpg\" alt=\"Chanel at Frieze. Pictured Nuria Menuyo\" width=\"460\" height=\"414\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Chanel at Frieze: the quilted shoulderbag was the style of choice. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p> October's Frieze is now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/oct/18/frieze-art-fair-2013-mens-womens-fashion\" title=\"\">firmly marked on fashion's annual calendar</a>, with the art world's style a great tonic after four weeks of front rows eyeing up each other's outfits. There's one element that these two groups no doubt have in common â€“ a penchant for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/oct/17/chanel-bags-london-art-fair-frieze\" title=\"\">Chanel's classic 2.55 handbag</a>. At this year's Frieze, the quilted, chained shoulderbag was the style of choice in an environment where designer accessories come as standard. While the shoulderbag is currently beta in fashion circles (see the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/sep/21/milan-fashion-week-clutch-bags\" title=\"\">oversized clutch</a>), the art crowd feel differently. With Karl Lagerfeld delving into art as inspiration for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2013/oct/01/chanel-paris-fashion-week-karl-lagerfeld\" title=\"\">Chanel's spring collection</a>, maybe they're on to something.</p><h2>David Hockney and Burberry</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420660563\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/22/1382452438437/The-Hockney-look-on-the-B-001.jpg\" alt=\"The Hockney look on the Burberry catwalk\" width=\"460\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>The Hockney look on the Burberry catwalk. Photograph: Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p> Every man can learn a lot by looking at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jan/23/david-hockney-my-style-hero\" title=\"\">David Hockney's wardrobe</a>. The tousled blond hair. The owlish glasses. The hint of a dandy in primary-coloured tailoring. The Yorkshireman has long been held in esteem by fashion. Burberry's Christopher Bailey is a fan â€“ referencing the artist in collections dating back to 2005. The brand's most recent collection had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/18/burberry-london-return-british-menswear\" title=\"\">those brights mixed with cosy sweaters</a> â€“ a very Hockney outfit indeed. A notable mention here must also go to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol</a> â€“ Hockney's rival for the Most Fashionable Male Artist award. His fright wig, skinny black trousers and Breton top add up to what we call a Strong Look.</p><h2>Prada and the street artists</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420660564\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/22/1382452560510/Pradas-street-art-designs-001.jpg\" alt=\"Prada\" s=\"\" street-art=\"\" designs=\"\" for=\"\" 2014.'=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Prada's street-art designs for SS14. Photograph: Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>If Prada always namechecks real women â€“ the stronger the better â€“ the Italian brand's spring collection also delved into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/sep/19/milan-fashion-week-prada-irreverent-catwalk-timescales\" title=\"\">the world of street art</a>. The label commissioned six young artists, whose work appeared on the walls of the show venue but also over vibrant dresses, coats and bags, sometimes with jewelled panels and always with striped legwarmers. The result? A kind of hybrid of investment pieces â€“ bonding this season's &quot;it&quot; designs with what is effectively limited-edition artwork. This is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/feb/17/miuccia-prada-first-lady-european-fashion\" title=\"\">a very Prada conceit</a> â€“ and one that will no doubt appeal to the strong women who wear the designer's clothes.</p><h2>Linder Sterling and Richard Nicoll</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420660565\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/22/1382452774691/Richard-Nicoll-catwalk-001.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Nicoll catwalk\" width=\"460\" height=\"426\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>London designer Richard Nicoll is influenced by Linder Sterling's provocative take on pop art. Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The artist who made artwork for the sleeve of the Buzzcocks' 1977 single Orgasm Addict â€“ <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tateshots-linder-sterling\" title=\"\">a naked woman with an iron for a head</a> â€“ might not sound like the obvious candidate for a fashion collaboration but she has been partnering with London designer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/09/room-own-richard-nicoll-designer since 2009\" title=\"\">Richard Nicoll</a> since 2009. It works. Linder's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/02/linder-sterling-photomontage\" title=\"\">provocative take on pop art</a> â€“ collaging everything from 60s pornography to household appliances and flowers â€“ brings an edgy kind of femininity that stands out from your average ditsy floral. A unisex line, S/He, is in the works, while the latest print features a mod-ish girl overlayed with a chrome tap. Sounds weird, looks great.</p><h2>Art and pop</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420660566\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/8/1381241347812/Lady-Gaga-Artpop-album-co-011.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Gaga Artpop album cover by Jeff Koons\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Lady Gaga's Artpop album cover by Jeff Koons</figcaption></figure><p>While Miley Cyrus is busy redefining sleaze with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2013/oct/07/terry-richardson-photographs-naked-miley-cyrus\" title=\"\">photographer Terry Richardson</a>, other pop stars are forming brand-positioning alliances of their own, by paying artists lots of money to work with them. Katy Perry â€“ usually more associated with hangover-inducing E-number brights â€“ has wheeled in Ryan McGinley to shoot the cover of her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/katy-perry-prism-review\" title=\"\">new album, Prism</a>, and it has all the hazy romance of the photographer's work. Lady Gaga â€“ not familiar with the idea of &quot;over-the-top&quot; â€“ has tapped the like-minded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2013/oct/07/terry-richardson-photographs-naked-miley-cyrus\" title=\"\">Jeff Koons, who made a sculpture of her for the cover of her upcoming ARTPOP</a>. Arguably, it's a match made in heaven.</p><h2>Marc Jacobs and contemporary art</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420660567\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/22/1382453062463/Models-present-creation-b-001.jpg\" alt=\"Models present creation by US designer M\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton: based on Richard Prince's Nurses series of paintings. Photograph: Pierre Verdy/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2013/oct/02/marc-jacobs-louis-vuitton-paris-fashion-week\" title=\"\">Leaving Louis Vuitton after 16 years</a> will allow Marc Jacobs to concentrate on his own label â€“ and bolster his already <a href=\"http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/marc-jacobs-paris-aparment-w-m-49631\" title=\"\">significant art collection</a>. He is the proud owner of works by Richard Prince, Ed Ruscha, Damien Hirst and John Currin, and has also been a pioneer when it comes to working with artists for his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2013/oct/02/marc-jacobs-louis-vuitton-top-10-moments\" title=\"\">clothing collections</a>. Stephen Sprouse, Takashi Murakami and Yayoi Kusama have been among his collaborators and spring 2008's Louis Vuitton collection was based on Prince's Nurses series. In Jacobs' world, art and fashion are BFFs already.</p><h2>J Crew and studio chic</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420660568\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/22/1382453191467/J-Crew-splattered-trouser-001.jpg\" alt=\"J Crew splattered trousers\" width=\"460\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>J Crew pays homage to painters with its splattered trousers.</figcaption></figure><p>Fashion's current preoccupation with art is effectively the death knell of the minimalist look â€“ most art (Donald Judd and his ilk aside) is about getting messy. This new abandon is evident even at C&eacute;line â€“ once home of no-spillage minimalism â€“ where paint swooshes filled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/sep/29/celine-paris-fashion-phoebe-philo\" title=\"\">the spring collection</a>. While a <a href=\"http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/news/marion-cotillard-gets-arty-in-latest-lady-dior-campaign\" title=\"\">Dior campaign out now</a> features the very-refined Marion Cotillard contrasted against drips of paint on a wall, the paint splatter of an artist's studio clothes is set to become the motif of 2014. As well as C&eacute;line, a pair of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/sep/10/new-york-fashion-week-j-crew-spring-summer-2014\" title=\"\">splattered trousers in the J Crew collection</a> already have a buzz about them and Martin Margiela has a pair of very smart brogues covered in paint. Messy, but pleasingly so.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420640042|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|494267ee202c5ede044f91606da7890487053a4c -->",

        "trailText":"<p><strong>Michael Cragg:</strong> Gaga's new Jeff Koons-designed cover suggests she's the first singer to be influenced by both Botticelli and Geri Halliwell</p>",
        "headline":"Lady Gaga: five things we can learn from her Artpop album cover",
        "body":"<p>As you well know, Lady Gaga's new album, Artpop, isn't merely a collection of hummable pop songs encased in a CD, or preloaded on to a downloadable interface. It is, instead, a &quot;reverse Warholian expedition&quot; that aims to blur the lines between art and pop, and pop and art in a way not seen since she tried to do it on all of her previous albums. Yesterday she unveiled the Jeff Koons-created artwork for the album <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/387268351224844288/photo/1\" title=\"\">via a Twitter hashtag</a> and a worldwide simultaneous live-stream thing, but what is she trying to tell us? Let's put our glasses on and have a look, shall we?</p><h2>1. She's learned from the Born This Way debacle</h2><p>Lady Gaga's head crudely plonked on the front of a motorbike was not what the world needed, and yet that's exactly what we got with <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Born_This_Way.jpg\" title=\"\">2011's Born This Way cover</a> â€“ an image so appallingly 80s-hair-metal and wildly out of step with the rest of the campaign's artwork that even her fans assumed it was some elaborate hoax sent to test them. Bright, bold and brilliantly ridiculous, Artpop looks like the sort of image that will jump out at you rather than make you want to blind yourself voluntarily.</p><h2>2. She's a fan of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus</h2><p>While your eye might not immediately be drawn to the album cover's background â€“ there is, after all, a large shiny blue ball resting between her legs â€“ it features elements of <a href=\"http://mmmnoodles.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/botticelli-birth-venus.jpg\" title=\"\">Botticelli's The Birth of Venus</a> crudely juxtaposed with a black-and-white image of what may or may not be Gaga's nose. Given that she recently spent the majority of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/02/lady-gaga-review-london-roundhouse\" title=\"\">her iTunes festival show</a> half-naked, her modesty covered only by some strategically placed shells, and with a wig of flowing brown locks piled on her head, it's clear that Gaga's latest muse is the goddess Venus. Perhaps she's trying to tell us that, like Venus, she is now a fully grown woman? Maybe it's a statement on how Gaga represents both the earthly goddess and the spiritual one? Or maybe she's just recasting well-known paintings in a pop setting to really hammer home this relationship between art and pop?</p><h2>3. Geri Halliwell is an unlikely influence</h2><p>Like all of us, Lady Gaga clearly struggles to forget the time Geri Halliwell â€“ emancipated from the Spice Girls â€“ opened the 2000 Brit awards with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XciZowQi74\" title=\"\">Bag It Up</a>. Unsure of how best to arrive on stage, the equally subtle and considered Halliwell waltzed out from between two giant spread-eagled legs. While Geri seemed to be suggesting a personal rebirth, on the cover of Artpop, Gaga's shown giving birth to a piece of art in the shape of a Jeff Koons shiny-blue beach ball. Fingers crossed they'll be available as part of her merchandise range next summer.</p><h2>4. 'One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me'</h2><p>This collaboration with Jeff Koons was foretold in Lady Gaga's recent single, Applause, and true to her word, she has quite literally become a Koons. According to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ladygaga/photos/a.89179709573.79898.10376464573/10151994535259574/?type=1\" title=\"\">a post on her Facebook page</a>, the centre image is a Koons sculpture that will be exhibited the day before the album's release as part of what she â€“ and no one else â€“ is calling artRAVE (it's the album launch party, basically). Now whenever we've had a party of any kind, we've always made sure the valuables are hidden away, but we're sure she knows what she's doing.</p><h2>5. She prefers to trust her instincts when it comes to the weight of her breasts</h2><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Weigh-Your-Breasts\" title=\"\">the wikiHow website</a>, the best way to weigh one's breasts is to first fill a bowl to the brim with warm water, then place said bowl on a baking tray and put them both on some scales. Once this is done, submerge one of your breasts into the bowl and do some sort of crazy-looking calculations to work it all out. For Gaga, a pop megastar with very little time on her hands, she can do it via some simple cupping exercises. If you look closely, that look of concentration is telling.</p><p>â€¢ <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2013/aug/26/lady-gaga-mtv-music-video-awards-video\">Video: Lady Gaga opens MTV video awards</a><br />â€¢ <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/graphic/2013/aug/23/lady-gaga-infomania\">Lady Gaga: all you need to know</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419364285|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|6d649e1020512e29254e8ff66d76e4aed70ee254 -->",

Do What U Want (feet R Kelly) appears on Gaga's album Artpop, due to be released on 11 November. After Artpop's lead single, Applause, was released, Gaga defended herself against those who said its failure to reach No 1 suggested she was on a downward slope. \"People focus less on the music and focus more on how the music's doing; how it's faring from a numbers perspective, from a financial perspective. If you think I give a damn about money then you don't know me as an artist at all,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/03/lady-gaga-people-think-im-finished\">she told the Guardian</a>. \"I think that once you've had a few No 1s in your career that you've kind of proven yourself and I don't feel the need to prove anything anymore.\"</p><p>Describing her new album, she said: \"\"For Artpop, I, in the most metaphorical explanation, stood in front of a mirror and I took off the wig and I took off the makeup and I unzipped the outfit and I put a black cap on my head and I covered my body in a black catsuit and I looked in the mirror and I said: 'OK, now you need to show them you can be brilliant without that.' And that's what Artop is all about. Because I knew that if I wanted to grow, if I really wanted to innovate from the inside, I had to do something that was almost impossible for me.\"</p><p>Let us know what you think of the new song in the comments below.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420519494|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|b96bec4fc6cfe0c88512ededa248d48f91ec6156 -->",

        "headline":"Lady Gaga ARTPOP album gets early UK debut on O2 Tracks",
        "body":"<p>Customers on O2's mobile network will get early access to Lady Gaga's new album ARTPOP, through a deal struck between the operator and label Polydor Records.</p><p>The album will be made available through the <a href=\"http://www.o2.co.uk/tracks\">O2 Tracks</a> music app from 5 November, six days before its official release date. It's part of a wider partnership that will see Gaga also appearing in a TV ad for O2.</p><p>It's a big coup for O2 Tracks, which was launched in February as a partnership between O2 and British startup MusicQubed. The Â£1-a-week app is available for Android, iPhone, Windows Phone and BlackBerry smartphones, and enables people to download each week's Top 40 singles chart to their handset.</p><p>News of the exclusive may come as a surprise to fans who were expecting ARTPOP to make its first appearance within Lady Gaga's own official app for the album, which was <a href=\"https://littlemonsters.com/text/5047d491ac460c3508001b8e\">first announced by the star in September 2012</a> as \"the most major way to fully immerse yourself in ARTPOP\".</p><p>In July, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/appsblog/2013/jul/12/lady-gaga-artpop-app-release-date\">post on Gaga's Facebook page</a> suggested that the app would be pre-orderable from 1 September alongside the album, although that launch date has slipped considerably for the ambitious project:</p><blockquote><p>\"Altering the human experience with social media, we bring ARTculture into POP in a reverse Warholian expedition.</p><p>Exploring Gaga's existence as a cultural interface, the user will share in the 'adrenaline of fame; as they build and share their own projects, chat with one another, and watch in real-time on a virtual globe as ARTPOP explodes onto the physical and virtual universe at once on November 11, our 'BIG BANG!' On this day, HAUS OF GAGA venges with forte to bring the music industry into a new age: an age where art drives pop, and the artist once again is in control of the 'icon'.\"</p></blockquote><p>In the UK at least, it seems that ARTPOP's big pre-release promotional push will be coming through a more traditional marketing deal with a mobile operator. O2 is describing the deal as \"exclusive\", which suggests the album won't also be available for pre-release stream on iTunes, Spotify or other digital music services â€“Â in the UK at least.</p><p>It's not exclusive to O2 customers though: O2 Tracks is available to all networks in the UK, although people on O2 get an eight-week free trial, versus two weeks for everyone else. ARTPOP is likely to spur a big wave of signups for the service, which <a href=\"http://news.o2.co.uk/?press-release=o2-emeli-sande-in-7m-o2-tracks-marketing-push\">O2 has already spent Â£7.3m marketing in 2013</a>.</p><p>In July, MusicQubed said that <a href=\"http://musically.com/2013/07/04/o2-tracks-app-has-attracted-more-than-500k-users/\">the app had signed up more than 500,000 users</a> in its first five months, who had averaged more than 55 minutes a day of listening each. The company didn't say how many had converted to paying subscribers once their free trials finished.</p><p>Lady Gaga is not the first big music star to make a new album available early to mobile customers. In June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/21/jay-z-samsung-charts-magna-carta\">Jay-Z struck a deal with Samsung</a> to give away 1m early copies of his Magna Carta Holy Grail album to fans who downloaded an Android app.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421096605|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|2593891252c526af4587f844a9f0fdd2f3c9ac13 -->",

        "headline":"Postmodernism killed the avant garde. Lady Gaga is no substitute for Lou Reed",
        "body":"<p>I wonder if any of the 260 complaints about&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/29/lady-gaga-x-factor-itv-complaints-watershed\" title=\"\">Lady Gaga's performance on The&nbsp;X&nbsp;Factor</a> were about the death of the avant garde, because that's mine. If this doesn't get me in Pseuds Corner, nothing will. Indeed, other female performers have garnered more complaints, so if Gaga is working overtime to shock us, it just isn't happening. We are familiar with the panto of The X Factor and with Gaga's turns. We expect her to look bonkers, cram in a ADHD medley and probably get naked. The soundtrack/product that comes with it is pedestrian, but her USP is that she doesn't have to&nbsp;look pretty all the time.</p><p>Of course her hint of freakshow fits in perfectly with a good old-fashioned variety show. It's all very postmodern, for although she may reference Andy Warhol as easily as she references <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/27/miley-cyrus-twerking-cultural-appropriation\" title=\"\">Miley Cyrus's flesh-coloured bikini</a>, she can be incorporated into primetime TV. Gaga is deemed suitable for \"a family show\". The promise of subversion is brought into the arena of light entertainment and demands little more than that we applaud the&nbsp;spectacle.</p><p>To demand a bit more from the audience, that they work it out, even stay with it, is not where it's at. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/28/neil-gaiman-lou-reed-sandman\" title=\"\">When Lou Reed died</a>, I watched some Warhol movies on YouTube and one wishes Warhol were still alive to see the comments. The YouTube generation are baffled by Warhol. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eChaxl-9pvg\" title=\"\">A film of the artist eating a hamburger</a> is exactly that. \"WTF? Is this it?\" they demand, short-changed. \"Is that all there is?\" Sometimes.</p><p>Reed's death has hit my generation because his presence anchored us into a time and a place when the avant garde was still meaningful. He was a touchstone of what it means to be modern, a significant and uncompromising artist whose works challenge social and artistic values. The Velvet Underground could have been formed at any time since 1966. They still sound utterly new. His death made us remember the music that made us want to leave our small towns and our small lives, a time when transgression was not simply a marketing technique.</p><p>The insane focus on whether he was nice or not seems misplaced, an attempt to jerk him back into the comfort zone. His music took us to dark places and we wanted to go. \"Here is a song about taking heroin that is just like taking heroin,\" we wisely told each other on the bus in our school uniforms. \"Here is a song about changing sex,\" we nodded wisely. He was not our mirror at all, but rather our compass. Now we have lost our bearings.</p><p>He did not need to explain himself in interviews, the work is there, already divided into the listenable/hits and the unlistenable/difficult. But here was a man whose cultural value far exceeded his commercial value.</p><p>There is not much of this any more. Marketing is now part of what artists do. They \"play\" with the market; their lifestyles and rebellions key into the corporate world. Art about art, art about money and value is now familiar. It was easy enough to walk around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/02/damien-hirst-tate-review\" title=\"\">Damien Hirst's big retrospective</a> and see precisely the point at which the money becomes both subject and object.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00729d9\" title=\"\">Grayson Perry's Reith Lectures</a> have been poking at this can of worms, with Perry himself the most slippery of worms, wriggling between the roles of establishment insider and snarky outsider. He says we are at the end point, where the avant garde no longer exists. Rather, he evokes a horizontal, flattened-out globalised art world. Here sincerity is but one tactic, shock another. Innovation is more likely to come from technology than anything that artists are doing. Artists, he explains, operate as the shock troops of gentrification, moving into an area and clearing a path for developers. The web, he argues, echoes Joseph Beuys' famous statement: \"Everyone can be an artist.\" Perry's view of art history is not one \"ism\" replacing another. Rather, we are living with all of this in the present. It is almost as if postmodernism has finished off the avant garde completely.</p><p>The jolt of Reed's death is to do with this. Lou Reed was avant garde precisely because he came out of modernism, because he changes for ever how things look and how they sound. A lodestar. His loss resonates because we can vaguely recall a time when not everything had been subsumed by the market.</p><p>So we are remembering his songs as if we heard them for the first time. Actually it's fitting. No one who ever heard the Velvet Underground could unhear them.</p><p>Watching Gaga writhe on the neuro-disco is a daft parody of Walk on the Wild Side. Amusement. Art does not have to be about transgression, it can be about anything â€“ of course, it can. But look at us mourn the time when it felt that way; this loss is immense. As Robert Hughes said in the 80s in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jun/30/art1\" title=\"\">The Shock of the New</a>: \"What does one prefer? An art that struggles to change the social contract but fails? Or one that seeks to please and amuse and succeeds?\"</p><p>You can answer that by pressing the red button on any remote.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421297945|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|104e474751593fad6da773013fe963573c3e465d -->",
