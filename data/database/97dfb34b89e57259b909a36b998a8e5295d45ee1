        "body":"<p>A few months ago, a friend of mine got married. To do this, she moved to London from Germany, leaving behind her friends, her family – and her job. She wasn't too worried about this: she'd built up more than a decade of experience and achievements. She could speak perfect English. She'd miss her family but financially, she'd be fine.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, London had other ideas. She went to interview after interview. They all ended in rejection.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she went to an interview where she was asked some odd questions. She was asked which part of London she lived in. She was asked what her husband did. And finally the interviewer just came out with it: \"Look, your husband is obviously doing quite well for himself, you've just got married, why do you even want a job?\"</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, that question contained the sexist (not to mention economically antiquated) idea that women just work for pin money. But it also hinted at another issue: the issue of babies. The issue of maternity leave. The issue of \"why should I hire you when you'll probably just end up costing me thousands of pounds in wasted pay a few months down the line?\"</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2013/11/04/government-launches-pregnancy-discrimination-investigation/\" title=\"\">European court of human rights has just been given £1m</a> by Maria Miller, the minister for women and equalities, to investigate just how bad this situation is. This follows on from a damning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/mar/09/women-on-maternity-leave-illegal-discrimation\" title=\"\">Slater &amp; Gordon poll</a> showing that many women were returning from maternity leave to worse jobs – or sometimes no job at all.</p><p></p><p>Research into this area is of course welcome. But I can't help but feel that we are ignoring the most obvious reason why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/04/review-pregnancy-discrimination-work\" title=\"\">women are discriminated against in this way</a>. The issue is at heart incredibly simple: it's about money.</p><p></p><p>Women from the age of 30 to 45 are viewed with suspicion and seen as a liability. They are a fecund cost waiting to happen. So why, these companies think, should we take the risk on this well-qualified woman, when we can place a safe bet on this man. He might not be as effective at the job, but at least he'll be around in six months' time. And so the cycle continues, with brilliant women floundering in their careers, overtaken by men not as a result of merit, but as a result of a shrewd cost decision. And perhaps the most irritating thing about this cycle is how easy it is to fix.</p><p></p><p>It is currently enshrined in law that women are the primary care-givers. Women get 26 weeks of ordinary maternity leave, and 26 weeks of additional maternity leave. Men get one or two weeks of ordinary paternity leave, and 26 weeks of additional paternity leave. There is no reason for this disparity, beyond a traditional notion that women are somehow more innately qualified than men to bring up children.</p><p></p><p>It's great that the government is finally sitting up and taking notice of this problem. It's great that it is seeing that legislating against discrimination doesn't mean that it stops. But what we need to see now is some action to change that. And splitting leave equally between the two parents of a child is the obvious and equitable way to do that.</p><p>Until men are seen as equally likely to take time off because of the child that they have brought into the world, this kind of covert, wink-wink discrimination will continue – and it will continue to affect women who don't intend to or can't have children, as much as those who do. If a company can't know either way, it is going to take the safer bet. And that bet is going to result in more women like my friend, who is still looking for a job, and still not finding one. I'm starting to wonder if she ever will.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421683067|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|c7161441d2240a7c72d2f5b34ec4aee091e7d2f7 -->",

        "body":"<p>The co-operative movement, started by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/27/co-operative-group-retail\" title=\"\">Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers</a> in the 19th century is fascinating in terms of social history. The Rochdale pioneers were a collective of weavers who developed a set of ethical principles which formed the basis for their first co-operative and for the modern movement. These included democratic member-control of the co-operative, which was to be community oriented, in other words, a social enterprise. Membership was open to all, without fear of discrimination in terms of race, religion, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation or disability.</p><p></p><p>Today, it is easy to dismiss the movement as having little relevance. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/co-op-group-rescue-activist-hedge-funds\" title=\"\">takeover of the Co-operative Group's banking arm</a>, with 70% of ownership now in the hands of City investors, appears to have fatally undermined the movement's principles. Is the Co-op Bank even worth saving?</p><p></p><p>Put aside first the dismissive argument that the Co-op Bank was mismanaged and therefore does not deserve to be supported. It is easy to say this <em>in vacuo</em>, but saying it to the 12,000 retail bondholders, the 1,000 people who could lose their jobs, the even larger number who have accounts with the bank, who believe in the co-operative movement and feel disappointed and let down by events, becomes more difficult. The fact is that there is a difference between cherishing a set of values and principles and practical action. We can argue vehemently for both adhering to the founding principles and for a management that can be held to account while implementing them.</p><p></p><p>We need also to look back to the 1980s to understand how mutualisation was undermined and fell out of favour through the privatisation of the building societies. The windfall that members enjoyed at the time seemed so worthwhile; a few hundred pounds each to put towards a new lounge carpet or whatever.</p><p></p><p>Now, the readiness with which we junked the mutual societies seems to be coming back to bite us. The private banking system has let us down badly; the absence of any ethical principles to underpin that system has resulted in mayhem; and a bailout of our main high street banks of an order that borders on incomprehensible. With so few mutualised societies left, people have fewer places to turn to place their hard-earned cash. So what we need is a return to mutualisation. And for this reason alone the Co-operative Bank is worth saving.</p><p></p><p>Circumstances have not changed that markedly since the founding of the Co-operative retail stores and bank. Indeed, we have been reminded recently of the abject poverty that many have fallen into, needing to use food banks or choose between \"eating and heating\" and the need for charitable institutions to step forward and help the needy. Other aspects of the social fabric are of concern. People feel they are having to choose between supporting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/ed-davey-green-levy-energy\" title=\"\">green energy policies </a>and paying the fuel bills.</p><p>In a civilised, developed society everyone should be able to eat well, heat their homes and support policies that protect the environment to ensure our long-term wellbeing and future happiness. One way to do that would be to support a financial sector that includes mutualised institutions underpinned by ethical principles similar to those cherished by the Rochdale pioneers. They may not be exciting but banking with community-based, socially oriented institutions would surely enable people to sleep more soundly at night.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421647722|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|c8c418b46f99ae5647ffd636fa46b73754ef3635 -->",

Bloomingdale's department store <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2486933/Wardrobing-sneaky-way-girl-stay-stylish-Growing-numbers-women-buying-clothes-wear-taking-refund.html\" title=\"\">takes a dim view of the practice</a>, and has marked its merchandise with big black tags that you have to leave on in order to get a refund, meaning you can attend the gala dinner in a Cavalli cocktail dress that you intend to take back the next day, as long as you don't mind looking like you arrived Santa-style, by climbing down a sooty chimney.</p><p>Big stores lose out when we return clothes, but everyone else wins. It depends on the returner, and the garment – you'd hope that no one would be so vulgar as to attend a hot yoga class in their new Spandex unitard and then demand a refund on their purchase. But as long as the wearer has remembered their deodorant and been careful with their cigarettes, I don't mind the idea of buying a dress that's already had a few gratis nights out. After all, we love vintage clothes because they have a history and a story. Returned clothes could have great stories too, it's just they're more likely to end with a trip to Chicken Cottage.</p><p>It's possible to rent occasion wear from some outfitters, but if stores feel \"wardrobing\" is a serious problem, they need to get in on the act. Chain stories could consider introducing a clothes library, where a garment can be rented for a reduced fee, which covers storage and cleaning costs. If nothing else, it would make a sizeable dent in the scary pile of man-made fabrics that end up in landfill every year.</p><p>For women, fashion consumerism is a game they can't win. In one light, we're flibbertigibbets, unable to focus our minds on serious issues like sport, because our heads are full of sparkles and chiffon. If we find joy in fashion, we're thought to be frivolous and simple, even though this is an industry that generates thousands of jobs and billions of pounds, attracting artistic visionaries and smart entrepreneurs.</p><p>However, we can't escape fashion. Everywhere we turn, we're being told to look different, to look better, to have the right outfit for every mood and occasion. If you ever have to go out, be seen in public and talk to people, I am certain there will have been at least one occasion in your life when it became a tearful and traumatic experience because you felt you looked wrong. We're judged by our peers and our families, and now on Facebook and Instagram. People you haven't seen since school can berate you for recycling a bridesmaid's dress and wearing it to a christening. Of course we fantasise about finding the outfits that fill us with joy, that make us feel like our very best selves, as if we could tap dance down the Left Bank and solve mysteries and build bridges and make brioche, while being simultaneously sexy, clever, cool and insouciant. But most women, shopping is not a source of joy. Forget the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQQK0VTTXvA\" title=\"\">\"Big mistake! Huge!\"</a> scene in the film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81528/pretty-woman\" title=\"\">Pretty Woman</a>. In reality it's more like a mash up of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89034/battle.royale\" title=\"\">Battle Royale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36325/scum\" title=\"\">Scum</a> and the bit in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/70550/men-in-black\" title=\"\">Men In Black</a> where the man is slowly revealed to be a big greasy alien.</p><p>If wardrobing was legitimised and formalised, shopping would not lead to alarming amounts of waste and even more alarming levels of debt. We would have the time to work out whether we were comfortable in a garment and whether it made us happy. Shopping wouldn't be such a stressful, expensive risk. It might even become as much fun as the movies suggest. If we could try more and buy less, we'd end up with so many items we truly loved that it would curb our desire for a pointless purchase just because it's new. No matter how big the store is, returning worn items and lying to get a refund is definitely not OK. But it would be great if shops could recognise why this practice is so widely adopted, and meet us in the middle.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421632571|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|0b413fc97101fc58d11993fe0acfec74e6c4f24a -->",

        "headline":"Judges can sidestep religion, but they can't avoid morality",
        "body":"<p>Sir James Munby <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Speeches/law-morality-religion-munby-2013.pdf\" title=\"\">gave a speech</a> last week saying that judges no longer concerned themselves with the promotion of virtue and the discouragement of immorality – and nor should they: Britain is now a secular society, he said, and religion has no special privilege beyond what it is granted by human rights legislation. This was widely reported as claiming that the law no longer has any business enforcing morality. I have now read his speech carefully and I am not at all certain that this is what he said – and if it's what he meant he is clearly wrong and his own speech proves it. Judges, he thinks, are very much in the business of enforcing morality, and so they ought to be. The confusion, and it's a very important one, arises from supposing that morality now means what it meant in respectable circles 100 years ago – a form of 19th-century Protestantism.</p><p>Much of his argument is wonderfully clear and, more importantly, right. Within living memory many influential judges did assume that morality was largely concerned with sexuality and the application of biblical standards of patriarchy in so far as this was possible. All this has gone. \"Judges are no longer <a href=\"http://thelawdictionary.org/custos-morum/\" title=\"\"><em>custos morum</em></a> of the people, and if they are they have to take the people's customs as they find them, not as they or others might wish them to be,\" said Munby.</p><p>\"And if they are\" – that's where the argument shifts, because, as will become apparent, he does believe judges are the custodians of morality to some extent. I suspect that any other view is incoherent, or at least wicked. The burden of his talk is an attack on religious privilege. It seems odd to suppose that this must also be an attack on morality.</p><p>For Munby's claims about what has replaced morality are themselves profoundly moral ones. They have to be. Look at his praise of tolerance.</p><p>He wants to live in \"a tolerant society, increasingly alive to the need to guard against the tyranny which majority opinion may impose on those who, for whatever reason, comprise a small, weak, unpopular or voiceless minority\".</p><p>This seems to me an entirely and unavoidably moral desire. What justification is there for not imposing our views on a small, weak, unpopular or voiceless minority? You can't answer the question without using moral concepts. What amoral reason could there be not to impose our views on the minority? Only that we might fail in the attempt and that's not often a serious danger.</p><p>Similarly, his argument against privileging religion is not based on the idea that we can sidestep morality, but on the belief that our idea of morality is better and truer than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/mar/06/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Lord Denning</a>'s was in 1957. Munby said that \"Reliance upon religious belief, however conscientious the belief and however ancient and respectable the religion, can never of itself immunise the believer from the reach of the secular law.\" I don't think many people would disagree with this – I certainly wouldn't. But the question then becomes how to draw the line, and the answer most certainly involves moral judgment and reasoning, as he goes on to recognise.</p><p>\"Where precisely the limits are to be drawn is often a matter of controversy. There is no 'bright-line' test that the law can set. The infinite variety of the human condition precludes arbitrary definition.\"</p><p>Even when Munby has recourse to European human rights law, he remains enmeshed in the problem: he points out that the <a href=\"http://human-rights-convention.org/the-texts/simplified-convention/\" title=\"\">European Convention on Human Rights</a> \"forbids the state to determine the validity of religious beliefs\" but that prohibition depends on a very narrow definition of validity and religious beliefs. What he means, clearly, is that the state has no business with the truth claims of religious mythologies: the state should have no opinion on whether Jesus rose from the dead, or if Muhammad really heard the angel Gabriel. But in other respects the convention positively demands that we determine the validity of religious beliefs. Are they, for instance, \"worthy of respect in a democratic society\"? Are they \"compatible with human dignity\"? These, again, are moral judgments, which society cannot avoid and should not try to.</p><p>Munby's easy acceptance that morality means what Lord Denning thought it did abandons a very necessary battlefield and hands victory there either to religious conservatives who claim that morality must have a supernatural sanction, or to the kind of market fundamentalists who claim that morality is unnecessary or unproblematic. Humanists need to do better than that.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421619645|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|4a0becbaf22a207b6f962914e94a1a2391d69d19 -->",

        "headline":"In Michael Gove's world Jane Austen, Orwell and Dickens will die out",
        "body":"<p>Michael Gove is <a href=\"http://dickens.stanford.edu/hard/issue1_gloss2.html\" title=\"\">Mr M'Choakumchild</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/charles-dickens/9048771/Gradgrind-My-favourite-Charles-Dickens-character.html\" title=\"\">Thomas Gradgrind</a> personified: \"<a href=\"http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/cdickens/bl-cdick-hard-1.htm\" title=\"\">What I want is, Facts</a>. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else.\" In Gove's schools, whatever might seize the imagination, give pleasure and stay in the heart and mind for a lifetime longer than rote-learned facts is being rooted out.</p><p>When he has done with cleansing the curriculum, it may be the case that fewer people know who Gradgrind and M'Choakumchild are. Dickens and much of literature will be a closed book to those not lucky enough to encounter them outside their exam-crammed education. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/15/michael-gove-gcse-changes-english-literature\" title=\"\">English literature is to be stripped out of the core English GCSE exam</a>, leaving nothing but grammatical correctness and straitjacket language reduced to right and wrong answers. Literature is to become an optional extra, and probably not a highly regarded one, for fear it might let the imagination roam dangerously free. English language, maths, three sciences, a foreign language and history or geography are the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19626663\" title=\"\">core English baccalaureate subjects</a>. <a href=\"http://www.enotes.com/homework-help/why-did-shakespeare-make-rest-silence-hamlets-400760\" title=\"\">The rest is silence</a>, more or less. (But soon few may recognise that reference.) In a world of harsh exams, with the screw tightened down to factual rigour, league table tyranny will increasingly sideline optional extras.</p><p>An array of writers, artists and academics fired off a <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Education/article1335699.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2013_11_02\" title=\"\">letter of protest to the Sunday Times, including Michael Morpurgo</a>, Robert Harris, Sheila Hancock, Miriam Margolyes and professors John Carey and John Sutherland. The new English literature exam will become more rigorous, concentrating on pre-20th century texts, which may deter all but enthusiasts: when everyone had to do some literature, it was more accessible to all. Prof Sutherland talks of how \"the humanities humanise us\".</p><p>No doubt Gove thinks that soft-headed, but he might ponder the conservative values of preserving the best. If few read literature together, the idea of a canon vanishes. The Bible has all but gone in a generation, a deep cultural loss: apart from the nativity, there is no common reference point, no chill to the marrow at <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?action=displayanchor&amp;pentid=P568\" title=\"\">God telling Abraham to cut his son's throat</a>, no common understanding of a reference to Lazarus. Another term of Gove-ism, and Jane Austen, Dickens, Orwell, Wilfred Owen, JD Salinger and all the rest will go the same way: it doesn't take long. Pupils may groan at literary texts, but books stay in the mind for further exploring. Whatever is unexamined with marks and tables is unvalued under the Gove whip.</p><p>The consultation in progress is unlikely to change the plan. Gove pretends it's for schools to choose – but drama, dance, art and now literature will slip away. Confident top schools may keep these subjects, but average schools, under intense pressure to perform in core EBacc exams, will let the rest slide. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/may/22/cultural-learning-building-knowledge-tate\" title=\"\">Cultural Learning Alliance</a> argues passionately for the cause of arts in schools. The Arts Council is negotiating valiantly behind the scenes with <a href=\"http://ofqual.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Ofqual</a> about how to ensure arts exams are as rigorous, and so of equal status, as the rest.</p><p>In Gove's groves of academe, high achievers will be more clearly set apart, laurels for the winners in his regime of fact and rote, 1950s grammar schools reprised, rewarding those who already thrive under any system. The UK always scored well with top students: it is the long tail of those falling behind who drag down our ranking in PISA tables. He is giving this unequal society, made more so by this government, schools better honed to reflect that social difference. The hurdles are set higher, the fallers will fall further and harder, with fewer paths into education for those not fired up by a strict diet of maths, grammar, physics and French.</p><p>Rudely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-referring-to-the-blob\" title=\"\">Gove dismisses the education world as \"the blob\"</a> – but if he asked further education colleges, those havens of second and third chances, what best rescues students failed by schools first time round, it is often those other doors into the many gardens of learning.</p><p>Schools need friendly secret niches with different kinds of teachers: for some children it might be sport, for others design, art, music, dance or drama where other talents and enthusiasms are welcomed to draw a child in, not propel them out. New GCSE codes downgrade all these, urging schools to discourage them. Under Gove's tutelage 14% fewer pupils are taking arts GCSEs. The Commons education select committee reports that the EBacc effect narrows options away from the arts, affecting disadvantaged children most. An Ipsos Mori report finds that schools with a high proportion of children taking free school meals are more than twice as likely to abandon arts subjects as are privileged schools. <a href=\"http://t.co/t17EsAb1pZ\" title=\"\">Gove boasts</a>: \"We've rewarded schools that teach traditional subjects, which help all students get into university.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/XeJOVZmORY\" title=\"\">Liz Truss, his minister, parrots</a>: \"We are rebalancing the curriculum towards high-value subjects – in maths, sciences, DT, computing, English and languages.\"</p><p>What is \"low value\" about drama? Small children learn through acting out imaginary roles. There is no discipline tougher than putting on a play, relying on one another, learning a part, hitting a cue, in mortal peril of failure and hope of triumph before an audience. Anyone who ever acted in a school play remembers it for ever. Ability to speak out, perform and pretend is essential for most jobs, from estate agent upwards. Employers complain that young people mumble, slouch and don't look them in the eye, prizing the \"soft skills\" that elite schools teach through drama and debating. Emotionally, drama teaches children lacking in empathy to put themselves into others' shoes, to express fears.</p><p>But ever fewer schools employ specialist drama teachers: English teachers may or may not have an aptitude. Shakespeare is on the curriculum, no longer to be examined, but dead on the page without performance to breathe life and sense into it. The RSC sends out a toolkit to help-teachers teach Shakespeare. The <a href=\"http://www.ssf.uk.com/\" title=\"\">Shakespeare Schools Festival</a> is in progress, a thousand primary and secondaries performing in real theatres everywhere, a brilliant project – but drama should be the right of every child. No school should be judged good or outstanding unless it's good at arts: the Arts Council awards an \"<a href=\"http://www.artsmark.org.uk/about-artsmark\" title=\"\">Artsmark</a>\" to schools that do well, but only a quarter earn it. My guess is Gove wouldn't send a child of his to any school that regards arts as a waste of time.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421652147|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|34f1e1aa39c7f92007996ba8e291291dd6c25bc7 -->",

        "headline":"Indonesia-Australia spying row: welcome to full-contact diplomacy",
        "body":"<p>Welcome to the world of full-contact diplomacy. Indonesian foreign minister Marty Natelagawa’s warnings that Indonesia will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/spying-row-indonesia-threatens-to-stop-co-operating-on-people-smuggling\">review its intelligence co-operation </a>with Australia and the United States unless they provide assurances they won’t spy on Indonesia shouldn’t be over-interpreted; they’re part of the rough-and-tumble world of diplomacy. And before we diagnose a crisis in Indonesia-Australia relations, we need to take a closer look at what’s going on.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/nsa-australia-bali-conference-spy-indonesia\">revelations</a> about the collection of signals intelligence at Australian missions in regional capitals are the work of an American whistleblower and Australian journalists, not neighbouring governments. If foreign governments are genuinely surprised and shocked that the US and Australia spy on them, they are naive in the extreme. Stealing secrets has been a part of statecraft since time immemorial, and arguably makes the world a safer place by minimising the chances that governments will surprise each other. Amidst all the outrage in Germany that the NSA has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\">tapping Angela Merkel’s private mobile phone</a>, someone should be asking some hard questions about why her phone hasn’t been encrypted from the start. If the Americans weren’t tapping the German chancellor’s unsecured phone conversations, the Russians, Chinese and French would be.</p> <p>In reality, Jakarta is well aware that Australia is part of the most potent eavesdropping partnership in the world. Indonesia has been a beneficiary of Australia’s intelligence capabilities in its fight against terrorism, just as Australia has benefited from intelligence cooperation with Jakarta. Against this background, Natelagawa’s threatened “review” takes on a Yes Minister slant – something that’s done in order to look decisive, while leaving things pretty much as they are.</p> <p>The Indonesian foreign minister is responding vociferously because he and his president don’t want to seen to be supine in response to allegations of Australian eavesdropping. Indonesia is in the countdown to a presidential election next year, and one way to discredit opponents is to accuse them of selling out to western interests. President Yudhoyono is already criticised by nationalists for being too nice to Canberra; and even though he can’t run again, he can’t discount his party being punished if he isn’t seen to be outraged by this apparent assault on Indonesia’s integrity.</p> <p>There’s another element to Natelagawa’s response that can’t be discounted either. Diplomacy is not all about smooth talk and cocktail parties; it’s often a brutal competition for the slightest advantage, even between ostensible friends and allies. The ability to exploit the slightest weakness can be worth its weight in gold as governments manoeuvre against each other.</p> <p>Natelagawa, who studied in Australia, has probably watched the odd State of Origin game. He knows the first 10 minutes of the match are known as the “softening up period” – a stanza of ferocious physicality in which each side tries to cow the opposition into a disadvantageous state of mind. Right now, there's a new government in Canberra, and neighbouring governments are likely to be keen to test its mettle. The odd diplomatic jab can give a better sense of what can be expected from a new government than years of polite cocktail discussions. New Australian governments over the past two decades have had some rocky foreign policy starts – think of the Howard and Rudd governments’ run-ins with Beijing early on – which makes one think that a bit of softening up may have become part of the regional diplomatic scene.</p> <p>Remember, this is not the first time Natelagawa has muscled up to the Abbott government. More than a few eyebrows were raised in Canberra back in September when he disclosed the contents of private discussions with Julie Bishop to the media – on the foreign minister’s first overseas trip no less. For this reason, the government’s neither-confirm-nor-deny, steady-as-she-goes response is spot-on. The last thing they want to do is to look unsettled.</p> <p>Does all of this add up to a new attitude of antagonism in Jakarta? No. Indonesia has demonstrated over several years that it well understands the value of building a robust and pragmatic relationship with Australia. Sometime earlier this year, a decision was made in Jakarta that it needed to do more to meet Australia half-way on the asylum seeker issue – and it has done so, under a distracting cover of grim warnings about Australian policy positions. So too should the current protestations be taken as a bit of Indonesian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang\">wayang</a> theatre, while the real business of collaboration carries on behind the curtains.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421669687|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|d7adacdf79a0838d507dedce3bafcb69e19d69db -->",

        "headline":"Why Australia should celebrate Guy Fawkes night",
        "body":"<p>\"Remember, remember, the fifth of November,\" lectures the old nursery rhyme. It&rsquo;s not really about remembering the date, but what it stands for: the importance of our political processes, and preventing people from hijacking them through public apathy.</p> <p>For the past few weeks, we have been up to our novelty eyeballs in discussions about whether Australia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/31/halloween-in-australia-what-a-terrible-and-spooky-sight\">should celebrate Halloween</a>. But given recent developments in Australia&rsquo;s political landscape, perhaps we should have been discussing whether Australia should celebrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night\">Guy Fawkes night</a>.</p> <p>In 1605, British authorities arrested a Catholic terrorist who was about to ignite enough explosives to blow the UK&rsquo;s House of Lords. His plot was to kill the king, the Privy Council, and a handful of aristocrats. His goal was to facilitate a Catholic queen&rsquo;s ascension to the throne. His name was Guy Fawkes.</p> <p>History would be kind to Fawkes. Although the fifth&nbsp;of November was instituted as a holiday to commemorate the failure of the gunpowder plot and an opportunity to stir up anti-Catholic prejudices, Fawkes would eventually be recast as an anti-authoritarian hero. At the start of the 20th Century, he was the protagonist of children&rsquo;s stories; by the end, he was the face of Alan Moore&rsquo;s protagonist in V for Vendetta. David Lloyd, the artist who worked with Moore on V for Vendetta, said that the \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735\">Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny</a>\". Although the historical Fawkes differs significantly from the contemporary imagination, his face has entered the popular consciousness as a prompt for questions about civil liberties and the relationship between the population and the state.</p> <p>As a young conservative who is generally in favour of greater state powers, I sit on the other side of the political spectrum from what Fawkes now represents. But despite my position on the right side of the political spectrum, I still find it profoundly disturbing that state and federal governments have been able to pass laws increasing the scope of their power with very little debate in the broader public.</p> <p>Governments have discovered that they don&rsquo;t need to discuss, negotiate, or persuade because the broader public has become almost completely apathetic to the idea of scrutiny and oversight. Activists and academics may write huffy pieces in hyperbolic prose, but the broader public simply does not care. Where there should be genuine outrage and concern, there is an eerie silence from a public that is disaffected, disinterested, and has forgotten the importance of the fifth&nbsp;of November.</p> <p>Queensland&rsquo;s \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/queenslands-new-anti-bikie-laws-a-recipe-for-tyranny-david-simon-says\">anti-bikie\" legislative package</a>, for example, seemed to come out of nowhere, was discussed for no more than 30 minutes, and then promptly passed into law. Although there were good reasons to introduce the legislation, the attorney-general of Queensland canvassed none of them. Instead of trying to persuade people with reasoned argument, he opted instead to troll the leader of the opposition over Twitter: \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JarrodBleijieMP/statuses/389991967125299201\">you must tell us who's side you are on, Criminal Motorcycle Gangs or Qld'ers?</a>\". Licensed by the public&rsquo;s lack of interest, other states are <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/vic-qld-on-board-with-our-bikie-lawsnsw/story-e6frfku9-1226749540734\">introducing similar legislation</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the federal level, a weekly press conference satiates the public&rsquo;s interest in the scrutiny of border protection policies. The media and Coalition were once sent into apoplexy every time a boat arrived; now the discussion has gone deathly quiet, as if millions of voices cried out for six years and were suddenly silenced.</p> <p>The situation is so dire that news organisations are resorting to stunts &ndash; like the New Stateman&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\">commissioning of Russell Brand as a guest editor</a>, and Jeremy Paxman&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\">subsequent interview with him on Newsnight</a> &ndash; in a desperate attempt to stir any public interest in politics. But it&rsquo;s a flash in the pan, a brief candle illuminating nothing.</p> <p>It seems weird to complain about this malaise when it so clearly benefits my side of politics, but it feels like an ungallant, ignoble victory. Had St George slayed the dragon while it slept, we wouldn&rsquo;t have written stories about him. Similarly, achieving good political outcomes is more than just getting your legislation into force; it&rsquo;s about having contentious but meaningful policies survive the ordeal of fire, generated by vigorous public discussion and debate.</p> <p>By forgetting the importance of the fifth&nbsp;of November &ndash; whether as a lesson about the importance of protecting political institutions, or as a symbol of anti-authoritarian rebellion &ndash; we have extinguished fiery political conflict with wet blankets of apathy. Our political culture is desperate for symbols behind which the public can rally and express its political concerns. Fawkes gives us that symbol, reinvented time and time again to speak to new political concerns.</p> <p>Who better to symbolise the resistance to more powerful security legislation than a terrorist from the 1600s cast as both the villain and hero of the holiday? How better to reignite the political passions of the public than with a bonfire? What better attracts the public&rsquo;s interest in community than fireworks? Come for the bonfire and the fireworks; stay for the political symbols.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s not the whole answer, but popularising political engagement is a good first step. Celebrating Guy Fawkes night hands the flame of political change back to the popular consciousness. Today, it&rsquo;s time to remember the fifth of November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421664451|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|a77515269ee0a211e675b2850093a524d14cbe36 -->",

        "headline":"Melbourne Cup: the diktat of classy fashion highlights our class problem",
        "body":"<p>Just like countries in the northern hemisphere are blessed with very dramatic seasonal changes &ndash; the crimson leaves of autumn, the snow storms, the emergence of spring flowers &ndash; Australia has a soothing, predictable commentary cycle&nbsp;rhythm.</p> <p>We are inundated with op-eds about the meaning of patriotism each ANZAC day, about nationalism each Australia day, and early November &ndash;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/fashion/stop-dressing-like-slappers-for-the-races/story-e6frfn7i-1225942489318\">year</a> after <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/on-melbournes-day-of-days-the-real-decision-is-to-flaunt-or-follow-the-rules-of-racewear-20111101-1mtxg.html\">year</a> after <a href=\"http://au.sports.yahoo.com/racing/news/article/-/15328772/melbourne-cup-lady-lets-fists-fly/\">year</a>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;heralds a slew of articles bemoaning young women&rsquo;s attire and behaviour at the races.</p> <p>Consider the recent <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/how-short-is-too-short-when-it-comes-to-melbourne-cup-day-fashion-etiquette/story-e6frfmqi-1226752675920\">news.com.au article</a> which asked &ldquo;when is short simply too short and how much skin is appropriate to show?&rdquo; Amid headless photographs of women in outfits the author deemed unacceptable, the article asked incredulously \"don't racegoers read fashion form guides of any kind?\" Fake tans, backless dresses and exposed midriffs are apparently ruining the hallowed traditions of a notably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/31/melbourne-cup-horse-racing\">cruel</a> horse race.</p> <p>So far, so predictable: moral panic about girls in sexy outfits is hardly novel. There is arguably more to such articles, though, than just the usual prurient (and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/08/08/women_know_more_than_just_love_and_sex/\">quasi-anthropological</a>) interest in young women behaving badly.</p> <p>Australia has long been shaped by a narrative of egalitarianism. Our national self-image centres on a uniquely <a href=\"http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=10571\">classless society</a>, unencumbered by the stratification and snobbery of the Old World. Acknowledging that divisions exist and that we do not in fact inhabit a <a href=\"http://tarahunt.com/2013/10/28/meritocracy-is-almost-as-real-as-this-unicorn/\">unicorn-filled meritocracy</a> is impossible within this framework. For those who wish to maintain the comforting fiction of a nation where Jack is as good as his master, the resulting sense of denial creates strange outcomes. As Guy Rundle <a href=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/11/01/rundle-rupert-clive-and-campbell-in-the-arkansas-of-the-world/?wpmp_switcher=mobile\">noted</a> recently, Australia is a topsy-turvy place where &ldquo;billionaires lecture us about elitism&rdquo;.</p> <p>We have a class-shaped gap in much of our national conversation, and this void is filled by coded, euphemistic language, including <a href=\"http://thingsboganslike.com/\">mockery</a> of &ldquo;bogans&rdquo; and, relevantly, the lamentation that young women attending a horse race fail to conform to dress codes. Thus we have &ldquo;leading stylist and Westfield ambassador Donny Gallela&rdquo; advising:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When dressing for the races, women should dress like a lady and adhere to basic racing style rules such as not flashing too much flesh and always wearing headwear.</p> </blockquote> <p>This, we are repeatedly <a href=\"http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/who/article/-/19485760/melbourne-cup-carnival-2013-race-day-fashion-explained/\">told</a>, is the point of the Cup for women: it gives us a chance to &ldquo;dress like a real lady&rdquo;.&nbsp;We are attuned to sexism, but classism also lurks in this sort of advice. The term &ldquo;lady&rdquo; is used to denote a division between different types of women (recall also that class is inextricably linked to race), and it circulates in modern times despite the equivalent descriptor &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; (to separate male plebs from their betters) having largely fallen into disuse.</p> <p>Consider the UK-produced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladette_to_Lady\">Ladette to Lady</a> television show that appeared during the 2000s, teaching boisterous young women to enunciate their vowels, dress demurely, and sublimate their personalities. For added colonial cringe, there were <a href=\"http://www.lifestyle.com.au/tv/aussie-ladette-to-lady/\">versions</a> of the show featuring all Australian contestants. A century after George Bernard Shaw wrote Pygmalion, the urge to remould young Eliza Doolittles has not yet evaporated.</p> <p>In 2013, it is no longer acceptable publicly to fulminate about the failings of the <br />&ldquo;lower orders&rdquo;, but this sentiment has not disappeared: could it lie beneath the horror expressed each November at the spectre of fake-tanned, miniskirted young women?</p> <p>Parallels may be drawn with the phenomena English writer Owen Jones interrogated in his 2011 polemic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review\">Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Classes</a>; the author argued that hostility towards an &ldquo;underclass&rdquo; represented in caricatures such as Little Britain&rsquo;s Vicky Pollard masked contempt for the working classes (a term rarely used in Australia&rsquo;s mainstream media, except when politicians <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Costello-taxes-the-point-were-all-working-class/2005/05/16/1116095909038.html\">claim membership</a>). For Jones, demonization was &ldquo;the ideological backbone of an unequal society&rdquo;.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s return to the Cup and the scandalised commentary surrounding its dress codes, which raises some questions. What does a lady look like? Who determines what behaviour is deemed ladylike? Is a lady simply a woman who conforms to antiquated assumptions rooted in a moribund yet strangely durable English class system?</p> <p>To ask these kinds of questions in the context of the Melbourne Cup is not to romanticise binge-drinking, which poses a danger to both men and women (although enthusiastic boozing attracts less concern when embraced by the male of the species). Neither is fashionably scanty clothing, at the races or otherwise, necessarily a symbol of empowerment; it&rsquo;s as well to be sceptical of versions of feminism that coincide with the dictates of consumer capitalism. It is simply to suggest that lamentations about the failure of young women to act &ldquo;like ladies&rdquo; need to be read with a critical eye.</p> <p>One thing is more or less certain: the day after the Cup, the papers will be replete with gleefully prurient pictures of bedraggled young women carrying their shoes. Our leaves don't fall in dramatic fashion, we don't have many snow storms, but here in this wide brown land the seasonal cycle continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421659057|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|0be0701959bda3dbfb286633c07cedc65d4baca6 -->",

Hunter argued that there was a continuity between the original 12th-century protection of commoner's rights over a piece of land, and a similar right in the 19th century. The new suburbanites might have no sheep, pigs or cows, but access to open space and fresh air was as important to them as grazing had been to their ancestors. Enshrined in law in the mid 1870s, the principle preserved thousands of acres – although it is now being undermined by new planning legislation. Later, Hunter had the idea of preserving the wilder landscape of the Lake District by creating a land-holding company. It should, he proposed, be called the national trust.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421662536|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|fe2f0aad3dc71fd9999a267f6211203ab2e58d8d -->",

For a brief period after the catastrophe of 2008, however, a deep but vague conviction that there must be a different way to run financial affairs became entirely mainstream; so mainstream, in fact, that the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-coalition-documentation\" title=\"\">coalition partners</a> made a hazy commitment to promote banking mutuals, a year after the outgoing Brown administration had issued special statutory instruments to allow the Co-operative Bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/21/britannia-cooperative-banks-building-societies\" title=\"\">to merge with the Britannia building society</a>.</p><p>This deal, it was fondly imagined, could create a player to drag a friendly society ethos of finance into the 21st century, and on a scale to put a branch on every high street, really challenging the Big Four's way of doing business. Four years on, the necessity of that challenge has been underlined by scandals involving everything from <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/libor-scandal/\" title=\"\">rate-rigging</a> to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21840052\" title=\"\">money laundering</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/payment-protection-insurance\" title=\"\">systematic mis-selling of insurance</a>. Far from thriving, however, the great Co-operative challenger is fighting for life, and this week announced that it was being kept alive – but only with, in the final cruel irony, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/04/co-op-group-rescue-activist-hedge-funds\" title=\"\">help of American hedge funds</a>.</p><p>The details of the deal are depressing first and most acutely for the workers who will lose their job in a run of branch closers. But they are depressing, too, for anyone who wants to see new models of finance, or indeed of business more widely. For the wider Co-op group is going to have to find £462m, which is half a billion pounds that will not be available to invest its mutually owned supermarkets and funeral homes. Assuming enough individual bond holders can be persuaded to acquiesce in the deal, the Co-op group's stake will shrink from 100% to 30%, while it writes ethical values into its articles of association.</p><p>In theory, the Co-op group will be able to blow the whistle on its own bank for any transgressions, but how likely is that? At best, like a declaration of confidence in a club manager, this is an avowal the company would rather it did not have to make. In the very worst case, the pledges could turn out as hollow as <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/49344\" title=\"\">the guarantees of editorial freedom</a> that secured Rupert Murdoch's take-over of the Times.</p><p>That, however, is probably melodramatic. For 30% should be enough for control; more fundamentally – as those hedge fund investments make plain – there is a serious market for ethical banking. Co-op Bank's difficulties came from expanding too fast, a hubristic habit learnt from the mainstream. The real difficulty, then, wasn't that Co-op was too different – but that it was not different enough.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421662147|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|7bc819c01d18ad96649cc86c4ee04b8b42ef8162 -->",

At a certain place you've got to say to the people, 'Suck it in and cope, buddy. Suck it in and cope.'\"</p><p>But banks, he insisted, need our help. It turns out that moral hazard – the notion that those who know the costs of their failure will be borne by others will become increasingly reckless – only really applies to the working poor.</p><p>\"You should thank God\" for bank bailouts, Munger told his audience. \"Now, if you talk about bailouts for everybody else, there comes a place where if you just start bailing out all the&nbsp;individuals instead of telling them to adapt, the culture dies.\"</p><p>In the five years since the financial crisis took hold, people have been sucking it in by the lungful and discovering how pitiful a coping strategy that is. <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/18835-race-lifespan-states.html\" title=\"\">In Michigan</a>, the state where Munger spoke, black male life expectancy is lower than male life expectancy in <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uz.html\" title=\"\">Uzbekistan</a>; in Detroit, the closest big city, <a href=\"http://drawingdetroit.wordpress.com/2013/01/27/infant-mortality-rates-in-detroit-and-michigan/\" title=\"\">black infant mortality</a> is on a par with <a href=\"http://kff.org/global-indicator/infant-mortality-rate/\" title=\"\">Syria</a> (before the war).</p><p>As such, the crisis accelerated an already heinous trend of growing inequalities. Over a period of 18 years, America's white working class – particularly women – <a href=\"http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/8/1803\" title=\"\">have started dying&nbsp;younger</a>. \"Absent a war, genocide, pandemic, or massive governmental collapse, drops in life expectancy are rare,\" <a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/whats-killing-poor-white-women\" title=\"\">wrote Monica Potts in the American Prospect</a> last month. But this&nbsp;was a war on the poor. \"Lack of access to education, medical care, good&nbsp;wages and healthy food isn't just&nbsp;leaving the&nbsp;worst-off Americans behind. It's killing them.\"</p><p>This particular crisis, however, has also accentuated the contradictions between the claims long made for neoliberalism and the system's ability to deliver on them. The \"culture\" of capitalism, to which Munger referred, did not die but thrived precisely because it was not forced to adapt, while working people – who kept it afloat through their taxes and now through cuts in public spending – struggle to survive. Given the broad framing of economic struggles in the west exacerbated by the crisis, this reality is neither new nor specific to the US. \"Over the past 30 years the workers' take from the pie has shrunk across the globe,\" explains <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21588860-labours-share-national-income-has-fallen-right-remedy-help-workers-not-punish\" title=\"\">an editorial in the latest Economist</a>. \"The scale and breadth of this squeeze are striking … When growth is sluggish … workers are getting a smaller morsel of a smaller slice of a slow-growing pie.\"</p><p>A few days before the bailout was passed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/29/uselections2008.useconomy1\" title=\"\">I quoted Lenin in these pages</a>. He once argued: \"The capitalists can always buy themselves out of any crises,&nbsp;as long as they make the workers&nbsp;pay.\" What has been striking, particularly recently, has been the brazen and callous nature in which these payments have been extorted.</p><p>Last Friday, 47 million Americans had their <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/02/food-stamps-cuts-food-banks/3356667/\" title=\"\">food stamp benefits cut</a>. These provide assistance to those who lack sufficient money to feed themselves and their families. Individuals lose $11 (£7) a month while a family of four will lose $36. That will save the public purse precious little – bombing Syria would have been far more costly – but will mean a great deal to those affected. \"Before the cut, it was kind of an assumption you were going to the food bank anyway,\" Lance Worth, of Washington state, <a href=\"http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2013/10/30/3285812/temporary-food-stamp-hike-expires.html\" title=\"\">told the Bellingham Herald</a>. \"I guess I'm just going to go $20 hungrier – aren't I?\"</p><p>The cut marks the lapse in stimulus package ushered in four years ago. But while the recession is officially over, the poverty it engendered remains. Government figures show <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics.aspx#trends\" title=\"\">one in seven Americans is food insecure</a>. According to Gallup, in August, one in five said they have, at times during the last year, lacked <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/164363/americans-struggle-afford-food.aspx\" title=\"\">money to buy food that they or their families needed</a>. Both figures are roughly the same as when Obama was elected. This negligence will now be compounded by mendacity. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/us/politics/house-passes-bill-cutting-40-billion-from-food-stamps.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Republicans propose further swingeing cuts</a> to the food-stamp programme; Democrats suggest smaller cuts. The question is not whether the vulnerable will be hammered, but by how much.</p><p>The impetus behind these cuts are not fiscal but ideological. Republicans, in particular, claim <a href=\"http://www.postbulletin.com/opinion/kevin-horrigan-republicans-see-the-working-poor-as-a-myth/article_a609f5ac-ce10-5fc0-b964-ee7f5eec1190.html\" title=\"\">the poor have it too&nbsp;easy</a>. \"We don't want to turn the safety net into a hammock that lulls able-bodied people into lives of dependency and complacency,\" <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/13/news/economy/ryan-medicaid/\" title=\"\">claimed former Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan</a>. \"That drains them of their will and their incentive to make the most of their lives.\"</p><p>The notion that food \"drains the will\" while hunger motivates the ambitious would have more currency – not much, but more – if the right wasn't simultaneously doing its utmost to drive down wages to a level where work provides no guarantee against hunger. In last week's <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/attack-on-american-labor-standards/\" title=\"\">paper for the Economic Policy Institute</a>, Gordon Lafer, an associate professor at the University of Oregon, revealed the degree to which conservatives have been driving down wages, benefits and protections at a local level after their victory at the 2010 midterms.</p><p>He writes: \"Four states&nbsp;passed laws restricting the minimum wage, four&nbsp;lifted restrictions on child labour, and 16 imposed new limits on benefits for the unemployed. With the support of the corporate lobbies, states also passed laws stripping workers of overtime rights, repealing or restricting rights to sick leave, and making it harder to sue one's employer for race or sex discrimination.\"</p><p>That's why 40% of households on food stamps have at least <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/22/american-dream-wages-stagnate-delusional-myth\" title=\"\">one person working</a>. And the states most aggressive in pursuing these policies, Lafer points out, had some of the smallest budget deficits in the country.</p><p>Immediately after Obama's election in 2008, his chief of staff to be, Rahm Emanuel, said: \"You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that is it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.\" The crisis didn't go to waste. But it is the right that has seized the opportunity. Not content with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/09/land-of-free-home-of-hungry\" title=\"\">balancing the budget on the bellies of the hungry</a>, it is also fattening the coffers of the wealthy on the backs of the poor.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421564552|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|4797923d8661097456223644081efde52f49ba57 -->",

        "headline":"The TSA shootings at LAX highlight America's real terror threat",
        "body":"<p>In 2012, <a href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/28/terrorist-attacks-and-deaths-hit-record-high-report-shows/\">15 Americans were killed</a> in terrorist attacks.</p><p>The previous year, <a href=\"http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-states\">more than 32,000 Americans died from gun violence</a> (including homicides, suicides and accidents). That total represents an almost 2,600 person increase in gun deaths since 2001.</p><p>So, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the first Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agent to be killed in the line of duty was not slain by an al-Qaida terrorist, but rather by an American with a gun.</p><p>Gerardo Hernandez, who was shot and killed at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Friday, was tasked with protecting Americans from a threat that barely exists. Instead, he died from a threat that we as a nation tacitly accept as a \"price of freedom\": practically unfettered access to firearms.</p><p>Twelve years ago this month, when Congress created the TSA, the threat from terrorism seemed real. Just two months earlier, 3,000 Americans had been killed by the worst terrorist attack in American history. Congress, acting with a level of responsiveness that in today's current political context would seem unimaginable, established a vast new federal bureaucracy to take responsibility for protecting airplanes and passengers from the supposed scourge of international terrorism.</p><p>Today, with a budget of nearly $8bn, the <a href=\"http://www.tsa.gov/about-tsa/tsa-workforce\">TSA employs almost 50,000</a> transportation security officers who screen the nation's air travelers. Yet, as incidents of terrorism directed at the United States have declined and al-Qaida's global reach has been constrained, the TSA's mandates remain in place. They've even been expanded, often in response to terrorist attacks or alleged plots.</p><p>When Richard Reid, aka \"the Shoe Bomber\", attempted to light explosives hidden in his shoes on a trans-Atlantic flight – and reports surfaced of other potential \"shoe bombers\" – it led to <a href=\"http://www.tsa.gov/press/releases/2003/07/10/tsa-homeland-security-move-make-shoe-screening-policy-consistent-travelers\">new rules \"encouraging\" passengers</a> to take off their shoes at TSA checkpoints. In 2006, when a plot to bomb multiple trans-Atlantic flights with liquid explosives was foiled by British police, it brought new restrictions on bringing liquids on planes – and a shift to <a href=\"http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/how-get-through-line-faster\">mandatory shoe screening</a>. Even large printer cartridges were banned on planes after a foiled terror plot in which they were used to hide explosives.</p><p>No other form of domestic travel, like trains or buses, has the same level of security as is seen on airplanes. Considering that cockpit doors are now locked (one of several post 9/11 reforms that is, in fact, keeping Americans safer), and given that passengers are conditioned by the events of 9/11 to not respond in a docile fashion to a potential terrorist attack, the threat of in-air terrorism seems even more limited.</p><p>Then again, perhaps an abundance of caution is in order. TSA restrictions are frustrating and time-consuming, but they are hardly onerous. While there have been occasional complaints about the infringement on personal freedom and the inconvenience that TSA screening represents, Americans have, by and large, accepted their presence as the price that must be paid to protect the nation against terrorism.</p><p>This begs the question, however: why do Americans accept such restrictions – to combat a threat that barely exists – and recoil at the notion of placing similar restrictions on guns, which kill 2,000 times more Americans every year than terrorism?</p><p>America has the laxest gun laws in the developed world, more guns per person and the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2013/09/19/u-s-has-more-guns-and-gun-deaths-than-any-other-country-study-finds/\">highest rate of death</a> by firearms of any developed nation. The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/14/nine-facts-about-guns-and-mass-shootings-in-the-united-states/\">US also leads the world</a> in mass shootings. <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map\">As Mother Jones points out</a>, of the 62 mass shootings that have taken place in the United States since 1982, three-quarters of the killers used legally obtained weapons.</p><p>While, mercifully, the gun ownership rate is in decline, millions of Americans continue to buy handguns for protection. This is the case, even though having a gun in one's home puts all those who live there <a href=\"http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full\">at dramatically</a> greater <a href=\"http://ajl.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/02/01/1559827610396294\">risk of dying</a> as a result of gun violence – and provides negligible deterrent benefit.</p><p>Of course, there is little talk of banning all guns in the United States; rather, restricting the ability of people to purchase them. However, even that is too high a mountain to climb.</p><p>For example, the gun used in the LAX shooting was a .223-caliber assault rifle, a weapon that exists for only one reason – to kill multiple numbers of people (a similarity it shares with virtually all guns). There really is no justifiable reason for such weapons to be in the hands of ordinary citizens. And yet, as <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2013/11/feinstein-links-lax-to-gun-control-176578.html\">Senator Dianne Feinstein noted Sunday on \"Meet The Press\"</a>, it would be a virtual impossibility to pass a bill in Congress banning them.</p><p>It was seven months ago, after all, that the Senate blocked a measure to expand background checks on gun purchasers. That occurred the same week that a major American city was shut down because there was a wounded, unarmed, single terrorist on the loose.</p><p>In the wake of the Newtown school shooting that took the lives of 28 people, including 20 children, no major federal gun control regulation has been enacted. Meanwhile, two researchers who are compiling Slate.com's <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2012/12/gun_death_tally_every_american_gun_death_since_newtown_sandy_hook_shooting.html\">extraordinary and sobering gun death database estimate</a> that more than 29,000 Americans have died from gun violence since that terrible day – a number dramatically higher than the more than 10,000 deaths officially reported (which, in itself, is a heartbreaking and appalling total).</p><p>There's been new <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/terrible-tally-500-children-dead-gunshots-every-year-7-500-8C11469222\">research indicating that 500 US children are killed</a>, and 7,500 are hospitalized, every year from gunshot wounds. None of this brings real policy change. In fact, in <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-11/colorado-senate-president-loses-seat-in-nra-backed-recall.html\">state senate recall elections in Colorado</a>, two Democratic legislators were defeated because of their support for an earlier state bill that had placed restrictions on gun ownership.</p><p>Quite simply, the unceasing death toll from gun violence continues unabated.</p><p>In a sense, we're all complicit in the deep narcissism of gun-owners who demand that their absolutist definition of freedom (largely unencumbered access to firearms of all shapes and sizes) takes precedent over the carnage it causes every day in communities across America.</p><p>The irony of our divergent responses to terrorism and gun violence is that the shooting in LAX was, by any meaningful measure, <em>an act of terrorism</em>. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/us/lax-shooting/\">According to a note found in the possession of the shooter</a>, he made \"a conscious decision to kill multiple TSA employees\". The note reportedly stated that he wanted to \"instill fear into their traitorous minds\", and he allegedly \"claimed the TSA treats Americans like terrorists even though all people aren't equally dangerous\".</p><p>Now, of course, if the shooter had screamed \"Allah Akbar\" as he needlessly took the life of TSA agent Gerardo Hernandez, or if he had had links to an al-Qaida terror cell, there'd be no question about how to describe this incident. Moreover, there would almost certainly be a major policy response.</p><p>In fact, if this latest act of gun violence were described accurately as terrorism, it would perhaps lead to the same quick response that led to the creation of the TSA. How else to shake Americans and their elected leaders from their collective slumber over the menace of gun violence?</p><p>But don't bet on it happening. This shooting, like the approximately <a href=\"http://blogs.kqed.org/lowdown/2013/03/07/u-s-gun-deaths-visualizing-the-numbers/\">85 other acts of gun violence</a> that take an American life <em>every single day,</em> will almost certainly lead to the same policy result to which we've become far too accustomed – even inured to – in this country.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>But at least we'll be safe from the terrorists.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421631840|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|39b5e894f50d2dfe46ad19aa2320c20fa6a0d7c9 -->",

        "body":"<p>If you bothered to listen to the Parents Television Council, you would think that New York's tiny IFC Center was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/01/new-york-cinema-blue-warmest-colour\">evil incarnate</a> when the theatre decided not to enforce the NC-17 rating for the film Blue Is the Warmest Color. The Parents Television Council<a href=\"http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/10/31/blue-is-the-warmest-color-ptc-protest/\"> called the move \"shocking\"</a> and fretted that this meant \"minor children\" would be allowed to view graphic sex scenes (because they'll no doubt be camping on the street to see a three-hour French drama). Though its \"stern warning\" was not widely reported, it may very well have contributed to the film's strong box office results thus far. </p><p>Everyone is entitled to their beliefs, but here's where the fury of the<a href=\"http://w2.parentstv.org/Main/\"> Parents Television Council</a> breaks down: these conservatives are so obsessed with sex, but seemingly care far less about violence. </p><p>While the Council was wailing about the possibility of a teenager seeing a lesbian film, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/shooting-los-angeles-airport-suspect-held\">gunman opened fire at Los Angeles airport</a>, resulting in one death and a number of injuries. That might have been a moment for the PTC, which ranks violence after sex in its list of evils it seeks to regulate on the airwaves, to deplore the shooting and, perhaps, note that there is some credence to the calls for stricter gun control laws (or, at least, less violence on screen and in video games). Real-world violence, however, tends to have little resonance with cultural scolds. It is certainly not worth mentioning when there is cinematic sex to condemn. </p><p>The fact that Blue Is the Warmest Color is even rated NC-17 in the first place makes it yet another entry in the discussion, most recently illuminated by Kirby Dick in his documentary <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493459/\">This Film Is Not Yet Rated</a>, about the hypocrisy and arbitrariness of film ratings, particularly where sex is concerned. </p><p>Sex, female nudity, female enjoyment of sex, and especially female enjoyment of lesbian sex, tend to draw the strictest ratings. Violence, however, is given much more of a pass. Even gory violence will be rated R, whereas a women's sexual pleasure is NC-17. </p><p>What's so scary about sex and the female body? And why is it so much scarier than violence – including violence committed upon the female body? </p><p>Concerns regarding sex over violence are nothing new in western society. Sex was, of course, right up there with forbidden fruit. Perceived as instigated by a woman, it then cast women in later religious thought as particularly carnal, a danger that could invite the devil into society. In the Speculum Maius, an encyclopedia used during the Middle Ages, friar Vincent de Beauvais wrote of women's frivolity, with their \"monstrous headdresses\" and particularly of the \"lascivious and carnal provocation\" of their clothing. Women were the \"devil's decoy\", capable of preventing men from achieving holiness. </p><p>One of the most famous sexual women in the Middle Ages is Chaucer's Wife of Bath, who laments \"Alas, alas, that ever love was sin\". While she is considered an example of healthy sexuality, her tale begins with a violent rape and ends with the rapist escaping punishment to instead enjoy a sexually fulfilling marriage. We never hear what happens to the rape victim, who likely ends up cast out of society. </p><p>Violence was, in fact, justified when aimed at women if they were said to be disobedient. That is, if they asserted some form of independence. While the bulk of victims of the<a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/860378/The_Woman-as-witch_stereotype_in_Early_Modern_England_Continental_Europe_and_New_England\"> early modern witch burnings</a> were likely women past child-bearing age and thus no longer considered sexual, they were also living alone, ungoverned by male dominance. The witch hunts hinted that women who lived outside the social order deserved violent treatment. </p><p>Women's sexuality has been the target of male study, suspicion, and regulation throughout millennia. Aristotelian philosophy classed women more as property, not individuals, and the idea of their having agency was anathema to a healthy society.</p><p>Violence, on the other hand, is a male purview. Men conducted war, carried weapons, meted out punishment. Duels were sanctioned as a means of effecting justice. It's a historical \"boys will be boys\" mentality, justified for its ends. Through violence, one can create empires. Sex just replaces those who were lost along the way.</p><p>Bad enough that women's lustfulness could lean men astray. Far worse when that lustfulness is shared with another woman. </p><p>The first TV show to depict a serious and erotic lesbian relationship, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, used the specter of witchcraft as a conduit of their romantic connection. The censors cracked down on their relationship – whereas Buffy featured frightening, intense violence, and a fair bit of heterosexual sex, the network was quick to tell creator Joss Whedon that it <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&amp;prgDate=09-May-2000\">didn't want to see any kissing between the lesbians</a>. Terrifying violence was solid entertainment, an expression of romantic love between two young women might damage the children. </p><p>If conservative American adults would stop focusing on sex for a moment, they might see that what is really damaging children in the US is an excess of gun violence. The obsession with depictions of cinematic sexuality is a smokescreen for a real discussion of how to protect the most innocent among us.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421644594|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1664d43e58fb5f5bf6df278f25054b30d54e0bf1 -->",

        "headline":"SnoreStop's 'be together' billboard campaign is racist and repugnant",
        "body":"<p>SnoreStop, a company who boasts the number one position in sales of throat spray that reduces <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/may/03/dr-luisa-dillner-guide-snoring\">snoring</a>, has unveiled a billboard that \"is part of a larger marketing campaign\". The product may be number one for reducing snoring, but the company's newest form of advertising has blown up on the internet in a not-so-number-one way  </p><p>The <a href=\"http://snorestop.com/press/news/does-this-los-angeles-billboard-go-too-far.html\">billboard</a> features what appears to be a US soldier and a Muslim woman covered in a niqab (a form of hijab that covers everything besides the eyes), who are happily married. She is wearing a wedding band and he is embracing her lovingly. \"As a snoring solution company, we're in the business of keeping people together\", said Melody Devemark, spokesperson for SnoreStop.</p><p>Though SnoreStop may be well intentioned, their campaign has gone viral and left many people confused, offended, and upset, and with good reason. SnoreStop went where no other company has, at least with the military: they put two perceived polar opposites together and marketed them as the couple that could survive snoring (of all things). </p><p>To many, seeing a US soldier and a Muslim woman who is almost completely covered as a happily married couple is odd and unfathomable. Never have Americans been faced with such a unique image of people who come from such apparently different worlds – one being \"the Muslim world\" – who can also be married. What's particularly frustrating is that according to SnoreStop, the average Muslim woman is covered in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/16/veil-biggest-issue-uk-niqab-debate\">niqab</a>. Let's have a little reality check here, the niqab something that the majority of Muslim women in the world, let alone in America, do not even wear. It was as if SnoreStop couldn't think of any other way to identify this woman as Muslim is if she wore a full niqab.</p><p>SnoreStop did not stop at profiling and stereotyping what a Muslim woman looks like, they placed her in the arms of a US solider. As an Iraqi, when I see a man dressed in camouflage and matching hat with a Muslim woman in his arms, I think of the atrocities committed against not only men, but women and children, during the brutal years of \"democracy and liberation\" that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/true-civilian-body-count-iraq\">ravaged my country</a> on the whims of US and international armed forces. Women and girls – <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/07/03/224123/--quot-woman-quot-raped-in-Iraq-15-yrs-old\">some as young as 15</a> – reportedly raped by soldiers between 2003 and 2004 may have something else to say about this billboard. To place a Muslim woman, who does not even represent the mainstream image of a Muslim in America, in the hands of a man who represents an institution responsible for the terror and agony of many Muslims in the world (not only in Iraq) is not simply insensitive, but disturbing. </p><p>This is not to say that relationships never occur between US servicemen and civilians in the countries they enter, whether it be Iraq, Afghanistan or any other nation the US military has had a presence in, but the marketing of this advertisement could have been done in a different manner. Instead, we are given a billboard that features a stereotype of a Muslim woman, with a US soldier who may at one point have invaded this woman's country. </p><p>I am in no way against a woman covering fully, as I myself practice a form of hijab, nor am I against happy marriages with men who aim to serve and protect. SnoreStop does claim this is a real couple, and I hope they are happy. But this is also an ad where we don't get to hear any more of this couple's story than a single photograph. I am against the stereotyping of Muslim women and what the US military represents to Muslims: a violent institution that does not seek the freedom of Muslim countries or the security of the United States, but instead, has been misguided by other interests. </p><p>These interests are materially based and cause problems well beyond the petty nuisance of snoring. If only SnoreStop could develop a spray to solve these problems as well, then they wouldn't need a racist and offensive marketing campaign to sell their product.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421632149|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|71b7dd8bb4f2202df4cccdcc85823e284ad1ca97 -->",

        "body":"<p>I don't know any younger media people, aka digital people, who would think about the division between content and business in the way it was once thought of at Time, Inc, where the premise of a Chinese wall between editorial (church) and advertising (state) became enshrined for several generations.</p><p>Time, Inc, in an effort to catch up with a world that in business and cultural norms has passed it by,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/business/media/pearlstine-rejoining-time-as-chief-content-officer.html\"> announced last week</a> that editors would now report to the business side. It also said it was bringing back <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/10/31/pearlstine-returns-to-time/3329225/\">Norman Pearlstine</a>, a former Time, Inc editor-in-chief to serve in a new hybrid role as the interfacer or facilitator between content and business, called Chief Content Officer, and to dispatch Martha Nelson, the current editor-in-chief.</p><p>There are many nuances to this end of the church-and-state distinction, beginning with the fact that if anyone considers Martha Nelson, the former editor of People, some kind of editorial purists, or any sort of person not concerned with the most craven measures of success, they are smoking something. It is not that Time, Inc hasn't bent over backwards to do anything to make a few more dollars for the past 10 years or more, but that it has done it so incompetently.</p><p>That is why it is shortly to be jettisoned from the company, Time Warner, for which it supplied name, influence, status, and, for many years, most of the profits. Time, Inc, in fact, once represented the ultimate ability to transform content into money. No publisher in history has ever been so nimble and shameless and talented and shrewd in monetizing the words and pictures it produced. And perhaps that had a lot to do with Time's fine balance between sellers and creators.</p><p>But over the last decade or so, in the shadow of the structural downturn in publishing, Time, Inc has largely become a management free-for-all having absolutely nothing to do with the proper balance between church and state. It's been more a Lord of the Flies type power struggle.</p><p>Two years ago, an outsider CEO was brought into the company and expelled by the barons of the place a few months later; after a long interregnum, a weakling replacement was installed, only to be ousted in little more than a year.<br /> <br />Perhaps the most elemental consideration when you are setting up a company –and Time, Inc. shortly to <a href=\"http://\">restart as an independent, publicly traded entity</a>, is now going through that birth process – has to do with who's in charge. It is true that the new CEO, Joe Ripp, as a former CFO, at Time, Inc, and other companies is hardly going to be an editorial visionary, or have any really concerns about the special nature of content creation, but, on the other hand, he knows where the bodies are buried. Last week's moves, which included hiring the adept and sensible, Lon Jacobs, formerly of News Corp, as the general counsel, are all about taking control of a largely dysfunctional and incredibly nasty place. </p><p>The 71-year-old Pearlstine and 58-year-old Jacobs were hired to be the adults. Theses are sagacious men. On the other hand, if the world is divided, it is not so much anymore between church and state, but between the old, with prosaic notions about content, and the young, who can talk a marketing, traffic, branded content game. </p><p>Joe Ripp, as old as Methuselah too, might well have wanted to hire a genuine young person as Content Chief, save for the fact that such an innocent would have been quickly sliced and diced by the gang bangers at Time, Inc. Hence, the once and future Pearlstine to help mediate the murderous fiefdoms. </p><p>Now, to further refine the problem, it is not just that the editorial side is reporting to business, but that the business side largely consists of failed salesman. Certainly, if you are a salesman who is still selling magazine pages (however you have tried to rebrand yourself as a cross platform man), you've lost your career way. On the other hand, if you are a magazine editor at this point in time, you also have some serious career problems. Suffice to say, Time, Inc is no longer the first choice of Rhodes Scholars and the best and the brightest that it once was. If the business side can't sell ads, the editorial side has not been able to create content that much matters to anybody either – not for quite some time.</p><p>It's a failed state and God is dead.</p><p>What's more, the print industry shrinks at annual double digit levels, Time Inc's cost basis makes it largely noncompetitive in the new content world, and, based on its countless efforts, the company's ability to perform in a technology-driven market is nil.</p><p>Time's advantage, likely its only advantage, is that in a post-apocalyptic world nobody expects the company to succeed, hence it can't disappoint anybody either. As much as a company with something like 160 magazines can be, it's a blank page. The questions it has to answer are far more basic and existential then who should be responsible for content's bona fides. </p><p>For instance, what is the business basis for print? In fact, is there any reason print should exist? What, if anything, is left of the historic partnership between Madison Avenue and a glossy page in a status-conscious title? If not enough, is there something that print can transform itself into, something that print people might be capable of transforming their craft into?</p><p>For some of us, these are actually exciting questions, and high time they are answered.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421631490|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|682f34d4ef145a9efb50441e1694e74154aa4425 -->",
