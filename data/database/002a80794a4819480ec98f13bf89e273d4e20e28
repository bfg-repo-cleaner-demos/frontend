        "body":"<p>The PGA of America is considering staging the US PGA Championship, one of golf's four majors, outside the United States. A report in Golf Digest states that a committee is studying the impact of holding the event around the world, with the earliest possible date in 2020.</p><p>The 2019 championship was awarded to Bethpage Black on Long Island last month. \"This is an exercise we are going through, an analysis,\" PGA of America chief executive Pete Bevacqua told Golf Digest. \"It is far from a fait accompli that we are going to take the PGA Championship international. When we sat down to map our strategic plan to service our members and grow the game the question arose as to what impact it would have to take the PGA Championship to an international location once or twice a decade.</p><p>\"It would be something we would only do if we had the co-operation of quite a few groups. It would need to work for the PGA Tour and it would need to work for the PGA Tour players.</p><p>\"Another would be the PGA in the particular area we would consider. We would want the international PGAs to be a part of this and share in this. Many pieces would have to fall in place.\"</p><p>Adam Scott fired a course-record 64 to storm past Justin Rose and claim victory at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda. Rose had led by a single stroke with three holes to play but he had no answer to Scott in the closing stages as the Australian won the 36-hole tournament – which gathers the season's four major champions – by two shots on eight under.</p><p>The Masters winner took control on the penultimate hole when his six-iron landed within inches to allow him a tap-in eagle three. The US Open champion Rose had given up his single-shot lead at the previous hole, forced to take a drop after a wayward tee shot, before par on the 17th left him two shots adrift as Scott accelerated.</p><p>Scott's win means that he was able to add the winner's pink jacket to the green one he dramatically secured after a play-off against Angel Cabrera at Augusta in April.</p><p>Jason Dufner finished third on three under while Padraig Harrington, who replaced the Open champion Phil Mickelson, was well off the pace on three over after a 71 on Wednesday.</p><p>Harrington was the defending champion after he stepped in for Ernie Els last year.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420185397|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|b33e8a46c32fbbd2ed1b088801100d3d38c6eeb3 -->",

        "headline":"Teenager Guan Tianlang learns his lesson from Masters experience",
        "body":"<p>If there is any lingering resentment over the controversial penalty handed down to Guan Tianlang at this year's Masters not a trace of it can be found when speaking to the teenager. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>Six months have passed since Guan, at the age of 14, survived to play the final 36 holes of the year's first major. That remarkable feat, which made Guan the youngest player in history to make the cut at a major championship, was overshadowed in part by the one-stroke punishment issued for slow play during the second round which left him on the cut line at four over.</p><p>The general consensus at Augusta was that it was harsh to punish Guan while serial offenders were ignored. As he glances back at the affair, though, Guan takes an alternative view.</p><p>\"I still respect what they did with me,\" Guan says. \"I still really respect the referee and I think it's a really good experience for me. So I learned from that, I paid attention. I think I should thank him [the referee] for that.\"</p><p>Guan will defend the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship title from 24 October at Nanshan in China's Shandong province. It was that success in 2012 which earned him the Masters invite.</p><p>A year on, Guan insists the only noticeable difference in his life is added confidence when heading into tournament golf, despite the attention that was focused on him in Georgia.</p><p>\"I don't feel much more pressure this time,\" Guan says. \"But I think it is still the greatest amateur event in the world. So I really hope to win it again. And I feel like if I am playing well and I'm having a really good week, I can win again.\"</p><p>Guan will not turn 15 until 25 October and has no immediate aspirations of moving into professional golf. \"I still have no idea about turning pro now,\" he insists. \"I'm still working on my game but schoolwork is very important for me still. So I think there is still a long way to go. I hope I can go back to Augusta next year, too. But other than that I don't have a plan.\"</p><p>Since Augusta, Guan has featured in professional events in the United States and returned to China in August, since when he has returned to his daily studies. On the course, Guan has now learned to play without the belly putter which was in use at the Masters.</p><p>\"Now I'm back to using the normal putter,\" he explains. \"I don't think it is too much different, or about which one is better. I changed back maybe a month ago. I still wish I could putt even better.\"</p><p>Guan's long game was the aspect which, by his own admission, needed more improvement. His lack of length off the tee owed nothing to technical troubles but rather a lack of physical development. \"I'm doing a little more work in the gym,\" Guan says.</p><p>\"After a couple of PGA Tour events I went to San Diego and worked with Doctor Greg Rose at the Titleist performance institute on my physical side. I have a lot to thank him for; my body feels stronger now. I can hit it a little bit longer.\"</p><p>The continuation of Guan's education and move, for now, back towards a normal life might placate those who fear that exposing a 14-year-old to top-level sport may be harmful.</p><p>There is intrigue, too, over what impact Guan's prominence will have on golf's development in China.</p><p>Both the European and US PGA Tours are keen to tap further into what is a developing area in the sport, but the fact remains that golf is generally an elite game for the Chinese. Not every youngster has the affluent backdrop that has helped Guan's emerging career. Guan, however, sees progress.</p><p>\"I think golf in China now is growing really, really fast,\" he adds. \"And I think after playing in the Masters, Chinese people who didn't know golf in the past, now they come to know golf and some start to pick up the game. So I think that has been very, very good for golf and for China.</p><p>\"I think all of the Chinese people are happy for me and I think more and more people know about golf in China. More people know about the Masters and I think it means a lot to the young players in China. They think, probably, the Masters is not that far away from them.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420058524|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|548a8ad7eb9529d40be3dcb0d28d801417a99516 -->",

They occur every time Rory and I are apart a few days or do not write on Twitter,\" she told the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet.</p><p>\"There is nothing in it, and from now on I just think that I will keep my private life private.</p><p>\"It is so annoying that the media and the so-called sources constantly spread the rumours. They write just what they want.\"</p><p>Wozniacki, who has slipped to ninth in the world rankings, said \"all is well\" with the relationship.</p><p>\"I just want to be allowed to live my life off the court without all the speculation,\" she added.</p><p>McIlroy, who claimed the order of merit on both sides of the Atlantic last year and won two major titles by the age of 23, has endured a difficult year.</p><p>After switching his club brand at the start of the season to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/19/rory-mcilroy-defiant-nike-nick-faldo\" title=\"\">Nike in a lucrative deal</a> reported to be worth £78m, the 24-year-old slipped from world No1 to sixth in the rankings.</p><p>Asked if his problems on the course were caused by mechanical or mental issues, McIlroy said: \"I think it was a little bit of both.</p><p>\"Mechanically my golf swing ... I fell into a couple of bad habits and I was trying to work myself out of it. It affects mental issues as well.</p><p>\"Golf is a game of confidence and if you are confident it allows you to play better and freer ... with a free mind. Definitely nothing to do with equipment.\"</p><p>McIlroy said there was plenty of golf left in the year and ample opportunities for him to get that first win.</p><p>\"I learned a lot this year,\" he added. \"I was undergolfed for the first three to four months. It's the first year I struggled and I didn't live up to the expectation.</p><p>\"This year is a little bit of a disappointment, But I have six tournaments left and will finish the season strongly.\"</p><p>In another off-course distraction, McIlroy recently terminated his contract with Horizon Sports Management and set up his own company to run his business interests.</p><p>That messy break-up<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/14/rory-mcilroy-horizon-dublin-court\" title=\"\"> reached a Dublin court</a> on Monday with McIlroy unhappy with the commission the Dublin firm was charging for its services.</p><p>Horizon has said it was disappointed McIlroy had ended a contract that had a number of years left to run.</p><p>\"Since October 2011 Horizon has achieved exceptional results for Rory in realising his commercial objectives,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>\"Under Horizon's management Rory has signed some of the most lucrative endorsements in sports history.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419982277|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|1741e1f8dba2aa90c3a53c0d008052053f0d6001 -->",

        "body":"<p>Rory McIlroy's former management company has promised to defend vigorously a court action against it by the former world No1, and Horizon Sports Management is claiming breach of contract.</p><p>McIlroy was not present at Dublin's commercial court on Monday morning when his action, which relates mainly to the level of fees taken by Horizon, was launched. The Northern Irishman has set up his own management group after claiming he has terminated his Horizon deal.</p><p>McIlroy is understood to be trying to recover €7m (£5.94m) from Horizon in the belief that fees charged during an 18-month spell with the Dublin-based firm were excessive. While under Horizon's guidance the 24-year-old signed an equipment deal with Nike worth US$100m over five years. A full trial date for the case between McIlroy and Horizon has been set for next October. Court papers reveal McIlroy claims he was misled.</p><p>McIlroy maintains he was not furnished with any draft of the agreement with Horizon before it was presented to him for signature on 21 December 2011, in a solicitor's office on the day of Horizon's Christmas party \"in circumstances of great informality\".</p><p>In his statement of claim, McIlroy alleges the Horizon agent Conor Ridge acted primarily in the interests of his company as opposed to, and to the detriment of, the interests of McIlroy.</p><p>n a statement, the firm said: \"Horizon Sports Management (\"Horizon\") notes with disappointment Rory McIlroy's decision to initiate legal action seeking to terminate his representation contract.</p><p>\"Since October 2011, under Horizon's management, Rory McIlroy has signed some of the most lucrative endorsement contracts in sports history, in addition to achieving significant success on the golf course. Today, he is one of the world's most highly remunerated sports people.</p><p></p><p>\"In March 2013, he signed an extension to his representation contract up to 2017. Rory McIlroy has now announced that his business interests will be managed by Rory McIlroy Incorporated. As a consequence, he is in breach of the representation contract into which he willingly entered.</p><p>\"This legal action seeks to void his representation contract from its original date, recover fees already paid and avoid paying any further fees as stipulated by the agreement.</p><p>\"Regrettably, this legal action has been taken despite Horizon's efforts to reach an orderly and fair resolution. The claim will be defended vigorously and comprehensively in legal process.</p><p>\"Horizon has confidence in its position. This confidence is underpinned by a legally binding contract and the clear evidence of the exceptional job done for Rory McIlroy by Horizon.</p><p>\"We will always be proud of what Rory McIlroy and Horizon achieved together and we wish him well in his future golf career.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419936906|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|7e5b4e2b15daea0a1cf9da905c7aeadbc79b5941 -->",

        "headline":"Why Rory McIlroy cannot wait for 2013 to finish",
        "body":"<p>The only thing missing from Rory McIlroy's traumatic 2013 is a relationship break-up. That news, it seems, is edging ever closer amid reports in Ireland last weekend that the golfer has finally split from his girlfriend, the Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki.</p><p>When thrown into a year which has seen McIlroy involved in legal cases worth tens of millions of pounds, slide from No1 to No6 in the world on account of missed cuts and absent form, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/02/rory-mcilroy-honda-classic-walked-out\" title=\"\">plus the public-relations disaster of a mid-tournament walk off</a>, that is quite a package. Should the Northern Irishman ever decide to write an autobiography, there will be little doubt over the key chapter.</p><p>\"Wozilroy\" has been one of the most famous and high-profile partnerships in global sport. But, from the outside, it has not been a scenario best suited to the pair's careers. When whispers first circulated about an imminent parting of the ways, almost two months ago, McIlroy was said to be as concerned by Wozniacki's tumble down the world rankings as his own on-course problems.</p><p>At the Open Championship in July, McIlroy had claimed to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/23362904\" title=\"\">\"brain dead\"</a> on course. It was an alarming statement. Since then, there have been only glimpses that he will recover some of his brilliance this year rather than regard it as a total write-off.</p><p>McIlroy has spent much of his recent time either in Belfast with childhood friends, as was the case when he took in Ulster's Heineken Cup match with Leicester on Friday night, or Dublin, where he was by Saturday. The inclination to follow the WTA Tour at any given opportunity has long since passed, it would seem.</p><p>McIlroy is nothing if not single-minded. He is not averse to change. In fact he makes a habit of it, as demonstrated by his move from International Sports Management to the Horizon group in late 2011. Now, Horizon itself has been ditched.</p><p>There has been a distinct cooling of the relationship, too, with his close friend Graeme McDowell. When McDowell married in the Bahamas last month, McIlroy was a notable absentee.</p><p>Today, Horizon and McIlroy will be represented in a Dublin courtroom as that alliance continues its own messy break-up. As with the McDowell alliance, it is sad that something which worked so well has come to this. The newly-formed Rory McIlroy Incorporated claims it has terminated the golfer's contract with Horizon under which McIlroy agreed his much-publicised £78m equipment deal with Nike. McIlroy's commercial appeal is further demonstrated by sponsorship agreements with Omega and Bose.</p><p>McIlroy believes he has a right to end that Horizon spell because it has taken too high a percentage of his sponsorship agreements.<strong> </strong>If no settlement can be reached, Horizon is set to counter-sue McIlroy for ending a five-year contract with more than half of it to run; that turn of events, needless to say, would lead to more of the golfer's financial affairs being made public than he would prefer.</p><p>Not that money should be of concern to McIlroy. He is already way beyond that stage, regardless of the Horizon outcome. In flying to the Far East this week, he begins a spell which will net him more than US$3m (£1.9m) simply for turning up at the Korea Open, the BMW Masters and for an exhibition meeting with Tiger Woods.</p><p>The WGC Championship follows that, with McIlroy still to ensure he earns a place in the European Tour's Race to Dubai final in mid-November. At that event a year ago, McIlroy confirmed his status as then the best player in the world with Wozniacki on hand to tease him at a post-round press conference.</p><p>Despite his claims to the contrary, it is difficult to imagine more going wrong during the intervening months as has already been the case.</p><p>Yet McIlroy remains a decent, engaging character despite those who have sought to demonise his personality simply because he has endured a torrid professional spell. In one particularly fierce article, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/sports/golf/mcilroy-a-native-son-divides-ireland.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">published in the United States</a>, McIlroy was portrayed in what is actually a wholly unfair manner for anybody who knows him.</p><p>It should be remembered that the root cause for McIlroy's 2013 problems has been struggles on the golf course, not a switch into an alter ego. That must also be placed against both an exceptional 2012 and McIlroy's relative youth. Throughout his career, even as an amateur, McIlroy has never been super-consistent.</p><p>In that playing sense, McIlroy's superb driving deserted him in the first part of this year. His putting, which had improved dramatically last season, has also regressed. In a technical sense, McIlroy's swing has a tendency to move off plane – or line – which triggers poor shots in both directions and therefore blunts his confidence. Not only will McIlroy know all that, he will be determined to have it fixed by the time a new year arrives.</p><p>The logical assumption is that such work is tougher when there is too much noise in the background.</p><p>If there are consolations for McIlroy as he settles in Seoul today; at least for now he is thousands of miles away from distraction, and it would seem impossible to have another year quite like this one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419907840|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|b22c321ecc10c749387fe7b4e07f990a6d1d8b58 -->",

        "body":"<p>England's David Lynn surged through the field at the Portugal Masters to claim his second European Tour title and climb back into the world's top 50. Lynn, whose only previous win in almost 400 events was at the KLM Open in 2004, carded a closing 63 to finish on 18 under par at Oceanico Victoria Golf Course in Vilamoura.</p><p>The 39-year-old started six shots off the lead but charged into contention with five birdies in a front nine of 30 and, after a bogey at the 10th, picked up further shots at the 11th, 14th, 15th and the 17th.</p><p>Justin Walters, who began the week 126th in the Race to Dubai, holed a 40ft par putt on the 18th to claim outright second on 17 under and secure his card for next season.</p><p>Lynn, 39, who had struggled to make 73 on Saturday, said: \"I was really disappointed when I walked off the course yesterday. I thought maybe I had played myself out of it. Today was just a case of I've got to go out there and make as many birdies as I can&nbsp;… and I really caught fire on the front nine.\" <strong> </strong></p><p>\"I was making everything I looked at, although I hit it to one foot at the first which got me off to a really good start. After that I made a couple of great putts for par to keep the momentum going and then I was making the birdie putts.\"</p><p>Lynn - who began the week 52nd in the world rankings - held a two-shot lead playing the last but admitted his heart was in his mouth as his approach looked set to find the water short of the green. It ended up clearing the hazard by a matter of feet and two putts later he had completed what proved to be the winning round.</p><p>Austria's Bernd Wiesberger had been just one behind with two to play but found the water with his second shot to the 17th, where playing partner Walters made his fourth birdie in a row to move to 17 under.</p><p>Walters looked certain to drop a shot on the last after finding a fairway bunker with his tee shot, but holed a massive par putt and punched the air in delight before the tears began to flow.</p><p>\"I don't know if I can talk much right now,\" said the 32-year-old from Johannesburg, whose mother died two weeks ago. \"Coming into the week I really didn't have any goals or ambitions, I just wanted to play and honour my mum and make her proud.</p><p>\"The putts kept dropping and I kept hitting some decent shots and the last one at the end, she made it for sure. It was probably the best moment of my career. It was so cool because I had a lot on the line.</p><p>\"I hadn't looked at a leaderboard all day so didn't know where I stood in terms of keeping my card and for it to go in on the last, all the emotions hit me.</p><p>\"I don't think I have the words for it just yet. Maybe after a drink with my dad who is here with me we can fully take it all in, but at first glance I don't know how I did it. I am super proud and so happy I could honour my mum. That feels the best for me right now.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419852607|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|da0f589d68682fe1326d891a894df0e0afd3104b -->",

        "body":"<h2><strong>Jamieson cards 11 birdies but misses magic 59</strong></h2><p>Scott Jamieson came close to recording the first 59 on the European Tour as he charged into contention in the Portugal Masters. The Scot carded 11 birdies in the first 17 holes of his third round at Oceanico Victoria and needed another on the last of the par-71 layout to break the magical 60 barrier. However, his approach ran just over the green and his chip from around 15ft grazed the edge of the hole, the 29-year-old from Glasgow sinking to his knees before tapping in for par. Jamieson had to settle for the 18th round of 60 in European Tour history and the second this season after American Peter Uihlein's 12-under round at Kingsbarns during the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.          <strong>PA</strong></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Márquez takes pole</h2><p>Championship leader Marc Márquez has claimed pole for Sunday's Malaysian MotoGP in Sepang. The Spaniard beat Valentino Rossi to first place with a pole record of 2min 0.011sec, with Britain's Cal Crutchlow third. Yamaha's Rossi had set the quickest lap in qualifying, but was pipped at the end of the session by Márquez, who claimed a 0.325sec advantage. Márquez leads the overall standings with 278 points, 39 ahead of second-placed Jorge Lorenzo, with Dani Pedrosa a further 20 points back. Rossi is fourth with 185.<strong>PA</strong></p><p></p><p></p><h2><strong>Test summit set for 2017</strong></h2><p>Four teams will vie for the first world Test championship in England in 2017, and the ICC is still formulating how to make the competition attractive and lucrative. International Cricket Council chief executive David Richard said at the logo unveiling ceremony he wants to have \"something worthwhile in place to make sure that it doesn't diminish the credibility of what Test cricket needs to be\". The ICC set 1 May this year to 31 December 2016 as the qualification period. <strong>AP</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419808792|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|b0981fb185c4859cb3516267a1ea8561458aab99 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sunnylands, the setting for the Xi-Obama summit under way this weekend, bills itself as a magnet for famous golf lovers: Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra and no fewer than four presidents (Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr) have teed off there.</p><p>Obama is known to be partial to 18 holes, but golf enthusiasts should not expect to see him take on Xi Jinping. Chinese leaders have been pictured kicking soccer balls (Xi) and playing basketball (former premier Wen Jiabao); it is practically <em>de rigueur</em> for them to pick up a table-tennis bat or proclaim their love of swimming (not surprising, since Chairman Mao would take to the water when he wanted to demonstrate his vigour). But golf is definitely not on the list of approved sports for the Chinese leadership to be seen playing in public.</p><p>The first and last high-profile golfer was Zhao Ziyang – the general secretary toppled for his sympathy towards the student protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p><p>A photograph in his secretly recorded memoirs shows him chipping a ball into a net in his courtyard home during his house arrest, which lasted until his death - although he was occasionally allowed out to play, surrounded by guards.</p><p>Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney,  suggests the association with Zhao, and its archetypally American image, may have helped to give the sport \"a certain negative flavour\".</p><p>It had already been banned as a bourgeois indulgence during the cultural revolution and courses were dug up, not to re-emerge until the mid-80s.</p><p>But they flourished as the economy boomed, and in 2004 China banned the creation of more courses because of concerns about the declining amount of farmland and water usage. It had little effect: the number is believed to have soared from under 200 that year to around 600.</p><p>Thanks to such illicit openings, and its popularity with China's elite, golf has also become associated with inequality, the excesses of the rich and rampant corruption.</p><p>When China's new anti-corruption chief said last week that discipline and supervision staff should return any prepaid membership cards they had been given, observers were quick to draw the link with golfing.</p><p>\"Many officials' salaries cannot afford expenses at high-end places, such as golf clubs, but they often consume in those places with membership cards,\" Zhu Lijia, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Governance, told China  Daily. </p><p>A 2008 survey by KPMG found the average cost of joining a Chinese club was $53,000: several times the modest annual salary of even a high level official.</p><p>Will the game ever become respectable? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/guan-tianlang\">The emergence of teenage prodigy Guan Tianliang</a> has probably helped to improve its image, as has the news that it will return to the Olympics in 2016. But a photo of Xi lifting a club would still be something of a surprise</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410375744|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|3420368d10619424b64cc1024a0d2be52e0652c1 -->",

        "headline":"Condoleezza Rice given green jacket as Augusta National lets women join club",
        "body":"<p>The hallowed fairways of Augusta National, the home of golf's annual Masters tournament, are being opened up to women for the first time, ending an increasingly controversial and anachronistic ban on female membership which had survived for 80 years.</p><p>Bowing to the not-so-modern concept of gender equality, the club announced on Monday it had invited two female members to join the club: former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore. </p><p>\"This is a joyous occasion,\" club chairman Billy Payne said in a statement. \"We are fortunate to consider many qualified candidates for membership at Augusta National. Consideration with regard to any candidate is deliberate, held in strict confidence and always takes place over an extended period of time. The process for Condoleezza and Darla was no different.</p><p>\"These accomplished women share our passion for the game of golf and both are well known and respected by our membership,\" Payne continued. \"It will be a proud moment when we present Condoleezza and Darla their green jackets when the club opens this fall.\"</p><p>In a statement released by the club, Rice, who served in George Bush's administration, said she looked forward to \"playing golf, renewing friendships and forming new ones through this very special opportunity\".</p><p>Moore, the vice-president of private investment firm Rainwater, said being asked to join the Augusta National represented \"a very happy and important occasion in my life\".</p><p>The announcement marks the end of a rearguard action by Payne and the Augusta leadership against the march of sexual equality. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/04/masters-2012\">As recently as the last Masters tournament in April, Payne had reaffirmed the all-male policy</a>.</p><p>After successfully fending off demands to admit women members, the club faced intense scrutiny this year following the appointment of Ginni Rometty as IBM's chief executive officer. IBM is a major sponsor of the Masters, and Rometty's four predecessors had been invited to become members of the club. However, no such invitation was issued to Rometty.</p><p>In the ensuing controversy, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/06/augusta-national-golf-club-women-members\">Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney joined the calls</a> for Augusta to abandon its men-only rule.</p><p>Martha Burk of the National Council of Women's Organisations, who has led the campaign for the club to admit women since 2002, said she was delighted at the news, but added that her invitation to join had yet to arrive. </p><p>\"I am very pleased. The woman's movement has prevailed,\" she said. \"It took a decade, but we did it. It is definitely a vindication.\"</p><p>She added: \"If I get an invite I will accept, absolutely.\"</p><p>Burk had repeatedly clashed with then Augusta chairman Hootie Johnson, who defended the policy even when it meant losing television sponsorship. Corporate sponsors, unnerved by the controversy over sexism, pulled out of the 2003 and 2004 Masters tournaments.</p><p>Before stepping down in 2006, Johnson conceded that Augusta National might one day have a woman in a green jacket, \"but not at the point of a bayonet.\" It became a battle cry for stubborn male members.</p><p>Although under the previous policy women were prohibited from gaining membership, they were allowed onto the course as guests.</p><p>It should not be surprising that Augusta National has taken so long to fall in line with the rest of society. The club, which opened in in December 1932, only accepted its first black member in 1990.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394966913|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|144abaf5c129c5dad2054f28d997afc3cc97ab80 -->",

        "body":"<p>For the first time in its 80-year history, Augusta National Golf Club has female members.</p><p>The home of golf's Masters championship, which has faced increasing criticism because of its all-male membership, invited former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore to become the first women in green jackets when the club opens for a new season in October.</p><p>Both women accepted.</p><p>\"This is a joyous occasion,\" Augusta National chairman Billy Payne said on Monday.</p><p>The move likely ends a debate that intensified in 2002 when Martha Burk of the National Council of Women's Organizations urged the club to include women among its members. Former club chairman Hootie Johnson stood his ground, even at the cost of losing Masters television sponsors for two years, when he famously said Augusta National might one day have a woman in a green jacket, \"but not at the point of a bayonet.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-394959880'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/20/1345476228955/augusta-masters-women-010.jpg' alt='augusta masters women' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Augusta National, home of the Masters. Photograph: David J Phillip/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Payne, who took over as chairman in 2006 when Johnson retired, said consideration for new members is deliberate and private, and that Rice and Moore were not treated differently from other new members. Even so, he took the rare step of announcing two of the latest members to join because of the historical significance.</p><p>\"These accomplished women share our passion for the game of golf and both are well known and respected by our membership,\" Payne said in a statement. \"It will be a proud moment when we present Condoleezza and Darla their green jackets when the club opens this fall. This is a significant and positive time in our club's history and, on behalf of our membership, I wanted to take this opportunity to welcome them and all of our new members into the Augusta National family.\"</p><p>A person with knowledge of club operations said Rice and Moore first were considered as members five years ago. That would be four years after the 2003 Masters, when Burk's protest in a grass lot down the street from the club attracted only about 30 supporters, and one year after Payne became chairman.</p><p>Moore and Johnson are close friends, both with roots in South Carolina and banking, and the person said Payne and Johnson agreed on the timing of a female member. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the club typically does not discuss membership issues, said it was important to Payne to be respectful of the membership process. The person said prospective members often are not aware they are being considered.</p><p>Augusta National, which opened in December 1932 and did not have a black member until 1990, is believed to have about 300 members. While the club until now had no female members, women were allowed to play the golf course as guests, including on the Sunday before the Masters week began in April.</p><p>The issue of female membership resurfaced again this year after Virginia Rometty was appointed chief executive of IBM, one of the Masters' corporate sponsors. The previous four CEOs of Big Blue had all been Augusta National members, leading to speculation that the club would break at least one tradition – membership for the top executive of IBM or a men-only club.</p><p>Rometty was seen at the Masters on the final day wearing a pink jacket, not a green one. She was not announced as one of the newest members.</p><p>Moore, 58, first rose to prominence in the 1980s with Chemical Bank, where she became the highest-paid woman in the banking industry. She is vice president of Rainwater, a private investment company founded by her husband, Richard Rainwater. She was the first woman to be profiled on the cover of Fortune Magazine, and she made a $25 million contribution to her alma mater, South Carolina, which renamed its business school after her.</p><p>Moore was mentioned as a possible Augusta National member during the height of the all-male membership debate in 2002. She and Johnson worked on South Carolina's $300 million capital campaign in the late 1990s.</p><p>\"Augusta National has always captured my imagination, and is one of the most magically beautiful places anywhere in the world, as everyone gets to see during the Masters each April,\" Moore said. \"I am fortunate to have many friends who are members at Augusta National, so to be asked to join them as a member represents a very happy and important occasion in my life.</p><p>\"Above all, Augusta National and the Masters Tournaments have always stood for excellence, and that is what is so important to me.\"</p><p>Rice, 57, was the national security adviser under former President George W. Bush and became secretary of state in his second term. The first black woman to be a Stanford provost in 1993, she now is a professor of political economy at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.</p><p>\"I have visited Augusta National on several occasions and look forward to playing golf, renewing friendships and forming new ones through this very special opportunity,\" Rice said in a statement released by the club. \"I have long admired the important role Augusta National has played in the traditions and history of golf. I also have an immense respect for the Masters Tournament and its commitment to grow the game of golf, particularly with youth, here in the United States and throughout the world.\"</p><p>Rice recently was appointed to the US Golf Association's nominating committee.</p><p>Johnson regarded the membership debate as infringing on the rights of a private club, even though every April it hosts the Masters, the most popular of the four major championships, which brings in millions of dollars through television rights for the highest-rated telecast in golf.</p><p>In a 2002 interview with the Associated Press, Johnson said the makeup of the club was more about four members-only parties each year than who plays the course.</p><p>\"Our club has enjoyed a camaraderie and a closeness that's served us well for so long, that it makes it difficult for us to consider change,\" he said. \"A woman may be a member of this club one day, but that is out in the future.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394959069|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|04007bf11da0a5e72939024e69a6d45740d07713 -->",

        "headline":"Tiger Woods' hopes for comeback overshadowed by ex-coach's memoir",
        "body":"<p>When Tiger Woods tees off in the first round of the Masters in Augusta on Thursday, millions of golf fans will be wondering if the former world No&nbsp;1 can bring off one of the greatest comeback stories in professional sport.</p><p>After winning his first tournament in two-and-a-half years last month, Woods appears set finally to put the turmoil of his life and career behind him since details first emerged of his repeated extramarital dalliances.</p><p>\"Americans love second chances and stories of redemption. Most golf fans are very eager to have him back,\" said Orin Starn, a professor of cultural anthropology at  Duke University in North Carolina and author of <em>The Passion of Tiger Woods. \"</em>Like him or hate him, he has provided spectacular drama.\"</p><p>But, like most things in Woods's career since a night-time car accident in Florida first hinted at problems in his domestic life, the path to redemption is still not entirely smooth. Last week Woods's camp reacted with fury to the publication of a tell-all book, <em>The Big Miss,</em> by his former swing coach Hank Haney.</p><p>Haney's book did not contain too many surprises, especially around the string of mistresses who turned the golfer from admired family man to tabloid fodder.</p><p>Instead it just confirmed a portrait of a Woods that most people already thought they knew: hyper-focused, unemotional and self-absorbed. But Woods's agent, Mark Steinberg, issued a slamming statement anyway. \"Haney admits he never had in-depth, personal discussions with Tiger. This self-serving book is full of guesses and false assumptions,\" he said.</p><p>When a journalist asked the fitness-obsessed Woods recently about the book's claim that – in reaction to his personal crises – he had considered giving up golf and joining the elite Navy Seals, Woods got into a terse exchange with the reporter that included him saying: \"You're a beauty, you know that?\" Woods faces another press conference on Tuesday in Augusta.</p><p>More recently pictures of an unsmiling Woods signing autographs showed that his ability to relate comfortably to his public might still need a little polishing. \"He looked like a resentful killer robot signing autographs. He still had that imperious stare. After everything that has changed in his life he is still the same old Tiger Woods,\" said Starn.</p><p>But now there is another blast from the past: Woods is the bookies' favourite for the Masters, one of golf's four major championships. For many observers that matters more to the rehabilitation than any of his still icy behaviour or fresh revelations about his past. In the end Woods and golf – like any sport and its major star – is a business that is all about money and success. An on-form Woods playing at the Masters is already a talking point. If he were to look like winning, then TV ratings for the tournament would go through the roof. It could also mean a bonanza for Woods as advertisers, who abandoned the star in the wake of his fall from grace, might be tempted to flock back with endorsement offers. \"That tide might shift totally after next weekend. If he is in contention to win it, then it will be a huge event,\" said Frank Shorr, the director of the Sports Institute at Boston University.</p><p>But even if Woods does triumph in Augusta – a tournament that he has won four times, but not since 2005 – he will still be a very different figure from the pre-scandal sporting hero. He had always been held up as a family man with the perfect marriage, mixing that with a turbo-charged  style that saw him dominate his sport. That is never coming back.  After an expensive divorce, therapeutic counselling and changes in both caddies and coaches, Woods is rising back to the top of his sport. But there is also a sense that many of the golfing public in America are ready to back him again.</p><p>\"I am sure he will be re-embraced by corporate America. But it will be a different Tiger Woods. It will not be the family man, straight-arrow role model,\" said Starn.</p><p>It is, of course, hard to tell if Woods will care too much. Haney's book repeatedly describes a man whose emotions and thoughts are impossible to read, even for someone who spent six years as a close companion and teacher. \"Whether with friends, business associates, other players, his mother or his wife… he seemed to keep the atmosphere around him emotionally arid,\" Haney wrote.</p><p>Which is something that sounds familiar to any serious follower of Woods's career: the more it has changed the more he has stayed the same.</p><p>His intense, blank expression does not seem to shift. \"He has gone through so many life changes, but when you see him from the outside it is very hard to tell,\" said Shorr.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/388117450|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|066ddd086c7f1d9bbaf7e0b00cf67c949c95770e -->",

        "headline":"Seve Ballesteros remembered by Gary Lineker",
        "body":"<p>My mum fancied Seve Ballesteros to death. It was the only time she'd ever watch golf, if Seve was playing. She thought he was gorgeous.</p><p>When I was a boy he was one of my heroes. He wasn't a conventional golfer – all fairways and greens and cautious play. Rather he was a swashbuckler. He had huge charisma. Whatever position he was in he'd somehow conjure up a magical shot to get out of it.</p><p>I first met him in 1999, playing in a pro-am tournament at Woburn before the British Masters. I remember seeing in the draw that I was playing with Seve; I had about 50 people asking if they could caddie for me, which was wholly unusual. Seve was in great form. Not necessarily in terms of his game – Woburn is a tight course, and Seve is pretty wild off the tee; he was forever in the trees. He still hit some incredible shots. He holed a putt that twisted left and right and up and down before dropping in. A monster shot, and he gave one of his typical celebrations – the big smile and fist pump. The celebration wasn't quite on a par with winning his first British Open, in 1979 in his famous blue jumper, but it wasn't far off.</p><p>I was fortunate to spend a lot of time in his company that day, and latterly I worked with him a number of times through the BBC. I wouldn't presume to claim Seve as a mate, but we got on well. He was a big Barcelona fan  and would always want to talk about football while I would always want to talk about golf.</p><p>He was ill for a long time, having been diagnosed with brain cancer in 2008. It was a constant source of conversation in the game: how's Seve? People were worried about him. At big tournaments, especially the Ryder Cup, there was always an atmosphere, a feeling, a thought towards Seve. It was a difficult time in the game, especially, I imagine, for players who'd played with him, and his close friends, the Spanish guys, José María Olazábal in particular, after that amazing partnership he and Seve had in Ryder Cups over the years.</p><p>After he died, in May, we made a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012lt4d\" title=\"\">tribute film</a> at the BBC. It was great to see new footage of him, and to hear all the stories about him, particularly from his caddies. He was so fiercely competitive, and always, perhaps, quick to blame the caddy – as most golfers are. Always better to blame someone else because confidence is everything in sport. But I think the caddies had a pretty tough time with him; that was something I hadn't realised before, that he could be difficult to work with.</p><p>But there were some terrific stories about him. There was once a kid at the side of the green, making noise, and Seve turned to him to say something like: \"You're nervous? You don't think I am?\" I thought that summed him up. It was a chastisement but done with great charm, great humour. That was Seve.</p><p>I spoke to him on a few occasions before his death. I interviewed him on the phone for the BBC a couple of years ago about his illness. He wanted to raise awareness about brain cancer, and it was a very emotional interview. He spoke deeply about what he was going through, the mental sides of his disease. There were a couple of times when I struggled to speak. Later I called him in the hope that he might be able to come over to receive the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/8405808.stm\" title=\"\">lifetime achievement award</a> at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. He was too ill to fly. That would be the last time I spoke to him.</p><p>Seve was one of the absolute greats, a pioneering European golfer, arguably Europe's first superstar – someone who transcended his sport because of that aura that he had, that charisma, those incredible good looks. We've had great players in Europe before, and we'll have them again. But nothing quite like Seve.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/382900769|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|128863c735e6053d07524dbb256d51cbd839a4be -->",
