        "headline":"Skype under investigation in Luxembourg over link to NSA",
        "body":"<p>Skype is being investigated by Luxembourg's data protection commissioner over concerns about its secret involvement with the US National Security Agency (NSA) spy programme Prism, the Guardian has learned.</p><p>The Microsoft-owned internet chat company could potentially face criminal and administrative sanctions, including a ban on passing users' communications covertly to the US signals intelliigence agency.</p><p>Skype itself is headquartered in the European country, and could also be fined if an investigation concludes that the data sharing is found in violation of the country's data-protection laws.</p><p>The Guardian understands that Luxembourg's data-protection commissioner initiated a probe into Skype's privacy policies following revelations in June about its ties to the NSA.</p><p>The country's data-protection chief, Gerard Lommel, declined to comment for this story, citing an ongoing investigation. Microsoft also declined to comment on the issue. </p><p>Luxembourg has attracted several large corporations, including Amazon and Netflix, due to its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/24/amazon-tax-loophole-ebooks\">tax structure</a>. </p><p>Its constitution enshrines the right to privacy and states that secrecy of correspondence is inviolable unless the law provides otherwise. Surveillance of communications in Luxembourg can only occur with judicial approval or by authorisation of a tribunal selected by the prime minister.</p><p>However, it is unclear whether Skype's transfer of communications to the NSA have been sanctioned by Luxembourg through a secret legal assistance or data transfer agreement that would not be known to the data protection commissioner at the start of their inquiry.</p><p>Microsoft's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data\">acquisition of Skype tripled some types of data flow to the NSA, according to top-secret documents seen by the Guardian</a>.</p><p>Microsoft <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/10/microsoft-buys-skype-biggest-gamble-yet\">bought Skype</a> for $8.5bn (&pound;5.6bn) in 2011.</p><p>The US software giant was the first technology group to be brought within the NSA initative known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">Prism</a>, a scheme involving some of the internet's biggest consumer companies passing data on targeted users to the US under secret court orders.</p><p>Having once been considered a secure chat tool beyond the reach of government eavesdropping, Skype is now facing a backlash in the wake of the Prism revelations.</p><p>&quot;The only people who lose are users,&quot; says Eric King, head of research at human rights group <a href=\"https://www.privacyinternational.org/\">Privacy International</a>. &quot;Skype promoted itself as a fantastic tool for secure communications around the world, but quickly caved to government pressure and can no longer be trusted to protect user privacy.&quot;</p><h2>Skype's legacy of encryption and security</h2><p>Founded in Scandinavia in 2003, Skype was designed to connect callers through an encrypted peer-to-peer internet connection, meaning audio conversations between Skype users are not routed over a centralised network like conventional phone calls. Video and chat connections are <a href=\"https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA31/does-skype-use-encryption\">also encrypted</a>.</p><p>Attracting millions of users worldwide – 12.9 million people had registered to use the service by 2004, and by 2011 that figure had reached more than 600 million – Skype's reputation for privacy and security led to it being adopted by journalists and activists as a tool to evade government surveillance. But some criminals, too, turned to the tool to dodge law enforcement agencies – frustrating police, who had previously been able to eavesdrop on suspects' conversations by 'wiretapping' phone lines.</p><p>A turning point came in 2005, when US company eBay purchased Skype for $2.6bn (&pound;1.6bn). The same year, Skype formed a joint venture with Hong Kong-based internet company Tom Online to launch a Chinese version of Skype, which was tweaked to be compliant with dragnet surveillance.</p><h2>Skype China customised for monitoring</h2><p>A former Skype engineer, who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the issue, told the Guardian that the company worked to build in a &quot;listening element&quot; to help Chinese authorities monitor users' communications for keywords, triggering a warning to alert the government when certain phrases get typed into its chat interface.</p><p>In response to questions about suspected monitoring of Skype chats in China, Skype has <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-08/skypes-been-hijacked-in-china-and-microsoft-is-o-dot-k-dot-with-it\">previously stated</a> that its software is made available in the country &quot;through a joint venture with Tom Online. As majority partner in the joint venture, Tom has established procedures to meet its obligations under local laws.&quot;</p><p>While publicly insisting it was unable to help law enforcement agencies <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9963028-38.html\">eavesdrop on calls</a>, Skype set up a secretive internal initiative called &quot;Project Chess&quot; to explore how it could make calls available to authorities, according to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/technology/silicon-valley-and-spy-agency-bound-by-strengthening-web.html?_r=0\">New York Times report</a> published in June.</p><p>A year later, Skype was <a href=\"http://about.skype.com/2009/09/ebay_inc_signs_definitive_agre.html)\">purchased from eBay by an investor group</a> including US private equity firms Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz. During this period, work began on integrating Skype into the NSA's Prism program, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data\">documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden</a> have revealed.</p><h2>The first 'eavesdropped' Skype call</h2><p>In February 2011, according to the NSA files, Skype was served with a directive to comply with NSA surveillance signed by the US attorney general. Within days, the spy agency reported that it had successfully eavesdropped on a Skype call. And when Microsoft acquired Skype in May 2011, the relationship with the NSA appears to have intensified.</p><p>Caspar Bowden, who served as Microsoft's chief privacy adviser between 2002 and 2011 and left shortly before the completion of its Skype takeover, says he was not surprised to learn the company had complied with the NSA's surveillance of the chat tool.</p><p>While working for Microsoft, Bowden says he was not privy to details of secret data-collection programs – but fully briefed the company on the dangers of US spy law the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for the privacy of its international cloud customers. He was met with a &quot;wall of silence,&quot; he says.</p><p>A letter obtained by the Guardian, sent by Skype's corporate vice president Mark Gillett to Privacy International in September 2012, suggested that group video calls and instant messages could be obtained by law enforcement because they are routed through its central servers and &quot;may be temporarily stored.&quot;</p><p>But Gillett also said in the letter that audio and one-to-one video calls made using Skype's &quot;full client&quot; on computers were encrypted and did not pass through central servers – implying that the company could not help authorities intercept them.</p><p>Separately, in July 2012, Skype contributed to UK parliamentary committee hearings on the government's proposed expansion of surveillance powers under the controversial communications data bill. Skype representative Stephen Collins claimed in testimony to the committee that &quot;there are no keys held by Skype to decrypt communications.&quot;</p><h2>Microsoft calls for more government transparency</h2><p>Skype told the Guardian that it would not answer technical questions about how it turns over calls to the authorities or comment on the extent of its compliance with US surveillance. The company insisted the information it provided the UK parliament was accurate, though would not explain apparent discrepancies between its public statements and access to Skype calls claimed by the NSA.</p><p>In a statement, Skype said it believed that the world needed &quot;a more open and public discussion&quot; about the balance between privacy and security but accused the US government of stifling the conversation.</p><p>&quot;Microsoft believes the US constitution guarantees our freedom to share more information with the public, yet the government is stopping us,&quot; a spokesperson for Skype said, referring to an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/28/microsoft-google-fisa-united-states-government\">ongoing legal case</a> in which Microsoft is seeking permission to disclose more information about the number of surveillance requests it receives.</p><p>However, the law that underpins the Prism program – FISA – allows the NSA to target not only suspected terrorists and spies, but also &quot;foreign-based political organisations,&quot; which could encompass an array of advocacy groups and potentially news organisations, too.</p><h2>'Journalists should avoid Skype'</h2><p>Gr&eacute;goire Pouget, an information security expert at <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org\">Reporters Without Borders</a>, believes that journalists should not underestimate the risks posed by NSA Skype surveillance.</p><p>&quot;It is what many of us feared, and now we know for sure,&quot; Pouget says. &quot;If you are a journalist working on issues that could interest the US government or some of their allies, you should not use Skype.&quot;</p><p>Although the NSA has access to at least some Skype calls, it remains unclear whether police and security agencies outside the US enjoy a similar level of access.</p><p>Hacking Team, an Italian company, sells surveillance software to law enforcement and intelligence agencies in 30 countries that allows authorities to covertly infiltrate computers with spyware that records communications before they are encrypted. The Milan-based firm explicitly markets the Trojan tool as a means to get access to Skype conversations – and says authorities still frequently complain about a lack of ability to eavesdrop on Skype calls.</p><p>&quot;When you talk to law enforcement about what their concerns are, they'll right away mention Skype,&quot; says Eric Rabe, Hacking Team's spokesman.</p><p>Rabe declines to name customers, citing confidentiality agreements, but says Hacking Team's business has been &quot;growing very nicely&quot; in recent years. The company's public accounts show that its revenue more than doubled from $5.3m in 2010 to a projected $11.8m in 2012.</p><h2>The new wave of encrypted services</h2><p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, new companies are now emerging in response to fears about surveillance of Skype, promising users access to encrypted chat tools that do not have secret 'backdoors' for NSA surveillance.</p><p>Washington DC-based Silent Circle is one such company, going to extraordinary lengths to shield customers against spying. With founders including Phil Zimmermann, who devised the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) email encryption product, and a former Navy Seal, Silent Circle offers a series of encrypted phone apps and a Skype-style internet chat platform. </p><p>It is registered as an offshore company and uses computer servers outside the US in a bid to evade government coercion. It <a href=\"http://silentcircle.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/to-our-customers/\">recently closed</a> its own encrypted email service because it could not guarantee security, and said it would focus instead on chat and telephony.</p><p>The FBI has already held meetings with Silent Circle, according to CEO Mike Janke, accusing it of being a &quot;ghost provider&quot; that could cause harm to the US because it stores virtually no information about its users' communications.</p><p>But Janke, a 45-year-old former Navy Seal sniper, says his company will not cede to government pressure to secretly comply with surveillance. &quot;I feel that we can use Skype as a template,&quot; Janke says, &quot;for what we don't want to do.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416035266|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|d5123a26f9ed45e9c34be99b66d2045da88f9894 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's spooks are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/09/mi5-gchq-surveillance-analysis\" title=\"\">striking back</a>. Weeks, months, after the Guardian, Washington Post and German magazine der Spiegel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/oct/10/nsa-files-guardian-front-pages\" title=\"\">published</a> documents about the massive surveillance operations of GCHQ and its close US electronic eavesdropping partner, the National Security Agency, they are saying the leaks have done more damage than the infamous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Five\" title=\"\">Cambridge spy ring</a>. Indeed, they suggest, the full extent of the damage done may never be fully assessed.</p><p>Sir David Omand, a former GCHQ director, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/defence/article3892012.ece\" title=\"\">told the Times newspaper</a> today that the leaks by former CIA contractor Edward Snowden was \"the most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever, much worse than [Guy] Burgess and [Donald] MacLean in the 50s\".</p><p>Yet when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/11/guardian-correct-publish-nsa-vince-cable\" title=\"\">Vince Cable was asked</a> what he thought about the decision to publish leaked material, the business secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Guardian had performed \"a very considerable public service\". He called for \"proper political oversight\" of the security and intelligence agencies. Then a few hours later, Nigel Inkster, a former deputy chief of MI6, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the Snowden leaks were \"comparable\" to those by the Cambridge spies, \"only worse\". Yet last month he played down the impact of the leaks, described them as \"very embarrassing, uncomfortable, and unfortunate\". He added, clearly referring to al-Qaida-inspired terrorists: \"I sense that those most interested in the activities of the NSA and GCHQ have not been told very much they didn't know already or could have inferred.\"</p><p>It is the job of the spooks to carry out damage assessments after leaks and security and intelligence failures. However, it is unclear whether, as those who make the dramatic comparison with the Cambridge spies suggest, the spooks are concerned more about information getting into the hands of the Russians and Chinese than the \"gift\" the leaks gave to terrorists, as the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, put it in his  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\" title=\"\">speech</a>. Terrorists, of course, pose as much a threat to Russia and China as they do to the UK.</p><p>The spooks avoid the issue by describing the damage done by the leaks as \"incalculable\". It is reminiscent of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Report\" title=\"\">Scott \"arms-to-Iraq\" inquiry</a> which revealed how security and intelligence officials told ministers they had no choice but to sign gagging orders to prevent parliament and MPs know what the spooks were up to. Lord Scott at one point asked a Foreign Office minister about Whitehall's claim that \"disclosure of any sources or alleged sources of intelligence information\" would cause \"unquantifiable damage\". Should that be taken as covering \"both unquantifiably great and also miniscule\". \"Yes,\" replied the minister sternly.</p><p>In an exchange about Whitehall's deeply ingrained \"need to know\" principle, Scott's legal counsel was provoked into telling a Ministry of Defence official: \"If you were not told about something, you don't know if you need to know it.\" Or as John Major explained to the Scott inquiry, what information was given to ministers was always \"a value judgment\".</p><p>That is what ministers are now worried about, and probably prompted Cable's call for political oversight of the spooks. GCHQ, based in Cheltenham, has been left to its own devices, with ministers having little idea what it has been up to. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state\" title=\"\">recent suggestion in the Guardian</a> by former Lib Dem minister Chris Huhne that members of the cabinet and the National Security Council were not aware of the GCHQ-NSA surveillance operations is confirmed by reliable political and official sources who are in a position to know.</p><p>There is a lack of effective political, as well as parliamentary and judicial oversight, of the security and intelligence agencies. Meanwhile, instead of attacking the recipients of the leaks, GCHQ, David Cameron, Jack Straw and others now queuing up to criticise the Guardian should tell the US to look at its own security, and ask why a junior CIA official turned private contractor possessed so much sensitive information – collected by British as well as American intelligence agencies.</p><p>And it is perhaps ironic, given the dramatic comparison made by Omand and others, that the real damage done by the Cambridge spy ring, as opposed to the embarrassment it caused British ministers and British spooks, has almost certainly been grossly exaggerated.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419735016|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|6135499b2bab48a5513d5404744bee83e21401f8 -->",

        "headline":"Five key claims from MI5 chief's defence of GCHQ surveillance analysed",
        "body":"<p><strong>On Tuesday the head of MI5 Andrew Parker </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\" title=\"\"><strong>gave a speech</strong></a><strong> in which he mounted a robust defence of GCHQ and its surveillance methods. Though he didn't name Edward Snowden or the Guardian by name, he explicitly criticised recent leaks from the whistleblower. Here are the key extracts from the speech – along with the Guardian's analysis and context:</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong><em>\"We only apply intrusive tools and capabilities against terrorists and others threatening national security. The law requires we only collect and access information that we really need to perform our functions, in this case tackling the threat of terrorism.\"</em></p><p>It is true that if MI5 wants to target an individual, or a group, then it has to seek a warrant from the home secretary. But what Snowden revealed is something quite different. In Tempora, GCHQ has a programme that is capable of sucking up vast amounts of personal data from the undersea cables that carry internet traffic in and out of the UK. That is not a narrow targeting capability. It gives the agency access to the private communications of millions of people.</p><p>This is allowed under a little known section of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa), which was brought in 13 years ago, long before Tempora was devised. GCHQ has relied on paragraph four of section 8 &nbsp;to gain \"external warrants\". In most Ripa cases, a minister has to be told the name of an individual or company being targeted before a warrant is granted. But section 8 permits GCHQ to perform sweeping and indiscriminate trawls of external data if a minister issues a certificate along with the warrant.</p><p>According to the Snowden documents, the certificate allows GCHQ to search for material under a number of themes, including intelligence on the political intentions of foreign governments; military postures of foreign countries; terrorism, international drug trafficking and fraud. One briefing notes says such sweeping certificates \"cover the entire range of GCHQ's intelligence production\".</p><p>The raw material is then recycled through machine-reading programmes which look for key words, names, phrases and patterns.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> <em>\"In some quarters there seems to be a vague notion that we monitor everyone and all their communications … utter nonsense.\"</em></p><p>Nobody has ever claimed this is happening. But by exaggerating the point, Parker swerves around another truth – that the UK's intelligence agencies are already scooping up more material than ever before, and GCHQ has an ambition to go further.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\" title=\"\">Documents seen by the Guardian</a> described how the agency is seeking to \"exploit any phone, anywhere, any time\". Tempora already gives GCHQ the capacity to collect more than 21 petabytes of data a day – equivalent to sending all the information in all the books in the British Library 192 times every 24 hours. In 2011, 350 British analysts and 200 from the NSA were sifting through the Tempora database.</p><p>In the US, Snowden's files have disclosed how the simple \"metadata\" of every single call made within America is available to the intelligence services. It is not known whether Britain has the same capability. The intelligence agencies argue these tools are essential for tracking down terrorists. Privacy campaigners insist the scope and reach of these programmes goes beyond the reach of a set of outdated laws, and that the agencies are acting without a public mandate.</p><p><strong>3. </strong><em>\"It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will.\"</em></p><p>This was the key soundbite of the speech – and it was provocative. But Parker did not provide any details to support the claim, nor can he. His view is the leaks have damaged national security, but the former director of operations and intelligence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/mi6-plays-down-damage-edward-snowden-leaks\" title=\"\">MI6, Nigel Inkster,</a> has been more sceptical. \"I sense that those most interested in the activities of the NSA and GCHQ have not been told much they didn't already know or could have inferred.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/06/11/in-nsa-leak-case-a-whistle-blower-or-a-criminal/before-prosecuting-snowden-investigate-the-government\" title=\"\">In an opinion piece for the New York Times</a>, the security specialist Bruce Schneier said the argument about compromising national security \"doesn't even pass the laugh test\".</p><p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">the New York Times reported</a> Snowden's disclosures had caused less damage than another self-inflicted leak. Apparently, there has been a \"sharp drop in terrorists' use of a major communications channel\" after the US press revealed American spies had intercepted messages between two senior al-Qaida commanders in the Middle East.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> <em>\"Successive governments have made careful decisions about both the scale and powers of organisations like MI5, proportionate to the threats, and have gone no further. Britain is a democracy that rightly prizes the freedom of the individual.\"</em></p><p>The three principal laws that set out the parameters for the intelligence agencies are the 1994 Intelligence Services Act, the Human Rights Act, and Ripa 2000. None of them could possibly have anticipated the technological advances that have been made in surveillance capabilities over the last few years. The former chair of parliament's intelligence and security committee, Lord King, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/26/uk-surveillance-laws-need-overhaul\" title=\"\">has said it is high time these laws are reviewed and updated</a>. The former director of GCHQ, Sir David Omand, and a former director general of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, have also questioned whether the agencies need to be more transparent and accept more rigorous scrutiny of their work.</p><p>None of them think the agencies have anything to fear by being a little more open and transparent. On Monday, a former legal director of MI5 and MI6, David Bickford, added his weight to the calls for change, saying the intelligence agencies should seek authority for secret operations from a judge rather than a minister because of public unease about their surveillance techniques is at an all-time high.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> <em>\"Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm.\"</em></p><p>Parker is upset about Snowden, but this is probably a veiled dig at the government too. The agencies have been frustrated that reporting of the Snowden files could not be shut down completely. For them, there is no public interest in revealing the scale of the programmes being undertaken.</p><p>Tuesday night's speech was the result of months of pent up frustration, and it glossed over the fact the Guardian changed significant details in some of the stories at the request of officials from the Cabinet Office. The number of people \"in the know\" about Britain's surveillance capabilities seems to be very small indeed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state\" title=\"\">Earlier this week the former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne said the Cabinet were kept in the dark</a>. The National Security Council wasn't told either.</p><p>Parker said MI5 could not stop every plot and neutralise every threat – which is true. But he has to be careful not to develop a narrative in which he is seen to be preemptively blaming whistleblowers for any future attacks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419511881|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|0730875a3b1d2541a25916c375b80c00852b7424 -->",

        "body":"<p>Nick Clegg has welcomed \"a totally legitimate debate\" concerning powerful technologies deployed by the security services, but said some of the technical detail published by the Guardian from files leaked by Edward Snowden would be of use to technicians among terrorists.</p><p>The deputy prime minister also called for a debate about the accountability of the security services, and admitted that the regulations covering their activities were designed for a different age.</p><p>His remarks suggest he may be willing to reopen the debate about the communications bill that he vetoed earlier this year as disproportionate.</p><p>Clegg, speaking on Thursday in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\" title=\"\">criticism of the Guardian by the security services</a>, said on LBC's Call Clegg programme: \"I certainly agree that if what you end up doing is publishing very technical information that most Guardian readers, and most of us frankly, would not understand and the only people who would understand are the technicians amongst the terrorists, then what is the public interest in that?\"</p><p>On Wednesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/09/david-cameron-mi5-chief-edward-snowden-gchq-leaks\" title=\"\">Downing Street offered strong support to Andrew Parker, the MI5 director general</a>, who had described leaks as a \"gift\" to potential terrorists, although he did not mention Snowden by name.</p><p>Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian's editor-in-chief, defended the paper's reporting on Wednesday, saying the NSA files had exposed formidable technologies that went beyond anything imagined by George Orwell. Rusbridger said: \"They [the authorities] have information they couldn't dream of harvesting 10 years ago and they will always want more. There has to be a balance.\"</p><p>Rusbridger also said there was a contrast between the hostile official British reaction to the disclosures and the response in the US, where Barack Obama has called for a debate on the extent of state surveillance.</p><p>On LBC, Clegg said: \"There is a totally legitimate debate to be had, and in my experience from speaking to people in the security services they recognise this, about the use of these incredibly powerful technologies.</p><p>\"We have legislation – regulations – that were designed for an age that is quite different now. Both terrorist states and security services conduct this battle online in a way that was quite unimaginable just a few years ago. What that means for privacy and proportionality is a totally legitimate area for debate. How you hold the secret parts of any state to account is an incredibly important  issue.\"</p><p>He said: \"We have to defend the principle of secrecy but you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is a proper form of accountability.\"</p><p>He said the system of accountability had been improved under the coalition. But he then added: \"I saw a previous head of MI5 say recently just to expect the public to accept some slightly opaque arrangement at Westminster is the way to hold everyone to account in which the public do not have much of an insight. I think it is right to ask whether there is anything more we can do to make sure the public feel accountability is working in this area properly.\"</p><p>Asked if the Guardian had gone too far in the level of detail it published, he replied: \"I have got no doubt that some parts of what was published, which will have passed most readers of the Guardian completely by because they were very technical … were of immense interest to those who wish us harm.\"</p><p>Asked if the Guardian had been wrong, he said: \"There is a totally legitimate debate about the power of these technologies, about how you get the balance right, how you do make sure these technologies are used in an accountable and proportionate way, but I don't think just giving technical secrets to those who wish to do us harm serves any purpose.\"</p><p>Downing Street declined on Thursday to say whether any laws were broken by the Guardian when it published the NSA documents. The prime minister's spokesman was asked whether the law had been broken after Prof Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said a prosecution should take place under the Official Secrets Act.</p><p>The spokesman said: \"With regard to laws, the enforcement of laws, that sort of thing – those are not questions for government. So I will put that to one side. On the wider issue I said yesterday that he [the prime minister] thought that the director general [of MI5] Andrew Parker had given an excellent speech and I would happily re-underline this point.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419570953|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|e8881048cdcff1dc297c99a7ed2509564974e7ec -->",

Any member of the National Security Council, frankly any member of the cabinet, is able … to get access to this information and they are able to go and have those conversations.\"</p><p>Cameron was also asked whether people should read the Guardian after it published the Snowden leaks. He said: \"People can read any newspaper they want. There are days when I recommend reading absolutely no newspaper at all.\"</p><p></p><p>He defended oversight of the security services but said he was \"happy to listen\" to suggestions about how it could be improved.</p><p>\"I am satisfied the work these agencies do is not only vital but it is properly overseen,\" he said. \"That is what this debate needs to be about. Do we want to have well-funded, intelligent services that help keep people safe?</p><p>\"If people want to suggest improvements about how they are governed and looked after I am very happy to listen to those, but as far as I can see we have a very good system.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419593715|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|8ee981e7d86eee8a262e00ff9b8bb3a9baef99c6 -->",

        "headline":"Skype under investigation in Luxembourg over link to NSA",
        "body":"<p>Skype is being investigated by Luxembourg's data protection commissioner over concerns about its secret involvement with the US National Security Agency (NSA) spy programme Prism, the Guardian has learned.</p><p>The Microsoft-owned internet chat company could potentially face criminal and administrative sanctions, including a ban on passing users' communications covertly to the US signals intelliigence agency.</p><p>Skype itself is headquartered in the European country, and could also be fined if an investigation concludes that the data sharing is found in violation of the country's data-protection laws.</p><p>The Guardian understands that Luxembourg's data-protection commissioner initiated a probe into Skype's privacy policies following revelations in June about its ties to the NSA.</p><p>The country's data-protection chief, Gerard Lommel, declined to comment for this story, citing an ongoing investigation. Microsoft also declined to comment on the issue. </p><p>Luxembourg has attracted several large corporations, including Amazon and Netflix, due to its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/24/amazon-tax-loophole-ebooks\">tax structure</a>. </p><p>Its constitution enshrines the right to privacy and states that secrecy of correspondence is inviolable unless the law provides otherwise. Surveillance of communications in Luxembourg can only occur with judicial approval or by authorisation of a tribunal selected by the prime minister.</p><p>However, it is unclear whether Skype's transfer of communications to the NSA have been sanctioned by Luxembourg through a secret legal assistance or data transfer agreement that would not be known to the data protection commissioner at the start of their inquiry.</p><p>Microsoft's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data\">acquisition of Skype tripled some types of data flow to the NSA, according to top-secret documents seen by the Guardian</a>.</p><p>Microsoft <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/10/microsoft-buys-skype-biggest-gamble-yet\">bought Skype</a> for $8.5bn (&pound;5.6bn) in 2011.</p><p>The US software giant was the first technology group to be brought within the NSA initative known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">Prism</a>, a scheme involving some of the internet's biggest consumer companies passing data on targeted users to the US under secret court orders.</p><p>Having once been considered a secure chat tool beyond the reach of government eavesdropping, Skype is now facing a backlash in the wake of the Prism revelations.</p><p>&quot;The only people who lose are users,&quot; says Eric King, head of research at human rights group <a href=\"https://www.privacyinternational.org/\">Privacy International</a>. &quot;Skype promoted itself as a fantastic tool for secure communications around the world, but quickly caved to government pressure and can no longer be trusted to protect user privacy.&quot;</p><h2>Skype's legacy of encryption and security</h2><p>Founded in Scandinavia in 2003, Skype was designed to connect callers through an encrypted peer-to-peer internet connection, meaning audio conversations between Skype users are not routed over a centralised network like conventional phone calls. Video and chat connections are <a href=\"https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA31/does-skype-use-encryption\">also encrypted</a>.</p><p>Attracting millions of users worldwide – 12.9 million people had registered to use the service by 2004, and by 2011 that figure had reached more than 600 million – Skype's reputation for privacy and security led to it being adopted by journalists and activists as a tool to evade government surveillance. But some criminals, too, turned to the tool to dodge law enforcement agencies – frustrating police, who had previously been able to eavesdrop on suspects' conversations by 'wiretapping' phone lines.</p><p>A turning point came in 2005, when US company eBay purchased Skype for $2.6bn (&pound;1.6bn). The same year, Skype formed a joint venture with Hong Kong-based internet company Tom Online to launch a Chinese version of Skype, which was tweaked to be compliant with dragnet surveillance.</p><h2>Skype China customised for monitoring</h2><p>A former Skype engineer, who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the issue, told the Guardian that the company worked to build in a &quot;listening element&quot; to help Chinese authorities monitor users' communications for keywords, triggering a warning to alert the government when certain phrases get typed into its chat interface.</p><p>In response to questions about suspected monitoring of Skype chats in China, Skype has <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-08/skypes-been-hijacked-in-china-and-microsoft-is-o-dot-k-dot-with-it\">previously stated</a> that its software is made available in the country &quot;through a joint venture with Tom Online. As majority partner in the joint venture, Tom has established procedures to meet its obligations under local laws.&quot;</p><p>While publicly insisting it was unable to help law enforcement agencies <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9963028-38.html\">eavesdrop on calls</a>, Skype set up a secretive internal initiative called &quot;Project Chess&quot; to explore how it could make calls available to authorities, according to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/technology/silicon-valley-and-spy-agency-bound-by-strengthening-web.html?_r=0\">New York Times report</a> published in June.</p><p>A year later, Skype was <a href=\"http://about.skype.com/2009/09/ebay_inc_signs_definitive_agre.html)\">purchased from eBay by an investor group</a> including US private equity firms Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz. During this period, work began on integrating Skype into the NSA's Prism program, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data\">documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden</a> have revealed.</p><h2>The first 'eavesdropped' Skype call</h2><p>In February 2011, according to the NSA files, Skype was served with a directive to comply with NSA surveillance signed by the US attorney general. Within days, the spy agency reported that it had successfully eavesdropped on a Skype call. And when Microsoft acquired Skype in May 2011, the relationship with the NSA appears to have intensified.</p><p>Caspar Bowden, who served as Microsoft's chief privacy adviser between 2002 and 2011 and left shortly before the completion of its Skype takeover, says he was not surprised to learn the company had complied with the NSA's surveillance of the chat tool.</p><p>While working for Microsoft, Bowden says he was not privy to details of secret data-collection programs – but fully briefed the company on the dangers of US spy law the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for the privacy of its international cloud customers. He was met with a &quot;wall of silence,&quot; he says.</p><p>A letter obtained by the Guardian, sent by Skype's corporate vice president Mark Gillett to Privacy International in September 2012, suggested that group video calls and instant messages could be obtained by law enforcement because they are routed through its central servers and &quot;may be temporarily stored.&quot;</p><p>But Gillett also said in the letter that audio and one-to-one video calls made using Skype's &quot;full client&quot; on computers were encrypted and did not pass through central servers – implying that the company could not help authorities intercept them.</p><p>Separately, in July 2012, Skype contributed to UK parliamentary committee hearings on the government's proposed expansion of surveillance powers under the controversial communications data bill. Skype representative Stephen Collins claimed in testimony to the committee that &quot;there are no keys held by Skype to decrypt communications.&quot;</p><h2>Microsoft calls for more government transparency</h2><p>Skype told the Guardian that it would not answer technical questions about how it turns over calls to the authorities or comment on the extent of its compliance with US surveillance. The company insisted the information it provided the UK parliament was accurate, though would not explain apparent discrepancies between its public statements and access to Skype calls claimed by the NSA.</p><p>In a statement, Skype said it believed that the world needed &quot;a more open and public discussion&quot; about the balance between privacy and security but accused the US government of stifling the conversation.</p><p>&quot;Microsoft believes the US constitution guarantees our freedom to share more information with the public, yet the government is stopping us,&quot; a spokesperson for Skype said, referring to an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/28/microsoft-google-fisa-united-states-government\">ongoing legal case</a> in which Microsoft is seeking permission to disclose more information about the number of surveillance requests it receives.</p><p>However, the law that underpins the Prism program – FISA – allows the NSA to target not only suspected terrorists and spies, but also &quot;foreign-based political organisations,&quot; which could encompass an array of advocacy groups and potentially news organisations, too.</p><h2>'Journalists should avoid Skype'</h2><p>Gr&eacute;goire Pouget, an information security expert at <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org\">Reporters Without Borders</a>, believes that journalists should not underestimate the risks posed by NSA Skype surveillance.</p><p>&quot;It is what many of us feared, and now we know for sure,&quot; Pouget says. &quot;If you are a journalist working on issues that could interest the US government or some of their allies, you should not use Skype.&quot;</p><p>Although the NSA has access to at least some Skype calls, it remains unclear whether police and security agencies outside the US enjoy a similar level of access.</p><p>Hacking Team, an Italian company, sells surveillance software to law enforcement and intelligence agencies in 30 countries that allows authorities to covertly infiltrate computers with spyware that records communications before they are encrypted. The Milan-based firm explicitly markets the Trojan tool as a means to get access to Skype conversations – and says authorities still frequently complain about a lack of ability to eavesdrop on Skype calls.</p><p>&quot;When you talk to law enforcement about what their concerns are, they'll right away mention Skype,&quot; says Eric Rabe, Hacking Team's spokesman.</p><p>Rabe declines to name customers, citing confidentiality agreements, but says Hacking Team's business has been &quot;growing very nicely&quot; in recent years. The company's public accounts show that its revenue more than doubled from $5.3m in 2010 to a projected $11.8m in 2012.</p><h2>The new wave of encrypted services</h2><p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, new companies are now emerging in response to fears about surveillance of Skype, promising users access to encrypted chat tools that do not have secret 'backdoors' for NSA surveillance.</p><p>Washington DC-based Silent Circle is one such company, going to extraordinary lengths to shield customers against spying. With founders including Phil Zimmermann, who devised the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) email encryption product, and a former Navy Seal, Silent Circle offers a series of encrypted phone apps and a Skype-style internet chat platform. </p><p>It is registered as an offshore company and uses computer servers outside the US in a bid to evade government coercion. It <a href=\"http://silentcircle.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/to-our-customers/\">recently closed</a> its own encrypted email service because it could not guarantee security, and said it would focus instead on chat and telephony.</p><p>The FBI has already held meetings with Silent Circle, according to CEO Mike Janke, accusing it of being a &quot;ghost provider&quot; that could cause harm to the US because it stores virtually no information about its users' communications.</p><p>But Janke, a 45-year-old former Navy Seal sniper, says his company will not cede to government pressure to secretly comply with surveillance. &quot;I feel that we can use Skype as a template,&quot; Janke says, &quot;for what we don't want to do.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416035266|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|d5123a26f9ed45e9c34be99b66d2045da88f9894 -->",

        "body":"<p>After the man who hated Britain, welcome to the paper that helps Britain's enemies. You are reading it now. The Daily Mail, which recently poured scorn on a dead man by distorting and misrepresenting his views, has now turned its focus on this newspaper, claiming we have behaved with \"lethal irresponsibility\" in reporting the issues raised by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Ralph Miliband was unable to answer back. We can.</p><p>Thursday's <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2451557/Daily-Mail-Comment-The-Guardian-paper-helps-Britains-enemies.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail editorial</a> compared the Guardian unfavourably with Professor Miliband. While he apparently \"wanted to smash all the traditions and institutions which make Britain British\", he never gave practical help to our enemies or placed British lives at risk. The Mail is incredulous that, having been asked to stop publishing any more stories by a senior intelligence officer, a newspaper should say that it will apply its editorial judgment about publishing more material, taking care not to endanger life. \"How, in the name of sanity can he [the editor] know,\" asks the Mail. \"He's a journalist, not an expert on security.\"</p><p>The first thing we should say is that we welcome the fact that, at last, we have a debate in this country. The Mail and other papers which have studiously ignored the raging global discussion about the proper limits of surveillance over the past few months will now find it harder to ignore. If they have been reading the comments on their websites they will know that their own readers are actually extremely interested in these issues and take a broadly balanced view far removed from the shrill denunciations of anonymous editorialists.</p><p>Secondly, we acknowledge that – of course – there is a tension between the total secrecy that intelligence agencies crave and the transparency that, in all other circumstances, democracies demand. This country needs spies, but those who do it for a living will never welcome the attentions of the press. Their condemnation of inquiring journalism is age old, almost ritualistic. The publisher of Der Spiegel was detained for treason in 1962. Ten years later, Nixon's security apparatchiks wheeled out similar arguments against the newspapers that dared to publish the Pentagon Papers. Those assaults on the press now look dangerous and absurd. Journalists should treat the remarks of intelligence chiefs with the same balance of respect and scepticism they reserve for all public officials.</p><p>The Mail's leading article must be read in the context of a fervent discussion about press regulation in which it is leading the charge for journalists to be both free and trusted. But Thursday's editorial argues the opposite. It is a statement of anti-journalism: editors, it says, cannot be trusted. They must defer to the state. We sent the Mail's editorial to two dozen of the most respected editors in the world – many of whom are quite familiar with the exercise of using their best editorial judgment to balance issues of security against the wish to inform their readers on matters of high public importance. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/guardian-democracy-editors\" title=\"\">Here are their contributions</a>. Virtually unanimously they reject the Daily Mail's concept of journalism, as expressed in Thursday's editorial. In stark contrast to some in the UK press, they have over recent months covered the Snowden disclosures in considerable depth. They include editors from the New York Times and Washington Post who have themselves handled Snowden's secret US intelligence agency documents. Collectively and in calm tones, these distinguished editors make a powerful and thoughtful case for journalism itself. Our&nbsp;searchlight, they say, should be shone on security matters as brightly as anything else.</p><p>The recent global debate over mass surveillance, its limits and its oversight has been richly textured, sometimes passionate and vital. It has included politicians, academics, technologists, spies, cryptologists, civil libertarians, businessmen and countless millions who use phones or email and have understandable fears about who looks at what. Mail readers are as entitled as anyone else to know the facts – and to join the debate.</p><p>• This article was amended on 11 October 2013 to remove a repetition of the word \"academics\" in the final paragraph</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419643989|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|0d7d4333cea38eeca088e752eea36c04396e942b -->",

The right to safety of citizens of one country can never be guaranteed by violating fundamental human rights of citizens of another country … The time is ripe to create the conditions to prevent cyberspace from being used as a weapon of war, through espionage, sabotage and attacks against systems and infrastructure of other countries.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.institutolula.org/lula-o-presidente-dos-estados-unidos-deveria-pedir-desculpas-ao-mundo/#.UlaaZWQa-Lj\" title=\"\"><strong>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, former president of Brazil</strong></a><strong>, after revelations that the NSA had spied on various countries, including allies, in a 6 September interview with the Hindu</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />The president of the United States should apologise to the world … Now, each country needs to take much more seriously the issue of sovereignty in the area of communication.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://presstv.com/detail/2013/06/27/311074/correa-slams-us-press-for-criticism/\" title=\"\"><strong>Rafael Correa, president of Ecuador, in a 26 June online statement in response to US media criticism of Ecuador for considering asylum for Snowden</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[The US media have] managed to focus attention on Snowden and on the 'wicked' countries that 'support' him, making us forget the terrible things against the US people and the whole world that he denounced … The world order isn't only unjust, it's immoral.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/bolivian-president-evo-morales-accuses-the-us-of-hacking-email-accounts-2013-7\" title=\"\"><strong>Evo Morales, president of Bolivia, speaking on 14 July after learning of NSA hacking at a Mercosur regional summit</strong></a></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />Those US intelligence agents have accessed the emails of our most senior authorities in Bolivia … It was recommended to me that I not use email, and I've followed suit and shut it down.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, president of Argentina, in a speech at the UN on 6 August</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Precisely one of the most distinct reasons for the fall of this [Berlin] wall was firstly that citizens from the other side wanted to live in freedom, they wanted to live without being watched.\" Fernández also used the speech to call for \"establishment of regulations of a global nature to ensure the sovereignty of states and the privacy of citizens in the world.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Martin Schulz, president of European parliament</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I am deeply worried and shocked about the allegations of US authorities spying on EU offices.

If a conservative security expert like Germany's Hans-Peter Uhl ventures into such territory, we should realize that this affair is about much more than only a few powerpoint presentations.

Even more persuasive is the reality that neither officials nor journalists can ever be sure of the consequences of publication: facts once distributed, like seeds in a garden, acquire a life of their own with consequences that can be salutary, malignant, both, or neither. So while intelligence agents perceive a professional duty to cloak all their deeds and knowledge, it is a newspaper's duty to publish what it learns without presuming to predict a good or ill result.

Those who attack that role have an altogether different agenda, and that too should be the subject of legitimate public questioning and exposure.<br /><em>Andrew Jaspan, editor, the Conversation</em></p></blockquote><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419718527\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/11/1381495843746/Crikey-001.jpg\" alt=\"Crikey\" width=\"460\" height=\"72\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>You would call the NSA revelations brave and brilliant journalism if it wasn't so blatantly obvious. Just like you would call the response by the Daily Mail simply sour grapes if it wasn't the antitheses of what journalism is about. Every publication genuinely committed to the principles of a free press – transparency, accountability, giving the public information it absolutely has a right to know – would have published this material. We can only be jealous. </p><p>The media must always weigh freedom of information with the consequences of publication. There seems little doubt the appropriate consideration was applied in this case. The result is clear: a public that is almost certainly no less safe but almost certainly much more informed about an issue that is likely to be a defining one of our generation.<br /><em>Jason Whittaker, editor, Crikey</em></p></blockquote><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419641474|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|d39f0b7943dbcba952a4d3356586207f4be0b61f -->",

        "headline":"Guardian's NSA revelations: spies to go under spotlight",
        "body":"<p>British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg is to start conversations in government about how to update the legal oversight of the UK's security services in the light of disclosures by the Guardian that powerful new technologies appear to have outstripped the current system of legislative and political oversight.</p><p>Clegg's aides said he would be calling in experts from inside and outside Whitehall to discuss the implications of the new surveillance technologies for public accountability and trust. It is the first time such a senior figure in government has conceded that the revelations published in the Guardian have highlighted concerns about the accountability of the security services.</p><p>Clegg hinted at his plans in his weekly phone-in on London's LBC radio, saying: \"I think it is right to ask whether there is anything more we can do to make sure the public feel accountability is working in this area properly. There is a totally legitimate debate about the power of these technologies, about how you get the balance right, how you do make sure these technologies are used in an accountable and proportionate way.\"</p><p>But Clegg also joined Prime Minister David Cameron and the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, in declaring that the Guardian had published information, passed to the paper by the American whistleblower Edward Snowden, that was not in the public interest. He said: \"I don't think just giving technical secrets to those who wish to do us harm serves any purpose.\"</p><p>Clegg's aides did not give specific examples of details published by the Guardian that would give this help to terrorists.</p><p>Cameron said: \"When you get newspapers who get hold of vast amounts of data and information that is effectively stolen information and they think it's OK to reveal this, I think they have to think about their responsibilities and are they helping to keep our country safe.\"</p><p>The prime minister acknowledged that the paper had destroyed some information at his request. He also hinted at movement on the issue, saying: \"I am satisfied that the work these agencies do is not only vital but it is properly overseen. That is what this debate needs to be about. If people want to suggest improvements about how they are governed and looked after, I am happy to listen to those.\"</p><p>In the wake of Parker's speech this week attacking the Guardian's disclosures, some British newspapers, notably the Daily Mail, accused the Guardian of being a newspaper that helps Britain's enemies. The Mail said the paper had \"crossed a line with lethal irresponsibility\".</p><p>But  more than 20 leading newspaper editors from a dozen countries   <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/guardian-democracy-editors\">rallied to defend the Guardian's handling of the Snowden files</a>. Many insisted that journalists were quite capable of deciding which information is too dangerous to publish – and which information the public has a right to knew. \"Journalists have only one responsibility: to keep their readers informed and educated about whatever their government is doing on their behalf,\" said Aluf Benn, editor-in-chief of Israel's Haaretz.</p><p>Several editors expressed disappointment that the Guardian had come under attack from other journalists. Javier Moreno, director of El País in Spain, said: \"What's sad, baffling and dangerous is that the attacks now come not only from governments but from other newspapers too. We need newspapers wiling to do their job, rather than those ready to cheer on the self-interested deceptions of the powerful.\"</p><p>Wolfgang Büchner, editor-in-chief of Der Spiegel, in Germany, said: \"It is a tragedy that media outlets aligned with governments are now accusing the journalists uncovering these abuses of 'lethal irresponsibility.' \" It had not been known that Clegg was to take active steps to review the issue, a route apparently closed off by the parliamentary watchdog, the Intelligence and Security Committee.</p><p>The ISC had declared, following a short investigation in private, that the security services were not bypassing the current systems of ministerial oversight.</p><p>But the deputy prime minister's aides said: \"We are completely supportive of you lifting the lid on a lot of this, and starting a debate to which he is trying to contribute.\"</p><p>Clegg himself said: \"There is a totally legitimate debate to be had, and in my experience from speaking to people in the security services they recognise this, about the use of these incredibly powerful technologies. We have legislation – regulations – that were designed for an age that is quite different now. Both terrorist states and security services conduct this battle online in a way that was quite unimaginable just a few years ago.</p><p>\"What that means for privacy and proportionality is a totally legitimate area for debate. How you hold the secret parts of any state to account is an incredibly important issue.</p><p>\"We have to defend the principle of secrecy but you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is a proper form of accountability.\"</p><p>The first public indications of government disquiet in the UK came as a new drive started in the United States to bring the National Security Agency to account.</p><p>The conservative Republican who authored the US Patriot Act is preparing to unveil bipartisan legislation that would dramatically curtail the domestic surveillance powers it gives to intelligence agencies.</p><p>Congressmen Jim Sensenbrenner, who worked with president George W Bush to give more power to US spies after the 11 September terrorist attack, said they had misused it by collecting telephone records on all Americans and claimed it was time \"to put their metadata programme out of business\".</p><p>Many lawmakers have agreed that new legislation is required owing to the collapse in public trust following Snowden's disclosures that the NSA was collecting bulk records of all US phone calls in order to sift out potential terrorist targets.</p><p>• This article was amended on 11th October. We originally stated that the ISC had declared that the security services were bypassing systems of ministerial oversight. In fact they had declared that these systems were not being bypassed. This has been changed.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419640154|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|1b7c4253aba65922bbce5bb279ab35708f0d3c2a -->",

        "headline":"Leave surveillance to the judges",
        "body":"<p>Andrew Parker, the new MI5 chief, is right to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\" title=\"\">deeply worried by the Snowden revelations</a>. The new availability of information on the web is opening up secrecy like a knife into an oyster. However, Anthony Glees, head of the centre for security and intelligence studies at Buckingham University, ignores the fact that secrecy in this country is overprotected and under-regulated when he suggests <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/oct/10/theguardian-surveillance\" title=\"\">the Guardian should be prosecuted</a> for putting this under the microscope.</p><p>Britain has utterly failed to prepare itself for openness when dealing with politically sensitive issues such as terrorism, or the involvement of their secret agencies in the covert gathering of information. We rarely hear from the intelligence agencies' chiefs; and ministers glide over the threats, never explain their relationship with those agencies, and retain an obviously inadequate system for their supervision. As a result, as long as ministers continue to authorise the agencies' eavesdropping, surveillance, and informant approval, the public will believe there is an unhealthy relationship between them. That scepticism is made worse by the communications data bill's proposal that the agencies themselves control their mining of communications data.</p><p>Against this background it is hardly surprising that the Snowden revelations have not been met by the public antagonism one might expect when national security has been compromised. The government must regain the initiative. A first and necessary step is to leave the authorisation of eavesdropping, surveillance and informant approval to the judiciary. This would mean that applications to carry out such covert activities would have to be made by the agencies direct to a judge. This would reduce both the risk and the perception of collusion or political interference.</p><p>Government may argue that all this is unnecessary as there is already adequate oversight of the agencies. It is true that oversight has improved now parliament itself is in charge of overseeing the agencies. However, that oversight is ex post facto and is, on the admission of former oversight committee chiefs, both inadequate and subject to political pressure. Moreover, it is no substitute for independent judicial authority.</p><p>As a bonus, if judicial authority were given for telephone and electronic intercepts, evidence thus collected could be used to prosecute terrorists, as happens in the US. The current refusal of the UK government to use intercept evidence would then look even more unwise.</p><p>This concept of judicial authority for intrusive covert surveillance is not new. Many jurisdictions adhere to it. In the French legal system, a judge supervises covert targeted operations and determines the civil rights balances involved. This way, both the public and the agencies are protected, and at any subsequent trial the evidential uncertainties have already been excluded. In the UK such a procedure would obviate the need for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/jun/14/what-are-secret-courts\" title=\"\">secret courts to determine civil proceedings</a> and reassure the public that fair trials remain a baseplate of our society. It is a system that needs to be introduced to all the UK agencies' covert targeted operations.</p><p>The government could then turn its attention to the vital job of informing the public. Unlike in the US, the British public do not get to see the intelligence agencies' chiefs grilled by the oversight committee, nor do they see those chiefs and the law enforcement agencies being interviewed together about their objectives and the tools they need to achieve them. The public have a right to see and hear this so that they can make up their own minds about the integrity of the leaders, the validity of their objectives, the need for the tools they use and whether the secrecy demanded is properly balanced.</p><p>Unless government takes this debate seriously, the British public's need to know what the intelligence agencies are doing will continue to shatter secrecy – and terrorism and organised crime will benefit.<em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419737996|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|a65913eb4871aad86f5e61387250187dce8ab75b -->",

        "headline":"Guardian was 'entirely correct' to publish NSA stories, says Vince Cable",
        "body":"<p>The Guardian performed a considerable public service after making the \"entirely correct and right\" and \"courageous\" decision to publish details from secret NSA files leaked by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden, Vince Cable has said.</p><p>The business secretary, who reserved judgment on Snowden's decision to leak the files, confirmed that Nick Clegg was setting in train a review of the oversight of Britain's intelligence agencies.</p><p>In an interview on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, Cable said that \"arguably\" Britain  did not have proper oversight of the domestic intelligence service MI5,  overseas agency MI6 and  eavesdropping centre GCHQ.</p><p>Cable confirmed a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/guardian-nsa-spies\" title=\"\">report in the Guardian that the deputy prime minister's aides are to start conversations in Whitehall about improving the legal oversight of the intelligence agencies</a> in light of Snowden's revelations. These suggest that  powerful new technologies appear to have outstripped the current system of legislative and political oversight.</p><p>The business secretary said: \"I think the Guardian has done a very considerable public service … The conclusion which Nick Clegg came to, and set out this morning, is that we do need to have proper political oversight of the intelligence services and arguably we haven't until now. What they [the Guardian] did was, as journalists, entirely correct and right. Mr Snowden is a different kettle of fish.\"</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Cable later elaborated on his comments in an interview with BBC News. He said: \"I think we've got to separate out the two things. There's the Guardian acting as a newspaper, bringing things to public attention, things that shouldn't have happened that did happen, and they have brought that out. That's their role, and they have done that very well and courageously.\"</p><p></p><p>He said that likening Snowden's actions to the Cambridge spy ring, as the former No 10 security adviser Sir David Omand has, was \"frankly somewhat bizarre\".</p><p>\"I mean, they were acting covertly over a long period of time. This was a whistleblower acting very publicly,\" he said. \"There is a question about sensitive intelligence he put into the wrong hands. That will obviously have to be pursued.\"</p><p></p><p>Asked whether there was a distinction between the decision to leak the information and the right to publish it, the business secretary replied: \"I think there is a distinction between whistleblowing to draw the public's attention to things happening in the intelligence world that shouldn't have been happening – absolutely right – and actually putting into the hands of other people a lot of very, very detailed intelligence information which they shouldn't have had. I think it is an important distinction and I think most people would understand that.\"</p><p></p><p>Clegg's aides said on Thursday that he would be calling in experts from inside and outside Whitehall to discuss the implications of the new surveillance technologies for public accountability and trust. It is the first time such a senior figure in government has conceded that the revelations published in the Guardian have highlighted concerns about the accountability of the security services.</p><p></p><p>Clegg <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/nick-clegg-edward-snowden-leaks-terrorists\" title=\"\">hinted at his plans in his weekly phone-in on London's LBC radio</a>, saying: \"I think it is right to ask whether there is anything more we can do to make sure the public feel accountability is working in this area properly. There is a totally legitimate debate about the power of these technologies, about how you get the balance right, how you do make sure these technologies are used in an accountable and proportionate way.\"</p><p></p><p>But Clegg also joined the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/pm-criticises-guardian-gchq-cameron-edward-snowden-leaks\" title=\"\">prime minister, David Cameron</a>, and the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, in declaring that the Guardian had published information, passed to the paper Snowden, that was not in the public interest. He said: \"I don't think just giving technical secrets to those who wish to do us harm serves any purpose.\"</p><p></p><p>Clegg's aides did not give specific examples of details published by the Guardian that would give this help to terrorists.</p><p></p><p>Cameron said: \"When you get newspapers who get hold of vast amounts of data and information that is effectively stolen information and they think it's OK to reveal this, I think they have to think about their responsibilities and are they helping to keep our country safe.\"</p><p></p><p>The prime minister acknowledged that the paper had destroyed some information at his request. He also hinted at movement on the issue, saying: \"I am satisfied that the work these agencies do is not only vital but it is properly overseen. That is what this debate needs to be about. If people want to suggest improvements about how they are governed and looked after, I am happy to listen to those.\"</p><p></p><p>In the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\" title=\"\">Parker's speech this week attacking the Guardian's disclosures</a>, some British newspapers, notably the Daily Mail, accused the Guardian of being a newspaper that helps Britain's enemies. The Mail said the paper had \"crossed a line with lethal irresponsibility\".</p><p></p><p>But more than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/guardian-democracy-editors\" title=\"\">20 leading newspaper editors from a dozen countries rallied to defend the Guardian's handling of the Snowden files</a>. Many insisted that journalists were quite capable of deciding which information is too dangerous to publish – and which information the public has a right to knew. \"Journalists have only one responsibility: to keep their readers informed and educated about whatever their government is doing on their behalf,\" said Aluf Benn, editor-in-chief of Israel's Haaretz.</p><p></p><p>Several editors expressed disappointment that the Guardian had come under attack from other journalists. Javier Moreno, director of El País in Spain, said: \"What's sad, baffling and dangerous is that the attacks now come not only from governments but from other newspapers too. We need newspapers wiling to do their job, rather than those ready to cheer on the self-interested deceptions of the powerful.\"</p><p></p><p>Wolfgang Büchner, editor-in-chief of Der Spiegel in Germany, said: \"It is a tragedy that media outlets aligned with governments are now accusing the journalists uncovering these abuses of 'lethal irresponsibility'. \"It had not been known that Clegg was to take active steps to review the issue, a route apparently closed off by the parliamentary watchdog, the intelligence and security committee (ISC).</p><p></p><p>The ISC had declared, following a short investigation in private, that the security services were not bypassing the current systems of ministerial oversight.</p><p></p><p>But the deputy prime minister's aides said: \"We are completely supportive of you lifting the lid on a lot of this, and starting a debate to which he is trying to contribute.\"</p><p></p><p>Clegg himself said: \"There is a totally legitimate debate to be had, and in my experience from speaking to people in the security services they recognise this, about the use of these incredibly powerful technologies. We have legislation – regulations – that were designed for an age that is quite different now. Both terrorist states and security services conduct this battle online in a way that was quite unimaginable just a few years ago.</p><p></p><p>\"What that means for privacy and proportionality is a totally legitimate area for debate. How you hold the secret parts of any state to account is an incredibly important issue.</p><p></p><p>\"We have to defend the principle of secrecy but you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is a proper form of accountability.\"</p><p></p><p>The first public indications of government disquiet in the UK came as a new drive started in the US to bring the National Security Agency to account.</p><p></p><p>The conservative Republican who authored the US Patriot Act is preparing to unveil bipartisan legislation that would dramatically curtail the domestic surveillance powers it gives to intelligence agencies.</p><p></p><p>Congressmen Jim Sensenbrenner, who worked with president George W Bush to give more power to US spies after the 11 September terrorist attack, said they had misused it by collecting telephone records on all Americans and claimed it was time \"to put their metadata programme out of business\".</p><p></p><p>Many lawmakers have agreed that new legislation is required owing to the collapse in public trust following Snowden's disclosures that the NSA was collecting bulk records of all US phone calls in order to sift out potential terrorist targets.</p><p></p><p>• This article was amended on 11th October. We originally stated that the ISC had declared that the security services were bypassing systems of ministerial oversight. In fact they had declared that these systems were not being bypassed. This has been changed.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419676467|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|9ef88fa7bf8e17abfa378c0bb58da851c102fc74 -->",

        "body":"<p>Senior members of the coalition are at odds over Britain's intelligence agencies after Downing Street dismissed a claim by Vince Cable that Britain arguably lacks a proper system of oversight.</p><p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/11/guardian-correct-publish-nsa-vince-cable\" title=\"\">the business secretary praised the Guardian</a> for performing a considerable public service in publishing leaked documents from the US National Security Agency, No 10 said David Cameron was satisfied with the current system of oversight. But the prime minister's spokesman added that members of the national security council, of which Nick Clegg is a member, were entitled to question the intelligence agencies.</p><p>The spokesman said: \"There is a debate that is outside of government that is often reported in [the Guardian] and other newspapers. There is the scope for members of the national security council, privy councillors, to ask questions and the like to better understand the work that the agencies do. That is always open to them.\"</p><p>Downing Street moved to clarify Cameron's thinking after Cable confirmed that Clegg was setting in train an examination of the oversight of Britain's intelligence agencies.</p><p>The business secretary said the Guardian had made the \"entirely correct and right\" and courageous decision to publish details from secret NSA files leaked by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden. He said that arguably Britain did not have proper oversight of the domestic intelligence service MI5, its overseas agency MI6 and the eavesdropping centre GCHQ.</p><p>Cable's views were given short shrift by Downing Street. The spokesman pointed out that the prime minister had said on Thursday: \"If people want to suggest improvements about how they are governed and looked after I am very happy to listen to them, but as far as I can see we have a very good system.\"</p><p>Asked whether the government was setting up a review into the oversight of the agencies, the spokesman said: \"There is not a government review in the way that you described – correct. There is no government review.\"</p><p>Aides to Clegg <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/11/guardian-correct-publish-nsa-vince-cable\" title=\"\">told the Guardian on Thursday</a> that the deputy prime minister would start conversations in government about how to update the legal oversight of the UK's security services in the light of disclosures by the Guardian that powerful new technologies appear to have outstripped the current system of legislative and political oversight.</p><p>The aides said he would be calling in experts from inside and outside Whitehall to discuss the implications of the new surveillance technologies for public accountability and trust. It is the first time such a senior figure in government has conceded that the revelations published in the Guardian have highlighted concerns about the accountability of the security services.</p><p>Cable, who reserved judgment on Snowden's decision to leak the files, confirmed the Guardian report about the Clegg plan. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: \"I think the Guardian has done a very considerable public service. Mr Snowden's contribution is two-fold. One is a positive one, which is whistleblowing, and the other is more worrying, that a large amount of genuinely important intelligence material does seem to have been passed across.</p><p>\"The conclusion which Nick Clegg came to, and set out this morning, is that we do need to have proper political oversight of the intelligence services and arguably we haven't until now. What they [the Guardian] did was, as journalists, entirely correct and right. Mr Snowden is a different kettle of fish.\"</p><p>The business secretary later dismissed as \"frankly somewhat bizarre\" a claim in the Times by Sir David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, that the Snowden leaks had inflicted more damage than the Soviet Union's Cambridge spy ring. Cable told BBC News: \"I mean, they were acting covertly over a long period of time. This was a whistleblower acting very publicly. There is a question about sensitive intelligence he put into the wrong hands. That will obviously have to be pursued.\"</p><p>Asked whether there was a distinction between the decision to leak the information and the right to publish it, Cable replied: \"I think there is a distinction between whistleblowing to draw the public's attention to things happening in the intelligence world that shouldn't have been happening – absolutely right – and actually putting into the hands of other people a lot of very, very detailed intelligence information which they shouldn't have had. I think it is an important distinction and I think most people would understand that.\"</p><p>Clegg first hinted at his plans to start conversations in government in his weekly phone-in on London's LBC radio, saying: \"I think it is right to ask whether there is anything more we can do to make sure the public feel accountability is working in this area properly. There is a totally legitimate debate about the power of these technologies, about how you get the balance right, how you do make sure these technologies are used in an accountable and proportionate way.\"</p><p>But Clegg also joined Cameron and the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, in declaring that the Guardian had published information, passed to the paper by Snowden, that was not in the public interest. \"I don't think just giving technical secrets to those who wish to do us harm serves any purpose.\"</p><p>Clegg's aides did not give specific examples of details published by the Guardian that would give this help to terrorists.</p><p>Cameron said: \"When you get newspapers who get hold of vast amounts of data and information that is effectively stolen information and they think it's OK to reveal this, I think they have to think about their responsibilities and are they helping to keep our country safe.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419709688|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|954b656d34ad7843df4fe5957c31b578eff17a15 -->",

        "trailText":"<p>Former US secretary of state greets debate as British shadow home secretary calls for oversight of intelligence</p>",
        "headline":"Hillary Clinton: we need to talk sensibly about spying",
        "body":"<p>Hillary Clinton has called for a \"sensible adult conversation\", to be held in a transparent way, about the boundaries of state surveillance highlighted by the leaking of secret NSA files by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>In a boost to Nick Clegg, the British deputy prime minister, who is planning to start conversations within government about the oversight of Britain's intelligence agencies, the former US secretary of state said it would be wrong to shut down a debate.</p><p>Clinton, who is seen as a frontrunner for the 2016 US presidential election, said at Chatham House in London: \"This is a very important question. On the intelligence issue, we are democracies thank goodness, both the US and the UK.</p><p>\"We need to have a sensible adult conversation about what is necessary to be done, and how to do it, in a way that is as transparent as it can be, with as much oversight and citizens' understanding as there can be.\"</p><p>Her words were echoed by the British shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, who repeated her call in a speech in July for reform of the oversight of the intelligence agencies. Cooper,  a former member of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee that oversees the agencies,said: \"I have long argued that checks and balances need to be stronger – this would benefit and maintain confidence in the vital work of our security and intelligence agencies as well as being in the interests of democracy.\"</p><p>The conciliatory language of Clinton and Cooper contrasted with that of MI5, whose director general, Andrew Parker, warned earlier this week that the leaked documents by Snowden had provided a gift to terrorists.</p><p>The former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw reinforced that message Friday, criticising the Guardian for publishing articles based on the leaked documents.</p><p>Straw, foreign secretary during the Iraq war in 2003, told the BBC: \"They're blinding themselves about the consequence and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particular secrets which they have published are not likely to damage the national interest, and they're not in any position at all to do that.\"</p><p>Clegg, who agrees with Straw that in some cases the Guardian was wrong to publish details from the NSA files, believes the leaks show the need to consider updating the legal oversight of Britain's security services. Aides said he would be calling in experts from inside and outside Whitehall amid concerns that the leaked files show that powerful new technologies appear to have outstripped the current system of legislative and political oversight.</p><p>Vince Cable, the business secretary, confirmed the Lib Dems wanted to examine the oversight of the intelligence agencies and he praised the Guardian for performing a public service in publishing articles on the files.</p><p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today: \"I think the Guardian has done a very considerable public service. Snowden's contribution is two-fold. One is a positive one, which is whistleblowing, and the other is more worrying, that a large amount of genuinely important intelligence material does seem to have been passed across.</p><p>\"The conclusion which Nick Clegg came to, and set out this morning, is that we do need to have proper political oversight of the intelligence services and arguably we haven't until now. What they [the Guardian] did was, as journalists, entirely correct and right. Snowden is a different kettle of fish.\"</p><p>Downing Street indicated that senior members of the coalition were at odds when the prime minister's spokesman dismissed Cable's claim that Britain arguably lacks a proper system of oversight, saying that the prime minister is satisfied with the system. But David Cameron's spokesman added that members of the national security council, of which Clegg is a member, were entitled to question the intelligence agencies.</p><p>The spokesman said: \"There is a debate that is outside of government that is often reported in [the Guardian] and other newspapers. There is the scope for members of the national security council, privy councillors, to ask questions and the like to better understand the work that the agencies do. That is always open to them.\"</p><p>The agencies are overseen in three ways in Britain: they are answerable to their relevant secretary of state; accountable to parliament's intelligence and security committee chaired by the former Tory foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind; and answerable to the intelligence commissioners.</p><p>David Bickford, a former legal director of MI5 and MI6, told the Guardian that the current oversight regime for Britain's intelligence agencies was \"obviously inadequate.\"</p><p>\"Secrecy in this country is over-protected and under-regulated,\" he said. \"The UK has signally failed to prepare itself for openness when dealing with politically sensitive issues such as terrorism or the involvement of their secret agencies in the gathering of information by secret means.\"Bickford added: \"We see only a fleeting and ephemeral face of the intelligence agencies chiefs; ministers glide over the threats, never explain their relationship with those agencies and are content to retain an obviously inadequate system for their supervision.\"</p><p>Bickford said public scepticism was \"made worse by the Communications Data Bill's proposal that the agencies themselves control their mining of communications data.\"</p><p>He added: \"Unless government takes this debate seriously, secrecy will be pierced by the needs of society and terrorism and organised crime will plunder our sovereignty.\"</p><p>Nick Pickles, the director of Big Brother Watch, joined forces with ten other like-minded campaigners to call on Cameron and Clegg to reform the system of oversight of the intelligence agencies. In a letter to the prime minister, deputy prime ministers and the ISC chairman the campaigners called for an independent review of the Regulation of Investigative Powers Act 2000 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994; the publication, in line with the practice in the US of legal opinions used to support surveillance methods; and to allow the Intelligence and Security Committee to report directly to Parliament rather than just to the prime minister.</p><p>In the letter they said: \"We would be delighted to meet with you or members of your Government to discuss these issues. At a time when the internet is an inescapable part of daily life, the modern economy and the delivery of public services, it is surely paramount that the laws that govern surveillance are fit for a digital age, and that the safeguards that operate are robust, properly resourced and can command public confidence.\"</p><p>Sir Francis Richards, a former GCHQ director, questioned whether it was right for an MP of a governing party to chair the intelligence and security committee. Richards, who was highly critical of the Guardian for publishing the leaked documents, told The World at One on Radio 4: \"I think it's probably not a very good idea that a former senior minister in a Conservative government is the current chair of the intelligence and security committee.\"</p><p>In her remarks, Clinton did not comment on the UK's oversight arrangements. But she indicated she was wholly supportive of the approach adopted by Barack Obama who – in contrast to Downing Street – has said he welcomes a debate on surveillance in the wake of the NSA leaks.</p><p>Answering a question from the Guardian at Chatham House, she said the discussion had to take place within a framework that addressed issues of privacy and protection of citizens because some surveillance programmes remained a \"really critical ingredient in our homeland security.\"</p><p>Clinton, who is considering whether to make her second challenge for the Democratic presidential nomination, added: \"It would be going down a wrong path if we were to reject the importance of the debate, and the kinds of intelligence activities that genuinely keep us safe.</p><p>\"So how do we sort all of this out? This is a problem that is well over a decade old, where these capacities have corresponded with increasing outreach to consumers on the business side and increasing concern about security on the government side. People need to be better informed.\"</p><p>Cooper was careful to praise the work of the intelligence agencies. She said: \"The work of the security and intelligence services is vital, and most of it by necessity must be kept secret to protect our national security and public safety. Leaks of classified information can be deeply damaging, and in the wrong hands can place our country and people's lives in danger. But because so much information needs to be kept secret, it's even more important that there are strong checks and balances in place, to provide effective oversight, accountability and reassurance to the public. And that's why we are proposing reforms.</p><p>\"When dealing with international terrorism or other complex and serious threats, strong powers will sometimes be needed but they should be matched by strong checks and balances to ensure power is not concentrated or abused, and to investigate when things go wrong.</p><p>As a former member of the Intelligence and Security Committee I have long called for it to have greater powers and resources to pursue searching investigations. And it also needs the credibility and independence of government in the eyes of the public, Parliament and the media that the Public Accounts Committee has.</p><p>\"We should be strengthening other forms of oversight too. We are way past the time when oversight can be delivered simply by retired judges undertaking paper-based reviews and never speaking publicly about their conclusions or the work they do. The current framework of commissioners who few people have heard of simply isn't adequate for a world of rapidly changing technology and public expectations.</p><p>\"The very nature of intelligence agencies is that their work needs to go on behind closed doors, and many of the checks and balances need to be behind closed doors too. But those checks and balances need to be strong enough and credible enough so the public can be confidence in the vital work the agencies do.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419751147|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|f446b0172d4881d0063c2ba2747b5e07f8ac9deb -->",
