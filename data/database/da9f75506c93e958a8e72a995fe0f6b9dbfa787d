        "body":"<p><em><em>Jenn Park-Mustacchio</em>&nbsp;is a licensed funeral director and embalmer who works in New Jersey, USA. She studied anthropology and human biology at the University of Pennsylvania, and has been in the funeral industry for 14 years. <strong>So what would you like to know? Leave your questions in the comments.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Jenn will pop in throughout the day to answer them.</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Take us through a regular day at work:</strong></p> <p>Typically, my day begins when someone dies. Since I'm a trade embalmer, I don't handle the first call or transport of a deceased person (although I've previously done both). My boss calls me, and I arrive at the funeral home shortly after the deceased has been taken into our care to begin the embalming process. I suit up in personal protective equipment (a gown, apron, shoe covers, gloves etc) and evaluate the person to decide how I will proceed. Every case is different and requires a special combination of fluids (which are mixed according to the height, weight and physical conditions of the deceased). I mix the fluids accordingly and begin to set the features.</p> <p>Setting the features involves closing the eyes and mouth and placing cotton in the mouth to give the person a more natural expression. Next, I gently flex the arms, legs and fingers to relieve the muscle tension or stiffness of rigor mortis. I position the hands one over the other, wash the body, cover the genitals (to preserve modesty) and prepare the tools I will need to embalm.</p> <p>Typically, we use a scalpel to make a small incision near the right collarbone. From there, we search for the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein. A small incision is made in each. Arterial tubes are placed in the artery (one is directed towards the heart, while the other is directed towards the head). A drain tube, or angled forceps, is also placed in the vein to facilitate drainage of blood. The hose, connected to the embalming machine, is then connected to the arterial tube directed towards the heart. The embalming machine is then adjusted to regulate pressure (the force of the fluid) and rate of flow (speed of the fluid). These knobs are adjusted differently during embalming for each case to create the optimum rate of injection for the body. The machine is switched on and the fluid begins to move through the hose, through the arterial tube and into the body. As the embalming fluid is pushed through the arterial system, the blood is forced out through the jugular vein.</p> <p>The body is vigorously massaged with a soapy sponge to help facilitate drainage and distribution of embalming fluid. The tissue will begin to firm and take on a rosy appearance, which is an excellent indication of adequate distribution and a successful embalming. The tubes are then removed, the vein and artery tied off and the incision is sutured. Next, the cavity is treated. Fluid is suctioned from the hollow organs with an instrument called a trocar, then a high-index (very strong) fluid is placed into the cavity and the incision is closed with a small circular plastic button like device referred to as a trocar button. The deceased is again washed. Their hair is combed and cream is placed on their face to prevent skin dehydration. The deceased is then covered and will remain in the preparation room until they are dressed, cosmetized and ready to be placed into a casket for viewing.</p> <p>Typically the viewing takes place a few days after death. So I will clean up the prep room and leave until it's time for the next embalming or until its time to dress and casket someone who's been previously embalmed.</p> <p>*The above is a description of a &quot;typical&quot; embalming. If a person dies tragically (murder, suicide, automobile accident) the embalming process is drastically different.</p> <p><strong>Tell us about something surprising, or unexpected, that happened to you while working:</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;I've had several interesting things happen on the job, but one particular moment comes to mind. I went in for a 3am embalming and heard a strange whisper. I quickly fumbled for the lights and, upon turning them on, figured out that the noise was coming from the occupied stretcher. I approached with caution expecting the person inside could be alive. However, upon unzipping the cover, I found a tape recorder (that I later found out was playing a Buddhist chant). The next day the family explained that, ideally, a monk would be at the place of death to chant when the soul exits the body. Chanting calms the soul, which the buddhists believe, is in a state of confusion and fright after exiting the body. The soul of the deceased must be put at ease with food and chant throughout the difficult time of transition. This particular experience was both enlightening and frightening!</p> <p><strong>What makes for a really good day at work?</strong></p> <p>My job is fulfilling when a particularly difficult case comes out better than expected. If a family decides to keep a casket open, when they previously thought they wouldn't be able to, or when someone compliments my work. The best compliment I got was from a woman whose daughter died of bone cancer. She took my hand and said, &quot;Thank you, she's so beautiful, she looks like she could get up and dance.&quot;</p> <p><strong>What is your salary? Do you get benefits?</strong></p> <p>The median annual income for funeral directors in the US is over $52,000 (with the annual salary in New Jersey averaging above $79,000). Regulations vary state by state, but here in New Jersey we are embalmers/funeral directors and are licensed to handle all aspects of the funeral (from first call to final disposition). In other states they have separate licenses for funeral directors and embalmers.</p> <p>Even though I am licensed to perform all aspects of the business, I work as an embalmer because I enjoy that particular aspect of the business and found that it allows me to spend a significant amount of time with my family. Trade embalmers, like myself, are paid by the job. Usually we work for more than one location and will embalm, dress, casket, cosmetize and do restorative work. Trade embalmers have the potential to make significantly more than the average funeral director depending on how many locations they work for and how busy those locations are. However, we do not receive health benefits because we are not full-time employees.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever made a mistake at work?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>I'm fortunate enough to say that I have not made any major mistakes. When I was an intern, I was super careful and very aware that any mistake I made could potentially affect the grieving process of the deceased friends and loved ones, so I always consulted with senior funeral directors if I was unsure of what to do or how to proceed with difficult cases.</p> <h2><strong><em>Do you have an interesting job?

The tacks have wires that are then twisted together to hold the mouth closed. This is almost always done because, when relaxed, the mouth stays open. We also use cotton to fill out hollow cheeks or give the appearance of teeth to those who have none, or are missing a few. The device under the eye is actually a serrated plastic eye cap that helps keep the eye closed. I do not enjoy the look of them, so I don't use them. Cotton is usually sufficient to use under an eyelid if the eye has deflated. However, we usually don't need to use anything under the eyelid at all.

That would have to be making a nose for a lady that had craniofacial cancer.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p><strong>Q:</strong></p> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28251296\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/3205970\" title=\"View Christo99’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2012/05/07/Christo99/ea8a8bf2-7d01-4d19-8fee-1d17fe9af853/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Christo99\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/3205970\" title=\"View Christo99’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Christo99</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28251296\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">24 October 2013 3:48pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I am in the UK and was always under the impression that at least partial embalming was done for viewing purposes.

Here in NJ you are only required to be embalmed if you're being transported across state lines. Some people choose to embalm before viewing because they prefer the life like appearance that embalming imparts. Some are embalmed, have a viewing and are cremated. It's strictly the choice of the family. From what I understand, embalming is not common in the UK, but that doesn't mean that the morticians don't set the features. I'm assuming this may be what you're referring to. It is possible to set the features (close the eyes and mouth) and cosmetize the deceased for viewing without embalming.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p>Q:&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28248995\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4395157\" title=\"View goddesszooeysapostle’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/01/13/goddesszooeysapostle/90596883-3ff7-4f5e-9c23-d536d0b0b164/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for goddesszooeysapostle\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4395157\" title=\"View goddesszooeysapostle’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">goddesszooeysapostle</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28248995\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">24 October 2013 2:47pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Do you believe in any kind of conscious existence after physical death?

Thank you.</p> <p>Embalming is usually selected when there's a public viewing followed by a burial (or cremation). Last I checked the cremation rate in the US was around 40% (and many of the people choosing this option are not embalmed). So, my educated guess is that around 60% of people in the US are still embalmed.</p> <p>The funeral industry is moving away from formaldehyde based fluids and opting to use glutaraldehyde based fluids (which is considered to be the &quot;greener&quot; embalming option).

        "headline":"I'm a homicide detective in the LAPD. What do you want to know?",
        "body":"<p>Christopher Barling has been working with the Los Angeles police department's homicide division since 1993. He's now the homicide supervisor for the <a href=\"http://www.lapdonline.org/77th_street_community_police_station/content_basic_view/1573\">77th division</a> in south LA, which has historically had one of the highest murder rates in the city.</p><p><strong>As a part of our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/series/a-days-work\">'A day's work' series</a>, Detective Barling has agreed to open up about his life and his work with Guardian readers, and answer questions throughout the afternoon. So what do you want to know? Leave your questions below and Detective Barling will be online after 2pm ET | 7pm BST to respond.</strong></p><h2>What's a typical day like for you?</h2><p>First of all, there is never a typical workday for a homicide detective. I work what's called a 9/17 shift, which means that I work nine-hour days, nine out of 10 weekdays, with weekends off. However, since I am the homicide supervisor, I am always on call.</p><p>I usually start my day between 6-7am, depending on the LA traffic. First thing I do is meet with the members of my squad, as they get their morning cups of coffee. I then transition the conversation into getting updates on their current investigations and their investigative plans to solve their cases.</p><p>Next, based on the teams of detectives' availability, I determine who is going to be on call with me during the week (they get to pre-schedule what weekend they have in advance). I then usually do a series of administrative functions: completing time sheets, signing overtime slips, reviewing search warrants, court orders, etc. <strong>But that's only the case if we didn't have a homicide overnight.</strong></p><p>When a murder occurs it is rarely during business hours; it is usually between 10pm and 3am. So, on those days, my watch officially starts when I arrive at the crime scene. I then assess if more detectives need to be called in to start early and start handing out tasks to be completed. Some of tasks can be locating and interviewing witnesses, re-canvassing the crime scene for additional witnesses or evidence, locating and downloading surveillance footage, booking evidence, searching through criminal data bases, and meeting with other law enforcement officers, who have expertise in the area where the crime occurred.</p><p>I oversee all of this and monitor the investigative team who is assigned the case and the teams that are assisting them. I also meet with the area captain and the bureau chief and update them on the status of the case to help assist them in the assignment of uniformed officers in the area for future crime prevention and apprehension.<strong> I also meet with gang intervention personnel and discuss the potential of retaliation because a high number of the murders in 77th division have some relationship to street gangs.</strong> The victims are not always gang members but the suspects usually are. All of this tends to make for long days and end of watch is rarely what it is scheduled to be.</p><h2>What makes for a really good day on the job?</h2><p>I am fortunate that every day is a good day on the job. I have the privilege of working with and supervising arguably the best detectives in the world. What makes a special day, is watching the detectives put together their cases and solving them. It is satisfying to watch a team of detectives getting excited that they just got their suspect identified or have a enough evidence to file a case against a murderer. <strong>If I am to use an old cliché, as homicide detectives we get to speak for the dead.</strong> It is exciting to watch a detective interviewing a suspect, and getting that suspect to make admissions or confess to a murder. It is also rewarding to hear one of the detectives get the call from the district attorney that a jury just convicted a suspect who is responsible for a murder. These days are special because we can then explain to a family that we know who is responsible for killing their loved one.</p><h2>How long have you been a homicide detective? What's changed over that time?</h2><p>I began working as a homicide detective in 1993, and technology is the biggest change over that time. When I first started working cases, we didn't have computers. We use to handwrite all reports and then typed them on a typewriter. Now everything is done on a computer. In 1993, we just had blood typing that was used to help identity people to a crime scene. Now DNA is used, which can identify an individual using his DNA to one in a billion, quadrillion or greater. There was no social media or surveillance cameras. <strong>The technology of today has greatly helped detectives build circumstantial evidence in their cases. </strong>We now also pass information out on Twitter on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/lapd-cghd\">@LAPD-CGHD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/LAmurdercop\">@LAMurderCop</a> and <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/77thhomicidecop\">@77thHomicideCop</a>. </p><p>Please remember, real detective work is not what you see on television shows like Law and Order, CSI and Dexter. We usually don't solve a case in an hour, or find scientific evidence everywhere.</p><h2>What are the most difficult aspects of your job?</h2><p>Over the past 10 years, 77th division has had 549 murders and there are approximately 250 open cases which are still not solved. Homicide detectives tend to be some of the most committed officers in any police agency and never want to go home without solving their case. But truth be told, we can't solve a case without the community's help and not every homicide case gets solved. However, just because it isn't solved does not mean that it is not being worked. <strong>Every year detectives solve anywhere between 60-70% of the cases, but only about 30-40% are from that calendar year.</strong> The rest of cases, which make up the difference, are from the previous years' cases.</p><h2>Tell us about a case that had a big impact on you in the last few years:</h2><p>All of the cases that you work or respond to affect you in some way or another but recently in 2010, there were two cases that stood out. </p><p>They were the senseless murders of <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/post/aaron-shannon-jr/\">Aaron Shannon Jr</a> and <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/post/kashmier-james/\">Kashmier James</a>. Aaron was a five-year-old boy, who was shot to death on Hallowe'en night in his grandfather's backyard while wearing his Hallowe'en costume (a Spiderman suit). Kashmier was a 25-year-old mother, who was standing near her car on Christmas night with her three-year-old daughter seated inside, when the suspect, who was standing down the street shot and killed her. In both of these cases, neither victim nor their families had anything to do with gangs.</p><p>Thankfully, the detectives who were assigned to both of these cases have arrested the suspects who were responsible for the murders. Both of the cases affect me in a couple of ways. One is just to be grateful of every moment I spend with people and my loved ones, because life can end so short and tragic, no matter what your age is or what day it is. Secondly, I watched both of these families handle their tragedies with such dignity, grace and strength that it inspires me daily to try and be a better person. Lastly, I had tremendous pride in watching the assigned detectives and their peers work relentlessly together as a cohesive team to solve both of the cases.</p><p><strong>Detective Barling has responded to some of our questions and now he'll answer yours.

        "body":"<p>Claudette Wilson is 20 and works two jobs in the fast food industry, one at Burger King and one at a pizza place. She is on her feet, sometimes for 12 hours a day, and makes $7.40 an hour. She agreed to share her experience for the Guardian's A Day's Work series because she wants people to understand <a href=\"http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1366073\">why fast food workers have been striking</a> for better wages. </p><p>Wilson participated in a <a href=\"http://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-1366073\">protest in Detroit, Michigan</a> last week. <strong>Due to her demanding work schedule, Claudette might not be able to answer all questions, but she will be available later today to try to get through as many Guardian reader comments and queries as she can.</strong></p><h2>1. What is your typical day like?</h2><p>Everyday for me is different. I can tell you how a typical Saturday is like: first I wake up around 8am to go to work at Burger King from 10am to 6pm. After I get off of work from Burger King, I go to my second job at Jet's Pizza from 6pm to midnight. After I get done with working, sometimes I hang with friends, sometimes I just go to sleep.</p><h2>2. There's been a lot of talk lately about people wanting work/life balance. Does your job provide that?</h2><p>My work/life balance is pretty rough at times. There's not even much time for me, let alone anyone else. In a weird way though, having both jobs does provide balance to me and a change of scene, but I'm not sure about others.  </p><h2>3. What's the craziest/most unexpected thing that's ever happened to you while on the job?</h2><p>The most unexpected thing that happened to me when I was at work is when I witnessed a robbery at the Burger King I work at. The guy tried to get away in a cab. One of the cashiers and my manager at the time ran outside after the cab and chased it down to get the cab driver's attention. The driver stopped and got out of the car while the cashier and the robber tussled in the backseat for awhile. In the end, the robber got out of the car and ran across the street and got away.</p><h2>4. What makes for a really good day on the job?</h2><p>A good day on the job to me is when I arrive on time, and everyone is in their position and ready to work. There aren't many bad attitudes and the customers aren't being rude. The best kind of day is when everyone is doing their job and the day goes by swiftly.</p><h2>5. What's your annual salary? Do you get benefits?</h2><p>I get paid $7.40 an hour. My annual salary varies depending upon how many hours I work, but I have not made over $15,000 ever annually. I do not receive benefits. I have worked as a cook, cashier and in just about every position short of management off and on for the last three years. I still live at home with my mother and try to go to school on the side. I do dream of something more, but it's really hard to get jobs right now.<br /> <br />I participated in the <a href=\"http://detroit15.org/\">strike on 31 July 2013 for District 15</a> (Detroit, Michigan area). I did it because I desire to accomplish a few things: I want to be able to form a fast food workers union and earn a higher wage. Also I would like to see fast food workers taken more seriously and actually respected for the hard work that we do.</p><p>• This article was amended on 6 August 2013 to correct Claudette Wilson's age.

        "body":"<p>Herman Carnie and Charles Meng are on the front lines of poverty in America. They direct food banks that serve thousands of families each week. Charles Meng heads the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=f&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.afac.org/&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;ei=nrNdUrOaDZCY0QWS34HwCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtU3LImbkZ2GJWxN53W0vZxgcFrA\">Arlington Food Assistance Center</a> in a suburb of Washington, and Herman Carnie is director of food acquisition at the<a href=\"http://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/site/PageServer\"> Greater Chicago Food Depository</a>. They are opening up today about their typical work day, the people they serve and how what happens in Washington can impact America's poor. <strong>Post questions below in the comments and they will check back later in the day.</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/oct/15/help-us-report-on-americas-food-banks\">Do you have a story? Help us report on America's food banks.</a> </strong></p><h2>1. What's your typical day like? </h2><p><strong>Charles Meng (Arlington, Virginia): </strong>The typical day starts with our drivers picking up perishable and non-perishable food donations from the various grocery stores, bakeries and specialty stores which are delivered back to the Arlington Food Assistance Center warehouse. Our daily distribution begins with the arrival of our volunteer team to stock our shelves, sort donations that arrived overnight and assist our families in choosing the foods they need. While distribution begins at 9:30am, a line has normally formed by 8AM. Our mornings are very busy while the afternoon brings more individual and team volunteers to repackage produce and other foods that we buy in bulk, rice beans, and oatmeal. For example, every Wednesday night our chicken bagging team repackages bulk cases of chicken into 3 lb packages. Another dedicated volunteer team picks up food donations from the two nearby and very generous Trader Joe's grocery stores.</p><p><strong>Herman Carnie (Chicago): </strong>No two days are the same. I'm responsible for managing our food sourcing, inventory and transportation teams. Our facility is a 268,000 square-foot warehouse and distribution center located on Chicago's southwest side. It's a massive effort across the board for our organization to run smoothly. I arrive at 5:30am when the building opens and attend a 6am meeting where we review routes and assignments with our truck drivers. From that point forward my focus is on sourcing food and managing inventory.</p><p>Donations are the primary way we receive food. Shelf-stable food donations have dwindled in recent years, so we make a concerted effort to contact food manufacturers. If we get a call that there's a truckload in Cook County, we make plans to get the food. A phone call can change your day. We manage our inventory across 18 core food categories. If we're short on any item, we look to purchase. Healthy options are the biggest thing. It's a balancing act – we provide food for children so we're looking for nutritious items that kids will enjoy. At the same time, we also serve older adults, so foods that are easy to open and prepare are a necessity.</p><h2>2. How many people does your food bank typically help?</h2><p><strong>Charles Meng:</strong> Currently we are serving 1,517 families each week – that is 3,531 individuals, a third of whom are children under the age of 18. At the start of the recession, we were serving about 650 families each week. At our peak in February, 2012 we were serving 1,707 families each week – an increase of 262%.</p><p><strong>Herman Carnie:</strong> We provide food through a network of 650 pantries, soup kitchens and shelters. In the community we serve, more than 860,000 people are food insecure. This means 1 in 6 people is unsure where their next meal will come from. People are hungry all year-round. I volunteer every month at a pantry, and I see that many of the other people volunteering are now in line for food, too – they need the support. More people are in need of work. </p><h2>3. What's the craziest/most unexpected thing that's ever happened to you while on the job?</h2><p><strong>Charles Meng:</strong> A local women suggested, in all seriousness, that we find hunters who could kill and dress the deer foraging in her backyard so that we could serve it to our families. I referred her to the local animal welfare league.</p><p><strong>Herman Carnie:</strong> Four years ago, a donor came up with the idea of planting 20 acres of sweet corn to give to us. In the first year, we harvested 71,366 pounds of corn with the help of a farmer and our volunteers. We've now added five acres of squash, and have harvested more than 625,000 pounds of food total. In a few hours the corn and squash goes from the field into the hands of people in need. </p><h2>4. What do you wish politicians and more of the public would understand about poverty and hunger in America? </h2><p><strong>Herman Carnie:</strong> Any cut to programs affects people in a huge way, especially with SNAP (food stamps). We can't fill that gap, and the need won't go away. Every food stream that we have now will be tapped to a higher level. We have a team that helps to sign people up for SNAP. It's hard-working people who are just trying to make ends meet. There actually are a lot of people who are eligible for SNAP who don't know it's available. A lot of it is tied to red tape.</p><p><strong>Charles Meng:</strong> Hunger has a pernicious effect on all who suffer from it – children go to school hungry cannot focus on their studies as they need to, the elderly skip meals or go to the local fast food establishment where everything is high salt, high fat and high sugar, parents must work two and three jobs just to make ends meet but they never do meet, and pregnant mothers who do not have the resources to feed themselves and their growing child. The effects are a huge burden carried by our schools, our medical care system and our economy through higher costs, service demands and in numerous other smaller and larger ways.</p><h2>5. What makes for a really good day on the job? </h2><p><strong>Charles Meng:</strong> The best part of my job is being thanked by our grateful clients. And, it is not frequently on the job but rather on the street, or in a store where a cashier will stop me and say \"thanks for what you do\".</p><p><strong>Herman Carnie:</strong> Our team volunteers in the community a few times each year. This is an opportunity for us to see how grateful they are for the food they receive. It pulls it all together. </p><h2>6. Has the shutdown had an impact on your organization or the people you serve? </h2><p><strong>Charles Meng: </strong>In the last two weeks of September, we saw an increase of 96 families. We cannot tell yet if this is just because of the change in seasons or attributable to the government shutdown. However, while we are serving 1,500 families each week, we have over 2,500 active referrals, which means that any economic change, whether it be gas and food prices or a shutdown, will cause more families to come to us for help rather quickly.</p><p><strong>Herman Carnie:</strong> Not yet, but the shutdown could affect the people we serve if it doesn't end soon. We often ask ourselves: how do we continue to fill the widening gap.</p><h2>7. What do you think will happen when <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3899\">food stamp benefits are reduced</a> on 1 November?</h2><p><strong>Charles Meng: </strong> Any reduction will drive more families to come to AFAC for help. Here in Arlington the average SNAP benefit is $28.21 a week ($4 a day). That is not much for a family of four to live on. We provide supplemental groceries – fresh fruit and vegetables, mike, eggs, chicken, fish, a number of staples, cereals and an assortment of canned goods.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420070378|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|c2e4c64ba9126a13b026608fad90d8391c928a55 -->",

        "body":"<p><em>Scott Barbour has worked and overseen security at luxury hotels in Hollywood for 25 years. He's seen plenty of NBA players, boy bands and actors. He's opening up about life behind the cameras and doors as part of our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/a-days-work\">A day's work</a> series. Leave questions for Scott in the comments and he'll answer as many as he can later today.</em></p><h2>1. What's your typical day like?</h2><p>There really is no typical day in hotel security. We are the law enforcement, fire and EMS for the hotel. We respond to emergency situations daily. At one hotel I worked at, we had a great rooftop venue for weddings and parties. Along with the hotel guests, we also had to protect the 300 to 500 additional guests attending events. The London West Hollywood Hotel also hosted several VIP Events, such as the NBA All Star week, several MTV events and wrap parties for television shows.  We had to keep the celebrities and guests safe while keeping the public and paparazzi away. We had One Direction stay at the hotel for a week. We had several hundred teenage girls standing around the hotel trying to gain access to the guest floors. It reminded me of my days at the L'Ermitage Beverly Hills Hotel in 1998 when 'N Sync, the Backstreet Boys and the rap artists started getting big. The reason that I enjoy working in hotel security is that you never know what your day will bring.</p><h2>2. There's been a lot of talk lately about people wanting work/life balance. Does your job provide that?</h2><p>Work balance? What is that? A typical work day for me runs about 10 to 11 hours a shift. Driving back and forth to my home take another two hours out of my day. The rest of the time I spend with my beautiful wife. We are able to see each other almost every day. When events are happening at night, my hours extend to perhaps 15 or 16 a shift. I do not take long vacations. I am never farther than an hour's drive to the hotel. California has earthquakes and although I would love to take a cruise somewhere or go to Las Vegas, I personally feel that if an emergency happens, I must be able to respond immediately.</p><h2>3. What's the craziest/most unexpected thing that's ever happened to you while on the job?</h2><p>After working for the police department, driving an ambulance and working in hotel security, you can imagine that I have seen and done a thing or two. But top of my list is a story from my hotel industry days. It was a Sunday afternoon, and I had been promoted to Security Supervisor two days earlier, so I was totally responsible for the safety of our hotel guests. The hotel had 30 stories with an independent restaurant on the first floor. I got a radio call from the dispatcher. He said that the restaurant just reported that someone had just jumped off of the restaurant roof. As I am going to the scene, I am going over situations in my mind. Since he jumped off of the restaurant roof, he may have a sprained ankle or some cuts. Should I get one of my officers to respond with the first aid kit? When I got to the restaurant, they showed me the direction that they heard the noise come from. I went out onto the courtyard with the ivy hill. There in front of me lay an obviously deceased male. After securing the scene and having the police and fire take over, I had to determine who he was and what happened. It turned out that he jumped from the 26th floor balcony and hit the restaurant roof before landing in the ivy. He had just broken up and took his own life. There were suicide notes and photos spread throughout the guest room. It was so sad. I will never forget that.</p><h2>4. What makes for a really good day on the job?</h2><p>Just about every day is a great day in the hotel business. Hotel employees are the most well behaved, willing to help and friendly people that I have ever met. We are constantly going out of our way to give our guests first class treatment. That treatment goes toward employees as well. I come from a luxury hotel background. Just walking through the beautiful property rather than in some concrete warehouse is relaxing. We also get complimentary meals every day.</p><p>I worked for a large convention hotel that held luncheons and dinner events daily.  After serving the guests, the extra prime rib dinners, the salmon plates and 10 different desserts were brought down to the employee cafeteria. Those were great. Then there are the great flower arrangements. We had an average of 60 to 70 tables for most banquet events. Each table had it's own beautiful flower decorations. The guests were allowed to take home the arrangements, but they were so huge that most guests left them behind. I surprised my wife one morning with 20 flower arrangements decorating our living room. Ahh, those were the days.</p><h2>5. What's your annual salary? Do you get benefits?</h2><p>The typical salary for a hotel security director is approximately $40,000 per year.  Depending on the hotel, salaries can go up to $50,000 a year. That is for a typical security director. I opened two five-star hotels and have been a security director for three hotels. Opening a hotel, especially a first-class operation takes a lot of work. I wrote all of the security procedures manuals, the hotel's emergency procedures manuals and hired new staff. My salary started at $65,000, and I ended with a salary of approximately $70,000. We got some benefits. We received sick and vacation pay, discounts at sister hotels, and I was part of a bonus plan.</p><h2>6. What's the biggest mistake you've ever made while working?</h2><p>My biggest mistake was thinking that if you did your job well, took care of your team, gave your best every day and stayed out of trouble, you would be able to keep your job. My position at the London Hotel in West Hollywood was \"eliminated\" three days prior to my five-year anniversary. I got a call to go to Human Resources. When I got there, I was simply told that my position was eliminated today and to pack up my things immediately. My benefit package would have gotten much better after the five-year mark. I climbed the ladder twice to get to the position that I attained. I do not want to climb that ladder again, but it looks like that is exactly what I will need to do.</p><p><strong><em>Do you have an interesting day job?

        "body":"<p><em><em>Jenn Park-Mustacchio</em>&nbsp;is a licensed funeral director and embalmer who works in New Jersey, USA. She studied anthropology and human biology at the University of Pennsylvania, and has been in the funeral industry for 14 years. <strong>So what would you like to know? Leave your questions in the comments.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Jenn will pop in throughout the day to answer them.</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Take us through a regular day at work:</strong></p> <p>Typically, my day begins when someone dies. Since I'm a trade embalmer, I don't handle the first call or transport of a deceased person (although I've previously done both). My boss calls me, and I arrive at the funeral home shortly after the deceased has been taken into our care to begin the embalming process. I suit up in personal protective equipment (a gown, apron, shoe covers, gloves etc) and evaluate the person to decide how I will proceed. Every case is different and requires a special combination of fluids (which are mixed according to the height, weight and physical conditions of the deceased). I mix the fluids accordingly and begin to set the features.</p> <p>Setting the features involves closing the eyes and mouth and placing cotton in the mouth to give the person a more natural expression. Next, I gently flex the arms, legs and fingers to relieve the muscle tension or stiffness of rigor mortis. I position the hands one over the other, wash the body, cover the genitals (to preserve modesty) and prepare the tools I will need to embalm.</p> <p>Typically, we use a scalpel to make a small incision near the right collarbone. From there, we search for the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein. A small incision is made in each. Arterial tubes are placed in the artery (one is directed towards the heart, while the other is directed towards the head). A drain tube, or angled forceps, is also placed in the vein to facilitate drainage of blood. The hose, connected to the embalming machine, is then connected to the arterial tube directed towards the heart. The embalming machine is then adjusted to regulate pressure (the force of the fluid) and rate of flow (speed of the fluid). These knobs are adjusted differently during embalming for each case to create the optimum rate of injection for the body. The machine is switched on and the fluid begins to move through the hose, through the arterial tube and into the body. As the embalming fluid is pushed through the arterial system, the blood is forced out through the jugular vein.</p> <p>The body is vigorously massaged with a soapy sponge to help facilitate drainage and distribution of embalming fluid. The tissue will begin to firm and take on a rosy appearance, which is an excellent indication of adequate distribution and a successful embalming. The tubes are then removed, the vein and artery tied off and the incision is sutured. Next, the cavity is treated. Fluid is suctioned from the hollow organs with an instrument called a trocar, then a high-index (very strong) fluid is placed into the cavity and the incision is closed with a small circular plastic button like device referred to as a trocar button. The deceased is again washed. Their hair is combed and cream is placed on their face to prevent skin dehydration. The deceased is then covered and will remain in the preparation room until they are dressed, cosmetized and ready to be placed into a casket for viewing.</p> <p>Typically the viewing takes place a few days after death. So I will clean up the prep room and leave until it's time for the next embalming or until its time to dress and casket someone who's been previously embalmed.</p> <p>*The above is a description of a &quot;typical&quot; embalming. If a person dies tragically (murder, suicide, automobile accident) the embalming process is drastically different.</p> <p><strong>Tell us about something surprising, or unexpected, that happened to you while working:</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;I've had several interesting things happen on the job, but one particular moment comes to mind. I went in for a 3am embalming and heard a strange whisper. I quickly fumbled for the lights and, upon turning them on, figured out that the noise was coming from the occupied stretcher. I approached with caution expecting the person inside could be alive. However, upon unzipping the cover, I found a tape recorder (that I later found out was playing a Buddhist chant). The next day the family explained that, ideally, a monk would be at the place of death to chant when the soul exits the body. Chanting calms the soul, which the buddhists believe, is in a state of confusion and fright after exiting the body. The soul of the deceased must be put at ease with food and chant throughout the difficult time of transition. This particular experience was both enlightening and frightening!</p> <p><strong>What makes for a really good day at work?</strong></p> <p>My job is fulfilling when a particularly difficult case comes out better than expected. If a family decides to keep a casket open, when they previously thought they wouldn't be able to, or when someone compliments my work. The best compliment I got was from a woman whose daughter died of bone cancer. She took my hand and said, &quot;Thank you, she's so beautiful, she looks like she could get up and dance.&quot;</p> <p><strong>What is your salary? Do you get benefits?</strong></p> <p>The median annual income for funeral directors in the US is over $52,000 (with the annual salary in New Jersey averaging above $79,000). Regulations vary state by state, but here in New Jersey we are embalmers/funeral directors and are licensed to handle all aspects of the funeral (from first call to final disposition). In other states they have separate licenses for funeral directors and embalmers.</p> <p>Even though I am licensed to perform all aspects of the business, I work as an embalmer because I enjoy that particular aspect of the business and found that it allows me to spend a significant amount of time with my family. Trade embalmers, like myself, are paid by the job. Usually we work for more than one location and will embalm, dress, casket, cosmetize and do restorative work. Trade embalmers have the potential to make significantly more than the average funeral director depending on how many locations they work for and how busy those locations are. However, we do not receive health benefits because we are not full-time employees.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever made a mistake at work?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>I'm fortunate enough to say that I have not made any major mistakes. When I was an intern, I was super careful and very aware that any mistake I made could potentially affect the grieving process of the deceased friends and loved ones, so I always consulted with senior funeral directors if I was unsure of what to do or how to proceed with difficult cases.</p> <h2><strong><em>Do you have an interesting job?

The tacks have wires that are then twisted together to hold the mouth closed. This is almost always done because, when relaxed, the mouth stays open. We also use cotton to fill out hollow cheeks or give the appearance of teeth to those who have none, or are missing a few. The device under the eye is actually a serrated plastic eye cap that helps keep the eye closed. I do not enjoy the look of them, so I don't use them. Cotton is usually sufficient to use under an eyelid if the eye has deflated. However, we usually don't need to use anything under the eyelid at all.

Here in NJ you are only required to be embalmed if you're being transported across state lines. Some people choose to embalm before viewing because they prefer the life like appearance that embalming imparts. Some are embalmed, have a viewing and are cremated. It's strictly the choice of the family. From what I understand, embalming is not common in the UK, but that doesn't mean that the morticians don't set the features. I'm assuming this may be what you're referring to. It is possible to set the features (close the eyes and mouth) and cosmetize the deceased for viewing without embalming.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p>Q:&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28248995\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4395157\" title=\"View goddesszooeysapostle’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/01/13/goddesszooeysapostle/90596883-3ff7-4f5e-9c23-d536d0b0b164/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for goddesszooeysapostle\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/4395157\" title=\"View goddesszooeysapostle’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">goddesszooeysapostle</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28248995\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">24 October 2013 2:47pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Do you believe in any kind of conscious existence after physical death?

Thank you.</p> <p>Embalming is usually selected when there's a public viewing followed by a burial (or cremation). Last I checked the cremation rate in the US was around 40% (and many of the people choosing this option are not embalmed). So, my educated guess is that around 60% of people in the US are still embalmed.</p> <p>The funeral industry is moving away from formaldehyde based fluids and opting to use glutaraldehyde based fluids (which is considered to be the &quot;greener&quot; embalming option). Glutaraldehyde is also used to sterilize medical equipment in certain corcumstances and is far less toxic than formaldehyde.</p> <p>I will always attempt reconstruction if the family requests it, but I would advise against viewing if I didn't feel like my attempt was presentable. Sometimes anything is better than the last memory a person was left with. If someone who died tragically was found by their loved one, it is my job to try my best to restore the appearance and give that loved one a more pleasant memory than the one they were left with.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p>Q:&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28253372\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10103913\" title=\"View JohnJohnJohnJohn’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JohnJohnJohnJohn\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10103913\" title=\"View JohnJohnJohnJohn’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JohnJohnJohnJohn</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28253372\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">24 October 2013 4:47pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>If a man dies and he didn't shave that day, do you shave him?</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p>A:&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28257505\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12439397\" title=\"View JenniferMustacchio’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2013/10/23/12439397/29cef8c7-0149-432e-82ec-805ab4386524/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JenniferMustacchio\" /> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12439397\" title=\"View JenniferMustacchio’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JenniferMustacchio</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28257505\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">24 October 2013 7:05pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Yes.</p></div> </div> </div> </figure><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420788195|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|e7047531055611aa75def91aa273e18e55bfafb2 -->",
