The oil giant also maintains a 1,200-strong internal police force in Nigeria, plus a network of plainclothes informants.</p><p>According to the data, the world's largest company by revenue spent nearly $1bn on worldwide security between 2007-09: if it were a country Shell would have the third highest security budget in Africa, after South Africa and Nigeria itself.</p><p>The documents show that nearly 40% of Shell's total security expenditure over the three year period – $383m (£244m) – was spent on protecting its staff and installations in Nigeria's volatile Niger delta region. In 2009, $65m was spent on Nigerian government forces and $75m on \"other\" security costs – believed to be a mixture of private security firms and payments to individuals.</p><p>Activists expressed concern that the escalating cost of Shell's security operation in the delta was further destabilising the oil rich region and helping to fuel rampant corruption and criminality. \"The scale of Shell's global security expenditure is colossal,\" said Ben Amunwa of London-based oil watchdog Platform. \"It is staggering that Shell transferred $65m of company funds and resources into the hands of soldiers and police known for routine human rights abuses.\"</p><p>The financial documents, <a href=\"http://t.co/fHAITY4j\">passed to Platform</a>, suggest Shell's worldwide security costs almost doubled between 2007-2009, coinciding with the rise of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/may/10/oil.world\" title=\"\">armed insurgency in the Niger delta</a>.</p><p>In 2008, 62 Shell employees or contractors were kidnapped and three killed, many Shell-operated pipelines, well heads and offshore oil platforms were attacked and the company was forced to halt oil exports for several weeks after attacks by groups including the Movement for the emancipation of the Niger delta.</p><p>Nearly a third of Shell's global security budget in 2008, or $99m, was spent on \"third parties\". This was double what the company spent on its own security staff and is believed to include the services of 600 Nigerian government police and 700 members of the controversial state \"joint task force\" (JTF) comprised of army, navy and police.</p><p>Shell denies having any direct control over JTF forces, amid <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/21/hundreds-killed-niger-delta\" title=\"\">numerous accusations of human rights abuses</a>, including a large-scale military attack in 2009 which the US state department said led to the displacement and loss of livelihood of tens of thousands of residents.</p><p>But in the past Shell has supplied government forces with gunboats, helicopters, vehicles and satellite phones to better patrol the myriad creeks and waterways of the delta.</p><p>\"This proves what we in the Niger delta have known for years – that the air force, the army, the police, they are paid for with Shell money and they are all at the disposal of the company for it to use it any how it likes,\" said Celestine Nkabari at the Niger delta campaign group Social Action.</p><p>According to Platform, a significant amount of Shell funding is channelled via senior military officials which provides \"ample opportunities for corruption\". US cables, released by WikiLeaks in 2010, alleged that the company paid hundreds of thousands of pounds towards the deployment of 350 soldiers in the delta in 2003.</p><p>But Shell International said that any allegations of corruption should be addressed to the Nigerian authorities, and that its spending is necessary to protect its staff and operations.</p><p>Although armed insurgency in the oil producing regions of the delta has declined since a 2009 amnesty, the company says it faces widespread criminality, organised crime and massive oil theft. It has stated that 15-20% of its output is stolen by international gangs.</p><p>\"Protecting our people and our assets is Shell's highest priority,\" it said. \"Our spending on security is carefully judged to meet this objective, wherever we operate in the world. We have always acknowledged the difficulties of working in countries like Nigeria. In the period that this report refers to, the armed militancy in the Niger delta was at its height, requiring a relatively high level of security spending there.</p><p>\"All our staff and contractors are expected to adhere to the highest levels of personal and corporate ethics, as set out in our code of conduct. We support the Voluntary principles on security and human rights (VPSHR), and we recognise that these principles help maintain the safety and security of our operations in a manner consistent with upholding human rights. We also investigate grievances under the VPSHR.\"</p><p>The company declined to comment on whether worldwide costs for security were increasing because of the Arab spring. The company has recently left Syria and has interests throughout the Middle East.</p><p>But the scale of Shell's spending, revealed by the data for the first time, raises questions about the effectiveness of its security policies. \"What is striking about the amount being spent in Nigeria is its ineffectiveness,\" said Amunwa. \"Shell spent many millions of dollars each year on government forces who failed to provide the company with adequate security.\"</p><p>Nkabari said: \"Shell cannot call this spending 'security'. If it was really providing security, then why do we continue to have vandalisation, why do we have bunkering [theft of oil], why do we have the security mess that we have in the Niger delta? They give protection to the oil workers but they are not providing the region with 'security'.\"</p><p>\"These figures are alarming – it is a scandal that so much money is spent on security instead of on the local communities whose livelihoods are destroyed as a result of the oil exploitation,\" said Jaff Napoleon Bamenjo of Relufa, which campaigns for environmental justice in west Africa.</p><p>\"Across Africa oil, mining and agro-industry companies regularly pay for the services of local security forces that have deplorable human rights records; sometimes as a contractual obligation,\" said Bamenjo. \"This is an extremely unethical practice held over from the colonial era which must end immediately. Not only is it bad for local communities who are the primary victims of police and military predation, but as Shell well knows, it exposes foreign companies to lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions.\"</p>","headline":"Shell spending millions of dollars on security in Nigeria, leaked data shows","trailText":"<p>Internal documents reveal oil company spent $383m over three years protecting staff and installations in Niger delta region</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"1","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/39p8b","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/19/1345397841020/Shell-in-the-Niger-delta-003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/19/1345397841020/Shell-in-the-Niger-delta-003.jpg","wordcount":"996","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"394922833","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6561337","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Afua Hirsch and John Vidal","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-20T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1789922","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-22T17:38:51Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/19/shell-spending-security-nigeria-leak","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/aug/19/shell-spending-security-nigeria-leak","tags":[{"id":"business/royaldutchshell","webTitle":"Royal Dutch Shell","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/business/royaldutchshell"},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","references":[],"type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/topstories","webTitle":"Top stories","references":[],"type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories"},{"id":"profile/johnvidal","webTitle":"John Vidal","rcsId":"GNL001546","r2ContributorId":"15886","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/john_vidal_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>John Vidal is the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment\">environment</a> editor.

Identifying a global plan is a vast challenge and makes Friends of the Earth's <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">work</a> back home in the UK seem quite straightforward by comparison.</p><p>There are some common threads amid the great complexity, however. In our debates between Friends of the Earth campaigners from more than 70 countries, I am constantly brought back to one big unifying dilemma: how can we resolve the clash of interest between those who are well off, and those who are in poverty, and do that at the same times as protecting the Earth's vital ecological systems, including a stable climate?</p><p>At our international meetings, local community activists from our host country join us. Their perspectives help to put our global strategies into context. The people who have come this time work with our hosts from Friends of the Earth Nigeria, and come from the troubled Niger Delta region.</p><p>People who live in the Delta are quite used to the outside world coming into their communities to get their local resources. Centuries ago British traders came for palm oil, a material produced from a local species of palm tree. The Royal Niger Company was one of the foreign business ventures that sought to gain control of this resource. The company wasn't interested in fair trade, it just wanted to get the palm oil and to sell it. It used a range of tactics to do this, including the regular kidnapping of tribal leaders so as to ensure the compliance of local populations.</p><p>Initially they took the palm oil being grown locally then the foreign traders took seeds from West African oil palms and started to grow them elsewhere in the tropics, in Malaysia for example. Later, the international resource companies came back. Again it was for oil, this time crude oil. For more than four decades foreign oil companies have been operating in the Delta region. Our very own Shell is among them, and is now responsible for more than half of the oil production now coming from the Delta.</p><p>Ten years ago the plight of the people living in the Niger Delta was brought to international attention when Nigeria's government decided to execute a group of environmental and human rights campaigners. Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues were raising pressure on the oil companies and Nigerian government because of the environmental devastation being caused in their homelands, and they were killed for that.</p><p>The outcry that followed the execution of the campaigners put the impact of Shell's Nigerian operations into the international spotlight and led the company to embark on a process of so-called corporate social responsibility (CSE). \"We understand that there are some problems,\" the company said, \"but we can sort it out. Just leave it to us.\"</p><p>A decade after the Nigerian human rights scandals rocked Shell, the testimonies from the communities who live next to the company's operations are more shocking than ever. They tell of pollution of land and water that continues to undermine their food security, health and livelihoods: croplands are poisoned and the river fish that people used to catch are either tainted with petroleum or gone. Billions of cubic feet of natural gas is flared by the oil companies next to where people live. They say that combusting the gas in the air creates a constant terrible roaring noise, it causes pollution that kills people, it is a source of acid rain, a terrible waste of fuel and of course is unnecessarily contributing to climate change. Amazingly, some four decades ago the British government recognised that gas flaring might in the end lead to those responsible being attacked for wasting Nigeria's natural resources. How right they were. But Shell carries on regardless.</p><p>Rather than stop the gas flaring and clean up the oil spills, Shell is inclined to blame the appalling environmental problems of the Delta on sabotage. There is some of that, because people are very angry. But it is by no means the source of all the pollution there. Shell claims sabotage against even buried pipelines, and even when the leaks are on the underside and could not have been caused by saboteurs.</p><p>The Climate Justice Programme and Friends of the Earth Nigeria have been working with people living in the Delta in order to gain some legal redress for them, including by bringing legal actions against Shell and the other main oil companies operating in the Delta to the Nigerian courts. This has been successful in <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200609290748.html\">securing</a> a judgment that holds the flaring to be illegal and an infringement of human rights. In any event, Shell has chosen to appeal the ruling that it must stop flaring and carries on as before.</p><p>One reason they can do this is because of the vast inequality of power that exists here. The fact is that the powerful can frustrate and slow down progress and the weak and vulnerable are thus at a perpetual disadvantage, even when the law is on their side. Last Tuesday court staff changed the date of a hearing without warning to the community representatives from the Delta who had travelled there. Shell had been informed though. The judge was surprised by this and ordered an inquiry. But it was too late for the communities, their day in court was lost and it may be that if a future date is set that they may not be able to come.</p><p>In any event, Friends of the Earth Nigeria and the people of the Delta see their struggle as being about much more than a breach (no matter how flagrant) of Nigerian environmental laws and human rights codes. They see it as part of a global struggle between those who have power and those who do not. They believe that the resources beneath the ground where they live belongs to them, and that foreign oil companies, no matter how big or powerful, have no right to take those resources away without their consent.</p><p>The injustice that is the context for their struggle against Shell is underlined by the grinding poverty suffered by the people who live on top of the oil and gas. The mineral wealth of the Delta has underpinned the Nigerian economy and has enabled the country to become (by African standards at any rate) a regional superpower. Despite many billions of dollars-worth of oil being extracted, the vast majority of the locals have seen virtually no benefits, only harm.</p><p>The perspective of the Delta activists is not, however, based solely on their local circumstances. They know about the chaos that is coming with global climate change and can already see changes taking place in their local environment, never mind what is happening to the rest of the African continent. If they had their way, if they had control of the resources, they would leave the oil in the ground: and that would do us all a favour.</p><p>The reason they can't secure this outcome is not only because of the Nigerian government's decision to agree joint venture production agreements with foreign oil companies like Shell, it is because of the demand for oil in the vastly over-consuming economies in the developed world. The west runs on oil, and the western governments, the UK and US among them, are developing strategies to get what is left out of the ground, including the oil that lies off the Nigerian coast.</p><p>Bush and Blair have already worked up plans for the exploitation of the oil and gas that lies beneath the Gulf of Guinea, and if they get their way then the environmental and human rights abuses and the corruption that has come with oil extraction in the Delta will be repeated. In helping to satisfy the hunger of the oil companies for access to more oil reserves, western governments (the UK included) are binding us all into a system that will perpetuate the abuses that are so clear to the people of the Delta.</p><p>Each time we fill up our cars, we are thus contributing to the pressure that is driving the exploitation of distant natural resources and in so doing driving environmental degradation, and in some places serious abuses of human rights. I think most people are broadly aware that cars are not good for the environment, but coming to Nigeria makes the connections between how we live and the distant consequences of our convenience all the more vivid.</p><p>Seeing the anger and hearing the experiences of people here makes me wonder how Shell can get away with it back home. One answer to that, of course, are effective public relations. Shell has become a master at using glossy reports and cleverly worded statements to create an undeserved impression that it is an environmentally responsible firm. You also can't necessarily trust what the company says. It does not only do this when it comes to its environmental performance, Philip Watts, its former Chairman and previous director of Shell's operations here in Nigeria, was effectively fired by shareholders when he was exposed lying about the size of the company's oil reserves. The PR didn't save him that time, because it was shareholder's money that was at stake. When it comes to poor Africans, however, the PR does still seem to work.</p><p>One of the firm's newest PR vehicles is the Shell Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. This prestigious award was for years run by BBC Wildlife Magazine, and today is a joint scheme between that publication and the Natural History Museum. Shell is the new corporate sponsor. Inspiring images of birds, whales, insects and incredible natural landscapes are submitted to be judged and winners announced at a glitzy event in London. It generates a lot of publicity and of course gives the impression that Shell cares about the environment.</p><p>We live in a finite world where the clashing interests of those who consume vast quantities of energy and resources and those who suffer the consequences are becoming ever more acute. While managing down this tension must be a priority for the 21st century, our governments and largest companies are leading us in the opposite direction. They are doing it on the basis of a false presentation of the notion of \"energy security\" and through the smoke and mirrors of PR.</p><p>If we, the \"haves\", are to help resolve the deep conflicts that exist with the \"have-nots\", then we must more effectively control the impacts we create on the rest of the world. One way to do that would be to ensure that the companies bill that will shortly come before parliament for its final stages is amended. This legislation could place a requirement on directors of companies like Shell to minimise the impacts they create on the environment and people, and to clear the way for legal actions to be brought in the British courts by local communities suffering harm because of the overseas operations of UK companies. Voluntary action and PR cannot do the job. Directors need new duties, and people need access to justice.</p>","headline":"They carry on regardless","trailText":"<p><strong>Tony Juniper:</strong> Oil companies must change their practices to help put a stop to environmental problems in the Niger Delta region.</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/xbf9m","wordcount":"1836","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"334101626","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tony Juniper","newspaperEditionDate":"2006-10-03T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"759154","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2006-10-05T10:15:46Z"},"rights":{},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/03/post469","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/03/post469","tags":[],"references":[],"elements":[]},{"webTitle":"Shell faces violence in Nigeria","webPublicationDate":"2003-03-21T02:30:39Z","sectionName":"World news","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2003/mar/21/oil.business","fields":{"hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2003-03-21T02:30:39Z","body":"Violence has escalated in the volatile Niger delta with up to 15 people killed in intercommunity conflicts in the past week and oil companies forced to evacuate staff and cut production. <P>Shell Nigeria, the largest oil company in Nigeria's delta region, said yesterday it had been forced to shut down 10 oil-flow stations and that it was losing 126,000 barrels a day of crude, after the escalation of the crisis in the state of Delta.  <P>The company said it had evacuated 145 workers from its Escravos oil centre, which had been partly burned down by rampaging youths.

A third, smaller explosion hit a venue at nearby Eagle Square, where the president sat with hundreds of Nigerian and foreign dignitaries. Jonathan, who faces an election next year, left in an armoured limousine without making a scheduled address. The celebrations, with army bands, dancing children and air force displays, continued without him.</p><p>Mend has been fighting for years for a greater share of oil revenues from the Niger delta, home to Africa's biggest oil and gas industry. The delta, which is also home to the president, is impoverished and polluted by spills.</p><p>In its warning email, Mend said: \"For 50 years, the people of the Niger delta have had their land and resources stolen from them.\" The group has previously operated primarily in the delta, hundreds of miles from the capital, although it has struck offshore oil installations and in the country's commercial capital, Lagos. Today's attacks, the first on Abuja and launched in defiance of tight security surrounding the celebrations marking Nigeria's independence from the UK, are the militants' boldest yet.</p><p>\"Two car bombs exploded and eight people are confirmed dead,\" Abuja police spokesman Jimoh Moshood told Reuters.

Eleven years after his own father was killed there, Ken Wiwa reports from the Niger Delta on the persistent conflict that is tearing the country apart","hasStoryPackage":"false","lastModified":"2008-06-12T23:58:13Z","body":"In a hotel in the city of Warri in southern Nigeria, a mobile phone rings impatiently. Even at six in the morning the city is roasting under a fierce sun. Warri is waking up to another hard day in its hard history. Populated mainly by three ethnic groups, it has been the theatre for the fierce rivalry and drama that animates the Itshekiri, Urhobo and Ijaw. Money has since been poured onto this smouldering ethnic fire from the proceeds of oil, turning the city into an industrial beast with the character of a frontier town.<P>At the end of the phone is a deep baritone voice. 'I am Adams of Mend,' the caller says, revealing himself as a member of the newly notorious militia, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta.<P>A few minutes after the call a new okada pulls up outside the hotel. A short young man steps off the small motorbike. 'Please come mister journalist, I know you,' he calls out, 'I am Adams of Mend.'<P>After a short bike ride and a two-hour speedboat journey, we arrive at a small village community to the west of Warri. As the boat comes to a stop, about 25 men emerge from a house, armed with AK 47 rifles and with rocket-fired grenades wrapped around their waists.<P>The insurgents don't bother to hide their identity. They are polite and friendly. At a thatched house in the community, which they insist on calling a 'camp', the militants showcase their arsenal, repeatedly insisting that they are prepared to go to war.<P>The history, politics and culture of the Niger River Delta is as rich, complex and intricate as the ecology of the Africa's largest floodplain. The delta covers an area of dense rainforest, sand ridges, mangrove forests and swamps with a labyrinthine distribution of tidal channels, streams, rivers and creeks. Rich in natural resources such as timber, coal, palm oil, natural gas and crude oil, it is also one of the most densely populated areas of the globe and one of the world's largest wetlands. And it is virtually impossible to patrol.<P>This rich but fragile ecosystem is often described as the heart and lungs of Nigeria and, since oil was discovered there in 1956, the region has delivered some $300bn to Nigeria's treasury.<P>It is the revenue from oil that keeps the 400 or so ethnic groups known as Nigeria together. Without it, the country might already have split. The kola nut that binds the agreement at the heart of the Nigerian constitution is known as the 'derivation formula'.<P>At independence in 1960, each of Nigeria's three regions was entitled to half the revenue from minerals found there, with the balance going to the federal government. Over the next 30 years fiscal chicanery reduced the formula so that the regions received as little as 1.3 per cent; central government got the rest.<P>In the Nineties my father, Ken Saro-Wiwa, stoked the embers of Niger Delta politics, agitating for a greater share of federal oil revenue. There had been a history of groups and movements demanding a greater share of the resources, the struggles alternating between violent and non-violent. One such movement, led by an Ijaw army officer, Isaac Boro, declared a Federal Republic of Niger Delta in 1966. It lasted 12 days. Boro was killed in mysterious circumstances during the Nigerian civil war but his memory has periodically fanned the flames of Niger Deltans and especially those of his Ijaw peoples who are the largest ethnic group in the region and the fourth-largest in Nigeria.<P>During his lifetime my father proselytised on behalf of the region but it wasn't until he anchored his political philosophy to the rights of the Ogoni that he attracted national and then global attention to the problems of the delta. His adoption of a non-violent approach was met with state violence by the then ruling military regime of General Sani Abacha.<P>In my father's final statement to the tribunal that convicted him in October 1995, he wrote: 'I predict that a denouement of the riddle of the Niger Delta will soon come. The agenda is being set at this trial. Whether the peaceful ways I have favoured will prevail depends on what the oppressor decides, what signals it sends out to the waiting public.'<P>It may come as a surprise to the visitor but Port Harcourt is known as the 'garden city'. Once a quiet, leafy place on the Atlantic coast, now the city's streets and neighbourhoods are a study in the challenges of governing Nigeria. The city's okada drivers and mass transit drivers appear to obey only one rule: to defy common sense and traffic regulations whenever possible. Despite road users' worst intentions, the Port Harcourt traffic is approaching manageable proportions and the city is enjoying a relatively peaceful dry season - but most people here are aware that the respite may be temporary. All the ingredients for civil strife are in the air: the city is not far from Owerri, scene of bloodshed over the Danish cartoons. Every week people pour in from Warri and the western Niger Delta, fleeing the upsurge in violence. Foreigners increasingly employ armed guards.<P>Almost as unquantifiable and uncontrollable as the delta itself is the informal network of armed youths who claim to be fighting for the emancipation of the Niger Delta.Their exact origins, size and operations are not easy to gauge. The lack of employment and career opportunities tempted many young graduates and unemployed youths into criminal syndicates.<P>A recent addition to criminal activities is oil bunkering - siphoning oil from pipelines onto barges, which are then sold on the high seas. Official estimates suggest that Nigeria loses 100,000 barrels daily through oil bunkering. The lucrative practice is rumoured to involve the complicity of oil company employees and highly placed government officials.<P>The full story is waiting to be told. Thus far only two naval officers have being held in connection with bunkering but it is an open secret among youths here that the 'business' is an alliance of mutually beneficial arrangements between officials, soldiers, ex-soldiers and the militias. If the business is shrouded in clandestine operations, the chain of violence is clear enough: Human Rights Watch says that oil bunkering is responsible for fuelling the gang-related violence in the delta that killed 1,000 Nigerians in 2004.<P>Port Harcourt and the eastern Niger Delta may be relatively calm - due to the non-violence that the Ogoni advocated - but there is a deeper irony in that much of the current instability in the Niger Delta can be traced to armed gangs that mushroomed and thrived there.<P>Beyond belonging to a mutual admiration society, Osama bin Laden and Niger Delta militia leader Alhaji Asari Dokubo have one other thing in common: the global oil markets respond to their actions. Asari Dokubo gained his notoriety in 2004 when his threat to blow up all oil facilities in the delta sent oil prices soaring above $50 for the first time. Calling his group the Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force(NDPVF), Asari Dokubo claimed right up to his arrest in September 2005 that he had 10,000 men ready to reclaim the resources of the Niger Delta for its people.<P>Whether or not the figures are correct, the reality is that the NDPVF is a decentralised amalgam of groups working in cells that are connected only by a common ambition. For a time Asari Dokubo was clearly the leader but his star peaked after sending oil prices past the $50 barrier and waned once the Bush administration encouraged the Nigerian government to broker an arms for cash deal with the NDPVF.<P>The 'deal' is said to have caused some disagreements within the NDPVF, leading to the creation of the breakaway faction operating as Mend. Although the NDPVF's fortunes appear to be linked to the personality of Asari Dokubo, last week's demands by Mend that Asari Dokubo be freed would suggest that the network is intact and perhaps working under an umbrella movement.<P>Tackling oil bunkering is the nettle that needs to be grasped and government efforts to do so led, indirectly and unintentionally, to the recent spate of hostage taking and kidnappings.<P>If President Obasanjo had hoped that a Joint Military Task Force would cut off the supply of oil, arms and money to the militia, he will be disappointed by the results so far. Reports suggest that, rather than enforcing the peace, the activities of some members of the JTF, as the task force is known, have created resentment among local people and the militia.<P>'When we saw they were involved [in oil bunkering] the boys got angry,' one youth told us last week. 'Why should they take away the oil when they are not even from here?'<P>Other reports accuse the soldiers of taking over the lucrative boat rental business to oil companies, which used to be the preserve of local operators. 'Because of JTF, we are almost unemployed now. Officers go to the oil companies and supply them boats for security patrol. We charge less but the oil companies prefer them because of their military connection,' an operator told a reporter from one Nigerian newspaper.<P>The latest sequence of events began on 11 January when Mend militants stormed a Shell oil vessel and took four foreigners on board hostage. Mend made a three-pronged demand: the release of Asari Dokubo; freedom for the impeached Bayelsa State Governor, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, who is on trial on money laundering charges; and payment of $1.5bn approved by the Nigerian Senate as compensation from Shell to communities affected by oil spills.<P>Four days later in a show of strength Mend militia attacked two houseboats, killing 15 JTF soldiers. Two weeks later Mend announced the release of the hostages on humanitarian grounds - and three communities were attacked by a JTF helicopter gunship. The JTF claimed the attacks were meant to stamp out oil bunkering but insiders insist that they were reprisal raids. Nine more hostages were taken in response to these attacks and, although six of them have since been released, the militia have vowed to fight on until the federal government meets their demands.<P>'We are continuing with our attacks on oil facilities and oil workers. We will act without further warning,' they said.<P>So far they have not fulfilled their promise but the country is holding its breath.

Next month, 14 years after his execution, the Nigerian environmental activist's dying wish is to be fulfilled. </p><p>In a New York federal court, Shell and one of its senior executives are to face charges that in the early 1990s in Nigeria they were complicit in human rights abuses, including summary execution and torture. </p><p>The Anglo-Dutch company, if found liable, could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in damages. No multinational has ever been found guilty  of human rights abuses, although two previous cases saw major claims settled outside court.</p><p>Saro-Wiwa became famous as a campaigner on behalf of the Ogoni people, leading peaceful protests against the environmental damage caused by oil companies in the Niger Delta. There was worldwide condemnation when, along with eight other activists, he was hanged by the Nigerian military government in 1995 after being charged with incitement to murder after the death of four Ogoni elders. Many of the prosecution witnesses later admitted that they had been bribed to give evidence against Saro-Wiwa, who was a respected television writer and businessman. </p><p>Lawyers in New York will allege that Shell actively subsidised a campaign of terror by security forces in the Niger Delta and attempted to influence the trial that led to Saro-Wiwa's execution. The lawsuit alleges that the company attempted to bribe two witnesses in his trial to testify against him. Members of Saro-Wiwa's family will take the stand for the first time to give their version of events, among them his brother Owens, who will allege that Brian Anderson, managing director of Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, told him: \"It would not be impossible to get charges dropped if protests were called off.\" Anderson is fighting the action.</p><p>Witnesses who were shot by military police in the Niger Delta principally to protect the building of Shell's oil pipeline will allege that Shell, by paying the police to protect its interests, was complicit in acts of violence.</p><p>Speaking to the Observer from Abuja, Nigeria, Saro-Wiwa's son, Ken Wiwa, said: \"For 14 years we have lived with the memory of a father, an uncle, a brother, a son executed for a crime he didn't commit. We have daily reminders. It's painful to live with a monstrous injustice. To wake up one day to finally get our day in court is tremendously satisfying.</p><p>\"After the injustice of the original crime against my father, having to watch legal arguments [by Shell] using the highest-paid lawyers in the world is sickening. You can't describe how painful that is to go through. </p><p>\"Part of the reason for the original protest was the way Shell behaved. Ogoni people made their living farming and fishing, but Shell was using open waste pits and oil pipelines criss-crossed the land. These polluting activities were put on top of a delicate ecosystem. It destroyed people's ability to sustain themselves. That's the impact of Shell and, when people tried to protest, they were brutally repressed.\"</p><p>In a statement, Shell this weekend described the executions of the Ogoni 9 as \"tragic events carried out by the Nigerian government in power at the time\".</p><p>\"Shell attempted to persuade that government to grant clemency; to our deep regret, that appeal - and the appeals of many others - went unheard, and we were shocked and saddened when we heard the news. Shell in no way encouraged or advocated any act of violence against them or their fellow Ogonis. We believe that the evidence will show clearly that Shell was not responsible for these tragic events. The allegations made in the complaints against Royal Dutch/Shell concerning the 1995 executions of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight fellow Ogonis are false and without merit.\"</p><p>US lawyers have finally won permission to bring the case to court under the alien tort statute, which gives non-US citizens the right to file claims in American courts for international human rights violations. The court case had been set for 27 April, though last night the date was moved to 26 May.</p><p>Today the oil-producing Niger Delta region is riven by intense violence and corruption. The Ogoni 9 trial is seen as a way of coming to terms with the past and building a non-violent future. </p><p>\"We need to know the truth,\" said Ken Wiwa last night. \"We need to have people account for their role in the executions and the displacement of the Ogoni people, many of whom feel traumatised.

Why so little, we might ask?</p><p>The UNEP has now admitted this figure is based on data from the oil industry and the Nigerian government. It's not surprising that this is in line with what Shell used to claim in the 1980s – that about 80% of the oil spills were caused by vandalism or sabotage. This claim that infrastructure has been sabotaged is particularly attractive to oil companies, because they are then exempted from paying compensation for any resulting spills. Why accept responsibility for polluting the locals' creeks, swamps and farmlands and destroying their livelihoods when you can blame the very same people for the mess now coating their own backyards with a toxic gloss?</p><p>Yet crucial expertise which could have painted a very different picture was sidelined. Prof Richard Steiner, an international expert on oil spills, was contracted to write the manual on oil damage assessment and restoration by the UNEP in 2004. But when Shell hired the agency to carry out the present study, Steiner's offer to provide scientific advice and guidance to the Ogoniland report was declined.</p><p>Steiner has already said that the findings now uncovered are incorrect, and has gone on to say: \"Our earlier results suggest that much of the oil spilled there was due to poor practice by Shell, rather than bunkering and sabotage… it is entirely implausible that 90% of the oil spilled was due to bunkering [the act of criminal gangs stealing oil].\" In short, his opinion is that this is not an independent, credible assessment.</p><p>The report does indeed rely heavily on figures produced by oil companies and Nigerian state statistics rather than on testimonies from those most affected – the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/aug/22/niger-delta-oil-pollution\" title=\"\">communities in Ogoniland</a>.</p><p>The National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency of Nigeria has reported a total of 3,203 oil spills in the Niger Delta region in the last four years alone.</p><p>That list lengthens every day. The records of the Nigerian Directorate of Petroleum Resources show that nearly 2.5m barrels of crude oil were spilt between 1976 and 1996. Most damning of all, 77% of this oil was not recovered and contaminated the local environment. This is an environmental catastrophe which has a long history – some notable past spills include the Escravos spill of 1978 in which 300,000 barrels of crude oil was spilled into the coastal waters and another, in the same year, caused by tank failure at Forcados Terminal in which 580,000 barrels were spewed into the environment.</p><p>It is in this polluted environment that the people of Ogoniland have had to live for decades with spill after spill. The UNEP must be, and be seen to be, an independent arbiter of what has really happened there. There should be no room for suspicion that the $10m (£6.5m) Shell paid the agency for this report will influence the outcome.</p><p></p><p>• Nnimmo Bassey is chairman of Friends of the Earth International</p>","headline":"UN report on Nigeria oil spills relies too heavily on data from Shell","trailText":"<strong>Nnimmo Bassey:</strong> Report blaming 90% of spills in Ogoniland on locals stealing crude from pipelines allows companies to shirk responsibility","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2j8n9","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/5/26/1243348510619/Oil-leaks-from-the-Shell--003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/5/26/1243348510619/Oil-leaks-from-the-Shell--003.jpg","wordcount":"526","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"366109033","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3729954","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nnimmo Bassey","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-08-25T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1443321","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-08-28T14:13:48Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/aug/25/un-nigeria-oil-spill-shell","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2010/aug/25/un-nigeria-oil-spill-shell","tags":[{"id":"business/royaldutchshell","webTitle":"Royal Dutch Shell","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionName":"Business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/business/royaldutchshell"},{"id":"commentisfree/cif-green","webTitle":"Cif green","references":[],"type":"blog","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/africa"}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-366109613","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/5/26/1243348509316/Oil-leaks-from-the-Shell--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"AP","photographer":"George Osodi","altText":"Oil leaks from the Shell flow station in Eriemu, Nigeria","height":"276","credit":"George Osodi/AP","caption":"Oil leaks from a Shell flow station in Nigeria.
