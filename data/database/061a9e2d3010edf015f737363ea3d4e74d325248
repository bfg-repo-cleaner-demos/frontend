        "body":"<p>Thousands of girls in danger of genital mutilation are being failed by the health and justice systems, a coalition of health professionals has warned in a report that recommends aggressive steps to eradicate the practice in the UK.</p><p>Female genital mutilation (FGM) should be treated the same as any other kind of child abuse and evidence of it must be reported to the police, according to the report.</p><p>Janet Fyle, a policy adviser of the Royal College of Midwives and one of the report's authors, said that just as it was inconceivable that a health worker would not report evidence of child abuse to the police, it should be equally important to report evidence of FGM.</p><p>\"If we are applying child protection laws, we cannot pick and choose which crimes against children we pursue,\" she said.</p><p>\"We are not asking for more money or legislation, we are just asking that child protection laws should work for all children not just some.\"</p><p>According to the report more than 66,000 women in England and Wales have undergone FGM and more than 24,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk of it.</p><p>Despite its regular occurrence, FGM has not resulted in a prosecution in Britain, whereas in France there have been about 100.</p><p>The report – Tackling Female Genital Mutilation in the UK – will be launched at the House of Commons on Monday by the Royal Colleges of Midwifery, Nursing and Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Unite union and Equality Now. It has been praised by the government.</p><p>FGM is carried out in Africa and the Middle East by Muslims and non-Muslims. It predates Islam and is not called for in the Qur'an although it mostly occurs in countries that became Islamic.</p><p>In countries such as Somalia and Egypt more than 90% of women have undergone some kind of FGM but it is also common in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mali and Sierra Leone. Although FGM has been outlawed in the UK since 1985, migrants from countries where FGM is common have continued the practice here or by taking girls to their home countries for it to be performed.</p><p>Since 2003, Britons can be prosecuted for acts of FGM abroad.</p><p>The report recommends that FGM must be treated as child abuse and evidence of it should be collected by the NHS and shared with the police and education officials. It also recommends that health workers who detect evidence of FGM should treat it as a crime and inform the police.</p><p>The former director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said it was only a matter of time before prosecutions for FGM took place.</p><p>\"Through working together closely with the police, health and social care professionals and the third sector, we are now in a much better place to have a successful prosecution against those who perpetrate this practice,\" he wrote in the report's foreword.</p><p>\"It is only a matter of time before this happens and this will send a very powerful message that FGM is a crime that will not be tolerated in a modern multicultural society.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-420814890\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/29/131025FGMKurdistan-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/29/131025FGMKurdistan_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/29/131025FGMKurdistan/131025FGMKurdistan.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/29/131025FGMKurdistan_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>The report recommends that health workers identify girls at risk and treat them as if they were at risk of child abuse. Girls at risk are defined as girls born to a woman who has undergone FGM or a child who lives closely with someone who has.</p><p>It also calls for a government-funded awareness strategy, similar to the HIV campaigns, and for health workers to be held accountable for their success or failure in monitoring FGM among patients and sharing information.</p><p>The report clearly emphasises the importance of an individual's safety over the respect for religious and racial sensibilities, a point welcomed by Shaista Gohir, the chairwoman of the Muslim Women's Network.</p><p>\"We need to be mindful of cultural and religious sensibilities but safeguarding the child from FGM has to be the priority. If a child is at risk it is better to protect them rather than religious and cultural feelings,\" she said.</p><p>The report's launch will be hosted by the public health minister, Jane Ellison, who has praised the report but not yet endorsed any of its recommendations.</p><p>She said: \"One of my priorities as public health minister is to work towards eradicating female genital mutilation. Having supported this report during its development, I welcome its publication and the lead that the organisations involved, representing so many healthcare workers, are showing.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the Department of Health said ministers had yet to study the report's recommendations.</p><p>Other suggestions include that medical staff should question all new young female patients to determine the prevalence of FGM in their families and that teachers and schools should highlight the issue with at-risk groups and individuals.</p><p>Sarian Karim, a 36-year-old community worker from Peckham, south London, who suffered FGM as an 11-year-old in Sierra Leone, welcomed the report.</p><p>\"FGM is a normal thing for us. We don't know it is against the law, but I know that it damages girls and leaves them scarred for life – mentally and physically.</p><p>\"It is very important that everyone knows that FGM is illegal. We suffer from a lot of complications [because of the procedure].</p><p>\"We want those people who work in schools to have guidelines and be able to inform, prepare and protect children.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421583017|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|40233753cacf35bfb457ed3dd3a739952e1c2173 -->",

This is the Guardian's shorter web version of that film</em></p><p>It started out as a film about a practice that has afflicted tens of millions of women worldwide. It culminated in a change in the law.</p><p>Ten years after they embarked on a documentary to investigate the extent of female genital mutilation in Kurdistan, two film-makers have found their work changing more than just opinions in a fiercely conservative part of the world. Partly as a result of the film, the numbers of girls being genitally mutilated in the villages and towns of Iraqi Kurdistan has fallen by more than half in the last five years.</p><p>Shara Amin and Nabaz Ahmed spent 10 years on the roads of Kurdistan speaking to women and men about the impact of female genital mutilation (FGM) on their lives, their children and their marriages. \"It took a lot of time to convince them to speak to us. This was a very taboo subject. Speaking about it on camera was a very brave thing to do.</p><p>\"It took us weeks, sometimes months to get them to talk and in the end it was the women that spoke out – despite the men,\" said Ahmed.</p><p>The result was a 50-minute film, A Handful of Ash. When it was shown in the Kurdish parliament, it had a profound effect on the lawmakers.</p><p>The film-makers' work began in 2003, shortly after the fall of Saddam Hussein. The stories they were told had a numbing consistency. In one scene in the documentary a young mother with her children sitting beside her tells Shara that in their village: \"They would just <a href=\"http://gu.com/p/3jz6d\">grab the little girls, take them and cut them</a>, and the girls came back home. I can still remember I was sick, infected for three months. I could barely walk after I was cut.\"</p><p>A mullah tells the film-makers that \"<em>Khatana</em> [the Kurdish term for FGM] is a duty; it is spiritually pure.\" That is the position of the Shafi'i school of Sunni Islam that is practised by Iraqi Kurds. It is the same branch of Islamic law that predominates in Egypt, where studies show that up to 80% of women have been mutilated. But FGM is not just confined to some Muslim countries in the Middle East – it is also widespread in parts of Africa and<br />Indonesian. It pre-dates Islam or Christianity and is on record since<br />the time of the Pharaoh.</p><p>\"It is about controlling women's sexuality and keeping them under control,\" said Nadya Khalife, from Human Rights Watch.</p><p>There are an estimated 140 million girls and women worldwide living with the effects of FGM, the World Health Organisation estimates.</p><p>\"There were a lot of kids in the room,\" one 18-year-old woman told the film-makers. \"My mother and sister took hold of me. They were taking off my trousers and separating my legs. I screamed 'What are you doing to me?' My mother said 'nothing dear, just a little pain'. They put me on the ground and the pain started between my thighs. Everything turned dark. When they wanted to raise me to my feet, I couldn't stand. My thighs were covered in blood.\"</p><p>Another woman took them to her sister's grave. \"One of my sisters got an infection and died. She was cut with a dirty blade. She had an infection for two days so we took her to a doctor. He couldn't treat her and she died. She is buried here.\"</p><p>\"It's not something that families discuss. It's just something that is done, and is forgotten about,\" said Khalife. \"Countless generations of girls were sentenced to lives lacking in sexual pleasure or fulfilment and cheerless marriages.\"</p><p>One Kurdish couple encountered by Amin and Ahmed <a href=\"http://gu.com/p/3jz67\">illustrated this underlying sadness</a> with extraordinary, raw honesty.</p><p>Hawa, a seamstress, and Erat, a farmer, have been married for 10 years and have three children. Hawa said she and her three sisters were mutilated at her grandmother's insistence.</p><p>\"My two sisters and I, three of us, we all had <em>khatana</em> [cutting]. Believe me, my mother did not care about the practice, never insisted. But my grandma insisted. She would always say food and water served by their hands would be <em>haram </em>[impure] if the girls were not cut.\"</p><p>Asked about the extent of her mutilation, she said: \"My husband always says 'nothing is left of you'.\"</p><p>Hawa's husband said FGM had destroyed his marriage. \"I was not aware of this when I married her. If I had known, I swear to God even if they paid me $10,000 I would not have married her. Because it is a problem for me.</p><p>\"This circumcision is similar to neutering animals,\" he said. \"It's a major problem. There is no sensation. It feels like lying next to a cold fish.\"</p><p>Piroza, now 15, recalled what was done to her when she was five. \"They said: 'Come here, we brought beads for you.' They took me into a room. There was an old woman. There was a razor and ash, and they cut me.\"</p><p>The film-makers found that when they first started the project they were visiting villages where every one of the girls had been mutilated. The Iraqi Kurdish government denied that it was widespread but the film-makers' testimonies found otherwise. In many cases, all the women in a village had been mutilated – usually between the ages of five and nine. Most alarmingly, the fall of Saddam Hussein had led to a resurgence of the practice – FGM was seen as a mark of national cultural independence for the Kurds.</p><p>The film-makers, both in their 30s and ardent campaigners against the practice, joined forces with Wadi, a small German-Iraqi non-governmental organisation dedicated to eliminating FGM in Iraqi Kurdistan, and took their campaign film to parliament. They were invited in but only female politicians turned up to the viewing. Nevertheless, the showing sparked a campaign by the Kurdish parliamentary women's committee to outlaw FGM.</p><p>It took three years and it was not until Human Rights Watch published a devastating report into the scale of FGM in Kurdistan, and pressure was applied on the Kurdish government from Brussels, that the law was implemented in 2011.</p><p>It then sparked a debate with the Muslim clergy. A key turning point was when a leading Kurdish cleric, Mullah Omar, told a conference organised by Human Rights Watch: \"Female circumcision is an injustice. It is a crime against women.\" A <em>fatwa</em>, or edict, was declared against it and word began to filter down to the villages.</p><p>One midwife who practised FGM for 20 years, Pura Sewa, said: \"We have been advised not to practice mutilation and we have obeyed that. They said not to mutilate or you will be taken to jail. They took away my licence and I stopped. But if they hadn't taken it away, I would still be performing <em>khatana</em> for Islam.\"</p><h2>Female genital mutilation – the facts: </h2><p>• Female genital mutilation (FGM) is carried out in 29 countries, according to the World Health Organisation. Although prevalent in many Muslim countries in the Middle East, it is also widespread in Africa and Indonesia.</p><p>• Some 140 million girls and women globally currently live with the consequences of FGM, according to the WHO.</p><p>• FGM is mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and the age of 15.</p><p>• More than 18% of all FGM is performed by medical professionals – and this trend is increasing.</p><p>• FGM varies from the the cutting the clitoris in some countries, such as Kurdistan, to removing all the external genitalia.</p><p>• More than 66,000 women and girls living in Britain have undergone FGM, according to the NHS, but there has not been a successful UK prosecution since it was criminalised 28 years ago.</p><p>• Human Rights Watch calls FGM a practice to control women's sexuality.</p><p>• There are several degrees of mutilation. In the most extreme form, the sexual organs are removed and the vagina is sewn up and narrowed. It is thought to reduce a woman's libido and thus to help her resist \"illicit\" sexual acts.</p><p>• Long-term consequences can include infertility and an increased risk of childbirth complications and deaths of newborns. Complications can also result in the need for later surgery. • In December 2012 the UN general assembly approved a resolution calling for the elimination of FGM.</p><p>• In most countries the prevalence of FGM has fallen, and an increasing number of women and men where it is practised support ending the practice.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420793822|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|be0f5402fcfb1e5e599293d87f6534c923f860c1 -->",

        "headline":"Female genital mutilation: 'Mothers need to say no'",
        "body":"<p>\"As a little girl I would go looking for the cutters and ask them when it was my turn,\" Faduma Ali says. \"I thought it was exciting. I wish I had known then what I know now.\"</p><p>It's almost eight decades since  Faduma underwent <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/female-genital-mutilation/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">female genital mutilation</a> (FGM), sometimes known as female circumcision, in Somalia. Today, sitting in her daughter's lounge in north London, she says it has left her with a lifetime of pain and medical problems. Yet despite her own agony she felt powerless to resist the societal pressure driving the tradition, and insisted her own daughters have it done too.</p><p>But when her granddaughters faced the same fate, she knew something had to change. And as an older woman, her voice carried more weight. Faduma told her daughter not to let her granddaughters be cut. \"Women can eradicate this,\" she says. \"Mothers are responsible for refusing the practice.\"</p><p>Campaigners say that a tangled mix of family pressure, cultural traditions and religious motivations make FGM – illegal for almost 30 years in the UK – hard to eradicate. It has been documented in 28 countries in Africa and in a few countries in Asia and the Middle East. The practice involves removing all or part of the external female genitalia (including the clitoris, labia minora and labia majora – and in some cases the narrowing of the vagina), and is usually carried out before the age of 15. As well as the risk of bleeding to death or infection, a terrifying array of physical and psychological problems can follow.</p><p>Today 30,000 girls in the UK are said to be at risk of this form of mutilation, while 66,000 live with the consequences of it. Yet no one has ever been prosecuted for carrying out or abetting the practice (which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years).</p><p>This, say campaigners, is because children are unwilling to speak out against their families and communities and that is why  Faduma, along with her daughter, Lul Musse, and granddaughter, Samira Hashi, have agreed to explain how – even in a loving and close-knit family such as theirs – such a custom can be perpetuated.</p><p>Samira, 22, is translating for her grandmother, who explains that growing up in the suburbs of Galkayo, a city in south Somalia, being \"cut\" was not just something she looked forward to, but insisted upon. \"Everyone had it done,\" says Faduma, 86. \"If you didn't, you were shunned. I saw it as something exciting.\"</p><p>She was under no illusions about how painful it could be, however. \"I saw it being carried out – most girls would try and run away. But it was part of our way of life. My grandmother and mother had had it done, so it seemed natural.\"</p><p>Faduma's father, who was in the Somali military, was not convinced. \"He had a city attitude because of his travels,\" says  Faduma. He told her grandmother, with whom  Faduma lived, that she was not to be cut. But  Faduma convinced her grandmother to take her while he was away.</p><p>The cutter had no medical qualifications and performed the operation in the open air, without sterilisation or pain relief.  Faduma was eight.</p><p>\"There were four of us,\"  Faduma recalls. \"But because I was the bravest I was told to go first.</p><p>\"My grandmother and the other girls' mothers held me down and the woman cut me with a knife. It's like someone is cutting your finger off without pain relief. My blood was shooting into her face and eyes.\"</p><p>Next, the wound and her vagina were sewn up, leaving her a hole the size of a match head through which to pass urine and menstrual blood. With no medical equipment, three thorns were used in place of stitches. Yet her ordeal was far from over.</p><p>\"They gave you milk and waited to see if you could urinate,\" she recalls. \"If not, they cut you open a little more. For two weeks it is agony.\"</p><p>Afterwards, she says, she boasted to her friends she had been cut, but never realised it would have such severe complications. \"The minute you have it done you have problems,\" she says. \"When you have your period, it is very painful and when you have children it is very painful.\"</p><p>Female genital mutilation, says  Faduma, was intended to guarantee virginity before marriage by ensuring sex would be frightening and painful for girls. Giving birth, however, was nothing short of torture.  Faduma had 10 children, but her first labour lasted five days with midwives forced to \"cut me everywhere\" to get the baby out.</p><p>Yet when her daughters turned seven, Faduma could not shun the custom. \"Without it, my daughters would not have been allowed to marry,\" she says. \"There was not a girl in sight who hadn't had it done.\"</p><p>Now 52, Lul agrees: \"You couldn't go to school without it, or people would laugh at you,\" she recalls. Her operation was in a hospital under anaesthetic, aged seven. \"I tried to run from the operating table, but my mum and her friend held me down.\"</p><p>The operation, she says, had a devastating effect on her life and affected her marriage. \"When you have sex it is very painful and you don't feel any pleasure. You will never enjoy sex.\"</p><p>Giving birth was excruciating and complicated for Lul. Yet, amazingly, this did not affect her decision to have her own daughters cut. But her mother stepped in. \"I was sick of it,\"  Faduma says, firmly. \"Times had changed. Women were freer and had more power.\"</p><p>She told her daughter not to do it. Yet Lul says she would have rebelled had they stayed in Somalia. \"I would have done it even though my mother said no. All men wanted circumcision. If your daughters weren't cut they would say they are like hookers.\"</p><p>She believes it is up to men to take a stand. \"This has to be a man's campaign. Until men say stop, that this is not part of our religion and not part of our culture, it will still go on.\"</p><p>For Samira, the very idea of this kind of mutilation is incomprehensible. Brought up in London, she was working as a model when she was approached by BBC3 to present a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcthree/2012/04/escape-from-the-worlds-most-dangerous-place-somalia-samira-hashi.shtml\" title=\"\">documentary about Somalia</a>. Visiting the war-torn country, she met women who planned to have their daughters cut and saw a six-year-old girl who had been recently subjected to FGM. \"I just didn't understand how a mother who had gone through this pain could have it done to her children. I don't blame the women, I blame the society that doesn't stop it.\"</p><p>Since the film came out last year, Samira has been touring schools with <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/where-we-work/africa/somalia\" title=\"\">Save the Children </a>to highlight issues facing Somalia. \"One thing I have learned is that while people may say we are moving on, it still continues.\"</p><p>According to Forward, a leading UK charity that campaigns to end FGM, the practice takes place in many cultures and occurs in several different religious communities. However, mainstream spiritual leaders have denied that the practice stems from religion. Samira believes the desire to control women's sexuality lies behind it.</p><p>\"I think women here are scared their daughters will become too westernised and not get married – that they will have boyfriends and go out, and this is why they have it done.\"</p><p>Yet the subject, she says, is rarely discussed. \"I go into schools with a high number of Somali girls, and they always seem shocked that it is part of our history and culture. We need women to talk about their experiences, men to talk about their marital experiences, clerics to explain it is not linked to religion and doctors to talk about the problems it causes. Then things will change – when we discuss what FGM is really doing.\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 9 September 2013. The original included a phrase which could be read to mean that FGM was practised within the Jewish community. That is not the case although there is some evidence that FGM was practised within a minor Ethiopian Jewish sect.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416443727|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|456cb7c86e2b5f9688ef074ecebf411711e583fc -->",

        "body":"<p>Thousands of girls in danger of genital mutilation are being failed by the health and justice systems, a coalition of health professionals has warned in a report that recommends aggressive steps to eradicate the practice in the UK.</p><p>Female genital mutilation (FGM) should be treated the same as any other kind of child abuse and evidence of it must be reported to the police, according to the report.</p><p>Janet Fyle, a policy adviser of the Royal College of Midwives and one of the report's authors, said that just as it was inconceivable that a health worker would not report evidence of child abuse to the police, it should be equally important to report evidence of FGM.</p><p>\"If we are applying child protection laws, we cannot pick and choose which crimes against children we pursue,\" she said.</p><p>\"We are not asking for more money or legislation, we are just asking that child protection laws should work for all children not just some.\"</p><p>According to the report more than 66,000 women in England and Wales have undergone FGM and more than 24,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk of it.</p><p>Despite its regular occurrence, FGM has not resulted in a prosecution in Britain, whereas in France there have been about 100.</p><p>The report – Tackling Female Genital Mutilation in the UK – will be launched at the House of Commons on Monday by the Royal Colleges of Midwifery, Nursing and Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Unite union and Equality Now. It has been praised by the government.</p><p>FGM is carried out in Africa and the Middle East by Muslims and non-Muslims. It predates Islam and is not called for in the Qur'an although it mostly occurs in countries that became Islamic.</p><p>In countries such as Somalia and Egypt more than 90% of women have undergone some kind of FGM but it is also common in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mali and Sierra Leone. Although FGM has been outlawed in the UK since 1985, migrants from countries where FGM is common have continued the practice here or by taking girls to their home countries for it to be performed.</p><p>Since 2003, Britons can be prosecuted for acts of FGM abroad.</p><p>The report recommends that FGM must be treated as child abuse and evidence of it should be collected by the NHS and shared with the police and education officials. It also recommends that health workers who detect evidence of FGM should treat it as a crime and inform the police.</p><p>The former director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said it was only a matter of time before prosecutions for FGM took place.</p><p>\"Through working together closely with the police, health and social care professionals and the third sector, we are now in a much better place to have a successful prosecution against those who perpetrate this practice,\" he wrote in the report's foreword.</p><p>\"It is only a matter of time before this happens and this will send a very powerful message that FGM is a crime that will not be tolerated in a modern multicultural society.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-420814890\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/29/131025FGMKurdistan-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/29/131025FGMKurdistan_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/29/131025FGMKurdistan/131025FGMKurdistan.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/29/131025FGMKurdistan_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>The report recommends that health workers identify girls at risk and treat them as if they were at risk of child abuse. Girls at risk are defined as girls born to a woman who has undergone FGM or a child who lives closely with someone who has.</p><p>It also calls for a government-funded awareness strategy, similar to the HIV campaigns, and for health workers to be held accountable for their success or failure in monitoring FGM among patients and sharing information.</p><p>The report clearly emphasises the importance of an individual's safety over the respect for religious and racial sensibilities, a point welcomed by Shaista Gohir, the chairwoman of the Muslim Women's Network.</p><p>\"We need to be mindful of cultural and religious sensibilities but safeguarding the child from FGM has to be the priority. If a child is at risk it is better to protect them rather than religious and cultural feelings,\" she said.</p><p>The report's launch will be hosted by the public health minister, Jane Ellison, who has praised the report but not yet endorsed any of its recommendations.</p><p>She said: \"One of my priorities as public health minister is to work towards eradicating female genital mutilation. Having supported this report during its development, I welcome its publication and the lead that the organisations involved, representing so many healthcare workers, are showing.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the Department of Health said ministers had yet to study the report's recommendations.</p><p>Other suggestions include that medical staff should question all new young female patients to determine the prevalence of FGM in their families and that teachers and schools should highlight the issue with at-risk groups and individuals.</p><p>Sarian Karim, a 36-year-old community worker from Peckham, south London, who suffered FGM as an 11-year-old in Sierra Leone, welcomed the report.</p><p>\"FGM is a normal thing for us. We don't know it is against the law, but I know that it damages girls and leaves them scarred for life – mentally and physically.</p><p>\"It is very important that everyone knows that FGM is illegal. We suffer from a lot of complications [because of the procedure].</p><p>\"We want those people who work in schools to have guidelines and be able to inform, prepare and protect children.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421583017|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|40233753cacf35bfb457ed3dd3a739952e1c2173 -->",
