When he turned back toward Brancheau, she had disappeared underwater.</p><p>Brancheau was dragged to her death at the end of a Dine with Shamu show in February. Topoleski told detectives that the trainer did nothing to agitate Tilikum. SeaWorld workers used nets to try to catch Tilikum and free Brancheau less than three minutes after she was dragged under. It took at least a half-hour, moving from pool to pool in the orca complex, before they could recover her body.</p><p>SeaWorld worker Chahine Kish said Tilikum appeared to grow more frantic as other workers used nets and threw food to distract him from Brancheau. Another employee said that once Tilikum was captured and raised out of the water on a platform, Brancheau's body was freed. But workers had to capture the whale again when they realised he still had Brancheau's arm.</p><p>The medical examiner said the death was a tragic accident.</p><p>Brancheau had known Tilikum for 16 years, ever since she began working as a trainer with killer whales at SeaWorld Orlando. The whale had been brought from a park in Canada a couple of years previously.</p><p>Brancheau and Tilikum had just finished what was described by fellow trainers as a \"very good session\". She had been petting him and hugging him from the side of his tank and he had been performing spins for her.</p><p>It marked the third time Tilikum had been involved in a human death. Tilikum was one of three orcas blamed in 1991 for killing a trainer who lost her balance and fell in the pool at Sealand of the Pacific near Victoria, British Columbia. Tilikum also was also involved in a 1999 death, when the body of a man who had sneaked by SeaWorld Orlando security was found floating naked in the orca's pool.</p>","headline":"SeaWorld killer whale pulled trainer to her death, says report","trailText":"Sheriff's report says Dawn Brancheau died from multiple injuries and drowning after orca pulled her under water in Orlando park","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2gkx3","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/3/2/1267538141248/Dawn-Brancheau-a-trainer--004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/3/2/1267538141248/Dawn-Brancheau-a-trainer--004.jpg","wordcount":"466","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"362003707","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"3306738","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Mark Tran","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-04-30T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1392420","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-05-02T10:35:14Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/29/seaworld-killer-whale-trainer-death","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/apr/29/seaworld-killer-whale-trainer-death","tags":[{"id":"science/animalbehaviour","webTitle":"Animal behaviour","type":"keyword","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/animalbehaviour","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/science/animalbehaviour"},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/type/article"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/world"},{"id":"world/florida","webTitle":"Florida","type":"keyword","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/florida"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science","type":"keyword","sectionName":"Science","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/science","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/science/science"},{"id":"profile/marktran","webTitle":"Mark Tran","rcsId":"GNL004704","r2ContributorId":"16072","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/11/08/mark_tran_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Mark Tran was appointed correspondent for the Guardian's Global development site in June 2011.

The interview took place at her home with reporters from the Associated Press and National Public Radio, with no Libyan minders present.

She was forced into a car when militia discovered that her ID card showed she was from the rebel-held east.</p><p>\"There were a number of militiamen in the Toyota and another girl they had captured and stuffed on the floor of the car under their feet,\" she said.</p><p>They went to a large house that looked like a palace where, she said, the abuse took place.</p><p>\"I kept fighting back. I hit back a lot and I kept fighting,\" she said. \"They eventually tied my arms and legs together.\"</p><p>Tied naked and left on the floor, Obeidi said, the men took turns raping her, at least three at a time. They would strangle her, cover her head while raping her, and kick her when they were done, she said.</p><p>The men were drunk and would pour alcohol in her eyes, nose and mouth. Obeidi claimed that the ringleader was a cousin of Gaddafi and son of a government minister. She said she recognised him because her sister worked for his father, and they knew his family.</p><p>Obeidi escaped when another girl who had been left untied because she had not fought back helped her to cut the rope from her legs. She said she jumped out of a window and threatened the African guards at the gate with a metal rod.</p><p>\"I could see fear in their faces when they looked at me, my hair was wild, I was naked and screaming,\" she said.

But officials had turned the case on its head and accused her of committing a crime by naming her attackers, she said.</p><p>A Libyan government spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, has confirmed that Obeidi was a victim of rape but alleged she was a prostitute and had a criminal record of petty crime and indecency, claims she denies.

He communicated the news at 3.27pm, sounding no more flustered than somebody ordering a burger from a fast-food outlet.</p><p>\"Hit birds, we lost thrust in both engines, we're turning back towards La Guardia,\" he told the control tower in his deep, slightly gravely voice.</p><p>\"Make that a double, onion rings on the side,\" he might as well have added.</p><p>His controller, a younger sounding man with a high-pitched voice, also managed to disguise his shock. Within 13 seconds of receiving the bombshell, he nonchalantly informed his colleagues to stop all departures. \"We got an emergency returning.\"</p><p>From there, the relationship between the two men, one on which the lives of 155 people depended, grows more surreal with every passing second. Like an airborne Clint Eastwood, Sullenberger appeared to become more eerily collected as the disaster engulfs him. At 3.28 and 5 seconds, his controller offers him the option of landing on runway 3 back in La Guardia.</p><p>After what appears an age - but was in fact just six seconds - the pilot replied: \"We're unable. We may end up in the Hudson.\" By now there is just the slightest hint of irritation.</p><p>Twenty seconds after that the controller tells him he will be turning left to the runway.</p><p>\"Unable,\" is the single word that comes back from the cockpit. No need for embellishment.</p><p>By now calls are flying around the New York area in a desperate search for options. Separate transcripts show that by 3.28 and 46 seconds La Guardia has also cleared its runway four for a possible landing.</p><p>Sullenberger rejects the offer on the grounds, \"I am not sure we can make any runway\". He inquires, almost languidly: \"what's over to our right? Anything in New Jersey, maybe Teterboro?\"</p><p>Within 29 seconds of his request, Teterboro, a small airstrip used by private planes in New Jersey, had given its assurance that a runway would be clear. On the ground, things were not quite so composed. \"I believe he's too heavy, but let me talk to supervisor,\" said one controller in tiny Teterboro, for whom this kind of event was wildly out of the normal.</p><p>\"He wants to fly in here,\" another is heard to say. \"He can't fly in here!\" says a third, and at last the sheer terror of what is happening becomes audible.</p><p>By then, though, Teterboro needn't have worried. At 3.29 and 25 seconds, Sullenberger ended the search for a terrestrial runway. </p><p>\"We can't do it.\" Three seconds later he added: \"We're gonna be in the Hudson.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry, say again,\" requests the air traffic controller, as though disbelieving his own ears. But that was the last word to be recorded from Capt Sullenberger.</p><p>It's at this moment that the logic of the conversation is lost, along with radio contact. The controller, suddenly overcome with a wave of irrational optimism, says: \"You also got Newark airport off your two o'clock and about seven miles.\"</p><p>Fifty four seconds later Flight 1549 splashed into the river.</p><p>At 3.30 and 40 seconds a helicopter pilot flying along the eastern edge of Manhattan, with a good view of events, said: \"Looks like he's going down.\" 3.30 and 45 seconds: \"He's in the water.\"</p><p>Answer from the control tower: \"Roger.\"</p>","headline":"Hero of Hudson plane surprisingly calm during ordeal, tapes reveal","trailText":"<p>Captain Chesley Sullenberger remained composed while describing disastrous situation to air-traffic controllers</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2548f","wordcount":"606","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"342847194","allowUgc":"false","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Ed Pilkington in New York","newspaperEditionDate":"2009-02-05T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1164444","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2009-02-08T20:12:53Z"},"rights":{},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/05/new-york-plane-crash-audio-sullenberger","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/feb/05/new-york-plane-crash-audio-sullenberger","tags":[{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/world"},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/type/article"},{"id":"profile/edpilkington","webTitle":"Ed Pilkington","rcsId":"GNL038863","r2ContributorId":"15609","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/3/27/1332862968426/edpilkington_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ed Pilkington is the chief reporter for Guardian US.

Ilyas Ashar, 83, and his wife, Tallat, 66, deny false imprisonment, human trafficking, sexual offences, violence and benefit fraud. They are accused of abusing the woman at their home in Salford, after bringing her from Pakistan in June 2000.</p><p>The trial, now in its third week, has heard claims that the victim was beaten, repeatedly raped by Ilyas Ashar, and kept to work for the family – never having gone to school and taught only to sign her name for the purposes of a benefits scam.</p><p>On Monday, she gave evidence for the first time via a video-link to the courtroom, signing her answers to questions.She said she had \"no friends\" when living with the Ashar family and was not allowed to go to college. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, asked her about her life now.</p><p>Her reply, through the translator, was: \"Love going out for walk in the fresh air. Love going to the fair and enjoy lots of different things. Also enjoy going to the college by myself on the bus. The third thing I love to do is going out, going around but having nothing to do with men. Sexually having nothing to do with men.\"</p><p>The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is thought to have been between 10 and 12 when she came to the UK. Shown photos of the cellar, she pointed out a camp-bed where she said she slept and a radiator she used to keep warm. She told the jury she would at times also sleep on a settee in the cellar, but for some time she was ordered to sleep on a sheet on the concrete floor instead. \"Really really hard,\" she said. \"It hurt my back, sleeping on the floor is hard. The bones in my back were very sore.\"</p><p>Cadwallader asked why she slept on the floor beside the settee.</p><p>\"The old woman (Mrs Ashar),\" she replied through the sign-language interpreter.</p><p>\"She was told to sleep on the floor, she had to sleep on the floor and that's what I did.\"</p><p>She was made to cook, clean, wash and iron for the Ashars and clean the houses and cars of their family and friends, the court has heard.</p><p>She also says she was made to work for hours in the cellar packing football shirts and clothes and mobile phone covers.</p><p>The Ashars deny human trafficking into the UK for exploitation and false imprisonment.

Hundreds of bodies bearing signs of rape and sexual mutilation have been dumped on waste ground in the city; thousands more have never returned.</p><p>In 2009, 55 teenage girls vanished in the town, which has been gripped by violence as two drug cartels fight a lethal turf war over cocaine smuggling routes into the US.</p><p>Maria, who was in hiding when she talked to Channel 4 News, said she had been given presents and promised a job in an office by the gang member but was instead drugged and raped and sold to men.</p><p>In late December, US special agents flew the teenager to the US for a full interview.</p><p>Describing what the gang did to one girl who tried to escape, she said: \"They took a gallon of gasoline and started pouring it over her. One of the men told me, 'If you don't do as I say, I will do the same to you.' I wanted to look away – but they didn't' let me.</p><p>\"Even though the girl was on fire, they kept hitting her. They were laughing as if they were enjoying what they were doing. They burned her alive.\"</p><p>Maria, which is not her real name, said the gang had held young women in a house on the Mexican border until they were sold to the US as sex slaves. But she said they also dealt in children, and told of one occasion when the gang was contacted by a woman in New York. \"She said she needed a seven-year-old girl and a nine-year-old boy – and she needed them in three days,\" Maria quoted the woman as saying.</p><p>Maria told special agents the gang would prowl the streets of poor areas looking for children.</p><p>\"They stole the children,\" she said. \"One of the gang members took a six-year-old kid. I had to look after him for three hours. He told me he wanted to see his mummy. Then I started crying. I said: 'I don't think you're ever going to see your mummy again.' All he kept saying was, 'I want to see my mummy.'\"</p><p>Maria, who escaped after a gang member left her alone in a house, says children were often around. But not for long.</p><p>\"I saw the Americans taking kids,\" she said: \"a four-year-old and another boy. He barely walked. He was only about two years old. They took them to New York.\"</p><p>The US state department estimates that more than 20,000 young women and children are trafficked across the border from Mexico each year. But conviction rates remain low.</p><p>Mexico's attorney general, Arturo Chaves, has been accused of failing to do enough to bring human traffickers to justice, he has insisted the country is \"definitely focusing\" on the issue.</p><p>Maria has been told she may have to give evidence against the gang if they are caught. It is something she says she is determined to do.</p><p>\"Women are sold. They are abducted, bought and even killed by these men. If these men are ever found, jail won't be enough to make them pay for the way they have made us feel.\"</p><p><em>Back from the Dead: Maria's Story will be broadcast on Channel 4 News tonight, from 7pm.</em></p>","headline":"Mexican woman tells of ordeal with cross-border child traffickers","trailText":"In interview with Channel 4 News, young woman says babies and young children are 'sold to order' to US nationals","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/2dmhg","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2010/1/11/1263228308166/A-picture-of-15-year-old--004.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2010/1/11/1263228308166/A-picture-of-15-year-old--004.jpg","wordcount":"666","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"357906441","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"2902049","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Nick Martin in Ciudad Juárez","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-01-12T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1335274","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2010-01-14T17:57:41Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":false,"subscriptionDatabases":false},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/11/mexican-woman-border-child-traffic","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/jan/11/mexican-woman-border-child-traffic","tags":[{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas","type":"keyword","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/americas"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/world"},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/type/article"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/media/media"},{"id":"world/mexico","webTitle":"Mexico","type":"keyword","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/mexico"},{"id":"media/television","webTitle":"Television industry","type":"keyword","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/television","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/media/television"},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/usa"},{"id":"law/human-trafficking","webTitle":"Human trafficking","type":"keyword","sectionName":"Law","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/human-trafficking","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/law/human-trafficking"},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news"},{"id":"media/channel4","webTitle":"Channel 4","type":"keyword","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/media/channel4"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-357912003","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2010/1/11/1263228304824/A-picture-of-15-year-old--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"CHANNEL 4 NEWS","altText":"A picture of 15 year-old girl stares out from a poster in downtown Ciudad Juarez, Mexico","height":"276","credit":"CHANNEL 4 NEWS","caption":"A missing 15-year-old stares out from a poster in downtown Ciudad Juárez.
