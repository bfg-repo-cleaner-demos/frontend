        "body":"<p>A silver and blue ATM, perched up next to the espresso bar in a trendy Vancouver coffee shop, could launch a new era for the virtual currency bitcoin, offering an almost instant way to exchange the world's leading virtual money for cash.</p><p>The value of a bitcoin soared from $13 in January to a high of $266 in April as more businesses and consumers used them to buy and sell online. Some investors are also treating bitcoins like gold, using them to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on their rise.</p><p>The kiosk, which looks like the average ATM but with hand and barcode scanners, opened for business on Tuesday and by mid-morning people were lined up to swap their bitcoins for cash, or to deposit cash to buy more bitcoins.</p><p>\"It's as easy as walking up to a machine, scanning your hand, entering some cash and buying bitcoin,\" said Jordan Kelley, chief executive of Las Vegas-based Robocoin, the company that builds the ATMs. \"With this, it's a 2-minute process. For any online exchange, it's at least two days.\"</p><p>Bitcoins, currently worth about $210 each, can be transferred without going through banks or clearing houses, thereby cutting fees. Users can buy products and services online or in a handful of stores, including the Waves coffee shop where the ATM is located.</p><p>With the bitcoin ATM, users scan their hand to confirm identity, then funds move to or from a virtual wallet on their smartphone. The system limits transfers to $1,000 a day, in an effort to curb money laundering and other fraud.</p><p>Bitcoiniacs, the local dealer that operates the ATM, will roll out four other kiosks across Canada in December. Robocoin said Canada was the ideal place to launch the kiosk due to a critical mass of users and less stringent oversight than in the US, where the bitcoin trade is monitored by anti-money laundering regulators.</p><p>\"We think the Vancouver market is enormous and we're excited to be here,\" said Kelley. \"By the end of 2013, we'll be all over Canada. By the end of 2014, we'll be all over the world, including the US.\"</p><p>Bitcoin is not a recognised currency in Canada, so Ottawa's anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre, does not monitor its trade.</p><p>However, Bitcoiniacs' founders say they are working with the agency to be ready for when Canada does start regulating them.</p><p>\"We're already being proactive in our business,\" said Bitcoiniacs co-founder Mitchell Demeter. \"We abide by any guidelines they would impose - which includes the 'know your customer' laws and anti-money laundering laws.\"</p><h2>Going mainstream</h2><p>Bitcoins were launched in 2008 and are traded within a global network of computers. They are not backed by a single company or government, but their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system's control over the minting of money.</p><p>Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.</p><p>The currency's reputation took a hit this month, when US regulators shut down Silk Road, an online marketplace used to buy and sell illegal drugs, and seized $3.6m (Â£2.3m) in bitcoins.</p><p>But the virtual currency is gaining hold among businesses and consumers, a key step to a bigger role.</p><p>\"I think it's definitely going mainstream,\" said Demeter. \"I think as things progress, and the infrastructure is built, it will become easier for people to buy and sell, and so more people will start using it.\"</p><p>In Vancouver, for example, dozens of people attend weekly bitcoin meet-ups and a member co-op is promoting the currency to a growing list of local retailers.</p><p>At Waves, Vancouver resident Chung Cheong used bitcoin to pay for his mug of tea and was happy to mull over the future of the digital currency.</p><p>\"It's been said that we're at the stage where email was in 1992,\" he said. \"Is it risky? Sure. But look at how the internet and email changed the world.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421280547|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|1fa51a332195230cc4aba0c7ee3a666a26f8dd59 -->",

        "headline":"Bitcoin: what you need to know",
        "body":"<p>When the Silk Road, the internet's biggest marketplace for illegal drugs, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/alleged-silk-road-website-founder-arrested-bitcoin\">was taken down earlier this week</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/bitcoin-price-silk-road-ulbricht-value\">the price of Bitcoin plummeted</a>.</p> <p>The two were \"intrinsically linked\", according to&nbsp;Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, but with Silk Road gone, does Bitcoin have a future?</p> <h2><strong>What are Bitcoins? </strong></h2> <p>Bitcoins are an anonymous, decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency.</p> <p>In contrast to older forms of electronic money, no company controls Bitcoin, nor ever could: all the rules about how it works are embedded into the very operation of trade, including the rate of inflation and how to verify transactions.</p> <h2><strong>How do I get them? </strong></h2> <p>For most users, the easiest way to get Bitcoins is to buy them. But due to strict anti-money laundering controls, even that is tricky.</p> <p>Most Bitcoin exchanges, such as <a href=\"https://mtgox.com/\">Mt Gox</a>, the best-known, require users to wire money from their banks to the exchange.</p> <p>A small group of hardcore users get extra Bitcoins through 'mining' for them: running computers which perform the calculations needed to make the currency work, in exchange for a share of the built-in inflation.</p> <h2>What do they look like?</h2> <p>Files of seemingly random data.</p> <p>Bitcoins have no physical existence, although some have devised ways to spend the digital currency <a href=\"http://blockchain.info/wallet/paper-tutorial\">by printing the necessary information on paper notes</a>. Instead, they are long lists of the digital signatures of previous owners. When a Bitcoin is spent, the old owner adds their digital signature to the end of the list, combined with the digital signature of the new owner.</p> <h2><strong>How do I spend them? </strong></h2> <p>With difficulty: few mainstream places accept Bitcoins, though the number is growing and now includes <a href=\"http://www.bitfash.com/\">fashion websites</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2013/jun/23/britains-first-bitcoin-pub\">pubs</a>, and online dating service <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2013/04/17/okcupid-bitcoin/\">OKCupid</a>.</p> <p>If your tastes are on the geeky side, however, you might have more luck. You can buy web hosting, geeky t-shirts, and even membership of the Reddit social network with Bitcoin.</p> <h2><strong>Who's making money from Bitcoin?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-10/meet-the-bitcoin-millionaires\">People who bought early and sold at the peak</a>. The currency has been through two boom-and-bust cycles, with the cost of one Bitcoin rising from $2 to $30 in 2011, and then from $13 to $266 earlier this year. But having a fortune in Bitcoin is a bit like having a fortune in gold: you have to sell your holdings to really make the most of it.</p> <h2><strong>Why would I want them?</strong></h2> <p>The big driver in Bitcoin&rsquo;s early growth was the online drug marketplace Silk Road, which took advantage of the currency&rsquo;s qualities to provide anonymity to patrons.</p> <p>While Silk Road no longer exists, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/silk-road-underground-market-closed-bitcoin\">a number of smaller outfits offer the same services</a>.</p> <p>But beyond access to illicit substances, for many fans Bitcoin use is a political statement: its existence proves that a currency with no centralised control is possible.</p> <h2><strong>How secure is Bitcoin?</strong></h2> <p>As secure as its user.</p> <p>Although there have been <a href=\"http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/05/13/bitcoin-blockchain-hard-fork-coming-may-15th-final-warning/\">some bugs</a> with the currency&rsquo;s programming, all of the reported thefts have come from the outside.</p> <p>If users don&rsquo;t keep their \"private key\", the password which lets them spend their Bitcoins, well hidden, <a href=\"http://www.geekosystem.com/first-major-bitcoin-theft/\">they can easily lose everything</a>.</p> <p>And, of course, anonymity cuts both ways: if you get tricked by a scammer into parting with your bitcoins, there&rsquo;s no higher authority to turn to.</p> <h2>Will it ever be a mainstream currency?</h2> <p>Economists and developers point to several flaws in the&nbsp;implementation&nbsp;of Bitcoin which render it unsuitable for widespread use. One problem is that the currency has deflation built in to its very core: only 21m bitcoins will ever be produced, and we're already halfway there. Most economists believe deflation is disastrous for an economy, but the Austrian school of economics, beloved by the libertarian creators of Bitcoin, disagrees.</p> <p>A more immediate problem is that it's not clear that the backbone of the currency can withstand the increased use that going mainstream would take. Transactions can already experience relatively lengthy delays in processing (taking minutes to clear), and that's just with Bitcoin remaining mostly popular amongst enthusiasts.</p> <p><strong>&bull; Was Silk Road's creator a genius who masterminded an online criminal underworld? Or did he actually do <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/five-stupid-things-dread-pirate-roberts-did-to-get-arrested\">five very stupid things to get himself arrested</a>?</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418997117|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|554c0de1a09f88c7263badf5508bb8b91ef13060 -->",

        "headline":"Bitcoin price surges to post-crash high",
        "body":"<p>Bitcoin, the cryptographic peer-to-peer digital currency, has reached a new price high since the market crash in April this year.</p> <p>Over the two weeks to 21 October, the value of one bitcoin rose by almost $60, and on Tuesday hit a high of $197.40 <a href=\"http://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/\">at the largest exchange</a>, Mt Gox. <a href=\"http://data.qz.com/bitcoin/\">An estimate of the current price</a> taking a broader spectrum of exchanges into account shows it at $182.74.</p> <p>The price of one bitcoin peaked at $266 on 10 April, before tumbling rapidly to a low of $50 shortly after. Since then, the price has not risen above $170 until this week.</p> <p>Some observers worried that the <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0CF0QFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2013%2Foct%2F02%2Falleged-silk-road-website-founder-arrested-bitcoin&amp;ei=UyplUoXiGuSR0QXD2IGoBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVgSDUiXeYvVvSH4MOw8NR2emaHw&amp;sig2=C8amtzX_6eNR4LcL-U-7hQ&amp;bvm=bv.54934254,d.d2k\">shutdown of the online drugs marketplace Silk Road</a> would hit the Bitcoin economy. <a href=\"http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/files/pdfs/tech_reports/CMUCyLab12018.pdf\">A paper from 2012</a> estimated that almost one bitcoin in 20 was spent on the site, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/bitcoin-price-silk-road-ulbricht-value\">economist Jeffrey Cook of World&rsquo;s First currency brokers warned</a> that investors were &ldquo;scrabbling for the exit&rdquo;.</p> <p>But others pointed out that the closure could provide a source of strength for the fledgling currency. &ldquo;If anything, the fall of Silk Road has done Bitcoin a favour,&rdquo; said Emily Spaven, editor of the digital currency news website <a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/\">CoinDesk</a>. &ldquo;Hopefully now that the website no longer exists, people will start to see Bitcoin in a more positive light and appreciate the numerous benefits it offers.&rdquo;</p> <p>That latter prediction seems to have stood up. The price drop caused by the closure of Silk Road was reversed in less than two weeks, and the value of a bitcoin has seen near-continuous growth since then.</p> <p>The currency has not completely lost its association with the darker side of the internet, however. In a report from McAfee, Digital Laundry, authors Raj Samani, Fran&ccedil;ois Paget and Matthew Hart assess a number of different digital currencies for their potential criminal uses.</p> <p>Bitcoin receives criticism for its &ldquo;mining&rdquo; mechanic, whereby users are given bitcoins for doing the complex calculations which enable the currency to operate.</p> <p>&ldquo;Once cybercriminals recognised the monetary opportunity in Bitcoin,&rdquo; the authors write &ldquo;it became a key focus of their activity.&rdquo; They detail an occasion when <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/07/esea-2/\">a rogue employee of the E-Sports Entertainment Association</a> updated the company&rsquo;s software, used by serious gamers to play online competitively, to make its computers mine for him. In a few weeks, he earned 30 bitcoins, currently worth about $6,000, but damaged customers' computers in the process.</p> <p>They also point to the ability to rent botnets, huge networks of computers taken over by hackers, and set them working at mining Bitcoins.</p> <p>A new virus is also reinforcing the link between Bitcoin and criminality. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/19/cryptolocker-attacks-computer-ransomeware\">CryptoLocker encrypts victim&rsquo;s files, and then demands payment</a> &ndash; currently either $300 or two bitcoins&nbsp;&ndash; within three days to unlock them. Unlike similar \"ransomware\" viruses, Cryptolocker makes good on its promise, leaving users with a tricky choice.</p> <p>But the virus underscores another perennial problem with Bitcoin: when the prices were set, two bitcoins were worth slightly less than $300. Now they are worth almost $100 more, the currency&rsquo;s notorious volatility having left the old prices out of sync with each other.</p> <p>&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/15/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-alleged-mastermind\">The man alleged to be behind the Silk Road says he is not \"excessively concerned\" about his future</a>.</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420535787|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|2b85115057835cda4923626760ffd99c7b65c239 -->",

        "body":"<p>Authorities in the US have seized an estimated $28m in bitcoins, a digital currency, from the alleged owner of Silk Road, the online marketplace for drugs and criminal activity that law enforcement shut down three weeks ago.<br /> <br />Federal prosecutors in New York said Friday that the 144,336 bitcoins, which were widely used on the defunct site, were discovered on computer hardware belonging to Ross William Ulbricht, known online as Dread Pirate Roberts, who was arrested 1 October in San Francisco and charged with various conspiracy counts. They said it represented the largest ever bitcoin seizure.<br /> <br />Ulbricht's lawyer could not immediately be reached on Friday evening, though he had previously told reporters that Ulbricht denied the charges.<br /> <br />Since it began operations in 2011 Silk Road had provided an anonymous site where drug dealers, counterfeiters and other criminals could shop for everything from heroin to hitmen, according to the justice department.<br /> <br />More than 900,000 registered users of the site bought and sold drugs using bitcoins, according to authorities. The currency, which has been around since 2008, first came under scrutiny by law enforcement officials in mid-2011 after media reports surfaced linking bitcoins to Silk Road.<br /> <br />With nearly 30,000 bitcoins previously seized, federal agents had so far collected more than $33m worth based on current value, the US attorney's office in Manhattan said.<br /> <br />The seizures were carried out as part of a corresponding civil action against Silk Road and Ulbricht. Ulbricht, who is detained in California, is expected to appear within weeks in Manhattan federal court to face criminal charges of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.<br /> <br />Court documents allege that $1.2bn in bitcoins changed hands through Silk Road during more than two years of operation, with the site charging 8-15% in commissions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421003535|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|adc539d95bdc2949f394ee5d4d3c050d5623d2d8 -->",

        "body":"<p>A silver and blue ATM, perched up next to the espresso bar in a trendy Vancouver coffee shop, could launch a new era for the virtual currency bitcoin, offering an almost instant way to exchange the world's leading virtual money for cash.</p><p>The value of a bitcoin soared from $13 in January to a high of $266 in April as more businesses and consumers used them to buy and sell online. Some investors are also treating bitcoins like gold, using them to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on their rise.</p><p>The kiosk, which looks like the average ATM but with hand and barcode scanners, opened for business on Tuesday and by mid-morning people were lined up to swap their bitcoins for cash, or to deposit cash to buy more bitcoins.</p><p>\"It's as easy as walking up to a machine, scanning your hand, entering some cash and buying bitcoin,\" said Jordan Kelley, chief executive of Las Vegas-based Robocoin, the company that builds the ATMs. \"With this, it's a 2-minute process. For any online exchange, it's at least two days.\"</p><p>Bitcoins, currently worth about $210 each, can be transferred without going through banks or clearing houses, thereby cutting fees. Users can buy products and services online or in a handful of stores, including the Waves coffee shop where the ATM is located.</p><p>With the bitcoin ATM, users scan their hand to confirm identity, then funds move to or from a virtual wallet on their smartphone. The system limits transfers to $1,000 a day, in an effort to curb money laundering and other fraud.</p><p>Bitcoiniacs, the local dealer that operates the ATM, will roll out four other kiosks across Canada in December. Robocoin said Canada was the ideal place to launch the kiosk due to a critical mass of users and less stringent oversight than in the US, where the bitcoin trade is monitored by anti-money laundering regulators.</p><p>\"We think the Vancouver market is enormous and we're excited to be here,\" said Kelley. \"By the end of 2013, we'll be all over Canada. By the end of 2014, we'll be all over the world, including the US.\"</p><p>Bitcoin is not a recognised currency in Canada, so Ottawa's anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre, does not monitor its trade.</p><p>However, Bitcoiniacs' founders say they are working with the agency to be ready for when Canada does start regulating them.</p><p>\"We're already being proactive in our business,\" said Bitcoiniacs co-founder Mitchell Demeter. \"We abide by any guidelines they would impose - which includes the 'know your customer' laws and anti-money laundering laws.\"</p><h2>Going mainstream</h2><p>Bitcoins were launched in 2008 and are traded within a global network of computers. They are not backed by a single company or government, but their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system's control over the minting of money.</p><p>Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.</p><p>The currency's reputation took a hit this month, when US regulators shut down Silk Road, an online marketplace used to buy and sell illegal drugs, and seized $3.6m (Â£2.3m) in bitcoins.</p><p>But the virtual currency is gaining hold among businesses and consumers, a key step to a bigger role.</p><p>\"I think it's definitely going mainstream,\" said Demeter. \"I think as things progress, and the infrastructure is built, it will become easier for people to buy and sell, and so more people will start using it.\"</p><p>In Vancouver, for example, dozens of people attend weekly bitcoin meet-ups and a member co-op is promoting the currency to a growing list of local retailers.</p><p>At Waves, Vancouver resident Chung Cheong used bitcoin to pay for his mug of tea and was happy to mull over the future of the digital currency.</p><p>\"It's been said that we're at the stage where email was in 1992,\" he said. \"Is it risky? Sure. But look at how the internet and email changed the world.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421280547|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|1fa51a332195230cc4aba0c7ee3a666a26f8dd59 -->",

        "body":"<p>The meteoric rise in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a> has meant that within the space of four years, one Norwegian manâs $27 investment turned into a forgotten $886,000 windfall.</p> <p>Kristoffer Koch invested 150 kroner ($26.60) in 5,000 bitcoins in 2009, after discovering them during the course of writing a thesis on encryption. He promptly forgot about them until widespread media coverage of the anonymous, decentralised, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/04/bitcoin-what-you-need-to-know-silk-road\">peer-to-peer digital currency</a> in April 2013 jogged his memory.</p> <p>Bitcoins are stored in encrypted wallets secured with a private key, something Koch had forgotten. After eventually working out what the password could be, Koch got a pleasant surprise:&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It said I had 5,000 bitcoins in there. Measuring that in today's rates it's about NOK5m ($886,000),&quot; Koch <a href=\"http://www.nrk.no/okonomi/kjopte-bolig-for-internettpenger-1.11314773\">told NRK</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Silk Road fluctuations</strong></h2> <p>In April 2013, the value of bitcoin peaked at $266 before crashing to a low of $50 soon after. Since then, bitcoin has seen large fluctuations in its value, most recently following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/alleged-silk-road-website-founder-arrested-bitcoin\">seizure of online drugs marketplace Silk Road</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/bitcoin-price-silk-road-ulbricht-value\">plummeting</a> before jumping $30 in one day to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/21/bitcoin-price-surges-to-post-crash-high\">a high of $197 in October</a>.</p> <p>Koch exchanged one fifth of his 5,000 bitcoins, generating enough kroner to buy an apartment in Toyen, one of the Norwegian capitalâs wealthier areas.</p> <h2><strong>Two ways to acquire bitcoins</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-480840c9-5847-4374-8059-0037eb5c3961\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383093762289/d4c7ce7c-974a-4c3b-a780-3793c0cc382e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bitcoin ATM at a coffee shop in Vancouver.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Customers line-up to use the world's first ever permanent bitcoin ATM at a coffee shop in Vancouver, British Columbia. Photograph: Andy Clark/Reuters</figcaption> </figure> <p>Typically bitcoins are bought using traditional currency from a bitcoin &quot;exchanger&quot;, although due to strict anti-money laundering controls, the process can can be tricky. A user can then withdraw those bitcoins by sending them back to an exchanger like <a href=\"https://www.mtgox.com/\">Mt Gox</a>, the best known bitcoin exchange, in return for cash.</p> <p>However, bitcoin is gaining more and more traction within the physical world too. It is now possible to actually spend bitcoins without exchanging them for traditional currency first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2013/jun/23/britains-first-bitcoin-pub\">in a few British pubs</a>, including the Pembury Tavern in Hackney, London, for instance. On 29 October, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/bitcoin-first-atm-vancouver-canada\">world's first bitcoin ATM</a> also went online in Vancouver, Canada, which scans a user's palm before letting them buy or sell bitcoins for cash.&nbsp;</p> <p>A small group of hardcore users also generate extra bitcoins by &quot;mining&quot; for them â a process that requires computers to perform the calculations needed to make the digital currency work, in exchange for a share of the built-in inflation.</p> <p>Mining is a time-consuming and expensive endeavour due to the way the currency is designed. Each subsequent bitcoin mined is more complex than the previous one, requiring more computational time and therefore investment through the electricity and computer hardware required.</p> <p><strong>â¢ In August, Germany <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/19/bitcoin-unit-of-account-germany\">recognised bitcoin as a &quot;unit of account</a>&quot;, allowing the country to tax users or creators of the digital currency</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421199275|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|fdd50fedc8eea567b8ab29a486f44cba2593f12a -->",
