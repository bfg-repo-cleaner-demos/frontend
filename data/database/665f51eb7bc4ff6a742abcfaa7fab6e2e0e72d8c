        "body":"<p>Following his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/chris-christie-reelection-new-jersey-win\" title=\"\">re-election as governor of the traditionally Democratic state of New Jersey</a>, Chris Christie is being seen the favourite to be the Republicans' presidential candidate in 2016.</p><p>1. Christie is becoming less coy about his presidential ambitions. He repeatedly ruled out running for the 2012 nomination dismissing such talk as \"presumptuous\". But in his New Jersey victory speech he said: \"I know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey, maybe the folks in Washington should tune in to their TV sets, and see how's done.\"</p><p>2. Christie is estimated to weigh 350lb (24 stone), but his opponents have failed to exploit his obesity. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOrP3vqEdzM\" title=\"\">A 2009 campaign TV ad by the Democrat governor Jon Corzine featured slow-motion footage of Christie struggling to get out of a car</a>. It accused him of \"throwing his weight around\". Christie turned the ad to his advantage by urging Corzine to \"man up and say I'm fat\". After unseating Corzine as governor Christie went on exploit his bull-in-china-shop image. But his weight remains a personal concern. In an attempt to shift some of his excess blubber, Christie had gastric-band surgery last February. He had the operation under a false name but later went public. He admits to struggling with his weight for the last 20 years. The operation has made no discernible difference to his size.</p><p>3. Christie is a diehard Bruce Springsteen fan. Such adulation goes down well among the blue collar workers of Springsteen's native New Jersey. But Christie's adoration of the Boss goes way beyond political calculation. He has been to 129 Springsteen concerts and is said to be able to recite the words to all of his songs.  But the adoration is not reciprocated by the Democrat Springsteen, who repeatedly refused to meet Christie. When Christie did finally meet his hero he was filmed crying.</p><p>4. When the Sopranos star James Gandolfini died unexpectedly in June, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/21/chris-christie-james-gandolfini_n_3479915.html\" title=\"\">Christie ordered flags to be flown at half-mast on New Jersey state buildings.</a> Gandolfini's portrayal of Tony Soprano has even been seen by some political commentators to have encouraged New Jerseyans to embrace a pugnacious figure such as Christie.</p><p>5. Christie was a source of repeated irritation to Mitt Romney during the latter's failed presidential bid. Initially there was speculation that Romney would chose Christie as his running mate, because of the New Jersey governor's bipartisan appeal. The Romney campaign rejected the idea reportedly because of nervousness about Christie's weight. But Christie remains a popular figure in the Republican party and was chosen to make the keynote speech at the Republican convention.</p><p>Romney's people were furious with Christie's speech because they felt it focused too much on Christie's own record and failed to sufficiently celebrate Romney. They even took the unprecedented step of briefing against Christie afterwards. Later, Christie did his own presidential ambitions no harm, but helped wreck Romney's, when he embraced Barack Obama in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy days before the presidential election. In a bipartisan gesture he thanked the president for federal government support to help New Jersey cope with the aftermath of the storm.</p><p>6. Christie is a long-term opponent of gay marriage. But last month he<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/chris-christie-gay-marriage-new-jersey\" title=\"\"> dropped legal efforts to block same-sex marriage in New Jersey</a>, hours after the first couples took advantage of a court ruling that allowed gay weddings to begin.</p><p>Christie said: \"<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/chris-christie-doma-reaction-93483.html#ixzz2jrK12GSR\" title=\"\">I believe that marriage should be between one man and one woman</a>. That doesn't mean, in any way shape or form, that I have anything against folks who are homosexual. I believe people are born that way. I don't believe it's a choice … you were born with your sexual preference. But I believe that the institution of marriage for 2,000 years has been between a man and a woman.\"</p><p>7. Public sector unions regard Christie as a pariah after he cut the pay and pensions of police, firefighters and teachers. One teachers' union leader suggested he wanted to see Christie dead in a poor-taste joke memo that backfired on the union.</p><p>The memo written in 2009 said: \"Dear Lord, this year you have taken away my favourite actor, Patrick Swayze, my favourite actress, Farrah Fawcett, my favourite singer, Michael Jackson, and my favourite salesman, Billy Mays. I just wanted to let you know that Chris Christie is my favourite governor.\"</p><p>Christie used the joke to his advantage repeatedly reminding audiences that his opponents wished for his death and chided the union for refusing to sack the author of the memo.</p><p>8. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkuTm-ON904\" title=\"\">Clips of Christie's combative encounters with hecklers</a> are a massive hit on YouTube. His town-hall put downs and shouting matches with union supporters attract millions of views.</p><p>9. Tino Fiumara, one of New Jersey's most notorious and ruthless gangsters, is a relation. But the connection is very distant – Fiumara was the brother of Christies aunt's husband. Christie met him only once. \"For most of my life, he spent his life in prison. That teaches you a lot,\" Christie said of Fiumara.</p><p>10. Christie is no Tea Party pinup. The New Jersey governor's attack on the public sector would appear to appeal to Conservative Republicans. But his views on gun control and abortion are far too nuanced for the Tea Party. He has strengthened gun control in New Jersey. But was later accused of flip-flopping on the issue by rejecting anti-gun legislation from the state legislature.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421815643|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|9beff9847c306b7325b51e090e05c9aa7c8a7951 -->",

The New Jersey governor won re-election by such a margin that he has made himself a natural contender for the party's presidential nomination in 2016. More to the point, he has done this in a solidly blue state. Mr Christie is the pro-life conservative who can get votes from women, the union-bashing Republican who can attract  Hispanics and African-Americans. Whether he could repeat the same trick in New Jersey if, as a presidential candidate, he were running against Hillary Clinton, is another matter. But for now, he can now look fellow Republicans, still mesmerised by Tea Party puritans, in the eye and say that his party can show up in the places they are not comfortable and still win.</p><p>In a field too often dominated either by machine politicians or weirdos, Mr Christie's attraction to independents is considerable. He has an oversized personality. He is the bruiser  on the stump who can eat hecklers for breakfast. Charlie Cook of Cook Report fame said he would pay money to see him being called a liberal by a Tea Party heckler in Iowa and watching the New Jersey governor \"reach down the guy's throat and pull his lungs out\". Governors make good presidential candidates. Unlike congressmen, they can say that they have been there and done it. As the leader-elect of the Republican Governors Association, Mr Christie will soon be in a position to help state candidates, favours which he will be sure to call on in time of need.</p><p>That's the plus side. The minus side for Mr Christie is that his party is still essentially two different parties which remain to be reunited. Its centre of gravity has been pulled to the right by a Tea Party base that puts the justice of the cause and the glory of the fight before the task of winning the battle. The clearest sign that a pushback is currently under way from the Republican establishment came when the National Republican Senatorial Committee told a <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/republican-campaign-committee-pushes-back-against-conservative-group/?_r=0\" title=\"\">prominent Republican advertising firm </a>it would not receive any more contracts because it had worked with groups seeking to undermine incumbent Senate Republicans. This is all to do with the battle that will take place when the Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky comes up for re-election next year.</p><p>The fact is that ideological divisions between moderates and conservatives within the Republican party go deeper than between Republicans like Mr Christie and Democrats like Mrs Clinton. A poll released this week made<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/poll-republicans-2016-president-99414.html\" title=\"\"> this very point</a>. It shows that the Republican senator Ted Cruz, who, in a presidential contest, would fare worst against Mrs Clinton, losing by 17 points, fares best among the right wing of the party. The converse is true for Mr Christie, who trails Mrs Clinton by only five points, but who can currently count on only 3% of the support from conservative Republicans. This schism will have to be solved, and the Republican slate for 2016 is already a full one, with Mr Christie, Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio,<a href=\"http://nation.time.com/2013/11/04/in-wisconsin-scott-walker-looks-for-his-own-way-to-insure-the-poor/\" title=\"\"> Scott Walker</a> and Mr Cruz all potential candidates.</p><p>Mr Christie has promised to turn up frequently in places like Ohio, Michigan and Florida, but what worked for him in New Jersey may not necessarily have the same effect in, say, Iowa. For one thing, he is in favour of gun control. Rudolph Giuliani's decision to skip Iowa and the smaller first-voting states in the 2008 presidential primaries cost him dearly. By the time he got to Florida he came a distant third. The New Jersey governor will not have that option if he decides to run. The Tea Party might not feel as discomfited by Tuesday night's results as the Republican establishment may imagine. In Virginia, Ken Cuccinelli, the Tea Party favourite, gave his Democrat rival Terry McAuliffe a run for his money in a classic swing state. Mr Rubio and Mr Paul both campaigned for Mr Cuccinelli. This fight still has<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/virginia-new-jersey-results-highlight-republican-partys-divisions-problems/2013/11/05/7a46d96e-37e9-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html?wpisrc=nl_politics\" title=\"\"> a long way to go</a>. Only when it ends will Republicans know whether they can field an electable candidate.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421860663|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|39dc0e3944bb883b109d9f7e6f2c0b26bf57cf28 -->",

        "body":"<p>Last week a radical candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/bill-de-blasio-wins-new-york-mayoral-election\" title=\"\">won the contest to be mayor of New York by a landslide.</a> Bill de Blasio campaigned to attack income inequality and demand greater respect by the police for human rights. His opponents made much of his <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2013/09/27/radio-host-questions-de-blasio-for-cuban-honeymoon/\" title=\"\">spending his honeymoon (in 1991) in Cuba</a> and, more recently, his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/06/bill-de-blasio-new-populist-left\" title=\"\">support for the Occupy Wall Street protests</a>. Never did a duck's back shrug off so much water: he trounced his Republican opponent with 73% of the vote to become New York's first Democrat mayor for 20 years.</p><p>Could the current struggles of millions of Britons to make ends meet be driving our voters in the same leftwards direction as those of the Big Apple? <a href=\"http://classonline.org.uk/news/latest/new-class-yougov-poll-released-today-shows-that-most-people-are-not-benefit\" title=\"\">A recent YouGov survey for a new thinktank, the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (CLASS)</a> contains results that could suggest Ed Miliband should play up his \"Red Ed\" tag rather than seek to deny it.</p><p>Here is how a leftwing Labour activist could make this case, based on our figures:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>\"Britain's economy may be growing, but most people feel no better off. Only 15% reckon they are benefitting at all from the country's recovery; fully 77% think it is passing them by. And they want ministers to do far more to protect their standard of living. Majorities say the Government should control gas and electricity prices (74%) and fares on public transport (72%). Almost half of those surveyed want government control of private sector rents – and one-third even want food prices to be controlled.<br />\"What's more, most people want Britain to undo the privatisation of the past three decades. There is a big appetite to renationalise the energy companies (wanted by 68%), the railway companies (66%) and Royal Mail (67%). If Ed Miliband committed Labour to a programme of price controls and public ownership, he'd be Britain's Bill de Blasio and win by a landslide.\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Well, maybe. But then again, maybe not. The evidence from last week's exit polls in the US should warn us against an over-simple interpretation of the public mood. Many of the New Yorkers who voted for De Blasio also praised the record of his predecessor, the very rich and far-from-leftwing <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/politics/bloomberg/legacy-2013-9/\" title=\"\">Michael Bloomberg</a>. Likewise, next door in New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/10/chris-christie-talkshows-republican-2016-president\" title=\"\">Chris Christie</a> was re-elected as governor, also by a landslide, even though he is a Republican in a mainly Democrat state. A mainstream conservative, an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/projects/elections/2013/general/new-jersey/exit-polls.html\" title=\"\">exit poll</a> showed he won the votes of 31% of those who describe their own ideology as liberal; an opponent of Obamacare, he was backed by 33% of those who back the president's health plans; and half of Christie's votes came from supporters of same-sex marriage – a reform he deplores.</p><p>As ever, one should be wary of translating what happens in the United States to what happens here. Our political culture is unlike theirs in so many ways – the campaigning style, influence of money, divisions over social values, nature of party loyalties and so on. But in one big sense, the results from New York and New Jersey do contain an important lesson for British politicians.</p><p>It is that elections, increasingly, are verdicts on people rather than polic -programmes. New Yorkers think De Blasio will do a good job fighting for them and their city; the voters of New Jersey have re-elected Christie because of his personality and his record. A surveyed <a href=\"http://eagletonpoll.rutgers.edu/polls/release_10-23-13.pdf\" title=\"\">85% of respondents</a> give him high marks for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/08/chris-christie-new-jersey-sandy\" title=\"\">way he handled Hurricane Sandy</a> last year. That mattered far more than his ideology, views on same-sex marriage or even, for many Democrats, his party label. His competence and character swept all else aside.</p><p>Now, \"character\" can be an elusive phenomenon. Few people on either side of the Atlantic can win an election if they are tagged as extremist. Hence the way De Blasio's opponents attacked him – the New York Post called him a <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2013/09/25/de-blasios-warped-world-view-should-set-off-alarm-bells/\" title=\"\">pro-Cuban communist</a> who was <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2013/09/04/the-left-strikes-back/\" title=\"\">soft on crime</a>. He won by persuading New Yorkers that this was nonsense and that he was a capable guy in tune with the concerns of people in a city that resented the ever-widening gulf between rich and poor.</p><p>Much the same story can be told about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945\" title=\"\">Labour's general election triumph in 1945</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979\" title=\"\">Conservative victory in 1979</a>. True, voters supported radical change in both elections; but only because they were satisfied that Clement Attlee and Margaret Thatcher were competent leaders who would convert their pledges into effective action.</p><p>By the same token, Ed Miliband's central task is to persuade voters not just that he is on their side, but also that he is up to the job of prime minister. Currently, too few people think he is. And I'm not sure that he would win over the doubters by translating our poll numbers into a series of manifesto commitments to reintroduce price controls and renationalise the Royal Mail and British Gas. Were voters to regard him as a strong, decisive leader with workable solutions to Britain's problems, then such radical measures might carry him to victory. The trouble is that this is not how most people see him; so the risk is that the very policies that most people say they want, could turn out to do him more harm than good.</p><p>Michael Howard learned this lesson the hard way as Conservative leader in 2005. He stroked public opinion with tough policies on Europe, crime and immigration – only to be dragged down by a reputation for being too rightwing.</p><p>It's the paradox of populism: ideas we say we like, can jar when proclaimed by politicians we don't respect. We want leaders to agree with us but not to pander to us. In that sense, politicians are like doctors. We would rather they never stuck needles into us or told us to lose weight, but how many of us would really trust a GP who did only what we asked and never seemed to use her knowledge and experience to say what had to be done?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422193252|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|acd599c16cb856e2757cf072b77be2b1632b0a1a -->",

        "body":"<p>The election of Bill de Blasio, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/bill-de-blasio-wins-new-york-mayoral-election\" title=\"\">first Democratic mayor of New York</a> for 20 years, has gone relatively unnoticed in the British media. There has been more attention paid to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/republicans-contemplate-future-mixed-election-fortune\" title=\"\">re-election</a> of Republican New Jersey governor Chris Christie, seen as a possible 2016 presidential contender. However, De Blasio's victory is worth remarking on, not just because he won with 72% of the vote, but because he won by breaking every rule in the New Labour playbook.</p><p>One of the planks of his campaign was the need to build more affordable housing. This is something even the most hardened New Labour apparatchik could give grudging agreement to.</p><p>But one of the key aspects was opposition to \"stop and frisk\" – New York's version of stop and search. The idea of doing this in the UK would give the average New Labour policy advisor palpitations. In New York, as in London, stop and search is popular with the middle classes but deeply unpopular with black and ethnic minority citizens. And in New York, just as in London, it affects black and minority young people disproportionately to any law and enforcement value, and poisons community relations. Yet even the black candidate in the Democratic primary chose to side with the police on stop and frisk. Presumably he was nervous about the attitudes of the New York bourgeoisie.</p><p>In contrast, De Blasio took aim at stop and frisk right from the beginning and it paid a political dividend. Married to a black woman, Chirlane McCray, De Blasio's campaign was only enhanced by a party political broadcast, starring his son Dante, which zeroed in on stop and frisk. Much of the advertisement's charm was Dante's huge afro, which became a star in its own right; \"Go with the Fro\" even became a campaign slogan. The advertisement's impact came from the fact that, well spoken and personable, Dante was the colour of the young men who are overwhelmingly the victims of stop and frisk.</p><p>If the idea of opposing stop and search would horrify most Labour policy advisers, the other plank of De Blasio's campaign – putting up taxes – would send them into a dead faint. But De Blasio made putting up taxes on wealthy New Yorkers one of the most important policies of his campaign. It was front and centre at all times. And it went alongside a consistent attack on spiralling inequality in New York. On his campaign website he said: \"In so many ways, New York has become a tale of two cities. Nearly 400,000 millionaires call New York home, while nearly half of our neighbours live at or near the poverty line.\"</p><p>It goes without saying that De Blasio was not originally the candidate of the Democratic establishment. That was an extremely experienced and moderate local politician called Christine Quinn. She even had the endorsement of the New York Times, but Democratic primary voters proved to be uninterested in the safe party loyalist. So De Blasio, having won the Democratic primary, swept to victory with every demographic of voters. It turned out that New Yorkers – black, white, Hispanic middle, class or poor – were ready to hear a message about the unacceptable inequality in the city and the need for the rich to pay their share. And he won by a landslide.</p><p>Rightwing Democrats and the Republicans are already prophesying Armageddon. The platform De Blasio ran on was contrary to every piece of accepted political wisdom of both the Democratic political elite in America and its Labour equivalent on this side of the Atlantic. But the right wing of the Labour party has prided itself on learning from the Democrats, since the earliest days of Tony Blair and New Labour. Will they be so keen to learn from Bill de Blasio?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421898207|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|01484e3e91fded1b98c02c6c4f76ac75527570d0 -->",

        "headline":"Astrodome rescue crashes to earth",
        "body":"<p>One of America's most iconic sports stadiums looks doomed to destruction after Houston-area voters spurned a rescue plan for the Astrodome.</p><p>The pride of \"Space City\" after it opened in 1965, the air-conditioned arena became a symbol of Texan ambition and American architectural innovation. It was the world's first domed stadium and hosted Astros baseball, Oilers football, Muhammad Ali and Evel Knievel.</p><p>Music stars such as Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan performed there and Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs in the Battle of the Sexes tennis match in 1973. Its artificial playing surface was famously dubbed AstroTurf and the building was a blueprint for a generation of enclosed arenas.</p><p>But by 2003 the dome's major tenants had left for newer homes and its most notable recent use came in 2005 as a temporary refuge for thousands from New Orleans who were escaping the effects of hurricane Katrina. Then it was shut and declared unfit for occupancy in 2009.</p><p>Historical preservation societies rallied around the cause and various groups proposed turning the Astrodome into a museum, a park or even a film studio. In Tuesday's local elections voters were asked if they wanted to commit up to $217m in bonds to turn the decaying structure into a convention and exhibition centre with an external plaza, called the New Dome Experience.</p><p>Last Saturday hundreds of nostalgics queued up to buy seats, turf and other memorabilia from the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\" at a sale and auction. But that enthusiasm was not reflected in the wider electorate. With 100% of precincts having reported late on Tuesday night, the tally was 47% for the proposal and 53% against.</p><p>Barring an improbable rescue from a wealthy investor, the Astrodome now looks likely to be razed at a cost of around $30m, sometime before 2017, when Houston will host the Super Bowl at the adjacent Reliant Stadium.</p><p>\"Clearly, on the issue of the dome, the voters have rejected the proposal and the proposed bond issue and so commissioners' court will have to make a decision as to where we go from here,\" Ed Emmett, a Harris county judge, told KTRK local news.</p><p>\"The voters in Harris County have spoken,\" Beth Wiedower of the National Trust for Historic Preservation told the Houston Chronicle. \"There's no disputing this building is an icon. Its legacy will live on even if it doesn't. It seems like its fate is sealed; obviously we are disappointed in the outcome.\"</p><p>There was bad news for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/05/texas-voters-70m-for-high-school-football-stadium\">another Texas stadium proposal</a>. Voters in the Houston suburb of Katy seemed set to reject a bond that would have financed construction of the most expensive high school football arena in the country.</p><p>The Katy school district wants to build a $69.5m, 14,000-seat new stadium next to its existing 10,000-capacity venue. But 55% of voters were against the issue of a $99m bond that would also have paid for a science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) centre and agricultural education facility.</p><p>In Houston's mayoral election the incumbent, Annise Parker, easily won a third and final two-year term. In 2009 the Democrat became the first openly gay mayor of a major US city.</p><p>Across Texas voters were polled on a number of constitutional and local issues. These were the first statewide elections since Texas introduced its contentious voter ID laws earlier this year. Republicans say that having to show a valid photo ID with a name matching the electoral roll will help reduce fraud, while Democrats claim it is a measure designed to make it harder for poor people and minorities to cast ballots.</p><p>There were no reports of significant problems at polling stations, though a truer indication of the law's impact should come in next year's gubernatorial election, when the turnout will be far higher.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421768418|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|ad4a0c9c435064ecc758e31f0d11fa72027fa906 -->",

There isn't a longer streak in America of one party not winning at least 50% of the vote in at least one major statewide contest. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/27/chris-christie-appeal-historic-win\">Other statistics bear out</a> how unusual Christie's victory will be.</p><p>As important as the size of Christie's win, is how he's going to get it. A coalition of white people who had been deserting the Democrats in New Jersey and minorities is delivering for Christie. The latter group is especially important for a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/03/18/the-republican-problem-with-hispanic-voters-in-7-charts/\">party whose elders want to reach out</a> to black people and Hispanics. The establishment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/11/rand-paul-2016-gop-presidential-odds\">almost always decides presidential primaries</a>, and after two terms out of the White House, the yearning to win exceeds the thirst for ideological purity.</p><h2>2. Bill de Blasio and crime</h2><p>De Blasio is about to take the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-new-york-city-mayor-lhota-vs-de-blasio\">New York City mayoral election</a> by a margin of at least 40 points. He'll win a higher percentage of the vote for a Big Apple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_mayoral_elections\">non-incumbent mayoral candidate since 1925</a>. When a victory is this wide, you can assign almost any factor as at least partially the cause.</p><p>Let me give one: crime is not the same election issue it once was. Republicans in New York City and candidates nationwide <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayoralty_of_Rudy_Giuliani\">found success</a> in the 1980s and 1990s by promising to crack down on \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/nyregion/catsimatidis-no-friend-of-hoodlums.html?_r=0\">hoodlums</a>\". </p><p>But now, violent and other types of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/07/economist-explains-16\">crime is falling</a>, and issues such as police overreach are as important as the crime the police is trying to prevent. Also, <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/114-de-blasio-with-big-lead-over-lhota-going-into-election-day/\">other issues</a> – like economic inequality – can rise to the top.</p><p>Republicans in urban areas are going to come up with a message that better resonates in a time of safety in order to remain viable.</p><h2>3. Terry McAuliffe and 2014</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421725789'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/6/1354831666301/mcauliffe.jpg' alt='terry mcauliffe' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Importantly for election watchers, Terry McAuliffe will win despite being disliked by most voters. Photograph: Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>McAuliffe, a Democrat, is about to become the first member of the party White House to take the Virginia gubernatorial election since 1975. He's doing so in a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/10/virginia-governor-2014-midterms\"> state that looks a lot</a> like the nation, demographically. Most importantly for election watchers, McAuliffe will win despite being disliked by most voters.</p><p>McAuliffe's success has largely depended on Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli being even more disliked. Sound familiar? It should, because a very similar battle is going on for the 2014 midterms. Democrats are trying to break a stretch of the White House party losing or winning fewer than 10 seats in the House of Representatives – a stretch that dates back to the civil war. They need to take 17 seats to win back the House.</p><p>Right now, Democrats are ahead on the national House ballot by about four points among <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/generic_congressional_vote-2170.html\">likely 2014 voters</a>. As in Virginia, it's all about being less ugly. President Obama's approval rating is bad, but Republican approval ratings are worse. The fact that voters in Virginia are disobeying the longer term election after the presidential race trend should have national Republicans at least somewhat worried.</p><p>If big races and possible long-term implications aren't your thing, there are some other lesser known affairs could keep result-watchers up for much of the night:</p><h2>1. Alabama first district, House Republican primary runoff</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421725790'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383602553748/Bradley-Byrne-Dean-Young-008.jpg' alt='Bradley Byrne, Dean Young' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The fight between Bradley Byrne, left, and Dean Young is an intra-party battle that looks a lot like the Republican party's quarrel nationwide. Photo: AP</figcaption></figure><p>It's a fight between the business-friendly establishment candidate Bradley Byrne and Tea Partier Dean Young. Byrne is a fiscal conservative who believes President Obama was born in this country, while Young is a social conservative who thinks President Obama was born in Kenya. It's an intra-party battle that looks a lot like the Republican party's quarrel nationwide. The Guardian's Paul Lewis has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/30/alabama-primary-republican-q-a\">a lot more on the positions of the candidates</a>.</p><p>Bryne had long been thought of as the favorite, and got the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama's_1st_congressional_district_special_election,_2013\">highest percentage of the vote</a> in the initial primary with 35% to Young's 22%. In the runoff, the <a href=\"http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=791752\">latest poll</a> has Young surging to 43% and Byrne stuck at 40%. Polling special primary elections in the south is nearly impossible, though the candidate with the most energized base – probably Young – likely has an edge. Either way, this race is too close to call at this point.</p><h2>2. Boston's mayoral runoff</h2><p>You'd be excused if you couldn't point to <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/09/24/walsh-connolly-must-fight-for-same-ground-distinguish-themselves-between-now-and-november/GGXziuGiMGD8jw2u2mAb7J/story.html\">a single policy difference</a> between Democrats John Connolly and Marty Walsh. The candidates can't seem to disagree, except that Connolly attacks Walsh for being an ex-union official, while Walsh goes after Connolly for being a lawyer. There aren't any gender, race, or religious differences either. It's really a race about personality at this point, and this has led to <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-boston-mayor-connolly-vs-walsh\">one heck of a tight race</a>. </p><p>Walsh won the first round 18% to 17%, though Connolly jumped out to an early edge in the runoff. Walsh has closed the gap and is up by less than one point in the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-boston-mayor-connolly-vs-walsh\">HuffPollster aggregate</a>. The only thing certain in this contest is that for the first time in 20 years Boston will have a mayor whose name isn't Thomas Menino. </p><h2>3. Virginia's attorney general general election</h2><p>The last time the Democratic party won all three elected statewide offices (governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general) in Virginia <a href=\"http://blogs.roanoke.com/politics/2013/10/18/what-are-the-odds-of-a-democratic-sweep/\">was 1989</a>. With governor and lieutenant governor in the bag, Democrats are hoping their standard bearer Mark Herring can emerge victorious against Republican Mark Obenshain. Unlike the other Republican candidates running on the statewide ticket, Obenshain has avoided the Tea Party tarring. </p><p>The result is a race that is far too close to call. Obenshain is up by 0.1pt in the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2013-virginia-attorney-general-obenshain-vs-herring\">HuffPollster aggregate</a>. If Herring wins, expect Republicans to blame Cuccinelli for dragging down the whole ticket. If Obenshain pulls it off, expect more moderate Republicans to point to him as an example of what can happen when a more mainstream Republican is presented to the public. It's pretty much a lose-lose for the Tea Party.</p><h2>Overall</h2><p>Despite my earlier protestations, there are indeed some interesting stories to unfold on election night 2013. You just have to look hard enough.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421655144|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|420aa3261fa28b43665dd2dbfed45bb77e42b5cd -->",

Democrats also won the battle for lieutenant governor and were within a whisker of securing the post of attorney general – an unprecedented sweep in a state that until recently was a Republican stronghold.</p><p>But the narrowness of the defeat for Cuccinelli, who had been as much as 12 points behind in the latest opinion polls, may temper Republican disappointment and help soften calls for the national party to pick more moderate candidates in future.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/05/election-day-2013-polls-results-live\">Follow developments in our live blog</a></h2><p>McAuliffe nodded to the often bitter, money-driven campaign when he joked to supporters: \"I think that every single person in the state of Virginia is glad that the TV ads are now over.\"</p><p>But he made an appeal for bipartisan co-operation with Republicans, a theme which he and the Clintons have used to distance themselves subtly from the Obama White House throughout the campaign. \"We want to make Virginia a model for pragmatic leadership ... and bipartisan co-operation,\" McAuliffe told supporters in his acceptance speech.</p><p>Cuccinelli blamed the $15m gulf in campaign finance between the two candidates for his defeat. \"We were very heavily outspent but I am glad that we ran on first principles,\" he told GOP supporters in Richmond.</p><p>But he insisted the last-minute recovery in his support showed the unpopularity of Democrat healthcare reforms. \"You have sent a message tonight to the president of the United States that you believe that Obamacare is a failure. This race came down to the wire because of Obamacare. That message will go out across America tonight.\"</p><p>In the end, however, it was Cuccinelli's conservative views on abortion together with anger at the Republican-driven government shutdown that drove voters to McAuliffe, a man once seen as the embodiment of Washington machine politics and with <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/11/terry-mcauliffe-governor-virginia\">a history of chequered business relationships</a>.</p><p>Ralph Northam, who comfortably won the race to become Democratic lieutenant governor, credited the unpopularity of Cuccinelli's views on abortion as a major factor in his defeat.</p><p>\"If there is one thing we have learned in Richmond it is that no group of legislators, most of whom are men, should be telling women what they should and shouldn't be doing with their health,\" he told party supporters after his victory.</p><p>McAuliffe raised substantially more money than his GOP opponent, amassing an estimated $34m, including 37 personal donations worth more than $100,000, to fund a series of television ads painting Cuccinelli as a hardliner whose views were outside the mainstream in a state that is increasingly wealthy and suburban.</p><p>The personality-driven campaign by Democrats appeared to have paid off handsomely after early exit polls for CNN released when polling stations closed at 7pm showed McAuliffe ahead by 50% to 43% for Cuccinelli.</p><p>But Cuccinelli's vote held up surprisingly well in Republican strongholds in the west and south of Virginia, leaving most pundits unwilling to call the race until late into the evening.</p><p>Only when results from liberal Washington suburbs begin pouring in around 9pm did McAuliffe supporters gathered at a hotel in nearby Tysons Corner begin to celebrate.</p><p>The Northern Virginia suburbs of DC where McAuliffe dominated are a world away from the blue collar towns in the south of the state where Cuccinelli has been campaigning. The Sheraton Premiere that hosted his campaign party is next door to Porsche and Aston Martin dealerships and just a dozen metro stops from downtown DC.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421755502|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|bd0f3040b7d35a5211340fee4d45e044e705afea -->",

        "body":"<p>Detroit elected its first white mayor since 1974 on Tuesday as the city awaited the outcome of an historic bankruptcy filing.</p><p>Mike Duggan, a onetime hospital executive, led by a comfortable margin going into the polls over his African American rival, Wayne County sheriff Benny Napoleon. By 11pm, Duggan had 56% of the vote and Napoleon 44% with 88% of the votes counted. The Detroit Free Press called the result for Duggan.</p><p>It was the first time since the end of the Vietnam war that the city's majority African American voters have elected a white mayor.</p><p>The election of a white mayor in a city that has been dominated by racial politics for decades comes as the US bankruptcy court in Detroit weighs whether the city can officially go bust, weighed down by debts estimated at between $18-$20bn.</p><p>On Tuesday, the court heard from former Michigan state treasurer Andy Dillon who warned ahead of the bankruptcy filing that the move \"looks premeditated\" and argued that the state needed to do a better job of explaining why it was necessary. The trial, scheduled to end this week, could spill over into next week.</p><p>The city is currently under the control of emergency financial manager Kevyn Orr, who is pushing for the so-called chapter 9 bankruptcy, the largest in US history. Unions and pension funds are pressing for the judge to dismiss the case, claiming the city failed to hold \"good-faith\" negotiations and are favoring Wall Street investors over the city's workers and retirees.</p><p>Both Duggan and Napoleon said they would press for Orr to be removed as soon as possible so that they could get on with running the city if elected. Duggan said this week that his first move would be to tackle the city's crime rate and police response times. Detroit has one of the highest violent crime rates in the US.</p><p>Speaking outside the courthouse, retiree Suzanne Mancha said: \"I keep a tally of all the promises these people make. I'm lucky if they do two out of the 20 things they promise.\"</p><p>Megan Heeres, art curator and community art and garden programme manager at Lafayette Greens, one of Detroit's city gardens, said she was worried about what the new mayor will and won't be able to do.</p><p>\"In the short term, the emergency manager (Kevyn Orr) is really in charge of the city. I think it's important we elect a mayor and a council that can talk with the manager,\" she said.</p><p>Duggan struggled to make it to the polls. The business executive, who specialised in turnarounds, moved to Detroit from the affluent, mostly white suburb of Livonia. Opponents had him kicked off the August 6 primary ballot after challenging whether he met residency requirements.</p><p>Duggan initially withdrew from the race but was persuaded by supporters to run as a write-in candidate. He won more than 50% of the vote despite opponents' bids to confuse voters by mounting the candidacy of a barber named Mike Dugeon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421765175|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|fffaa63f1fe9f7c59b24a13e9e9ebb87ff2df0b1 -->",

Tackling inequality isn't  easy. It never has been and it never will be. The challenges we face have been decades in the making, and the problems we sought to address will not be solved overnight. But make no mistake, the city has chosen a progressive path and tonight we set forward together on it, together as one city.\"</p><p>De Blasio made a veiled reference to New York's controversial stop-and-frisk policing in the speech – something that had served as a divisive issue between he and Lhota on the campaign. Safety and civil liberties \"are not mutually exclusive\", De Blasio said, adding that there needs to be communication between police and the neighbourhoods they serve. \"We are stronger and safer as a city when police and residents work hand in hand.\"</p><p>De Blasio based his campaign on a portrayal of New York's \"two cities\". He has promised to expand pre-kindergarten and after-school programs by raising taxes on high earners. It remains to be seen if De Blasio will be able to raise taxes, however, which requires approval from New York State in Albany.</p><p>He will be sworn in on 1 January when he will become the 109th mayor of New York City, replacing Bloomberg, a former Republican who ran as an independent. The city council allowed Bloomberg to run for a third term, controversially accepting his argument that in the wake of the financial meltdown, he should be allowed to continue leading the city. A two-term limit was later restored.</p><p>Lhota gave a relatively low-key concession speech.  \"I have fought the good fight and I have finished the race,\" he said. Lhota wished his mother happy birthday, and thanked former mayor Rudy Giuliani, under whom he served as deputy.</p><p>\"Let it be known I will not spend one moment of my future regretting<br />what might have been,\" Lhota said. He left with an upbeat message in<br />what has been a rather damp squib of a campaign. \"New Yorkers never quit, New Yorkers never surrender, New Yorkers never hide from history, we make history.\"</p><p>De Blasio becomes the first Democratic mayor of New York since David Dinkins, elected the city's first and only black leader in 1989. De Blasio worked on Dinkins' campaign 24 years ago, where he met his wife Chirlane McCray.</p><p>McCray and the couple's children, Dante and Chiara, featured extensively in De Blasio's campaign. Dante, 15, appeared in and narrated De Blasio's first television commercial.</p><p>De Blasio had been up by almost 40 percentage points in every survey conducted since he and Lhota won their respective nominations. </p><p>At De Blasio's victory party at the YMCA in Park Slope, Brooklyn, supporters were jubilant. Amina Abdul-Wahhab, 40, said: \"It makes me feel great, I feel like there's gonna be a lot of progress, he's really fighting for the working class,\" she said. \"We finally have a politician who is fighting for the everyday people.\"</p><p>Abdul-Wahhab lives in East Flatbush, around four miles from Park Slope but a world away in terms of average incomes. \"There's a lot of working class people struggling just to make ends meet,\" she said. She said early childhood education was a key policy for single parents in the neighbourhood.</p><p>Leon Goldenberg, a real estate agent from Midwood, was \"absolutely excited\", despite observing that De Blasio's victory \"seems to have been set in stone after the primary\". He added: \"You don't have the high you normally would when it's a close race,\" he said.</p><p>Asked how the city will change under De Blasio's leadership, Goldenberg said the change would \"not nearly be as dramatic as people expect\".</p><p>\"There'll be a little less of the friction that the current mayor has caused,\" he said. De Blasio would be \"less Manhattan-centric\", and \"hopefully there'll be more affordable housing\", Goldenberg said.</p><p>De Blasio was not initially fancied to win his party's nomination ahead of his main rivals Bill Thompson, the city's former comptroller, and Christine Quinn, the city council leader. Quinn was the early favourite to be the Democratic nominee but De Blasio won 40.81% of the vote in the primary, winning the poll outright.</p><p>Lhota, the losing candidate, described himself as a \"fiscal conservative and progressive socially\". Throughout the campaign he attempted to portray De Blasio as soft on crime – \"recklessly dangerous\" on crime, one ad said – but his message failed to gain traction. In one of his final campaign acts Lhota criticised De Blasio <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/nov/04/bill-de-blasio-night-owl-vs-morning-bird\">after the Democrat admitted</a> he was \"not a morning person\".</p><p>• This article was amended on 8 November 2013. The earlier version suggested Michael Bloomberg's three-term reign as the mayor of New York City was unprecedented. In fact Fiorello LaGuardia (1934-45), Robert Wagner (1954-65) and Ed Koch (1978-89) also served three terms as the city's mayor.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421760576|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|786c94d6ba9281a8ff0457ea8a1d812b563c2285 -->",

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p><strong>• There were no big surprises.</strong> Governor Chris Christie won reelection in New Jersey, Bill de Blasio won the New York mayoral race and Terry McAuliffe was elected governor of Virginia.</p> <p><strong>• The margins in the races were roughly as expected,</strong> although McAuliffe won a narrower victory – 2.5 to 3 points – than forecast. Christie won by more than 22 points, garnering likely more than 60% of the vote, and de Blasio was on track to win by almost 50 points.</p> <p><strong>• Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli blamed his Virginia loss on having been outspent.</strong> Analysts contributed other explanations, including the fact that he lost women voters by 9 points, according to exit polls. The election &quot;was never a choice between Democrats and Republicans,&quot; McAuliffe said.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• Detroit voted for the technocrat mayoral candidate, Democrat Mike Duggan,</strong> over the county sheriff. Boston went for the former union leader, Marty Walsh, over the lawyer. Alabama's 1st congressional district went for the deeply conservative Republican candidate, Bradley Byrne, over the apocalyptically conservative Tea Party candidate.</p> <p><strong>• Both parties came away with reasons to be happy</strong>. Republicans seem to have a potentially strong presidential candidate in Chris Christie, who demonstrated crossover potential – although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/05/election-day-2013-polls-results-live#block-52799870e4b00ff3f5c0fcf5\">not as m</a>uch as some had hoped. Democrats romped in Virginia, a swing state, although as of this writing the attorney general race was still being counted:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/statuses/397944682032160768\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Per the AP, Obenshain's lead is now down to just 928 votes.</p>— Harry Enten (@ForecasterEnten) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/statuses/397944682032160768\">November 6, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-06T04:49:58.800Z\">at 11.49pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-5279c3b8e4b08cac6a3301bb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-06T04:24:12.016Z\">11.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Guardian's Kayla Epstein (@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KaylaEpstein\">kaylaepstein</a>) speaks with de Blasio supporter&nbsp;Lori Zeno after the mayor-elect's victory speech.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It may seem silly but I think <strong>his kids keep him young, they keep him grounded</strong>,&quot; she said. &quot;It makes me want to trust him with my own children...

Out walked the star of the campaign – Dante De Blasio, the 15-year-old son of Bill whose advertisement appearances and sizable afro have made him the face of this election. De Blasio's daughter, Chiara, and wife, Chirlane McCray, were there too, and it was McCray who offered the introduction.</p> <p>“The man I love has exactly what it takes to take on the big challenges we face,” McCray said, as the crowd finally quietened down. McCray had worked with De Blasio on the campaign of New York's last Democratic mayor, David Dinkins– and now she was introducing the next.</p> <p>De Blasio waved down the cheers and thanked his wife and staff. “We're proud of what we've accomplished on this campaign and we're humbled by it,” he said, before getting down to business in a speech that sought to temper expectations that were sky-high after De Blasio's repeated campaign pledges to united New York's “two cities” – those of the haves and have-nots.</p> <p>“Let me be clear, our work, all of our work, is really just beginning,” he said.</p> <p>“We have no illusions about the task that lies ahead. Tackling inequality isn't easy. It never has been and it never will be. The challenges we face have been decades in the making, and the problems we sought to address will not be solved overnight. But make no mistake, the city has chosen a progressive path and tonight we set forward together on it, together as one city.”</p> <p>De Blasio went on to praise his family, who have been so central to his campaign. His children came in for special praise. &quot;They make me proud every single day. And my fellow New Yorkers, they are very stylish,&quot; he said, to cheers.</p> <p>There was mention of New York's controversial stop-and-frisk policing in the speech – something that had served as a divisive issue between he and Lhota on the campaign. Safety and civil liberties “are not mutually exclusive”, De Blasio said, adding that there needs to be communication between police and the neighbourhoods they serve. “We are stronger and safer as a city when police and residents work hand in hand.”</p> <p>De Blasio signed off with more realism before this self-confessed “night owl” left to enjoy his victory.</p> <p>“The road ahead will be difficult but it will be travelled.

An&nbsp;<a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/58-tight-race-for-governor-in-virginia/\">NBC/Marist poll</a>&nbsp;has T-Mac up by 2pt among registered voters and down by 3pt among likely voters.

Not really. At&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/va/09-va-gov-ge-mvd.php?nr=1\">this point in 2009</a>, all but one scientific poll had eventual winner and current Republican Governor Bob McDonnell winning by 9pt or less. A few polls even had Democrat Creigh Deeds ahead by mid-June, but most had McDonnell ahead by about 5pt. With a few exceptions – notably from SurveyUSA, which consistently showed double-digit McDonnell leads by early August – most surveys continued to show a single-digit McDonnell lead through September.

Christie isn't a federal candidate; there's a long history of Republican governors in blue states. Christie’s also an incumbent who was elected in favorable conditions, who’s now running against a challenger—Barbara Buono—whose name I occasionally forget. It's an open question whether Christie from four years ago could win an open seat in New Jersey today. And it would be malpractice to forget Hurricane Sandy, the real turning point in the race. Before the storm, Christie’s approval ratings were in the low-to-mid fifties—low enough that he was potentially vulnerable in a very blue state. At the very least, he wasn’t on track to win by 23 points. So Christie isn’t a blueprint for perpetual Republican dominance: It would be extremely misguided to assume that conservative Republicans can simply jettison guns and immigration and routinely win blue states.</p> <p>But that doesn’t justify discounting Christie, either. After all, Republicans don’t need to win New Jersey to win the presidency. They mainly need to hold down Democratic margins in areas that aren’t too different from New Jersey, like the well-educated and diverse suburbs around Philadelphia, Washington, Columbus, and Denver. The sheer margin by which Christie is surpassing what’s necessary is consistent with the possibility that even modest changes would be enough for a sufficient number of moderate voters to reconsider a Republican candidate.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52793777e4b00d1cb1644775\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T18:57:07.864Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Happy election day!

        "body":"<p>Following his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/chris-christie-reelection-new-jersey-win\" title=\"\">re-election as governor of the traditionally Democratic state of New Jersey</a>, Chris Christie is being seen the favourite to be the Republicans' presidential candidate in 2016.</p><p>1. Christie is becoming less coy about his presidential ambitions. He repeatedly ruled out running for the 2012 nomination dismissing such talk as \"presumptuous\". But in his New Jersey victory speech he said: \"I know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey, maybe the folks in Washington should tune in to their TV sets, and see how's done.\"</p><p>2. Christie is estimated to weigh 350lb (24 stone), but his opponents have failed to exploit his obesity. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOrP3vqEdzM\" title=\"\">A 2009 campaign TV ad by the Democrat governor Jon Corzine featured slow-motion footage of Christie struggling to get out of a car</a>. It accused him of \"throwing his weight around\". Christie turned the ad to his advantage by urging Corzine to \"man up and say I'm fat\". After unseating Corzine as governor Christie went on exploit his bull-in-china-shop image. But his weight remains a personal concern. In an attempt to shift some of his excess blubber, Christie had gastric-band surgery last February. He had the operation under a false name but later went public. He admits to struggling with his weight for the last 20 years. The operation has made no discernible difference to his size.</p><p>3. Christie is a diehard Bruce Springsteen fan. Such adulation goes down well among the blue collar workers of Springsteen's native New Jersey. But Christie's adoration of the Boss goes way beyond political calculation. He has been to 129 Springsteen concerts and is said to be able to recite the words to all of his songs.  But the adoration is not reciprocated by the Democrat Springsteen, who repeatedly refused to meet Christie. When Christie did finally meet his hero he was filmed crying.</p><p>4. When the Sopranos star James Gandolfini died unexpectedly in June, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/21/chris-christie-james-gandolfini_n_3479915.html\" title=\"\">Christie ordered flags to be flown at half-mast on New Jersey state buildings.</a> Gandolfini's portrayal of Tony Soprano has even been seen by some political commentators to have encouraged New Jerseyans to embrace a pugnacious figure such as Christie.</p><p>5. Christie was a source of repeated irritation to Mitt Romney during the latter's failed presidential bid. Initially there was speculation that Romney would chose Christie as his running mate, because of the New Jersey governor's bipartisan appeal. The Romney campaign rejected the idea reportedly because of nervousness about Christie's weight. But Christie remains a popular figure in the Republican party and was chosen to make the keynote speech at the Republican convention.</p><p>Romney's people were furious with Christie's speech because they felt it focused too much on Christie's own record and failed to sufficiently celebrate Romney. They even took the unprecedented step of briefing against Christie afterwards. Later, Christie did his own presidential ambitions no harm, but helped wreck Romney's, when he embraced Barack Obama in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy days before the presidential election. In a bipartisan gesture he thanked the president for federal government support to help New Jersey cope with the aftermath of the storm.</p><p>6. Christie is a long-term opponent of gay marriage. But last month he<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/chris-christie-gay-marriage-new-jersey\" title=\"\"> dropped legal efforts to block same-sex marriage in New Jersey</a>, hours after the first couples took advantage of a court ruling that allowed gay weddings to begin.</p><p>Christie said: \"<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/chris-christie-doma-reaction-93483.html#ixzz2jrK12GSR\" title=\"\">I believe that marriage should be between one man and one woman</a>. That doesn't mean, in any way shape or form, that I have anything against folks who are homosexual. I believe people are born that way. I don't believe it's a choice … you were born with your sexual preference. But I believe that the institution of marriage for 2,000 years has been between a man and a woman.\"</p><p>7. Public sector unions regard Christie as a pariah after he cut the pay and pensions of police, firefighters and teachers. One teachers' union leader suggested he wanted to see Christie dead in a poor-taste joke memo that backfired on the union.</p><p>The memo written in 2009 said: \"Dear Lord, this year you have taken away my favourite actor, Patrick Swayze, my favourite actress, Farrah Fawcett, my favourite singer, Michael Jackson, and my favourite salesman, Billy Mays. I just wanted to let you know that Chris Christie is my favourite governor.\"</p><p>Christie used the joke to his advantage repeatedly reminding audiences that his opponents wished for his death and chided the union for refusing to sack the author of the memo.</p><p>8. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkuTm-ON904\" title=\"\">Clips of Christie's combative encounters with hecklers</a> are a massive hit on YouTube. His town-hall put downs and shouting matches with union supporters attract millions of views.</p><p>9. Tino Fiumara, one of New Jersey's most notorious and ruthless gangsters, is a relation. But the connection is very distant – Fiumara was the brother of Christies aunt's husband. Christie met him only once. \"For most of my life, he spent his life in prison. That teaches you a lot,\" Christie said of Fiumara.</p><p>10. Christie is no Tea Party pinup. The New Jersey governor's attack on the public sector would appear to appeal to Conservative Republicans. But his views on gun control and abortion are far too nuanced for the Tea Party. He has strengthened gun control in New Jersey. But was later accused of flip-flopping on the issue by rejecting anti-gun legislation from the state legislature.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421815643|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|9beff9847c306b7325b51e090e05c9aa7c8a7951 -->",

Are people coming together?'\"</p><p>Christie made no direct mention of any ambitions in the 2016 presidential race, though one woman in the crowd shouted out: \"Chris Christie for president!\" He quipped back: \"I guess there is open bar tonight, huh? Welcome to New Jersey.\"</p><h2>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/terry-mcauliffe-elected-governor-virginia\">Democrat Terry McAuliffe elected governor of Virginia</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/bill-de-blasio-wins-new-york-mayoral-election\">Bill de Blasio wins landslide victory in New York mayoral vote</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/mike-duggan-elected-detroit-mayor\">Detroit elects first white mayor since 1974 amid bankruptcy crisis</a></h2><p>In a disparate set of elections, it was hard to draw clear national conclusions. In New York, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/bill-de-blasio-wins-new-york-mayoral-election\">voters chose Bill de Blasio to be the city's first Democratic mayor </a>in 20 years. He won by a thumping majority: with 99% of the results declared, De Blasio had 73% of the vote. </p><p>In Virginia, Ken Cuccinelli, a conservative Republican supported by the Tea Party, lost the race for governor by a slim margin to Terry McAuliffe, a controversial Democratic fundraiser. In Alabama, a Tea Party Republican, Dean Young, lost a primary runoff election for the party's nomination to run for the House of Representatives. The vote was won by Bradley Byrne, a more mainstream candidate who received the backing of the US chamber of commerce.</p><p>In New Jersey, Christie made it clear that the Republican leadership should take note of his result. With 83% of counties reporting, he had a resounding lead with 60% of the vote to 39% for his Democratic rival, the state senator Barbara Buono who he out-spent by more than five-to-one.</p><p>His landslide victory and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/terry-mcauliffe-elected-governor-virginia\">simultaneous defeat of  Cuccinelli</a>, the more conservative Republican candidate for governor in Virginia, will embolden those within the party calling for a shift toward more centrist policies.</p><p>Christie has made a virtue of working with Democrats such as president Obama on bipartisan issues – a stark contrast to the hardliners in Congress who were blamed by voters on Tuesday for causing the government shutdown. He is also seen as much less divisive on social issues such as abortion and gun control.</p><p>In the race to secure his party's presidential nomination in 2016, the New Jersey governor will now be seen as a serious challenger to conservatives such as senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul – both of whom campaigned unsuccessfully for Cuccinelli. </p><p>Nevertheless, many in the GOP will point to New Jersey as an outlier state and were already clinging to the narrowness of Cuccinelli's defeat to McAuliffe in Virginia on Tuesday as a reason to stick with the party's rightward tilt.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421865021'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/6/1383713684023/Terry-McAuliffe-008.jpg' alt='Terry McAuliffe' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Democrat Terry McAuliffe celebrates winning the Virginia governorship at an election night party in Tysons Corner, Virginia.  Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>There has been renewed interest in Christie as a possible way out for the Republicans from the virulent in-fighting that has been tearing at the party under the influence of the Tea Party. The governor made particular mention of the work he had done on the campaign trail attempting to appeal to African American and Latino voters.</p><p>Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was quick to jump on the Christie bandwagon, hailing his re-election as a sign of the popularity of conservative principles \"even in a state the pundits like to call a 'blue state'.\" Priebus made a particular point of congratulating the New Jersey governor for having attracted significant support among minority voters – claiming some of the credit for such success on behalf of the national party.</p><p>\"During this race, the RNC worked alongside the Christie campaign to engage early and often with Hispanic, African American and Asian voters,\" he said.</p><p>Despite the RNC's response, some of the exit polls may give the party's – and Christie's – advisers some pause. Among black voters, the governor attracted just 20% support, exit polls suggested – nothing like the 93% landslide Barack Obama enjoyed nationally among African American voters in 2012.</p><p>Among Hispanics, Christie fared better at 48%, according to exit polls – tied with Buono. That's an improvement on Mitt Romney's miserable performance among Latinos in the 2012 presidential race at 27%, but shows that the Republican party still has a way to go in rebuilding Hispanic trust following years in which the general tone of Republican debate has been sharply anti-immigration.</p><p>More convincingly, and more in tune with the bridge-builder image that Christie has tried to cultivate, exit polls had the governor attracting the support of almost two thirds of independent voters – an important figure given the party's difficulties in recent elections to appeal to moderates. He won over even a third of Democratic voters – a sign of his soaring popularity since Hurricane Sandy when he was seen embracing President Obama amid the ruins of the New Jersey coastline.</p><p>The supporters who gathered at the Asbury Park convention hall to celebrate with the governor were in ebullient mood. Christina Rooney from nearby Bradley Beach said the night was \"a big step to the next big step. It was a huge deal when a Republican won the governor's race in New Jersey, but re-election is even better because it shows that his bi-partisanship works.\"</p><p>Leo Sugg said the victory would encourage Christie to go forward with his national aspirations. He said the governor's talents would play well across the country: \"He's very clear, honest and frank about the issues as he sees them. There's no ambiguity, and that's refreshing.\"</p><p>In his victory speech, Christie invoked what he called the \"spirit of Sandy\" and the impact that the storm had had on his term as governor. \"It's no longer a job for me, it's a mission, it's a sacred trust. I will not let anyone, any political party, any governmental entity get between me and the completion of my mission,\" he said.</p><p>One of Christie's earliest challenges, should he stand in 2016, is whether he can win the hearts of hard-core Republican voters who dominate at the primary stage when Christie would be battling to represent his party as presidential candidate. Traditionally, Republican presidential candidates are forced to pitch starkly to the right during the primary, then try and scratch their way back to center ground in the general presidential election.</p><p>The Tea Party could play an influential role in deciding Christie's fate on the national stage, given its influence in many key presidential primary states. Even here though, there are signs that Christie might find favour.</p><p>Sal Russo, chief strategist of the Tea Party Express, told the Guardian that on fiscal policies and the national debt on which the Tea Parties were focused, the New Jersey governor scored well. \"On the issues that we care about, Christie does pretty good – he's solid on the economy.\"</p><p>Contrary to much media coverage, Russo said, the Tea Party movement was very open to ideas of compromise as espoused by Christie. \"It's all about getting things done, and I'm totally supportive of his efforts to reach out to non-traditional Republican constitutions. That's the right thing to do.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421758013|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|ec90ec17ddff9aa6b72b60e85349c6ef869780e5 -->",

        "headline":"Bill de Blasio triumphs as mayor of New York: here's how he did it",
        "body":"<p>Just a few months ago, it looked like Bill de Blasio would be just another also-ran Democrat in the New York city mayoral race, at best a brief footnote in the history of The Rise and Very Hard Fall of Anthony Weiner's New York. Yet New Yorkers have just elected Bill de Blasio as their 109th mayor, handing him 73.3% of the vote in last night's election. His Republican opponent, Joe Lhota, only mustered 24.3%.</p> <p>De Blasio’s success owed much to his ability to tap into New Yorkers' discontent with issues such as income inequality and stop-and-frisk, as well as a deep desire for a change after the Michael Bloomberg era. But without a series of errors from his opponents, another Democrat may have triumphed last night.</p> <p>As this election season finally comes to a close, we assess the key moments that helped De Blasio: some a triumph of consistent messaging and canny timing, but others a result of some serious good luck.</p> <h2>Prologue: A Tale of Two Cities</h2> <p>De Blasio is hardly the first politician to seize upon the opening of Dickens' novel: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOdIqKsv624\">Mario Cuomo spoke of the tale of two cities</a>&nbsp;in his famous speech at the Democratic convention in 1984 and Fernando Ferrer, the Democratic nominee for mayor in 2001 and 2005, often spoke of the &quot;two New Yorks&quot;. But nobody has capitalized upon the phrase like De Blasio. Part of the message’s success was timing – New York's (and America's) income inequality is growing rapidly – and part of it was consistency. De Blasio name-checked the book so often that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/08/drinking_game_mayoral_debate.php\">reporters turned it into a drinking game</a> for the debates, and its title became a shorthand for the ideas at the center of De Blasio's campaign.</p> <h2>Chapter 1: Meet the De Blasios</h2> <p>After months of speculation, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-kicks-off-campaign-for-mayor.html?_r=0%20%20\">De Blasio, outside his home in Brooklyn in January,&nbsp;announced he would run for mayor</a>. He was immediately upstaged by his son Dante’s afro, which became instantly recognisable, and <a href=\"http://politicker.com/2013/08/fromentum-momentum-meets-social-media-backlash/\">later spawned a controversial meme</a> and earned presidential praise. Throughout the campaign, De Blasio siphoned Samson-like political strength from Dante's fro – as well as minority appeal. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.</p> <p>Despite the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fromentum&amp;src=typd\">#Fromentum</a>, it took a while for De Blasio to gain any traction in the polls, especially once a certain former congressman from Brooklyn arrived on the scene.</p> <h2>Chapter 2: Anthony Weiner enters the fray</h2> <p>This was a bad moment for De Blasio. He was supposed to be the liberal, outer-borough white-guy alternative in the race dominated by Christine Quinn, but Weiner's entrance into the Democratic primary all but edged De Blasio from the public's mind. All summer, New Yorkers gathered around their TVs and computer screens to tune into the Anthony Weiner show, as Quinn slipped to second place, and De Blasio struggled to gain ground in the press and in the polls despite outlandish publicity stunts like <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bill-de-blasio-councilman-steve-levin-arrested-lich-protest-article-1.1394816\">getting arrested at a protest</a>.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/deBlasioNYC/statuses/354979058716667904\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Taking a stand to keep community hospitals in New York City open. RT if you're united to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SaveLICH&amp;src=hash\">#SaveLICH</a>. <a href=\"http://t.co/c4AjYCsFpH\">pic.twitter.com/c4AjYCsFpH</a></p>— Bill de Blasio (@deBlasioNYC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deBlasioNYC/statuses/354979058716667904\">July 10, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>But Weiner turned out to be a blessing in disguise.</p> <h2>Chapter 3: Two words: Carlos Danger</h2> <p>We don't have to recap <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/23/anthony-weiner-huma-abedin\">what happened to Weiner</a>. We've moved on. All we're saying is that in a couple years, when this all dies down, De Blasio might want to quietly send Sydney Leathers a hand-written thank you note, and perhaps a nice Edible Arrangement.</p> <p>As soon as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/29/anthony-weiner-majority-new-yorkers-race\">Weiner plummeted in the polls</a>, the liberal-outer-borough-white-guy slot opened back up, and De Blasio moved to fill it with his 6ft 5in frame and big-picture education plans. He doubled down on his pledge to bring &quot;progressive change&quot; to New York and unite the &quot;two cities&quot;, and focused like a laser on his pitch to provide pre-kindergarten education to all New York children. It was now that the campaign's intense focus and consistent messaging finally began to pay off.</p> <h2>Chapter 4: De Blasio's ascent</h2> <p>Like the Wolfpack stumbling out of their Las Vegas hotel room, dazed and bruised and wondering what the hell they had just put themselves through, New York voters emerged from Weinergate part II looking for answers and a savior. In the immediate aftermath, they flocked to the most stable, well-known candidate in the race: city council speaker Christine Quinn. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/christine-quinn-new-york-mayoral-race'\">But Quinn was vulnerable</a>. Her numbers had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/29/anthony-weiner-mayor-race-surprises\">consistently precarious</a> throughout the race, with her unfavorable ratings high. New Yorkers were desperately seeking an alternative, and De Blasio made his move.</p> <h2>Chapter 5: Dante</h2> <p>We told you the 'fro would be back. On August 8, the De Blasio campaign released this now-famous TV ad, featuring and narrated by Dante de Blasio. It had soothing music, endearing imagery, and simple message: that Bill would be “a mayor for every New Yorker&quot;, no matter where they live and what they look like, and that under his leadership, the two cities would unite as one. New Yorkers ate it up.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgvXniTz7D8\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GgvXniTz7D8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> <figcaption>You can't say no to the 'fro</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Chapter 6: De Blasio leads the mayoral field for the first time</h2> <p>A few days later, on August 13, Quinnipiac University <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/new-york-city/release-detail?ReleaseID=1935\">dropped a bombshell</a>, with its latest poll showing De Blasio leading the pack with 30% of the vote. His commanding lead over Quinn and Bill Thompson allowed him to be taken seriously as a contender for city hall.</p> <h2>Chapter 7: The <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/mayoral-debate-puts-de-blasio-hot-seat-article-1.1433355\">second Democratic mayoral primary debate</a></h2> <p>Sensing danger, nearly all the candidates focused their attacks on De Blasio in the second mayoral debate. Thompson accused De Blasio of flip-flopping, saying: “Will the real Bill de Blasio please stand up?” All of them attempted to portray De Blasio as a man who had big ideas yet wouldn’t be able to implement them. But by this stage, New Yorkers had started to like the big ideas.</p> <p>De Blasio swatted his opponents’ attacks away, and despite many pundits declaring Quinn the winner, there was no mistaking De Blasio as the center of gravity in this debate. The dynamic carried into the third debate, but by then, De Blasio was on an unstoppable path to the general election. The only question was, who would face him in the seemingly inevitable runoff?</p> <h2>Chapter 8: Primary night</h2> <p>For over a year, nearly everyone had predicted a runoff election, which would have been triggered had no Democrat attained 40% of the vote in the primary. But de Blasio managed to squeeze past 40% and claim the nomination (Thompson contested the tally for a few days <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/nyregion/thompson-to-concede-to-de-blasio-in-mayoral-primary.html\">before ultimately conceding</a> for the sake of Democratic unity).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/joe-lhota-republican-new-york-mayor\">Joe Lhota didn’t stand a chance.</a></p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xohJj98FlG4\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xohJj98FlG4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> <figcaption>Bill de Blasio's primary night speech</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Chapter 9: Six to one</h2> <p>De Blasio probably could have run away with the general election if he’d stayed home in Park Slope for two months, bumming around in flannel and making his own artisinal pickles; in fact, he drastically reduced the number of daily campaign stops after the September 10 primary. That’s because registered Democrats outnumber their Republican counterparts six to one in this city, giving a Democratic nominee an immense home-field advantage. And for the undisputed frontrunner, fewer public appearances meant fewer chances to blow his immense lead.</p> <p>“With De Blasio having avoided a runoff, it clarified things on the Democratic side early. Republicans do well in New York City elections when the Democrats are splintered,” Lee Miringoff of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion told the Guardian earlier this week.</p> <p>Lhota chose to relentlessly attack de Blasio as lacking executive experience and being soft on crime, but New Yorkers wanted their “real progressive change.&quot; Not even accusations that De Blasio was a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/nyregion/rivals-attack-de-blasio-on-past-support-for-sandinistas.html\">Sandinista</a>, that <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2013/11/03/de-blasio-visited-communist-ussr-in-college/\">he visited the USSR</a>, that <a href=\"http://politicker.com/2013/11/belafonte-compares-koch-brothers-to-kkk-while-introducing-de-blasio/\">he campaigned with a man who compared the Koch brothers to the KKK</a>, could put the breaks on his campaign.</p> <p>And so on Tuesday night, excitedly but inevitably, Bill de Blasio ascended the podium at the YMCA in Park Slope, Brooklyn and declared: “My fellow New Yorkers: today you spoke out loudly and clearly for a new direction for our city.”</p> <p>De Blasio might have praised the city for choosing its own new path, but he'd been carefully steering them there all along.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://distilleryvesper9-5.ak.instagram.com/bd4e2bcc46b211e38da122000ab5cb2e_101.mp4\"> <iframe src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fp%2FgXUW_yqNFJ%2F&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fdistilleryimage9.ak.instagram.com%2Fbd4e2bcc46b211e38da122000ab5cb2e_8.jpg&amp;video=http%3A%2F%2Fdistilleryvesper9-5.ak.instagram.com%2Fbd4e2bcc46b211e38da122000ab5cb2e_101.mp4&amp;video_secure=true&amp;type=video%2Fmp4&amp;schema=instagram\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <figcaption>It's the best of times for Bill de Blasio.
