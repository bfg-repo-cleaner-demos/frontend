        "headline":"US spooks play into the hands of Russia, China and others who want control over global digital citizens",
        "body":"<p>No wonder Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are smiling: they are closer than they have ever been to mastering who is saying and doing what online. They and other authoritarian leaders are watching with glee as US intelligence agencies destroy what is left of the original utopian vision of a cyberspace free of government control.</p><p>The process was under way long before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/edward-snowden-nsa-testimony-germany-us-surveillance\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> revealed the extent of surveillance by the US National Security Agency. But the allegations of mass monitoring of hitherto friendly political leaders, businesses and ordinary internet users around the world have stoked a backlash with worrying consequences.</p><p>Slowly but surely governance of the internet is moving from the existing mishmash of institutions and into the hands of national governments. The Chinese call this \"cyber autonomy\".</p><p>Authoritarian regimes are showing ever-greater confidence in restricting information, filtering, blocking, monitoring and punishing anyone who steps over the mark. During a recent visit to Beijing – attending a seminar on new media at the Central Party School – I was given a remarkable insight into official thinking.</p><p>The issue is one of the most sensitive in China, going to the heart of the party's hold on power. With up to 600 million netizens – spending hours every day on the micro-blogging site <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2011/jul/15/weibo-twitter-china\" title=\"\">Weibo</a> and the messaging service <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/07/wechat-chinese-social-media-app\" title=\"\">WeChat</a> – is it still possible to control the message? The party believes it can. The exhortations were colourful: I was told that China needed to help people \"show responsibility and reasonableness\" and to \"harmonise the public and private persona, to minimise public confusion\".</p><p>After President Xi's call to \"seize the ground of new media\", a law was introduced in September to <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/china-threatens-tough-punishment-online-rumour-spreading-101715933.html\" title=\"\">punish \"wrongful rumours\" online</a>. Content that is re-posted more than 500 times or viewed more than 5,000 times could land the author in jail for up to three years. A number of well-known <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/21/china-arrest-blogger-twitter-joke\" title=\"\">bloggers have since been arrested</a>.</p><p>Reports say that China has an estimated 2 million \"internet opinion analysts\" tracking content. The boundaries for acceptable and unacceptable information are subjective. It may be patriotic to report on the corruption of certain officials; to cast aspersions on others could be a crime. Chillingly, I was told that the party is looking at an \"explicit protocol to provide for future discipline requirements\".</p><p>Given the penalties, harassment and deliberate vagueness of the boundary lines, it is remarkable that so many ordinary Chinese are as outspoken as they are. They have more to fear now than ever before.</p><p>In Russia, alongside the violence meted out to journalists – making it one of the most dangerous places for investigative reporters to operate – new <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20096274\" title=\"\">laws instigated under the guise of child protection</a> allow the authorities to close down sites immediately and force the big service providers to block access.</p><p>Other countries have imposed their own rules to promote \"responsibility\" and \"stability\". In Singapore new licensing regulations require <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2426679,00.asp\" title=\"\">news websites with more than 50,000 unique visitors a month </a>to pay a deposit then comply with takedown orders within 24 hours.</p><p>The credibility of the US to proselytise about individual rights online is pretty much shot. Its attempts to preserve the existing system of internet governance have been similarly undermined.</p><p>Until now, a number of organisations have shared responsibility: groups with an alphabet soup of acronyms, from Icann (Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers, a US-based not-for-profit organisation that assigns domains) to IGF (Internet Governance Forum, which brings together companies, civil society groups, governments and techies for an annual week of discussions on the future of the net).</p><p>At the recent <a href=\"http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/workshops2013\" title=\"\">IGF in Indonesia</a> the Chinese were, for the first time, out in force. One \"expert\" offered to explain to a US state department official why US human rights standards are not up to scratch and how China could help.</p><p>Gatherings such as these are often cumbersome, but they have the benefit of being open to all voices – multi-stakeholder in geek jargon. All this could change. Moves are afoot to give a long- established but previously low-profile UN organisation – the International Telecommunications Union – jurisdiction over the web. The ITU is the preserve of governments alone.</p><p>It is not just the Chinese and Russians who are keen on this change. India, Brazil and South Africa are among a number of emerging powers that want to prise control away from groups considered friendly to the US and towards the ITU. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/03/telecoms-unitednations\" title=\"\">most recent move, in Dubai last December, narrowly failed</a>. Thanks to the NSA furore, it will be easier next time.</p><p>Matters are likely to come to a head next April when Brazil holds a special conference focusing on securing user privacy from the prying eyes of US and other intelligence services. One idea being mooted is to require internet service providers to host data country by country, and thereby be answerable to local laws. On the one hand, this could be seen as an understandable and laudable fightback. But the Balkanisation of the net could also reinforce the control of nation states over global digital citizens.</p><p>American dominance of the internet is being challenged on several fronts. The Obama administration and its spooks only have themselves to blame. It is just possible that recent events could usher in a new era of transparency and data protection.</p><p>But don't bet on it. The direction of travel is more likely moving towards the authoritarians. As one Chinese interlocutor put it to me: \"We should cleanse negative information, which jeopardises good order.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421837892|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|207703b94578afe7de7e9b7a88565719609efb53 -->",

        "headline":"After the NSA revelations, who will listen to America on human rights?",
        "body":"<p>One of the unfortunate consequences of the spying by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\" title=\"\">NSA</a> that has now been revealed is that it makes it more difficult for the United States to be effective in promoting human rights internationally. America's ability to exercise a positive influence on the practices of other governments had been severely damaged under the Bush administration. That was because American abuses against detainees at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/guantanamo-bay\" title=\"\">Guantánamo</a> and Abu Ghraib deprived Washington of the moral authority to criticise others when they engaged in such practices as prolonged detentions without charges or trials, or trials before irregular courts, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or torture.</p><p></p><p>President Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/20/barack-obama-guantanamo-congress-veto\" title=\"\">inability to fulfil his promise to close Guantánamo</a> because of congressional opposition, and his unwillingness to hold Bush-era officials to account for their abuses, has hampered his administration in recovering lost moral authority. That may help to explain why the Obama administration has been relatively reluctant to speak out forcefully about abuses of rights by governments such as those of China and Russia. Of course, dependence on those governments economically and eagerness for their collaboration in the ongoing global struggle against terrorism were also probably factors in muting American criticism.</p><p></p><p>What the world has learned about the NSA's systematic intrusions on the privacy of others has dashed hopes that the US would gradually recover its voice in speaking out for rights. It is difficult, if not impossible, for a government that is seen by many worldwide as a great violator of rights to be credible in promoting those same rights.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the damage to American foreign policy by the practices of the NSA goes far beyond American capacity to promote human rights. Perhaps the damage in Europe has been the greatest. Europe has much stronger protections for privacy than the US, reflecting a high level of public concern. Nowhere is the commitment to privacy stronger than in Germany, where article one of the country's constitution, the Basic Law, begins with the assertion: \"Human dignity is inviolable. To respect it and protect it is the duty of all state power.\" Dignity, which also has a central place in the European charter of fundamental rights, but is not mentioned in the US constitution, is understood in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to encompass a commitment to privacy. In the absence of a clear repudiation by the Obama administration of practices of the NSA that go far beyond the requirements of national security, including a pledge to discontinue spying on European leaders, and to end indiscriminate surveillance of many millions of European citizens, it seems likely that co-operation with the United States on a host of issues will decline drastically.</p><p></p><p>The US once enjoyed a reputation as a country that respected human rights. This enhanced its political standing with other countries and gave Washington the capacity to promote these rights worldwide. Its stand on rights had been an asset; now it is turning into a liability. The main reason to respect rights, of course, is because of their intrinsic worth and significance. A secondary reason that is not negligible, however, is that America's practices on rights also have a significant impact on the country's other interests in its relations with the rest of the world.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422137029|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|798132d2f4a9dc98843b5fac4061f62110efc67e -->",

Governments and corporations are increasingly able to track people's location, associations and communications.</p><p>Existing legal frameworks were devised in an analogue age, when cross-border communication was rare and online communication and social media were unheard of. In that pre-internet age, surveillance techniques were labour-intensive and time-consuming, which helped to constrain arbitrary and abusive practices. The law has to catch up.</p><p>A good place to start would be <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/applying-human-rights-law-to-state-23-09-2013,45214.html\" title=\"\">a set of principles</a> unveiled in September by a coalition of non-governmental groups and technology experts aimed at keeping communications surveillance lawful, necessary, proportionate, and subject to adequate safeguards against abuse.</p><p>The EU is sensitive to data protection by private actors, and has set the global standard in regulations to ensure people have control over what data they give to companies and how those companies use it. But lawmakers and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have much more to do.</p><p>When it comes to European governments' demands for access to data, which companies must retain for a substantial period, oversight standards are quite relaxed. The US, in turn, has left data privacy regulation to its 50 states, resulting in a cacophony of rules.</p><p>It's time for governments to come clean about their practices, and not wait for the newest revelations. All should acknowledge a global obligation to protect everyone's privacy, clarify the limits on their own surveillance practices (including surveillance of people outside their own borders), and ensure they don't trade mass surveillance data to evade their own obligations. Of course it is important to protect security, but western allies should agree that mass, rather than narrowly targeted, surveillance is never a normal or proportionate measure in a democracy.</p><p>Washington is finally grappling with the Snowden revelations, holding hearings and considering legislation that might help to rein in the NSA's seemingly unconstrained power. Some of these bills would limit or end bulk data collection, institute greater transparency, and give the secret court that oversees surveillance requests a more adversarial character. These are important proposals, but none include protection for non-Americans abroad. The US has the capacity to routinely invade the digital lives of people the world over, but it barely recognises any privacy interest of those outside the US.</p><p>Every country thus has an interest in seeing the US rein in the NSA and oversee its surveillance operations effectively. And as one revelation after another shows that the data of US-based internet companies is not secure from NSA prying, they too face an imperative to restore consumer trust by pressing for stronger privacy protections. If Washington won't listen to foreigners, at least it might listen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/04/eric-schmidt-nsa-spying-data-centres-outrageous\" title=\"\">to its own companies</a>, who risk severe damage to their overseas businesses.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422116829|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|c8ed3718cb714cf93f292301e8fbf33bf5701660 -->",

        "headline":"Tim Berners-Lee: encryption cracking by spy agencies 'appalling and foolish'",
        "body":"<p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the computer scientist who created the world wide web, has called for a \"full and frank public debate\" over internet surveillance by the National Security Agency and its British counterpart, GCHQ, warning that the system of checks and balances to oversee the agencies has failed.</p><p>As the inventor of the global system of inter-connectivity known as the web, with its now ubiquitous www and http, Berners-Lee is uniquely qualified to comment on the internet spying revealed by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</p><p>In an interview with the Guardian, he expressed particular outrage that GCHQ and the NSA had weakened online security by cracking much of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security\" title=\"\">online encryption</a> on which hundreds of millions of users rely to guard data privacy.</p><p>He said the agencies' decision to break the encryption software was appalling and foolish, as it directly contradicted efforts of the US and UK governments to fight cybercrime and cyberwarfare, which they have identified as a national security priority. Berners-Lee also said it was a betrayal of the technology industry.</p><p>In contrast to several senior British politicians – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/david-cameron-nsa-threat-newspapers-guardian-snowden\" title=\"\">including the prime minister, David Cameron</a> – who have called for the Guardian to be investigated over reporting of the Snowden leaks, Berners-Lee sees the news organisation and Snowden as having acted in the public interest.</p><p>\"Whistleblowers, and responsible media outlets that work with them, play an important role in society. We need powerful agencies to combat criminal activity online – but any powerful agency needs checks and balances and, based on recent revelations, it seems the current system of checks and balances has failed,\" he said.</p><p>The damning assessment was given as the heads of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 prepared to face questioning by MPs in the Commons on Thursday. In an unprecedented hearing in Westminster, questions over the conduct of Britain's spy agencies will be raised when the heads of the three secret services go before parliament's intelligence and security committee.</p><p>The 90-minute session will give the nine-strong committee, led by Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a chance to question the agencies about the reach of the mass surveillance programmes that have provoked a global debate about privacy in the internet age. While critics have often despaired of the ISC's lack of clout, Rifkind has promised to use new powers to provide robust scrutiny of the agencies and restore public confidence in what they have been doing.</p><p>As the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that seeks to forward global standards for the web, Berners-Lee is a leading authority on the power and the vulnerabilities of the internet.</p><p>He said the Guardian's coverage of the Snowden leaks had to be seen within the context of the failure of oversight of GCHQ's and the NSA's surveillance activities. \"Here is where whistleblowing and responsible reporting can step in to protect society's interests.</p><p>\"It seems clear that the Guardian's reporting around the scale and scope of state surveillance has been in the public interest and has uncovered many important issues which now need a full and frank public debate.\"</p><p>Talking in his office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Berners-Lee said that though he had anticipated many of the surveillance activities exposed by Snowden, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\" title=\"\">taps on the internet through the Prism program</a>, he had not been prepared for the scale of the NSA/GCHQ operations. \"I didn't realise it would be so big,\" he said.</p><p>At worst, such spying could damage the public's confidence in the intimate privacy of the internet as a free and safe place to interact. \"When you take away the safe space, you take away a lot of the power of human problem solving,\" he warned.</p><p>Berners-Lee will mark the 25th anniversary of his invention of the web next year by campaigning for greater public awareness of threats to the internet and by pushing for a charter that would codify the rights of all its users. As head of the World Wide Web Foundation, on 22 November he will release the <a href=\"http://thewebindex.org/\" title=\"\">2013 Web Index</a>, which measures the web's growth, utility and impact across about 80 countries – including indicators on censorship and surveillance.</p><p>The scientist, who was honoured in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics, reserved his harshest words for GCHQ and the NSA's undermining of the protection afforded by encryption, which he said would benefit organised criminal hacker gangs and hostile states.</p><p>\"In a totalitarian state where it reckoned it was the only strong state in the world, I can imagine that being a reasonable plan. But in this situation, internet security is hard. It's naïve to imagine that if you introduce a weakness into a system you will be the only one to use it.\"</p><p>He also criticised the cracking of encryption on ethical grounds: \"Any democratic country has to take the high road; it has to live by its principles. I'm very sympathetic to attempts to increase security against organised crime, but you have to distinguish yourself from the criminal.\"</p><p>Berners-Lee said that the series of Snowden disclosures revealed a failure at the heart of oversight in both the US and UK governments, which he called \"dysfunctional and unaccountable\". The leaked documents raised the question: who guards the guards themselves?</p><p>In practice, he said, the only practical answer to that question was the whistleblowers. He called for the introduction of an international system of protection for whistleblowers such as Snowden, who has taken a year's temporary refuge in Russia.</p><p>The Obama administration has pursued official leakers heavily, launching eight prosecutions under the 1917 Espionage Act including that of Snowden himself – more than twice the total number under all previous presidents.</p><p>\"Civilisation has to a certain extent depended on whistleblowers, and therefore you have to protect them,\" Berners-Lee said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421841192|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|37ffbf164879c084e82155fcd4b0b37cb801492d -->",

        "body":"<p>The authors of <a href=\"http://www.ceps.eu/book/mass-surveillance-personal-data-eu-member-states-and-its-compatibility-eu-law\" title=\"\">a new study on mass-scale surveillance </a>have accused the intelligence services of the US and EU countries of violating European law and urged the European parliament to take action.</p><p>Sergio Carrera, a Spanish jurist, and Francesco Ragazzi, a professor of international relations at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who co-wrote the paper, made the appeal for European action at a hearing in the EU parliament in Brussels on Thursday.</p><p>They said the US National Security Agency (NSA), the UK's GCHQ and equivalent bodies in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden had breached basic articles of the EU treaty, such as article 4.3 on \"sincere co-operation\", as well as privacy clauses in the EU charter of fundamental values and in the European charter of fundamental rights.</p><p>They also noted that EU agencies such as the joint police body, Europol, and the EU foreign service's intelligence-sharing branch, IntCen, were in all likelihood using data \"stolen\" from European citizens.</p><p>\"It's no longer credible to say the EU has no legal competence and should do nothing on this. Sorry, we don't think this is acceptable,\" Carrera said.</p><p>\"We are witnessing a systematic breach of people's fundamental rights,\" he added.</p><p>Ragazzi said: \"The bigger the crisis, the more the system of checks and balances should be reinforced. This is what distinguishes democracies from police states.\"</p><p>The idea that espionage is a national prerogative has been widely used to deflect EU queries into the scandal.</p><p>The British ambassador to the EU, Sir John Cunliffe, in a letter to the EU parliament last month said the GCHQ chief, Sir Iain Lobban, had no obligation to answer MEPs' questions because \"national security is the sole responsibility of member states\".</p><p>But Carrera and Ragazzi urged MEPs to use \"all the powers at their disposal\" to break the wall of silence.</p><p>They said the EU parliament should threaten to block an EU-US free trade agreement unless the NSA and GCHQ disclose the full nature of their surveillance programmes.</p><p>They said MEPs should push EU countries to draft a \"professional code for the transnational management of data\".</p><p>They also called for new EU laws to stop internet companies giving information to intelligence services, to protect whistleblowers such as the NSA leaker Edward Snowden, and to form a permanent oversight body on intelligence matters.</p><p>Snowden's revelations show that GCHQ alone hoovers up 21 petabytes of internet data each day, while the NSA has forced private companies such as Facebook to hand over customers' files.</p><p>A senior Facebook executive, Erika Mann, was due to attend the EU hearing on Thursday but cancelled at the last minute citing agenda problems.</p><p>The head of IntCen, the former Finnish spy chief Ilkka Salmi, spoke in a closed session on Thursday morning, but said only – according to one MEP – that it was \"natural\" that intelligence services intercepted their own citizens' emails and phone calls.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421928957|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|c04b81d54398e39bbff08bfe6642485e7bf9e0d9 -->",

        "body":"<p>The former legal chief of MI5 and MI6 told a hearing at the European parliament that Britain should adopt a French model of judicial oversight of the intelligence agencies to limit abuse.</p><p>Speaking to MEPs at a European parliament hearing in Brussels on Thursday , David Bickford, who held his post from 1986 to 1995, rejected a \"root and branch\" reform of intelligence laws or the creation of new national or EU-level oversight committees in reaction to the Edward Snowden scandal. He said MI5 and MI6 needed the means to hunt criminals who \"have access to the most sophisticated forms of communication\".</p><p>\"If the number of regulations proliferate … you will stifle the agencies and you will not be protected,\" he said.</p><p>But he said the British system, in which government ministers authorise covert surveillance operations and MPs look into cases of abuse \"<em>ex post facto</em>\" is \"not adequate,\" however. The French model, in which a judge weighs up national security needs against people's rights \"at the coalface\" of individual operations is the best compromise, he said. The system \"allows intelligence agencies to do their work while limiting the margins for abuse\", Bickford said.</p><p>At the EU hearing, privacy advocates and jurists voiced outrage at Snowden's revelations that US, British, Dutch, French, German and Swedish intelligence services routinely snoop on millions of European citizens.</p><p>\"We need to ban mass surveillance. I just don't see how that's compatible with human rights,\" Gus Hosein, the head of the London-based NGO, Privacy International, said.</p><p>\"In the 1990s we said the internet was the new Wild West. Now we have government actions as the Wild West,\" he added.</p><p>\"The suspicions of economic espionage are very serious here,\" said Iain Cameron, a legal expert attached to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p><p>Earlier, two academics who co-authored a <a href=\"http://www.ceps.eu/book/mass-surveillance-personal-data-eu-member-states-and-its-compatibility-eu-law\" title=\"\">new study on mass surveillance</a>, said the activity <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nsa-gchq-surveillance-european-law-report\" title=\"\">violates European law and called on MEPs to take action</a>.</p><p>They said the EU and US \"transnational guilds\" of spies have breached basic articles of the EU treaty, such as article 4.3 on \"sincere co-operation,\" as well as privacy clauses in the EU charter of fundamental values and in the European charter of fundamental rights.</p><p>They also noted that EU agencies, such as the joint police body, Europol, and the EU foreign service's intelligence-sharing branch, IntCen, are in all likelihood using data \"stolen\" from European citizens.</p><p>\"It's no longer credible to say the EU has no legal competence and should do nothing on this,\" one of the two, Spanish jurist Sergio Carrera, said.</p><p>The study urges MEPs to block an EU-US free trade agreement unless the US and EU countries disclose the full nature of their surveillance activities.</p><p>It also says MEPs should push EU countries to draft a \"professional code for the transnational management of data\" and set up a permanent intelligence oversight body at EU level.</p><p>But Ian Leigh, a law professor at Durham University, joined Bickford in pouring cold water on the ideas.</p><p>He said the reality of intelligence co-operation is that countries do it bilaterally or in \"tight\" groups instead of using EU structures.</p><p>He added that national legislatures or expert committees are the only ones who have the legal mandate and the \"trust\" for intelligence services to work with them in a meaningful way.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421956142|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|dbeece872ec13b750541e3ed2af6a1aa1cd34b45 -->",

Al-Qaida is lapping it up\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nsa-leaks-enemies-rubbing-hands-glee-mi6\" title=\"\">British spy chiefs vent fury at leaks</a>, 8 November). Doubtless they also lapped up the revelations of British involvement in extraordinary rendition, security service participation in torture of detainees, and the unlawful killings documented during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/al-sweady-inquiry\" title=\"\">Al-Sweady inquiry</a>. However, if our security services consistently traduce the values they claim to defend, the responsibility for any benefit accruing to al-Qaida lies with the security forces, not with those who expose their actions and their hypocrisy. It's clear Sawers and his ilk use secrecy to commit grotesque abuses of the principles they purport to uphold. Little wonder they fear exposure.<br /><strong>Nick Moss</strong><br /><em>London</em></p><p></p><p>• The Guardian has done an excellent job of bringing the Snowden revelations into the public arena, such that meaningful debate can take place about what we are willing to tolerate as a society. This and many other actions by government are excused on the basis that they are required to stop terrorist attacks on our country. I think it is time for an equally open debate about why this threat exists. What are we doing that people are willing to risk or even give up their lives to stop? Let's ask the people we are afraid of to explain why they hate us so much. The truth may be uncomfortable, but at least we can discuss more effective ways of getting to the root causes of the problem.<br /><strong>Jim Pettman</strong><br /><em>Anglars-Juillac, France</em></p><p></p><p>• Your leader (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/07/yasser-arafat-from-beyond-the-grave?commentpage=1\" title=\"\">8 November</a>) makes the point that assassination \"only works if there are no consequences [for the assassins]\". A point well illustrated by the ongoing use of drones as blunt instruments of assassination by people who make precisely that assumption.<br /><strong>Jon Bell</strong><br /><em>Machynlleth, Powys</em></p><p></p><p>• According to the heads of our intelligence services, al-Qaida and its subsidiary organisations were completely unaware of how their communications were accessed by the agencies until the publication of Edward Snowden's leaks. Obviously Frederick Forsyth's latest work is not available in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen etc.<br /><strong>Brian Hartigan</strong><br /><em>Banstead, Surrey</em></p><p></p><p>• Who would readers most prefer to be deeply involved in the nation's security: Lobban, Parker and Sawers, or Greenwald, Rusbridger and Snowden? The Guardian should hang its head in shame at the way it has tried to vilify our security personnel and beatify the leakers.<br /><strong>Robert Carlin</strong><br /><em>Leeds</em></p><p></p><p>• My wife, who grew up in communist Poland, said watching the three heads at the parliamentary committee reminded her of the nonsense she would hear from Polish government officials. The only difference is the language.<br /><strong>Dominic Tkaczyk</strong><br /><em>Welwyn, Hertfordshire</em></p><p></p><p>• The spooks' appearance before Malcolm Rifkind's committee was akin to facing underarm bowling in the nets. In future they should appear before Margaret Hodge's committee, where she leads with a range of fast bowling and googlies more suited to these slippery characters.<br /><strong>Les Bright</strong><br /><em>Exeter, Devon</em></p><p></p><p>• It beggars belief that while most government services are mired in waste and incompetence – from the MoD to universal credit, from the Border Agency to the NHS – the secret services, alone, sail serenely above it all, unsullied and unique. They never make a mistake, never put a foot wrong and, of course, are never subject to proper public scrutiny.<br /><strong>Ian Martin</strong><br /><em>Falmouth, Cornwall</em></p><p></p><p>• Now we've seen the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, it is ironic that in the 1930s people fleeing persecution in Germany came to Britain. Today people take refuge in Germany to avoid prosecution in Britain. How times have changed in 80 years.<br /><strong>LJS Lesley</strong><br /><em>Liverpool</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422035716|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|cc80c3b9671ca1c15443426520ee80389ef5ed27 -->",

        "headline":"British spymasters let their frustrations show but explanations remain hidden",
        "body":"<p>Five months ago, the heads of Britain's spy services would probably have had little appetite for appearing before a parliamentary committee to talk about their work.</p><p>But in some respects Thursday's session in front of the intelligence and security committee could not have come a moment too soon for them; here, at last, a platform from which to vent a summer of pent-up frustration at the leaks from Edward Snowden, to a group of MPs and peers only prepared to soft-mouth them during 90 minutes of questions and answers.</p><p>The chiefs did not miss the opportunity to make their point, though critics of the ISC will wonder how they were allowed to say so much without being challenged more robustly – and why certain issues were avoided completely.</p><p>As head of GCHQ, Sir Iain Lobban had the most to get off his chest. He didn't name Snowden or any of the media groups across the world that have published stories on his documents when he made the most startling assertion of the session.</p><p>But with oblique references to stories in the Guardian and the New York Times about how GCHQ and America's National Security Agency have worked to undermine commercial encryption packages, he said these disclosures had made life easier for terrorists, who had been alerted to these secret initiatives and are now trying to find new methods to communicate.</p><p>Paradoxically, he said he knew this because British agents were still listening to them: \"What we have seen over the last five months is near-daily discussion among our targets. We have seen terrorist groups in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and elsewhere in south Asia discussing the revelations in specific terms, in terms of the communications packages they use, the communications packages they wish to move to.</p><p>\"We have actually seen chat around specific terrorist groups, including closer to home, discussing how to avoid what they now perceive to be vulnerable communications methods or how to select communications which they now perceive not to be exploitable.\"</p><p>Sir John Sawers, head of MI6 and very much the leader of this pack,  added: \"Our adversaries are rubbing their hands with glee. Al-Qaida is lapping this up.\"</p><p>Neither Lobban nor Sawers were asked about the damage that had been done by western intelligence efforts to weaken encryption standards in the first place – and how numerous experts have said this has made it easier for criminals, terrorists and other hostile states to hack into sensitive material owned by those who rely on this software to keep their secrets safe.</p><p>There was no mention, either, of a leak to the US media in August that American officials said had done <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html?_r=2&amp;\" title=\"\">much more damage than anything published by Snowden</a>.  Analysts had detected a sharp drop in communications between al-Qaida terrorists when it emerged in reports the US had intercepted messages between Ayman al-Zawahiri, who succeeded Osama bin Laden as the head of al–Qaida, and another al-Qaida leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi. One United States official, quoted by the New York Times, said of the communications: \"The switches weren't turned off, but there has been a real decrease in quality.\"</p><p>None of the chiefs were asked to comment on the analysis of Peter Swire, a former White House chief privacy counsellor and now on President Obama's review panel of the NSA, who says agency claims of their world \"going dark\" have to be treated with scepticism, because setbacks in some areas are \"more than offset by surveillance gains from computing and communications technology\".</p><p>Closer to home, the former home secretary David Blunkett this week urged a healthy degree of caution when it comes to the claims of the agencies, because in his experience, they tend to \"get carried away\".</p><p>The Snowden documents revealed that GCHQ, by undertaking technically brilliant but potentially intrusive mass surveillance programmes, now believes it is in a \"golden age\". But Lobban was not asked to explain how his agency has reached this point, or why the public – and indeed members of the ISC – had not been told about all the capabilities he says the agencies now rely on.</p><p>Asked whether he would now disclose them to the committee, Lobban said he would – in private – though during the entire public session neither he nor any member of the ISC mentioned Tempora at all. This is the programme that allows GCHQ to suck up vast amounts of data from the cables that carry internet traffic in and out of the country, information that is analysed and shared with the NSA.</p><p>Neither Lobban, Sawers nor the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, wanted to accept there was any necessity for the public to know about this kind of activity, or acknowledge the concerns there may be about the reach of such a powerful capability, or what laws are being used to justify its use.</p><p>Lobban did not deny GCHQ was collating vast amounts of information, but he said his teams were \"motivated by finding terrorists and serious criminals\".  He said: \"We don't want to delve into innocent emails and phone calls.\"</p><p>This depiction of programmes as benign entities was accepted without question by the committee, but it did not explain why the ISC had not been told about Tempora in the first place, or why, as Chris Huhne revealed, neither the cabinet nor the National Security Council were informed about it either.</p><p>During the only exchanges where the chiefs were really pressed, there was some begrudging acceptance from them that it might be better for the agencies if they were a little more transparent – that the laws which permit them to do what they do should be updated, and that the scrutiny could be tougher.</p><p>Lord Butler, the former cabinet secretary, asked them: \"Can you see why it is that the public feel that when the last bit of legislation on this was passed in 2000, and technology has moved on so fast and your capabilities have developed so hugely, that it is hardly credible that this legislation is fit for purpose in the modern world?\"</p><p>Parker said the public didn't really understand the \"combination of arrangements\" that keep the agencies honest, though he did concede that \"we are going down the road of more openness\".</p><p>Sawers and Lobban appeared more prepared to contemplate changes in the legal framework. \"If there are changes in the law, so be it,\" said the head of GCHQ. \"You set the law and we will work within it,\" added Sawers.</p><p>Over 90 minutes, those who have attacked Snowden were armed with more ammunition. Those who were hoping for a valued contribution to a more rounded debate about privacy and surveillance in the internet age, and the balance between the public's right to know and the agencies' need to keep secrets, may feel they were short-changed.</p><p>\"They faced a grilling that wouldn't have scared a puppy,\" said Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty. \"It was tame, predictable, and limp,\" said Privacy International.</p><p>Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, added: \"As the US president, world leaders and international experts express concern about the scale of surveillance and the need to review the laws and policies involved, today was perhaps more unique for the fact parliament found three people who think there is no need for reform.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421949306|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|6d5d7c712171009d278d59ae646319e0820761ed -->",

        "headline":"Spy chiefs can give evidence without the sky falling in – so let's reform oversight",
        "body":"<p>It wasn't only the security chiefs being scrutinised, but those conducting the scrutiny. Now that we have been granted a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nsa-leaks-enemies-rubbing-hands-glee-mi6\" title=\"\">glimpse into the activity of the intelligence and security committee</a>, do we feel reassured they were doing the job that we need them to do, to assure ourselves that oversight worked? Many of us could reasonably be sceptical of a committee handpicked by the prime minister, and which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/mi6-licence-to-kill-and-torture\" title=\"\">made mistakes over extraordinary rendition</a>.</p><p>It is of course welcome that this session happened at all: 38 years after the CIA director first gave public evidence to Congress, we are finally catching up. However, from my own select committee experience, what occurred on Thursday seemed more like a cosy chat. Nevertheless, it ought to establish the principle that security chiefs can give evidence in public without the sky falling in, and I look forward to them appearing before the home affairs select committee in our counter-terrorism work.</p><p>But this initial session has been useful. Journalists, commentators and bloggers will be poring over each sentence uttered. This sort of public scrutiny is exactly what we need to restore confidence in our intelligence service, whose work keeps us safe. It does make you wonder why this should have been such a massive event: shouldn't public scrutiny be at the heart of the way our intelligence and security service operates anyway?</p><p>Of course, sometimes it will be necessary to hold private sessions but this should be the exception. Some have argued that the very nature of the intelligence and security services means that there has to be a great deal of secrecy, but I am not asking for details to be discussed, just principles. Should we be spying on our own citizens? Is it reasonable and proportionate that every click we make online is monitored and saved for an eventuality that may never come? Is it right and proper that we spy on our allies, tapping into their personal phones? Can our embassies be used as listening posts? These questions can be debated at length and should be debated in public.</p><p>I recently held a parliamentary debate on oversight of the intelligence and security services. It was incredibly well attended and views from every side were represented. I did not agree with all of them, and some of the things that were suggested were frankly ridiculous. But one key point that did emerge was a general agreement from across the divide of opinions that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">Snowden leaks</a> demonstrate the NSA is insecure and can't protect its own information. If it is true that what was leaked contained information that was directly damaging to our security, as opposed to just being very embarrassing, why were hundreds of thousands of contractors able to access it all? Why were names of UK agents so widely available?</p><p>We should be relieved that this information went to the Guardian, which has made a point of publishing carefully and responsibly. The NSA and British agencies should be thanking the Guardian for its hard work.</p><p>What we need now is substantial reform of our oversight mechanisms. The ISC must become a creature of parliament, not the executive, and be furnished with the resources needed. But we also need an independent body – perhaps like President Obama's privacy and oversight board, which includes civil society representatives. We need more transparency about what sort of information companies are required to provide, and the legal basis for the actions of the intelligence and security agencies. We are also dealing with outdated, over-broad and excessively complex legislation – this needs an independent review.</p><p>On Thursday the agency heads said: \"You set the law. We will work within the framework of the law.\" So let us work to ensure we can have confidence in the laws we have put in place.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421950903|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|d6533fb24ecc501a9435fa0b10bbde18b5494330 -->",

        "body":"<p>Another historic milestone in the battle for parliamentary oversight was passed when Britain's spy chiefs summoned a committee of MPs and peers to justify their behaviour and reassure the public they are not a threat to national security.</p><p>To the average Ukip voter watching on almost-live TV, the nine members of the intelligence and security committee (ISC) must have looked a shifty bunch. The chairman, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, is a Scot, so he must be some kind of traitor. Labour's George Howarth sports a beard (communist?). Tory Mark Field was born in Germany (Hun?).</p><p>As for that Hazel Blears ( \"His and Hers\" as Sir Malcolm called her in his rough Edinburgh accent), she rides a motorbike. Yes, there is plenty there for the spook community to get their digital teeth into.</p><p>Obviously it would have been more appropriate if the committee had been kitted out in orange jump suits and taken to M16 HQ at Vauxhall Cross or to GCHQ in Cheltenham for their interrogation. But constitutional niceties must be respected, so the three intelligence chiefs came to Westminster's Boothroyd Room and pretended to be grilled by the ISC. Even then they insisted on a two-minute TV pause button in case anyone blurted out a SECRET.</p><p>Fat chance. A slice of the session was devoted to the sensitive question of whether or not any of Britain's \"security partners\" – a more comforting label than \"Pakistani intelligence\" – ever mistreat or even torture suspects arrested on MI6's say-so. Not these days, the squeamish politicians were assured, although hints were dropped that things weren't perfect after 9/11.</p><p>It can be more confidently stated that no one was mistreated or tortured during Thursday's chat, which made Sir David Frost's gentle sofa technique look like the Gestapo's Klaus Barbie. \"Sir John, do you want to say anything?\" Sir Malcolm asked Sir John Sawers of M16. \"Just to add my support to what Sir Iain [Lobban of GCHQ] and Andrew [M15's Parker] have said.\" It was like listening to old BBC output: \"Is there anything you'd like to tell us, Mr Attlee?\" \"No.\"</p><p>Sawers, Lobban and Parker were what TV crews called \"doughnutted\" by a wholesome cross-section of citizens who looked as if they were up from Cheltenham for the day. Like ordinary members of the public (the cunning of it) all wore poppies believed to be able to fire 1,700 rounds a minute if anyone blurted out a SECRET or even hurled a pie, as happened to Rupert Murdoch.</p><p>No one did either as the spooks made their daylight debut, a trio of Draculas in the winter sun. Sir Malcolm may have dreamed of appearing with a long-haired white cat in his lap (\"this committee has ways of making you talk, Mr Parker. My associate, Sir Ming Campbell, is not as sweet as he looks\"), but thought better of it, though he did prod them a bit. So did Ming and Biker Blears. No, no, no, the chiefs replied to every prod.</p><p></p><p>In this very British tea and crumpets atmosphere opacity was all. The whistleblower Edward Snowden was not mentioned until 3.09 (long after James Bond's namecheck), the Guardian not at all, though Sawers put the boot in over media leaks (\"al-Qaida are lapping it up\" he said) and Lobban, the one you might not want to meet after dark, got quietly angry about it. Parker was more sorrowful, perhaps because his knighthood has been lost in the post.</p><p>Watching voters must have noticed that the trio slid over past intelligence gaffes, their failure to predict 9/11 or the Arab spring. \"Why did you fail to notice the second world war until 1943, Sir John?\" \"We are not crystal ball gazers.\"</p><p>They also felt sorry for themselves. Digital technology has made their carpeted lives and £2bn budget so much harder than it has for bearded Islamist boys in their stinking caves. Politicians make the rules, we just obey them, they said.</p><p>OK, if you say so, though it sounded like buck-passing. But Sir Malcolm won't tell: it's a SECRET.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421968599|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|405e270aab9efbdc6a9a0b6d073cde140238c290 -->",

        "body":"<p>Spies are, by profession and training, required to keep their cool in tight corners. The three security chiefs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nsa-leaks-enemies-rubbing-hands-glee-mi6\" title=\"\">who appeared before parliament's intelligence and security committee </a>today did not break into sweat. But the session – the first to be televised – was by no stretch of the imagination a tight corner. There was no Bond villain, no white cat, no steel-rimmed bowler hats – just a gentle 90 minutes of polite questioning in which little was demanded or gleaned. The afternoon came briefly to life only when the spies united to identify the real bad guys: the media.</p><p>The fact that the intelligence chiefs are now required to come out in public and speak about what they do is obviously a step in the right direction. And it is only fair to acknowledge that the ISC has more powers and resources than once it had. But, as a genuine exercise in transparency, the event seemed stilted, restricted, sometimes coded and more than a little stage-managed.</p><p>There were many reassurances offered: the agencies are excellent value for money; they operate within the law; they are successfully adapting to changing technologies; and they reject any accusations of intelligence failures or improper behaviour. No MP or peer seriously tested any of these assertions. Nor – in public at least – was it possible to query the eye-catching claim that terrorists were \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nsa-leaks-enemies-rubbing-hands-glee-mi6\" title=\"\">rubbing their hands in glee</a>\" at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">Snowden allegations</a>. In private, some members of the committee voice concern about the scope and interpretation of laws under which the services operate and their limited knowledge of specific programmes which have recently made front-page news around the world. But these worries were, at best, hinted at.</p><p>An American or European visitor would have been most struck by what the committee did not ask: it barely touched on the substantive issues raised by the Snowden documents. It skated over any serious questioning about the complex issues to do with mass surveillance, civil liberties or privacy. There were no questions about GCHQ's reported involvement in agencies helping themselves to traffic between Google data servers. There was nothing on the bugging of world leaders who might be considered allies, not enemies. Nothing on the reliance on corporate partners – \"well beyond\" what they are legally required to do. And nothing on the issue <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/tim-berners-lee-encryption-spy-agencies\" title=\"\">raised by Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> – the \"appalling and foolish\" weakening of internet encryption with potentially terrible consequences for individuals and businesses. These matters have been widely discussed in this country, including in such subversive journals as the FT and the Economist. Indeed, they have been debated in every serious newspaper and legislature in the world. They will become manifest in reformed laws, treaties and alliances. But there was little suggestion today that much of this was of true concern.</p><p>Instead there was a kick at the \"global media\". Let us be clear. The loss of Snowden's material was plainly damaging for western intelligence. The disaster was that the US agencies have, for the second time in three years, proved incapable of keeping enormous secret databases secure. After WikiLeaks it is astonishing that 850,000 people worldwide were able to peer into the heart of secret operations in Cheltenham. No NSA official has apologised or resigned for this devastating failure and there were only the mildest questions today as to why GCHQ went along with these bizarre arrangements. The intelligence agencies were saved from true catastrophe by only one thing: the fact that Snowden didn't dump the material on to the web, but handed it instead to journalists. Together with the New York Times and Washington Post, we have worked carefully and responsibly (in consultation with governments and agencies) to disclose a small proportion of what he leaked. Some would like newspapers gagged or prosecuted. Be careful what you wish for. Kick newspapers by all means, but, without them, be prepared for something much worse.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421966151|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|e28d7388bc2f82af2952b13abbceeaeed429af81 -->",

        "headline":"UK intelligence chiefs get off scot-free in grilling on NSA leaks",
        "body":"<p>In their carefully choreographed first public session, MPs and peers on the parliamentary's intelligence and security committee ranged predictably, and thinly, over the work of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.</p><p>Andrew Parker, the new head of MI5, had the air of someone who wanted to go on, and on, emphasising the (genuine) threats posed by potential terrorists. Sir Iain Lobban, head of GCHQ – the electronic eavesdropping agency at the heart of the Edward Snowden allegations, seemed full of venom towards the leakers and the newspapers, notably the Guardian, which revealed the enormous capabilities of his agency and its close partner, America's NSA, but unable to spit it out.</p><p>It was left to Sir John Sawers, the smooth chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6, to deliver the soundbite.</p><p>\"What I can tell you is that the leaks from Snowden have been very damaging; they have put our operations at risk. It is clear that our adversaries are rubbing their hands with glee. Al-Qaida is lapping it up,\" he told the committee. As a result, he added, \"it becomes more difficult to acquire the intelligence that this country needs\".</p><p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who realised that the credibility of his committee was on trial, asked his three witnesses to give some \"specific examples\". Lobban, who earlier talked about damage done by the leaks, replied that he could only give examples in private.</p><p>The committee's big failure was not to probe the witnesses at all on the allegations of mass, giant-computer-driven, surveillance operations of GCHQ and NSA. The agencies are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-reports-nsa-secretly-intercepts-data-links\" title=\"\">reported to have the ability to intercept the main communication links that carry the users' data for big internet companies</a>  such as Google and Yahoo. This strikes at the very heart of the unaccountable power of GCHQ – and the NSA – to invade personal privacy. It is an issue that has provoked outrage in many quarters in the US, in Germany, and in other countries, but not, it seems, very much in Britain.</p><p>And, it seemed, the members of the committee did not begin to understand the significance of such invasion of personal privacy and the links between GCHQ, the NSA and Silicon Valley.</p><p>Lobban repeated the comparison of trying to look for needles in haystacks. The vast majority of the communication would be discarded. How do we know? Because you can trust his staff.</p><p>Rifkind sensibly asked what his witnesses thought about the NSA sharing sensitive GCHQ information with \"a junior clerk\" – ie Snowden. We know that the NSA shares such information with more than 800,000 people. Parker replied simply that UK agencies have vetting procedures. He added: \"I can't comment on US arrangements.\"</p><p>The committee members could scarcely avoid the allegations – indeed evidence – that MI6 and MI5 had colluded with the CIA over the abuse and torture of terror suspects. MI6 was involved in the rendition of two prominent Libyan dissidents who were subsequently tortured by Muammar Gaddafi's secret police.</p><p>Sawers was quick to emphasise, more than once, that in potentially difficult cases his officers always consulted ministers. Any changes in the law covering their activities were also entirely a matter for ministers.</p><p>Asked why the intelligence agencies had not foreseen the end of the cold war, the 9/11 attacks and the Arab spring, Sawers said the agencies were \"not crystal-ball gazers\".</p><p>The witnesses thus got off scot-free. They did reveal, however, that whether the line between secrecy and transparency should be redrawn was being \"actively considered\". In private, of course.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422002787|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|cd0a94e1de7a5acdb684a0a1d68dc7e3049554eb -->",

        "body":"<p>Ahead of Thursday's appearance of Britain's three chief spooks before the Commons intelligence and security committee, the Guardian set out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/10-questions-intelligence-agency-chiefs\" title=\"\">10 questions that they should be asked</a>.</p><p>Only three of the key questions were directly asked by the committee. Some of the questions were broadly alluded to, but the MPs favoured general soft questions rather than forensic probing.</p><p>The MPs' performance on the key questions is detailed below, with the response from Sir Iain Lobban, director of GCHQ; Sir John Sawers head of MI6, and Andrew Parker head of MI5.</p><p><strong>1 Should Britain's intelligence agencies become more transparent to encourage greater public confidence, and if so how?</strong></p><p>Former Labour minister Hazel Blears asked: \"Is there the possibility to have a more informed dialogue with the public?\"</p><p>Lobban replied: \"The pat answer is that there are very good safeguards in place … If your activities pose a genuine threat to the national or economic security of the United Kingdom there is a possibility that your communications will be monitored, as in we will seek to read, we will seek to listen to you. If you are not, and you are not in contact with one of those people, then you won't be, and we are not entitled to.\"</p><p>Parker added: \"The issue about balancing powers and transparency … are matters principally for ministers to lead on and for parliament to set law about, that we then abide by.\"</p><p><strong>2 Why weren't the cabinet and the National Security Council allowed to know about GCHQ's mass surveillance programmes?</strong></p><p>Not asked</p><p><strong>3 Why have the agencies resisted calls for an overhaul and updating of surveillance laws? </strong></p><p>Sir Menzies Campbell asked: \"Is the existing legal framework adequate to deal with the enormous consequences of the revolution in technology?\"</p><p>Lobban replied: \"The laws were drafted to be technology neutral. I think the draftsmen did a pretty good job. [The law] insists upon necessity and proportionality. They are as relevant now as when the laws were drafted. They guide the way that we work … But if Parliament chooses to have a debate, that's fine by me … I want to stress the role of [intelligence] commissioners. As technology moves on, we talk to them about our methods.\"</p><p><strong>4 What action, if any, has been taken to reduce the number of people (estimated to be 850,000 employees and contractors) who have access to the secret material uncovered by the Guardian?</strong></p><p>Committee chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind asked: \"Can we assume that you are having discussions with the your American colleagues about the hundreds of thousands of people who appear to have access to your information?\"</p><p>Parker said: \"All three of us are involved in those discussions.\"</p><p>He added: \"We have very tightly controlled IT access, and arrangements for who can download what.\"</p><p><strong>5 How many people are working on GCHQ's Tempora program which analyses calls, emails and Google search traffic coming in and out of the UK?</strong></p><p>The Tempora program was not mentioned once by name during the session, and the Tory MP Mark Field suggested the committee was not aware of it until Edward Snowden's disclosure. He said: \"We were very much aware of your capabilities in the past, but we weren't aware of the intricacies.\"</p><p>Field went on to ask: \"While we appreciate that a lot of this is confidential about the sort of co-operation you have with other overseas agencies, will you give us an assurance that at the earliest opportunity in a closed session of this committee you will give us a comprehensive update on collaborations that were taking place with overseas intelligence agencies?\"</p><p>Lobban replied: \"I would be very happy to do so.\"</p><p>Rifkind asked: \"Why do you think it is necessary to collect information on the majority of the public in order to protect us from the minority of potential evil-doers.\"</p><p>Lobban replied: \"We do not spend our time listening to the telephone calls or reading the emails of the vast majority. That would not be proportionate. It would not be legal, we do not do it. We can only look at the content of communications, where there are very specific legal thresholds that have been met.</p><p>\"We don't want to delve into innocent emails and phone calls. I don't employ the kind of people who would. My people are motivated by saving the lives of British forces on the battlefield. They are motivated by finding terrorists and serious criminals. If they were asked to snoop, I wouldn't have the workforce, they would leave the building.\"</p><p><strong>6 Why is Britain's legal framework deemed to be so attractive to the US?</strong></p><p>Not asked</p><p><strong>7 Did GCHQ have legal authority to hack into Google fibre optic cables in the UK? </strong></p><p>This was not asked specifically, but Blears put this general question: \"Can you give us a guarantee that you do not conduct operations which were outwith the British legal framework.\"</p><p>Lobban replied: \"Yes I can give you that guarantee.\"</p><p><strong>8 Did Britain's intelligence agencies receive any transcripts of the mobile phone calls of Angela Merkel and other world leaders? </strong></p><p>This was not asked but Tory MP Julian Lewis did question whether Britain's allies were spied on.</p><p>Sawers replied: \"Everything we do is in response to priorities laid down by government. We have limited resources, of course we don't spy on everyone. There are very few countries where we actively have operations. I'm not going to go into the details.\"</p><p><strong>9 Do Britain's intelligence agencies need warrants for information offered or gifted by another agency such as the NSA?</strong></p><p>Not asked</p><p><strong>10 Former home secretary David Blunkett said this week the intelligence agencies tended to \"get carried away\" and their claims needed to be treated with a \"breath of scepticism\". What do you think he meant? Should Britain's intelligence agencies face stronger oversight?</strong></p><p>Rifkind alluded to such concerns by asking: \"Very often the agencies themselves seem over-nervous about insisting that something cannot be said in public. Have you sometimes taken that argument too far?\"</p><p>Parker replied: \"The reason why things are secret is not because we are embarrassed about them, it is because we want to keep them from the people that we are investigating.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421972255|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|1e93976b74a9a84584bada360479288e7f3c64a9 -->",

My colleague Owen Bowcott <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/owenbowcott\">will post a full report here</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527bc10fe4b055987af674fc\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T16:38:45.768Z\">4.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Meanwhile, in the House of Lords, Lord Foulkes, a former member of the intelligence and security committee, has just laid into it for &quot;inadequate&quot; scrutiny of Britain's spying agencies and has called for it to be radically overhauled, <strong>Rowena Mason </strong>reports.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The former Labour minister said he had had difficulty holding the intelligence services to account when he sat on the committee responsible for their oversight.</p> <p>He argued that its secrecy &quot;would do MI6 proud&quot; and said it did not instil confidence to have former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind as chairman. One of the biggest problems is its membership, which includes too many &quot;stalwards pillars of the establishment&quot;, he added.</p> <p>Foulkes told the House of Lords: &quot;Some of the recent reports have shown the inadequacy of the scrutiny of the intelligence and security committee of those services as it is currently comprised. I'm not surprised, frankly, by what's happened. For four years I served as the only representative of this house on the nine-person committee and I experienced some of the difficulties of scrutiny of the intelligence services. I had some radical ideas and changes to propose ... but I was surprised that I was summarily removed from that committee by the coalition, but what was even more disturbing is that no Labour peer was appointed by the prime minister in my place.</p> <p>&quot;I have great admiration for the many qualities of the two peers appointed. I doubt however that the Marquis of Lothian and Lord Butler actually have as the top of the list a reputation for radical and challenging questioning. Two more stalwart pillars of the establishment would be harder to find ... The secrecy surrounding the way in which this committee is to be constituted would do MI6 proud. It is not the open procedure that parliament ought to have.</p> <p>&quot;Like any other joint committee, this house should have roughly half the members. I would suggest the committee ought to be increased to 11 members. I think the chair should be a member of the opposition party like the chair of the public accounts committee to give it greater credibility.</p> <p>&quot;I have great respect for the current chair, Sir Malcolm Rifkind – in fact I have known him for 50 years. But it doesn't honestly instil confidence in the public and in parliament that the committee will undertake radical and effective scrutiny when you've got in the chair someone who has so recently [1995-97] been foreign secretary ... In order for it to be seen as effective and impartial, I would suggest the members of the committee need to be chosen by as democratic a procedure as we possibly can devise.&quot;</p> <p>He also pointed out the committee had its investigating staff member taken away from it &quot;because no doubt he was investigating too much&quot;.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T16:39:04.219Z\">at 4.39pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-527bbab9e4b055987af674f5\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T16:08:10.655Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The appearance of MI5’s Andrew Parker, MI6’s Sir John Sawers and GCHQ’s Sr Iain Lobban before the intelligence and security committee has come to an end. Here are the key points:</p> <p>• <strong>Mark Field, a member of the committee, said the committee had not been aware of all the “intricacies” in the spy programmes revealed by the Guardian and asked for a “comprehensive update” of all collaboration with foreign agencies in a closed session, which Lobban agreed to.</strong> Field said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We were very much aware of your capabilities in the past, but we weren’t aware of the intricacies to which Hazel Blears has just referred. Whilst we appreciate that a lot of this is confidential about the sort of cooperation you have with other overseas agencies, will you give us an assurance that at the earliest opportunity in a closed session of this committee you will give us a comprehensive update on collaborations that were taking place with overseas intelligence agencies?</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong>Lobban denied that the mass surveillance programmes revealed by Edward Snowden meant the intelligence agencies were reading everyone’s emails or listening to their calls.</strong> “I do not look at the surrounding hay”, he said, using the metaphor of looking for a needle in a haystack. If you are a threat or you are in contact with someone who is a threat you may be monitored, Lobban said. If not, not. If he asked his staff to snoop, “they’d leave the building”, he said. He said the agencies did not do anything outside the law. Parker said over the years governments had offered them greater powers “and we’ve said they’re disproportionate and turned away from them”.</p> <p>• <strong>The Snowden leaks have been “very damaging”, Sawers said.</strong> “They have put our operations at risk … Al-Qaida are lapping it up.” Lobban said terrorist groups in the Middle East and Afghanistan had been discussing the revelations in specific terms and had discussed moving to other “communications packages”. The three chiefs were unwilling to provide more specific examples of this damage in public, although they said they would do so to the MPs in a closed session.</p> <p>• <strong>Asked why the public had not been entitled to know about the mass surveillance programmes and had only found out about them via the Guardian, Lobban said some things were “necessarily secret” and “should remain secret”.</strong> Secret did not mean sinister, he said. Lobban said an “active debate” had been going on even before the Snowden revelations about where the line of secrecy needed to be drawn.</p> <p>• <strong>Asked if the existing framework of oversight for the security services was adequate, Lobban said that was a matter for parliament but he thought it “did a pretty good job”.</strong> But if parliament chose to have a debate and change the laws, that was “fine by him”. Parker expressed frustration that his (closed-door) meetings with the home secretary, the ISC and the intelligence commissioners that make up MI5’s oversight regime did not “get into the public mind”. Oversight was “very rigorous”, Sawers said.</p> <p>• <strong>The number of people who have travelled to Syria from Britain to fight in the civil war and are either still there or have come back is in the low hundreds, Parker said.</strong> Most will not attack Britain, but some might, he said.</p> <p>• <strong>Sawers denied MI6 spied on “everyone”, saying there were only a few countries where the Secret Intelligence Service actually had operations. </strong></p> <p><strong>•&nbsp;Sawers and Parker both said they would never ask a foreign intelligence agency to question someone if they thought that would result in torture.</strong></p> <p><strong>• Parker suggested that the kind of situation where a “junior clerk” such as Edward Snowden could leak so much information was unlikely to happen in the UK.</strong></p> <p><strong>•&nbsp;MI6 is communicating with Russia over the Sochi Olympics and will take cooperation with Moscow forward “step by step”.</strong></p> <p><strong>•&nbsp;Parker said MI5 sometimes recommended people for the government’s anti-radicalisation Prevent programme.</strong></p> <p><strong>•&nbsp;He said there were some terrorist plots during the London Olympics but “they didn’t happen”. There have been 330 prosecutions for international terrorism since 9/11, he said. Thirty-four plots had been disrupted since 7/7.</strong></p> <p><strong>• He rejected the idea that 7/7 represented an “intelligence failure”. </strong></p> <p><strong>• Parker said MI5’s budget was &pound;2bn.</strong></p> <p><strong>•&nbsp;There will be more public sessions with the three spy chiefs in future, Rifkind said he hoped.</strong></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527bb391e4b08521f0cfb359\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:38:14.685Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&nbsp;Legal pressure group Reprieve has called the session a &quot;damp squib&quot; that demonstrates why the ISC gives inadequate oversight of the security services. Its strategic director Cori Crider said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today’s hearing was billed as a grilling, but was nothing more than a damp squib. It gave a clear demonstration, if one were needed, of just how inadequate the ISC is as a watchdog on the intelligence services.</p> <p>One of the many elephants in the room was the UK’s involvement in Libyan rendition and torture. Not one member of the ISC asked about MI6’s role in ‘rendering’ the wives and children of Gaddafi opponents back to the dictator’s prisons in 2004 – an incident of which the ISC was completely unaware when it cleared the services of involvement in rendition and torture in 2007.</p> <p>They also failed to question GCHQ over its role in providing support to the CIA’s covert drone programme – which has killed hundreds of civilians in Pakistan and Yemen, and violates international law.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527bb330e4b055987af674ee\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:35:22.523Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Tory MP Dominic Raab has been in touch to say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the first time, intelligence chiefs gave public evidence about the scope of their activities and powers. It punctures the myth that ensuring the agencies are more transparent and accountable comes at a price to UK national security.</p> <p>In fact, strengthening oversight will make the agencies more effective, preserve the rule of law and safeguard public confidence.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527bb326e4b08521f0cfb358\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:35:06.045Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Campbell asks about North Korea. It is a big concern, but not as high an operational concern as other parts of the world, Sawers says.</p> <p>Julian Lewis asks about espionage in the UK. Does traditional espionage, say from Russia, still pose a threat? Would it be true to say that everyone is still spying on everyone else?</p> <p>Parker says 10% of his work arises from threats from foreign states, most of that being espionage. “It’s still a lively business here.”</p> <p>There are a range of countries involved, he says.</p> <p>Rifkind asks about the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. </p> <p>Sawers says we have not had the cooperation we sought from the Russians on that case. Recently they have been talking about security for the Sochi Olympics, though. “We will take it forward step by step.”</p> <p>Lewis asks again: would it be true to say that everyone is still spying on everyone else?</p> <p>Sawers says terrorism, cyber, nuclear issues are the vast bulk of what they do.

George Howarth gave the impression that the MPs had not known, while chair Sir Malcolm Rifkind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/31/nsa-files-mps-debate-oversight-of-the-intelligence-services#block-52727877e4b0ad7c52b6049f\">said</a> the MPs questioning him had no idea whether his committee knew about the programmes because secret information like that had to be kept secret. </p> <p>But this morning Omand said he was sure the ISC would have had detailed briefings on the scale of GCHQ's activity, but in private. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ISC has now been reconstituted. It is now a proper committee of parliament. They have got new powers. They are on show this afternoon every bit as much as the three heads of agencies. They have to demonstrate they can satisfy the need for oversight and satisfy parliament that they are doing a job that in other areas of government can be done by much more open means.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527b6178e4b0f1cce820909d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T09:56:40.540Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Richard Norton-Taylor </strong>has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/10-questions-intelligence-agency-chiefs\">profiled</a> the three chiefs. Here is what he wrote:</p> <h2><strong>Sir Iain Lobban - head of GCHQ</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-eb0546c2-c2b6-4831-8e68-651048d92933\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/7/1383817724762/bd7f7847-3538-4c32-8e4d-294ba741bed0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Director of GCHQ Sir Iain Lobban.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Director of GCHQ Sir Iain Lobban. Photograph: GCHQ/Crown Copyright/PA</figcaption> </figure> <p>Lobban,53, has been director of GCHQ, the British electronic eavesdropping agency, since 2008. He has more than 6,000 staff under him and they spend the bulk of the three agencies' combined budget of &pound;2bn.</p> <p>Lobban supports Everton football club, and declares his other interests as cricket, photography, travel and birdwatching.</p> <p>He studied French and German at Leeds University and passed the higher command staff course at the Defence Academy at Shrivenham before joining GCHQ in 1983. GCHQ is also in the lead in fighting cyber wars, and Lobban is appealing to cyberwarriors. &quot;[GCHQ] can offer them a fantastic mission, but … can't compete with their salaries,&quot; he has said referring to the kind of money offered by private companies. None of the chiefs seeks the spotlight, but Lobban is probably the least well-known of them all preferring to keep himself, and his Cheltenham agency, out of the Whitehall spotlight.</p> <h2><strong>Andrew Parker - head of MI5</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ab50824c-3b9e-4c5b-b19c-8bd0b0a41163\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/28/1364494813967/Andrew-Parker-008.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Parker\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Andrew Parker, head of MI5. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>Parker, 50, has been director general of MI5, the domestic security service, which has a staff of 3,900 officers, since April this year. He studied natural sciences at Cambridge University, and describes himself as a keen ornithologist and wildlife photographer. In a highly provocative maiden speech last month he claimed, without naming the newspaper, that by publishing leaks from the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the Guardian had handed a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\">gift to terrorists</a>&quot;. The claim has been questioned by MPs from all main parties and led a former director of public prosecutions, Lord Macdonald, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/14/snowden-leaks-mi5-chief-rhetoric-dpp\">accuse him</a> of using self-serving rhetoric.</p> <p>Parker has worked for MI5 for more than 30 years, including on Middle East terrorism, counter espionage, Northern Ireland terrorism, and serious and organised crime. He was also MI5's liaison officer in the US and deputy to the former head of MI5, Jonathan Evans.</p> <h2><strong>Sir John Sawers - head of MI6</strong></h2> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4dd2ba29-219f-4f12-8a9c-1487ce5f26d7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/6/16/1245169815011/John-Sawers-the-new-head--001.jpg\" alt=\"John Sawers, the new head of MI6\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>John Sawers, the head of MI6. Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>Sawers, 59, has been chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi6\">MI6</a>, since 2009. By tradition, he signs his correspondence – copies of which go to the Queen – with the letter &quot;C&quot; in green ink. Although he had a spell with MI6 in Yemen, most of his career was in the Foreign Office and included the post of UK ambassador to the UN. He was Tony Blair's foreign affairs private secretary from 1999 to 2001 and had a brief spell in Baghdad after the 2003 invasion. MI6 has a staff of 3,200 deployed worldwide, and its biggest overseas station is Kabul.</p> <p>Sawers was brought in to lift the shadows over MI6 following the scandal of the misleading Iraq weapons dossier. He gave the first public speech by the head of MI6 and said he believed the mechanisms set up to hold the intelligence agencies to account were inadequate.</p> <p>But he was pushed on the defensive by the revelation that MI6 played a role in the abduction of Libyan dissidents to Tripoli where they were abused by Muammar Gaddafi's secret police, and by damning criticism of MI6 following the death of Gareth Williams, a GCHQ officer seconded to MI6 – an incident for which Sawers apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot;.</p> <p>He studied physics and philosophy at Nottingham University and lists his recreations as sport and the arts. He is due to retire next year.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527b5ea6e4b0ebad08ff9ceb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T09:45:54.597Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>My colleague <strong>Nick Hopkins</strong> has drawn up a list of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/10-questions-intelligence-agency-chiefs\">10 key questions</a> the intelligence and security committee should ask the spy chiefs this afternoon. Here they are in full:</p> <p><strong>1. </strong>Stella Rimington, the former head of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi5\">MI5</a>, and David Omand, the former director of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq\">GCHQ</a>, have said it is time for Britain's intelligence agencies to be more transparent so the public can have greater confidence in their work. Do you agree, and how will you achieve this?</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>Former minister Chris Huhne said the existence of some of GCHQ's mass surveillance programmes were kept from the cabinet – and from members of the National Security Council. Why weren't ministers allowed to know about the programmes – particularly when they were relevant to discussions about data retention set out in the so-called snooper's charter?</p> <p><strong>3. </strong>Privacy campaigners, former cabinet ministers and even a former chair of the ISC, Lord King, have called in recent weeks for the laws that govern Britain's intelligence agencies to be overhauled. The agencies have argued against any changes. Why? What do the agencies have to fear from having more up-to-date laws?</p> <p><strong>4. </strong>Edward Snowden was one of 850,000 employees and contractors who had access to the secret material he leaked to the Guardian and others. Did the chiefs know that so many people outside the UK had access to British secrets? What has been done to reduce the numbers who can see this material?</p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Last year, 550 analysts (300 British, 250 American) were working on GCHQ's Tempora programme, which analyses calls, emails and Google search traffic coming in and out of the UK. How many are working on it now?</p> <p><strong>6. </strong>Documents seen by the Guardian describe how GCHQ regards the UK's legal regime as a &quot;unique selling point&quot; to be exploited when collaborating with the US. Why is Britain's legal framework deemed to be so attractive to the US?</p> <p><strong>7. </strong>The Washington Post revealed this week that GCHQ had &quot;hacked&quot; into Google's private fibre-optic cables in the UK as part of a joint programme with America's National Security Agency. Google said this was outrageous. Did GCHQ have legal authority to do this – and if so, which minister signed the relevant &quot;warrant&quot; – and when?</p> <p><strong>8. </strong>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\">NSA</a> eavesdropped on Angela Merkel's mobile phone for at least 10 years. Documents also show the NSA targeted the phones of another 35 government heads. Did Britain's intelligence agencies receive any transcripts of these conversations? Did GCHQ help the NSA tap any of these calls?</p> <p><strong>9. </strong>The agencies insist they seek legal approval for all their major programmes, and that if they want information from other agencies, such as the NSA, they need warrants for that material too. But do they need warrants for information offered or gifted by another agency?</p> <p><strong>10. </strong>The former home secretary David Blunkett <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/david-blunkett-review-laws-security-services\">said this week</a> the intelligence agencies tended to &quot;get carried away&quot; and their claims needed to be treated with a &quot;breath of scepticism&quot;. What do you think he meant? And wouldn't stronger oversight of the agencies be better in the long run?</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527b5c63e4b0ebad08ff9ce7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T09:25:55.695Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The intelligence and security committee is different to parliamentary select committees, a fact noted by many MPs in<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/31/nsa-files-mps-debate-oversight-of-the-intelligence-services\"> last week’s Westminster Hall debate on the security services</a>.</p> <p>The committee was established in 1994 to examine the three intelligence agencies and the intelligence work of the Cabinet Office, Ministry of Defence and Home Office, and was reformed earlier this year, giving it greater powers and allowing it oversight of operational activity and “the wider intelligence and security activities of government”.</p> <p>Unlike select committees, whose members and the majority of whose chairs are now elected by their fellow MPs, the members of the ISC are appointed by parliament only after nomination by the prime minister. They can be members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and serving ministers cannot be chosen. The chair is chosen by the PM.</p> <p>Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the current chair, said last week that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/31/nsa-files-mps-debate-oversight-of-the-intelligence-services#block-52727877e4b0ad7c52b6049f\"> in future the committee would chose its own leader</a>.</p> <p>Rifkind is a former foreign secretary and his role has been<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24491443\"> criticised</a> in that he might be required to scrutinise decisions he made himself when he was in power.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/06/whistleblowers-protection-labour-mi5-mi6-gchq\">Labour’s Diana Johnson has called for reforms</a> to the committee to give greater protection to whistleblowers and has said an opposition MP should be its chair.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/nsa-files-us-rejects-clemency-for-edward-snowden-live\">Monday’s Riba debate</a> on the Snowden revelations, Tory MP Rory Stewart made the same point, arguing: &quot;You are never going to have a government backbencher chairing a committee that is going to criticise the government properly.”</p> <p>The current members of the committee are:</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/Sir-Malcolm-Rifkind/1191\">Sir <strong>Malcolm Rifkind</strong> MP, former Tory foreign secretry</a> (chair)</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/Hazel-Blears/456\"><strong>Hazel Blears</strong> MP, former Labour communities secretary</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-butler-of-brockwell/3337\"><strong>Lord Butler</strong> of Brockwell, crossbench peer</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/Sir-Menzies-Campbell/627\">Sir <strong>Menzies Campbell</strong> MP, former Lib Dem leader</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/Mark-Field/1405\"><strong>Mark Field</strong> MP, former Tory shadow minister</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/Paul-Goggins/462\"><strong>Paul Goggins</strong> MP, former Labour Northern Ireland minister</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/Mr-George-Howarth/481\"><strong>George Howarth</strong> MP, former Labour undersecretary in the Northern Ireland Office and Home Office</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/dr-julian-lewis/54\"><strong>Julian Lewis</strong> MP, former Tory shadow minister</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/marquess-of-lothian/259\"><strong>Lord Lothian</strong> QC, former deputy Tory leader</a></p> <p>Today’s session with the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ will cover “the terrorist threat, regional instability and weapons proliferation, cyber security and espionage”. But it will not cover “details of intelligence capabilities or techniques, ongoing operations or sub judice matters”.</p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/nsa-files-us-rejects-clemency-for-edward-snowden-live\">Monday</a> Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, predicted that the spy chiefs would use the session to claim that terrorists had now “gone dark” – or disappeared from their view – as a result of the paper’s stories. He quoted a 2011<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.futureofprivacy.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2FGoing-Dark-Versus-a-Golden-Age-for-Surveillance-Peter-Swire-and-Kenesa-A.pdf&amp;ei=awZ4UoHUK6fB0QWsuYDoDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcONMp-Zv1UOCfM7kxRc02mSmqZw&amp;bvm=bv.55819444,d.d2k\"> article</a> by Peter Swire of Ohio State University and Kenesa Ahmad of the Future of Privacy Forum – written before the Snowden revelations – arguing that security agencies have used the “going dark” argument for a long time, when in reality we are currently living in a “golden age of surveillance”.</p> <p>The article noted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This post casts new light on government agency claims that we are “going dark.” Due to changing technology, there are indeed specific ways that law enforcement and national security agencies lose specific previous capabilities. These specific losses, however, are more than offset by massive gains. Public debates should recognize that we are truly in a golden age of surveillance.</p> </blockquote> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A simple test can help the reader decide between the “going dark” and “golden age of surveillance” hypotheses. Suppose the agencies had a choice of a 1990-era package or a 2011-era package. The first package would include the wiretap authorities as they existed pre-encryption, but would lack the new techniques for location tracking, confederate identification, access to multiple databases, and data mining. The second package would match current capabilities: some encryption-related obstacles, but increased use of wiretaps, as well as the capabilities for location tracking, confederate tracking and data mining. The second package is clearly superior - the new surveillance tools assist a vast range of investigations, whereas wiretaps apply only to a small subset of key investigations. The new tools are used far more frequently and provide granular data to assist investigators.</p> </blockquote> <p>Swire is now on Barack Obama's panel reviewing the powers of the NSA.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527b57dbe4b0ebad08ff9ce3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T09:06:08.389Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Good morning.</p> <p>Today at 2pm the three heads of the UK intelligence agencies, Sir Iain Lobban of GCHQ, Andrew Parker of MI5, and Sir John Sawers of MI6, are going to give evidence before parliament’s<a href=\"http://isc.independent.gov.uk/\"> intelligence and security committee</a>.</p> <p>The hearing will be<a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Live.aspx\"> broadcast here</a> on a short time delay (in case anything is mentioned that might jeopardise national security), and I will live blog it.</p> <p>Also today David Miranda’s high court challenge to his nine-hour detention at Heathrow under the Terrorism Act last month continues, and is expected to conclude. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/david-miranda-heathrow-detention-glenn-greenwald\">Here</a> Owen Bowcott and Alan Travis report on day one of the hearing, in which lawyers for Miranda – the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald – told the high court his detention was unlawful and the first time journalistic material has been seized under a controversial provision of the Terrorism Act.

        "body":"<p>Thirty-four terror plots targeted against the UK have been disrupted by the security services and police in the last eight years, the director general of MI5 has told the intelligence and security committee.</p><p>Andrew Parker told MPs that since the 7/7 attacks in London in 2005 \"active detection and intervention\" by counter-terrorism agents and police officers had foiled one or two terror attacks a year, which were aimed at creating mass casualties. These were among 34 plots that have been disrupted since the London bombings.</p><p>The spy chief said the vast majority of the conspiracies were by people who lived in the UK, and the committee heard that agents were actively monitoring individuals known to be radicalising and recruiting sometimes vulnerable individuals to violent extremism.</p><p>\"There are several thousands of individuals in this country who I would describe as supporting violent extremism or engaged in it in some way that we are aware of, and the terrorist plots that we have dealt with have almost all come from those people,\" he said.</p><p>The prevented plots included an attempt by a group of extremists in the West Midlands to carry out an attack bigger than 7/7. Eleven people were convicted and jailed this year after the plot was interrupted while the extremists were trying to test their devices in a flat in Birmingham.</p><p>Covert surveillance by the security services detected some of the group discussing how they wanted to carry out an attack that dwarfed the 2005 bombings, Parker told the committee.</p><p>In the last year alone, he said, there had been 25 convictions resulting from four major investigations into terror conspiracies. \"Spectacular plots are very much in the minds of terrorists still,\" he said.</p><p>Describing a diversifying threat as al-Qaida offshoots appeared and gathered support in north, west and east Africa, Yemen and Syria, Parker said the job of the security services had become more complex. Syria in particular was a concern as it was drawing hundreds of individuals from the UK to train and fight alongside groups where al-Qaida ideology had taken root.</p><p>\"Syria has become a very attractive place for people to go … who sympathise with the AQ message,\" Parker said. \"We have seen low hundreds of people from this country go to Syria … That includes people we believe are there now fighting and those who have been and come back … who have been involved in fighting.</p><p>\"We need to take some regard to and interest in them to check they are not intending to be involved in violence. Most will not but some may so we need to have an informed view of that.\"</p><p>Sir John Sawers, the head of MI6, told the committee that the threat from terrorism was rising, and gave recent examples of British citizens killed at home and abroad in Islamist terror attacks, including at the Tigantourine gas facility in Amenas, Algeria, the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya, in Nigeria and also in London with the murder of Lee Rigby.</p><p>\"We do what we can to disrupt the attacks overseas but some of them get through and the threat overseas is getting greater,\" Sawers said. He told the MPs that the threats to the country and \"our way of life\" were diverse and wide-ranging.</p><p>\"It's not like it was in the cold war. There aren't states out there trying to destroy our government and our way of life … The biggest is terrorism – the threat from al-Qaida and its many, many branches. There are also states out there that are trying to do us harm, through cyber-attacks, by acquiring nuclear weapons or involved in generating instability in parts of the world important to us.\"</p><p>He added: \"It's a very volatile and rapidly changing world we are living in and we have to have the skills, the people and the capabilities to be able to support and defend this country's security interests wherever those threats arise.\"</p><p>Sir Iain Lobban, director of GCHQ, talked about the growing cyber threat, which he said came from multiple fronts, including from hostile countries, sophisticated criminals and hacktivists.</p><p>\"We are seeing attacks against businesses that keep Britain going – finance, transport, communication, energy, the theft [of secrets] from over 20 industrial sectors, research and innovation, trade secrets, academic research. It is industrial espionage on an industrial scale,\" he added in his oral evidence.</p><p>• This article was amended on Friday 8 November 2013 to restore a sentence inadvertently removed during the editing process.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421951199|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|21b09d1b88304cb7ab353ed28bde48e8bfcd4141 -->",

        "body":"<p>Civil liberties groups have described the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/heads-of-gchq-mi5-and-mi6-appear-before-intelligence-committee-live\" title=\"\">first public questioning of Britain's spy agency chiefs</a> as disappointing and far from illuminating, saying the committee of MPs who quizzed the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ failed to ask searching questions.</p><p>During the 90-minute intelligence and security committee hearing, MI5's Andrew Parker, the MI6 chief, Sir John Sawers, and Sir Iain Lobban, the director of GCHQ, were questioned on subjects including whether the agencies' interception of electronic communication was excessive, if there was a need for greater oversight of their work, and the effects of stories by the Guardian and others based on the revelations of Edward Snowden.</p><p>On the latter subject, Sawers said the Snowden stories had been very damaging and that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nsa-leaks-enemies-rubbing-hands-glee-mi6\" title=\"\">\"our adversaries are rubbing their hands with glee\"</a>.</p><p>Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, said the promised inquisition had proved extremely tame. \"These public servants presided over blanket surveillance of the entire population without public, parliamentary or democratic mandate. Yet they faced a grilling that wouldn't have scared a puppy,\" she said.</p><p>\"Broad, friendly questions were easily batted away and little was said that isn't already on public record. A real inquiry into this grand breach of trust must now begin.\"</p><p>Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, contrasted the spy chiefs' reaction with the response to the Snowden revelations in other countries.</p><p>\"As the US president, world leaders and international experts express concern about the scale of surveillance and the need to review the laws and policies involved, today was perhaps unique for the fact parliament found three people who think there is no need for reform.\"</p><p>His organisation has published a poll showing two-thirds of people believe the government should publish more data about the way surveillance powers are used.</p><p></p><p>Among omissions in the questioning, Pickles said, was explanations as to why Snowden was among 850,000 people with access to secret files, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/tim-berners-lee-encryption-spy-agencies\" title=\"\">condemnation by Tim Berners-Lee, the internet's creator, of spy agencies' actions</a>.</p><p></p><p>He said: \"Many people will find it is surprising that the head of GCHQ was not even asked about how a 29-year-old contractor in Hawaii gained access to so much information about his organisation, or that the concerns of Sir Tim Berners-Lee about weakening encryption were not addressed in any meaningful way.</p><p>\"Senior figures in the UK and US have all said that the Snowden revelations have not damaged national security, but the committee seemed uninterested in challenging the now familiar well rehearsed soundbites from officials.</p><p>\"A public hearing is a welcome step towards long overdue transparency and a genuine debate about the legal framework is clearly in the public interest. However, on today's evidence there is still a long way to go.\"</p><p>Thomas Hughes, executive director of Article 19, said the hearing showed how any new public knowledge was being led by media reports.</p><p>\"Without Snowden's revelations, the intelligence and security committee seemingly wouldn't have known the extent of the mass surveillance of our personal communications.</p><p>\"Today's hearing has highlighted the need for the creation of a fully independent, effective and accountable oversight mechanism for the UK intelligence agencies.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the Open Rights Group said the committee had \"failed to ask the difficult questions\".</p><p>He said: \"For instance, who decided that mass data trawling did not need an explicit parliamentary vote? How do they square data trawls with repeated human right judgments showing such harvests are going too far? Why is undermining internet security alright and why is it fine to break into potentially millions of accounts at Google and Yahoo! when there are legal routes to the same data?</p><p>\"By concentrating on generalities the ISC failed to bite, which is extremely worrying as their main argument is that oversight makes us safe.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421951279|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|3004f378cbeb5885c65cfc391d066093ad18d1a1 -->",

        "headline":"NSA leaks: UK's enemies are 'rubbing their hands with glee', says MI6 chief",
        "body":"<p>Britain's three senior spy chiefs came into the public glare for the first time  to claim that leaks by the former NSA analyst Edward Snowden were being \"lapped up\" by the country's adversaries, but also to concede that the disclosures had prompted discussion with the government over how to be more transparent about their methods.</p><p>Despite an often gentle first public cross-examination of the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, some members of the intelligence and security committee, including the former head of the civil service Lord Butler, expressed their concern at the legal oversight of the intelligence agencies.</p><p>Butler said it was hardly credible that the legislation governing the agencies was \"still fit for purpose for the modern world\". After the session, Sir Menzies Campbell, a Liberal Democrat member of the ISC, also called for a review of the law, \"not least to provide the public with a sense of reassurance and confidence that there is a substantial legal framework\".</p><p>A third ISC member, the Tory MP Mark Field, also revealed that members felt they had not been told about the intricacies of GCHQ's capabilities, demanding in private \"at the earliest opportunity a comprehensive update on collaborations that are taking place with overseas intelligence agencies\" – including, by implication, the US National Security Agency. Sir Iain Lobban, the head of GCHQ, agreed to do so.</p><p>The 90-minute session came most alive when the spy chiefs expressed their cold fury at the Edward Snowden disclosures in the Guardian and other papers, claiming that they would lead for years to an \"inexorable darkening\" of their knowledge of those threatening the country.</p><p>Sir John Sawers, head of MI6, said: \"The leaks from Snowden have been very damaging. They have put our operations at risk. It is clear our adversaries are rubbing their hands with glee. Al-Qaida is lapping it up.\"</p><p>Lobban told MPs there had been a gradual but inexorable deterioration of GCHQ's knowledge of its targets after five months of near daily chat by potential terrorists about how to adapt their methods of communication in the light of the disclosures about GCHQ's modus operandi. He asserted: \"The cumulative effect of the media coverage, the global media coverage, will make the job that we have far, far harder for years to come.\" Success, he in effect argued, required Britain's enemies to be unaware or uncertain of GCHQ's methods. He added: \"There is a complex and fragile mosaic of strategic capability which allows us to discover, to process, to investigate and then to take action. That includes terrorist cells, it reveals people shipping secrets or expertise or materials to do with chemical, biological, nuclear around the world. It allows us to reveal the identities of those involved in online sexual exploitation of children. Those people are very active users of encryption and of anonymisation tools. That mosaic is in a far, far weaker place than it was five months ago.\"</p><p>Neither Sawers nor Lobban was willing to give the committee any specific detail about the compromise of intelligence capability in public, but they promised to  be \"very, very specific\" in a future private session.</p><p>Lobban also expressed fears that he was going to lose the co-operation of internet service providers in conducting telephone and internet monitoring. \"I am concerned about the access that we can lawfully require of communications companies, which is very difficult if they are based overseas,\" he said.</p><p>He hotly denied that GCHQ delved into \"innocent emails and calls\", but said the agencies needed to have access to \"the enormous hayfield\" if they were to find the needles.</p><p>Lobban promised: \"We do not spend our time listening to the telephone calls or reading the emails of the majority, the vast majority – that would not be proportionate, it would not be legal. We do not do it. We can only look at the content of communications where there are very specific legal thresholds and requirements which have been met. So that's the reality. We don't want to delve into innocent emails and phonecalls.\"</p><p>But the GCHQ boss said there were some people who would be monitored, and it was the job of the intelligence agency to monitor \"a terrorist, a serious criminal, a proliferator, a target or if your activities pose a genuine threat to the national or economic security of the UK\".</p><p>On Thursday night, one of the members of the ISC said that the committee knew GCHQ was able to secretly access vast quantities of data. Labour's former counter-terrorism minister Hazel Blears told BBC's Newsnight that the ISC was fully aware of \"what they were doing in terms of being able to collect information\".</p><p>Former cabinet minister Chris Huhne had said top government figures were kept in the dark about GCHQ's ability to access data, in an operation codenamed Tempora. But in what appears to be the first admission to the contrary, Blears said: \"The committee did have a broad understanding of what the capabilities of GCHQ were.\"</p><p>Pressed on whether it had been aware of the existence of the Tempora programme, she said: \"We didn't know the names of these projects, and I'm sure the exact same situation applies in America. But in terms of broad capabilities, yes we did,\" said Blears.</p><p>\"We have been looking at them now for several years, we have been on several visits to GCHQ, we've had very, very confidential briefings about what the capabilities were and obviously we were satisfied that they were operating within our legal framework.\"</p><p>At Thursday's hearing, Sawers criticised newspapers for claiming they could judge whether disclosures would compromise national security, saying they were not particularly well placed to make such decisions. But pressed to accept that the disclosures had raised issues about the line between secrecy and openness, however, Lobban acknowledged the urgency of the issue, saying: \"Clearly with the situation we are in, we are actively considering that with government.\"</p><p>The spies used their public outing to defend their £2bn budget, and to claim that the security threat facing Britain was growing. Andrew Parker, director of MI5, said that since 2005 and the 7/7 attacks, 34 separate plots had been foiled, including one that would have created mass casualties.</p><p>He said the numbers sympathetic to violent extremism were in the low thousands, saying \"terrorism tourism\" was now a serious problem as Britons, numbered in the low hundreds, travelling to fight in Syria had made the crisis worse.</p><p>Sawers also rejected allegations that intelligence agencies had been complicit in torture or have mistreated individuals. Parker added: \"We do not participate in, incite, encourage or condone mistreatment or torture, and that is absolute.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for Guardian News and Media, publisher of the Guardian, said: \"We welcome the fact that the intelligence chiefs acknowledged that they need to be more open as a result of the Snowden disclosures, but were surprised that unlike in the US and Europe there was no substantive discussion at all about anything Snowden revealed.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421943780|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|d31113588b94ace3d135d50e5245cc52814fc65a -->",

        "headline":"Spy agency revelations: Tory peer urges 'defenders of liberty' to speak out",
        "body":"<p>A Conservative peer and former cabinet minister has attacked the UK media's \"lackadaisical\" response to the US whistleblower Edward Snowden and called on \"defenders of liberty\" to speak out against invasion of personal freedoms by the intelligence services.</p><p>The former Tory party chairman John Gummer, now Lord Deben, said the revelations should be a cause for concern \"from right to left\" as spying agencies too easily use terrorism as an excuse to invade civil liberties.</p><p>His intervention comes after David Cameron and Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, criticised the Guardian for endangering national security by publishing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">stories about mass surveillance </a>of internet users based on Snowden's leaks.</p><p>The reports reveal GCHQ has been tapping internet cables since 2008, potentially allowing the organisation to see the emails and web activity of millions of users. While there has been public outrage in the US and Germany about the extent of spying on internet users, the issue has had less political attention in the UK.</p><p>Deben said the UK had a \"duty of guardianship\" to its citizens and warned it was dangerous to accept the word of the intelligence agencies.</p><p>\"If you look back into history, the times at which people lose their freedoms are always times when the loss of freedom is excused by national emergency or by the need to fight terrorism,\" he said. \"It means that whenever that's the argument used, people who believe in freedom should be extremely quick to stand up.</p><p>\"I am very surprised at the way in which the press in Britain has been so lackadaisical and not seen that there are issues here of huge importance. At a time when the majority of the press are making a great deal of fuss about what they see to be a threat to press freedom, here is an issue of freedom that I'm very surprised they have not caught on to and recognised. Who guards the guardians? It's absolutely crucial. This is the moment in which it should have been an issue from right to left.\"</p><p>Deben, who is also an independent adviser to the government on climate change, said there was a serious political debate to be had about how far surveillance should be allowed to go.</p><p>\"You can't just hide it by saying 'well, we live in a world threatened by terrorism',\" he said. \"Are we going to allow the terrorists to remove the very freedoms we defend? I'm not blaming anybody, I'm merely saying this ought to be a real national debate and people who are involved in the very good business of surveillance, which is a very necessary part of a free society, ought to know that what they do is subject to very real concerns by people outside.\"</p><p>He spoke out after Sir Malcolm Rifkind and his joint intelligence committee heard evidence from the heads of the intelligence agencies MI5, GCHQ and MI6 in public for the first time. The committee decided to broaden an existing inquiry into whether the intelligence laws are \"fit for purpose\" in the wake of the Snowden revelations.</p><p>Deben said the public should not assume the spying agencies are acting within proper boundaries.</p><p>\"My big concern is that we kind of take it for granted and say I'm sure [the intelligence services] are doing their best, I'm sure people wouldn't do anything that's wrong,\" he said. \"I don't think that's how you should do it. They should make sure those who are responsible should know their every action has to be taken in the context that others will know about it.</p><p>\"They must know there are codes which are really very seriously enforced so you don't overhear the telephone calls of the chancellor of Germany or use your power to force land the airplane of the president of Bolivia because you think somebody whom you fear is on board. That's the other thing that really shocked me. We have to speak out. At a time in which the media is so determined to talk about freedom of the press, this is a freedom the press is supposed to be defending.\"</p><p>Asked about GCHQ's Project Tempora, which collects data from internet users by tapping 200 subsea cables, Deben said there had been an \"alarming amount of silence from some who could tell us more\".</p><p>\"The only thing I can do is to say, well look here, freedom means you have to be constantly on your guard against those who use terrorism and the need to defend against it as an excuse for actions which are manifestly unacceptable,\" he said.</p><p>Politicians appear split on the role the Guardian played in publishing Snowden's leaks exposing mass surveillance.</p><p>The former defence secretary Liam Fox has written to Alison Saunders, the new director of public prosecutions, about the matter. Referring to reports that some leaked material obtained by the Guardian contained details of GCHQ agents, Fox said in his letter he would like to know whether passing this information \"to foreign journalists and bloggers\" constituted an offence under the Terrorism Act.</p><p>William Hague, the foreign secretary, and Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, endorsed comments made at the recent intelligence and security committee hearing at which Sir John Sawers, the head of MI6, said Britain's enemies were \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nsa-leaks-enemies-rubbing-hands-glee-mi6\" title=\"\">rubbing their hands with glee</a>\" over the disclosures.</p><p>But despite Fox's letter to the CPS, the two ministers sidestepped questions about whether they would like to see a prosecution. \"Action against any particular media outlet in any particular country, unfortunately, is not going to reverse the damage that has been done,\" Hammond said on Sunday.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a parliamentary debate last week a cross-party group of MPs, including Tory Dominic Raab, Labour MP Tom Watson and Liberal Democrat Julian Huppert, argued there should be greater oversight over intelligence agencies.</p><p>A Guardian News &amp; Media spokesperson said: \"The loss of classified data was not the responsibility of journalists but of the intelligence community itself. It is only the involvement of global newspapers that prevented this information from spilling out across the web and genuinely causing a catastrophic leak.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421902924|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|e5ac64270b129d5f0770883f4770068bc1c51c16 -->",

        "headline":"Guardian faces fresh criticism over Edward Snowden revelations",
        "body":"<p>The Guardian faced fresh criticism from the government  over its handling of leaks from former NSA analyst Edward Snowden as two cabinet ministers said its revelations had endangered national security.</p><p>William Hague, the foreign secretary, and Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, endorsed comments made at the recent intelligence and security committee hearing at which Sir John Sawers, the head of MI6, said Britain's enemies were \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/nsa-leaks-enemies-rubbing-hands-glee-mi6\" title=\"\">rubbing their hands with glee</a>\" over the disclosures.</p><p>But despite the former defence secretary Liam Fox writing to the Crown Prosecution Service asking whether there is a case for legal action against the Guardian, the two ministers sidestepped questions about whether they would like to see a prosecution.</p><p>\"Action against any particular media outlet in any particular country, unfortunately, is not going to reverse the damage that has been done,\" Hammond said on Sunday.</p><p>Speaking on Sky News, he said: \"Have the Snowden revelations damaged our ability to fight terrorism and keep Britain safe? Undoubtedly they have. Anything that gives away the tradecraft, the methods, the methodologies of the security services and the agencies is, of course, hugely valuable to those who wish us harm.\"</p><p>Hague, who oversees the work of MI6, spoke in similar terms when interviewed on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0080bbs\" title=\"\">BBC's Andrew Marr Show</a>. Everything he had seen suggested that what the intelligence chiefs said about the Guardian revelations was \"absolutely right\", he said.</p><p>\"The Snowden allegations, let me put it that way, certainly have endangered our national security, made it harder for us to protect our country and other countries from terrorist attacks.</p><p>\"By speculating about our capabilities, it makes it easier for people who want to evade interception but are seeking to damage our country, or kill people, it makes it easier for them to evade interception. That is something that is very, very serious, and very damaging.\"</p><p>Hague said that the intelligence services operated in a \"very strong and robust legal framework\".</p><p>And although he refused to be drawn on the detail of the Guardian revelations, Hague defended the fact that the full scope of surveillance by GCHQ was not discussed at the national security council or the cabinet. Last month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state\" title=\"\">Chris Huhne used a Guardian article</a> to complain that both bodies were kept in a state of \"utter ignorance\" about the programmes subsequently publicised by the Guardian,</p><p>Hague said there was a \"particular system\" for dealing with these matters, with the foreign secretary and the home secretary (in charge of MI5) taking the key decisions, overseen by commissioners.</p><p>He continued: \"That is the political and legal framework in which these decisions about intelligence are made. Are they made in much larger groups? Well, no they're not. That's because so much of what we do has to be so secret.\"</p><p>Asked if the Guardian should be prosecuted, both Hague and Hammond said that was a matter for the attorney general. Hammond also questioned whether a prosecution would make much difference. \"The cat is out of the bag,\" he said.</p><p>But his predecessor, Liam Fox, has written to Alison Saunders, the new director of public prosecutions, about the matter. Referring to reports that some leaked material obtained by the Guardian contained details of GCHQ agents, Fox said in his letter he would like to know whether passing this information \"to foreign journalists and bloggers\" constituted an offence under the Terrorism Act.</p><p>A Guardian News &amp; Media spokesperson said: \"The loss of classified data was not the responsibility of journalists but of the intelligence community itself. It is only the involvement of global newspapers that prevented this information from spilling out across the web and genuinely causing a catastrophic leak.</p><p>\"We have consulted regularly with the DA-notice committee, Downing Street, the White House and the intelligence agencies, giving them time to raise concerns and flag up anxieties. We have listened carefully to the arguments made to us, agreed not to publish certain things, and redacted all names and sensitive operational details.</p><p>\"That said, we understand that some people will always warn that any form of disclosure has a damaging impact on the work of the security services – but this cannot mean the end of all questioning and debate.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422121021|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|2534814c2ee1bf72b8de984b61ebabbb4e75d59e -->",

        "headline":"John McCain says NSA chief Keith Alexander 'should resign or be fired'",
        "body":"<p>Senator John McCain has called for Keith Alexander to \"resign or be fired\" as the head of the National Security Agency, <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-john-mccain-on-nsa-spying-on-angela-merkel-a-932721.html\">in an interview with the German news weekly Der Spiegel published on Sunday</a>.</p><p>The senator for Arizona, a former Republican presidential candidate, said Alexander should be held accountable for the leaks of thousands of documents by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, which revealed NSA surveillance and spying on a massive scale. McCain said Snowden, who worked for the NSA as a contractor, should never have had access to classified information.</p><p>\"And now we have a contractor employee, not a government employee, who has access to information which is, when revealed, most damaging to the standing prestige of the United States and our relations with some of our best friends,\" McCain said. \"Why did Edward Snowden have that information? And what are we doing as far as screening people who have access to this information? It's outrageous, and someone ought to be held accountable.\"</p><p>President Barack Obama, the NSA and the congressional intelligence committee had responsibility for the sharing of classified information, he said. </p><p>Asked if Alexander should resign, McCain said: \"Of course, he should resign, or be fired. We no longer hold anybody accountable in Washington.\"</p><p>Asked if the US intelligence services were out of control, McCain said: \"There's not been sufficient congressional oversight, and there has been an absolutely disgraceful sharing of information that never should have taken place. For many years, we had an absolute provision that any classified information, which was going to be shared, is based on need-to-know information.\"</p><p>McCain also spoke to the news weekly about reports, prompted by research by the magazine, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/nsa-surveillance-brazil-germany-un-resolution\">that the US had been monitoring the cellphones of German chancellor Angela Merkel</a> and other European leaders. He said it was \"conceivable\" President Obama had not known about the German chancellor's phone being monitored, but added that he should have.</p><p>\"Knowing how angry Angela Merkel was, he should have apologized,\" said McCain. \"You know, I've had to do that on numerous occasions in my life. The pain doesn't last very long.\"</p><p>He was asked about whether the US was a real friend of Germany, following revelations that Merkel's phone had been monitored.</p><p>McCain said: \"Friends spy on friends. We all know that, but there have been certain boundaries. Those boundaries were probably, to some degree, there because we didn't have the capabilities we have now. But when you go to the point where you invade someone's privacy, the leader of certainly Europe, if not one of the most foremost leaders in the world, Angela Merkel, then it was a mistake.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422138193'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/18/1382083833783/NSA-whistleblower-Edward--009.jpg' alt='NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Edward Snowden has reportedly found work in Russia. Photograph: AP</figcaption></figure><p>The interview moved to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/germany-edward-snowden-asylum\">recent discussions in Germany over the possibility of granting asylum to Snowdon</a>, who is currently in Russia. McCain said he did not believe it would happen. \"We're too good of friends,\" he said.</p><p>He said he believed Snowden would never return to the US, where he would face trial, even after his asylum in Russia expires at the end of the year.</p><p>\"[Russian president Vladimir] Putin will grant him asylum indefinitely,\" McCain said. \"The Russians know if they send him back that's a lesson to other people who might defect. I'm sure that Mr Snowden has told them everything that he possibly knows.\"</p><p>Snowden has denied that he has passed information to the Russians, and said he did not take any NSA documents with him. But McCain said: \"If you believe that Mr Snowden didn't give the Russians information that he has, then you believe pigs fly.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422136755|2013-11-11T15:34:14Z|1fbdfb7baf00caa7a668ea5511f4b4e8f1425a18 -->",
