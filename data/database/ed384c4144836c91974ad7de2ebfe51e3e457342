with lung disease and heart disease to closely monitor their symptoms. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Already smoke from bushfires burning in the Blue Mountains region and Muswellbrook areas has been blown east to Sydney city and coastal suburbs.&nbsp;Particle levels are likely to be higher outdoors than indoors, so people sensitive to fine particles should limit the time they spend outside.</p> <p>Bushfires can result in a large amount of smoke particles in the air, even great distances from the fires.&nbsp;The best way to avoid breathing in the smoke is to remain inside with the windows and doors closed, preferably in an air-conditioned building.</p> </blockquote> <p>NSW Health says the particles can&nbsp;cause a variety of health problems, such as itchy or burning eyes, throat irritation or runny nose and aggravate existing illnesses including bronchitis, emphysema and asthma.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525fb0ece4b0010b6627a928\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-17T10:42:06.111+01:00\">8.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ndrewg/statuses/390769526935003136\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The view North from Newcastle this evening.

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13406.htm\" title=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13406.htm\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a> has appealed to Washington to sort out its finances after the US pulled back from the brink of a debt default and hundreds of thousands of federal employees prepared to return to work after a 16-day government shutdown.</p><p>As the US president, Barack Obama, warned: \"We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis,\" the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, appealed for more stability.</p><p>\"It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner,\" she said.</p><p>\"We also continue to encourage the US to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phased-in measures that would not harm the recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan.\"</p><p>A Senate-drafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to the conservatives who had driven the country to the precipice of a new financial crisis was passed by the Republican-dominated House of Representatives just hours before a deadline to extend the US debt limit was to pass.</p><p>The World Bank too expressed its relief that the global economy had \"dodged a potential catastrophe\", with its president, Jim Yong Kim, urging policymakers in all countries to \"continue to focus on crafting and implementing policies that promote economic growth and boost jobs and opportunity for all\".</p><p>Stock markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea initially reflected relief after the Republicans finally capitulated in their failed attempt to undermine Obama's healthcare reforms. But in Asia and Europe stock markets overall displayed a muted reaction with traders apparently expecting another battle in Washington early in 2014.</p><p>The shutdown is estimated to <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/16/government-shutdown-has-cost-us-economy-15bn-a-day-sp-says\" title=\"\">have cost the US $24bn – £1.5bn a day – according to the ratings agency Standard and Poor</a>. China's official Xinhua news agency had accused Washington of jeopardising other countries' dollar assets. China is the US government's largest creditor.</p><p>Obama signed the necessary legislation to fend off a default shortly after midnight on Thursday after a Republican split in the House of Representatives. The bill had passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement. It offers a temporary fix, funding the government until 15 January and raising the debt ceiling until 7 February.</p><p>But the president made clear he did not expect another bitter budget fight and shutdown next year.</p><p>In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would \"lift the cloud of uncertainty\" that had hung over the country in recent weeks.</p><p>\"Once this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately,\" he said, in a statement delivered at the White House. \"Hopefully next time it won't be in the 11th hour. We've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.\"</p><p>As he left the lectern after his Wednesday night press briefing, the president was asked by a journalist whether the crisis would happen all over again in a few months. Speaking over his shoulder, Obama replied: \"No.\"</p><p>Earlier, the Republican senator Mike Lee had struck a defiant tone, perhaps indicating more trouble ahead: \"The media keeps asking: 'Was it worth it?' My answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing,\" he said, adding: \"This is not over.\"</p><p>However, the political deal on Wednesday was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans. None of their stated goals were achieved and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420229420|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|2b036863c93c22f4888f1e820417bd7e3ca14064 -->",

To date, this has simply not occurred and the evidence is now mounting daily in the public arena,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>&ldquo;I therefore request that the Australian federal police investigate this matter. Given the public importance of the matter I further request that the investigation be undertaken as a matter of urgency.&rdquo;</p> <p>While Mitchell upped the ante with his request to the AFP, Labor again on Thursday offered Abbott a process to shut down the now rolling public controversy over parliamentary entitlements.</p> <p>The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, repeated his offer from a couple of weeks ago of bipartisanship in the event the prime minister wants to pursue changes to the current guidelines. Bowen also declared the prime minister must answer questions about the validity of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/16/travel-expenses-mp-claims-for-a-trip-to-cairns-and-buys-property-there\">expenses claims from the Western Australian Liberal MP Don Randall</a>.</p> <p>&ldquo;There is a case for changes here and if the government wants to put forward sensible changes for better guidelines, for less grey area, then we&rsquo;d look at that very sympathetically and in good spirit,&rdquo; Bowen told the ABC.</p> <p>&ldquo;I think the current situation does not pass the common sense test and does not pass the public test which is a fair and reasonable approach to entitlements.&rdquo;</p> <p>Abbott has, thus far at least, resisted all entreaties to either have an inquiry, or tighten the guidelines around expenses.</p> <p>Randall&rsquo;s is the latest controversial case to come to light. An investigation by Fairfax Media in collaboration with readers unearthed travel claims to Cairns appearing to coincide with the outspoken MP&rsquo;s purchase of an investment property in the north Queensland city.</p> <p>Randall is refusing to make a detailed explanation of the claims.</p> <p>Bowen said on Thursday: &ldquo;I think Mr Randall has a lot of questions to answer. He's not dealing with the issue.</p> <p>&ldquo;Simply saying it was official business and the department of finance paid it is simply not good enough. He owes the Australian people a much better explanation than that. I think he owes people a much better explanation than the one he's provided so far, and if he won't give it, Tony Abbott should.&rdquo;</p> <p>The Greens leader, Christine Milne, also called on the major parties to support her party&rsquo;s proposal for an integrity commissioner. &ldquo;I think now the whole community is saying this has to be sorted out,&rdquo; Milne told reporters in Canberra.</p> <p>Milne said an anti-corruption integrity commissioner was &ldquo;actually about the whole of the public service as well as MPs. I think it&rsquo;s long overdue.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;NSW has demonstrated that with the corruption they&rsquo;ve had at a state government level. We need it at a national level,&rdquo; Milne said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420212767|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|f7fb9766580d265f1b680cbe62bba0b8028fb720 -->",

        "body":"<p>The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has defended Kevin Rudd&rsquo;s right to decide whether he stays or whether he quits politics, after Labor&rsquo;s former attorney general Nicola Roxon publicly advised Rudd to quit for the good of the ALP.</p> <p>Bowen told the ABC all former party leaders were entitled to the respect of their colleagues. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter for Kevin Rudd as to how he chooses to make his contribution to the Labor party and the nation going forward,&rdquo; he said on Thursday morning.</p> <p>&ldquo;I think that all former Labor leaders are deserving of respect. All former Labor leaders are deserving of a place in the party&rsquo;s history and they should be accorded the respect that the Labor party has traditionally given to former leaders,&rdquo; he said.</p> <p>Rudd&rsquo;s office says the former prime minister is focused on the future rather than on the internals of the party.</p> <p>Bowen&rsquo;s defence of Rudd follows a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/16/nicola-roxon-says-kevin-rudd-was-a-bastard-who-deserved-his-removal\">blistering critique</a> of Rudd by Roxon on Wednesday night. She used the John Button lecture to blast Rudd&rsquo;s leadership style and his character. The public intervention has reopened the Rudd/Gillard faultline within the ALP.</p> <p>Roxon said in the lecture that Rudd was a &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; who deserved the political bastardry inflicted on him in the leadership coup of 2010.</p> <p>She gave numerous examples of dysfunction within his government and destabilisation after he lost the Labor leadership. Roxon said Rudd&rsquo;s failure to behave with dignity after the ousting defined his character.</p> <p>Roxon&rsquo;s lecture was an extraordinary evisceration of Rudd &ndash; but it was also a more wide-ranging analysis of what went wrong for Labor between 2007 and 2013. She pointed to the lack of a governing strategy, a lack of tolerance for internal argument and dissent, and unproductive fixation with opinion polls.</p> <p>&ldquo;We can want power but we have to want it for a purpose,&rdquo; Roxon said. &ldquo;We have to know how to use that power well and to full effect.&rdquo;</p> <p>Concerning Rudd departing politics for the good of Labor&rsquo;s new leadership team, Roxon said: &ldquo;I believe we also must confront the bitter truth that as long as Kevin remains in parliament, irrespective of how he behaves, pollsters will run comparisons with him and any other leader.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;In my opinion, and it is only my opinion, for the good of the federal parliamentary Labor party and the movement as a whole, Kevin Rudd should leave the parliament &ndash; otherwise the action of any Labor leader will always be tested through the prism of popularity compared to him.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420206890|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|08210ba8f11337d7baa6b88f9cf1035e5ae9c95b -->",

There are also proposals to move the endangered mountain pygmy possum, which is considered vulnerable to warmer temperatures.</p> <p>&ldquo;Climate change will have a huge impact on a lot of species in Australia and where there is no other solution to mitigate the situation, relocation will be a last resort,&rdquo; said Rout. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it being used very widely, but there needs to be a proper formula to it.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420200561|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|d93474637107ba2e337bcd577c7b765a3792d9c5 -->",

None was immediately available to comment.</p> <p>This category marked firms on their disclosure of data such as majority and minority holdings, percentages owned by the parent company and the country of incorporation and operation – all of which is often made &quot;deliberately opaque for the purpose of hiding the proceeds of corruption&quot;, Transparency said.</p> <p>Eleven companies scored zero in this category, nine of them incorporated in China.</p> <p>In the third category, measuring standards of country-by-country reporting of revenues, capital expenditure, income before tax, income tax and community contributions, the Chilean retailing group Falabella scored highest with 50%.</p> <p>Falabella's chief executive,&nbsp;Sandro Solari, said transparency was &quot;a central element in building trust&quot; and it would continue strengthening its ability to deliver information.</p> <p>&quot;Key financial data give citizens the possibility to understand the activities of a particular company in their country and to monitor the appropriateness of their payments to governments,&quot; Transparency said.</p> <p>In a sub-index ranking just the BRICS nations, which the watchdog said account for 20% of global economic output and 15% of world trade, the companies from India were followed by South Africa, Russia, Brazil, then China.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420213720|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|4391a2555e835ed3aba39ad22dfc52e98749f955 -->",

        "headline":"Coal executive turned climate change activist fights for seat on BHP board",
        "body":"<p>A former chairman of the Australian Coal Association, who has accused the fossil fuel industry of &ldquo;stuffing up&rdquo; effective action on climate change, is fighting an insurgent battle to gain a seat on the board of the mining giant BHP Billiton.</p> <p>Ian Dunlop, formerly a senior executive in the oil, gas and coal industries, is attempting to gain shareholder support for his bid to challenge what he claims is &ldquo;utter bullshit&rdquo; from a resources industry that has stymied an urgent transition away from carbon-intensive fuels.</p> <p>The board of BHP, which will hold an annual general meeting in London next week and another in Perth on 21 November, has called on shareholders to reject Dunlop, with the chairman, Jacques Nasser, describing him as a single-issue candidate who would add little to the board.</p> <p>But Dunlop, who will fly to London for the meeting, told Guardian Australia that shareholders were &ldquo;curious&rdquo; about his bid and that BHP required a strong advocate for dealing with the challenge of climate change.</p> <p>&ldquo;This is an unusual situation, which has created a lot of interest among shareholders,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There needs to be a range of perspectives on boards or you get locked into the kind of groupthink that the fossil fuel industry has on climate change.&rdquo;</p> <p>Dunlop has turned to climate change activism after his career in the fossil fuel industry, chairing <a href=\"http://www.safeclimateaustralia.org\">Safe Climate Australia</a> and become a member of the <a href=\"http://www.clubofrome.org\">Club of Rome</a>, which has warned of the limits of sustainable living.</p> <p>He told Guardian Australia that the resources industry had &ldquo;completely ignored the catastrophic risk&rdquo; posed to their business models by climate change.</p> <p>&ldquo;The industry hasn&rsquo;t shown any leadership as it hadn&rsquo;t been prepared to admit what&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If we want to keep below the limit of 2C warming, which is already far too high, we cannot continue ad infinitum in Australia talking about doubling our coal exports and tripling our gas exports.</p> <p>&ldquo;BHP, to be fair to them, is doing more than most but when I look around the boardrooms of Australia, the UK or US I see absolutely no recognition of the strategic implications of climate change.</p> <p>&ldquo;These businesses have got a horrendous problem when it comes to [climate] risk management. Waiting until it is too late and then being forced to do something in a panic isn&rsquo;t risk management in my book.</p> <p>&ldquo;There is a mind block towards it. Some [executives] are in denial while others have this gently, gently approach, whereas the reality is far more urgent. You simply can&rsquo;t do business in a world with 4C of warming. Shareholder value will go down the tubes.&rdquo;</p> <p>Dunlop said governments had abrogated their responsibility to lead on climate change, while the resources industry had failed to take the initiative owing to its focus on short-term profit.</p> <p>&ldquo;The industry used to have nation builders but now it has technocrats with a short-term focus,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Their arguments are utter bullshit. Utter nonsense. We have a global problem and if we all sit on our hands we&rsquo;ll all commit suicide together.</p> <p>&ldquo;[Environment minister] Greg Hunt&rsquo;s approach won&rsquo;t do anything, so we need business leaders capable of articulating the problem. The likes of Rio Tinto and the Minerals Council express great concern about climate change but then allow [others] to whiteant any action.</p> <p>&ldquo;[The industry has been] actively stuffing up carbon pricing for the past decade. That&rsquo;s just not acceptable anymore.&rdquo;</p> <p>Dunlop admitted that it was &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; for shareholders to ignore a board&rsquo;s advice on director appointments but said he was hopeful of winning them around.</p> <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be on the board to destroy the joint,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;BHP is a diversified miner and has got a solid, long future, but it has got to get out of fossil fuels.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420220890|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|1cc2771a849e0bcd394c43e3b765e800162f75f8 -->",

        "body":"<p>A typhoon has killed 17 people in Japan, but largely spared the capital and brushed by the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power station.</p><p>More than 50 people were missing after  typhoon Wipha roared up Japan's east coast, including two schoolboys engulfed by waves on a beach; 20 more were hurt by falls or being struck by flying debris. About 20,000 people were told to leave their homes because of the danger of flooding and hundreds of flights were cancelled.</p><p>Sixteen people were killed on Izu Oshima island, about 75 miles (120km) south of Tokyo, as rivers burst their banks. The storm set off mudslides along a mile-long stretch of mountains.</p><p>Wipha sustained winds of 78mph (126km/h) with gusts up to 180km/h.</p><p>Television footage showed roads clogged with wreckage and houses with gaping holes smashed into them.</p><p>\"I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,\" a woman on Izu Oshima told NHK television.</p><p>The storm brought hurricane-force winds and torrential rain to the Tokyo metropolitan area of 30 million people at the peak of the morning rush-hour.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The operator of the Fukushima nuclear plant, Tokyo Electric Power Corp, cancelled all offshore work and secured machinery as the storm approached.</p><p>The operator, known as Tepco, has been struggling to contain radioactive leaks since a 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused extensive damage and triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.</p><p>A Tepco spokesman said Typhoon Wipha had caused no new problems at the plant, which is on the coast 130 miles (220km) north of Tokyo.</p><p>The storm dumped heavy rain that had to be pumped out of protective containers at the base of about 1,000 tanks storing radioactive water, the byproduct of a jerry-rigged cooling system designed to control wrecked reactors.</p><p>The rainwater was checked for radioactivity and released into the sea, the company spokesman said.</p><p>Wipha has  been down-graded to a tropical depression.</p><p></p><p>During the height of the storm, more than 500 flights at Tokyo's Haneda and Narita airports were cancelled, and thousands of schools closed.Typhoon Wipha was the strongest storm to hit the region since October 2004. That cyclone triggered floods and landslides that killed almost 100 people, forced thousands from their homes and caused billions of dollars in damage.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420096438|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|d4cdef13116f8499d3f2a33523fa5ff5b8c6e4e2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Australian special forces have been implicated in the deaths of a young boy and his father who were found shot dead after a night raid on a neighbouring house in southern Afghanistan last month.</p> <p>Locals allege the two civilians were killed when Australian forces fired through the roof while entering the house next door where an insurgent was hiding, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/australian-forces-accused-over-deaths-of-afghan-father-and-son-20131016-2vn3v.html\">reports Fairfax Media</a>. The raid was carried out on the night of 27 September in Bulagh, west of Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan province.</p> <p>Locals found the boy and his father after Australian forces left the house. They reportedly had bullet wounds and were lying under a blanket in a bed. The six-year-old boy was on his father&rsquo;s chest and there was evidence that someone had tried to give him medical attention, it was claimed.</p> <p>Fairfax also reported that Australian forces had paid compensation.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Australian Department of Defence told Guardian Australia that a possible civilian casualty incident on that date was under investigation.</p> <p>&ldquo;The government of Afghanistan and Isaf [International Security Assistance Force] headquarters have been informed of the incident,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>&ldquo;The ADF takes all reasonable steps to ensure its operations do not put the lives of civilians and non-combatants in jeopardy. Deployed ADF personnel operate under strict rules of engagement designed to minimise the risk to civilians.&rdquo;</p> <p>In August, Australian elite special forces troops were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/30/afghanistan-defence-adf-misconduct-insurgents\">accused of misconduct</a>, including severing the hands of deceased insurgents.</p> <p>In March, Afghan officials blamed Australian soldiers for the deaths of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/australian-soldiers-kill-afghan-children-aged-seven-and-eight-8517896.html\">two young children</a> who were tending cattle.</p> <p>In March 2011 Australian troops killed a man suspected of being an insurgent and a young boy. A <a href=\"http://news.defence.gov.au/2013/05/16/release-of-inquiry-officers-report-into-previously-reported-27-march-civilian-casualty-incident/\">defence report into the case</a> found the actions of Australian troops were &ldquo;lawful and in accordance with the rules of engagement&rdquo;, said the chief of joint operations, Lieutenant General Ash Power.</p> <p>&ldquo;The child&rsquo;s fatal injuries and the death of the Afghan man were the result of the partnered force being engaged by insurgents,&rdquo; the report said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420208221|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|932fce992fd98c0eee29eb1e1a1f42a4037b96b1 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Queensland government has pledged to allay UN concerns about the Great Barrier Reef by preventing any major new ports until 2022, but environmentalists have accused it of conducting a &ldquo;greenwash&rdquo; that will do little to protect the vast coral ecosystem.</p> <p>A draft Queensland <a href=\"http://www.dsdip.qld.gov.au/resources/plan/draft-qps-consultation.pdf\">ports strategy</a>, released on Thursday, prohibits deepwater port facilities and seabed dredging outside five &ldquo;priority port development areas&rdquo; &ndash; Brisbane, Mackay, Gladstone, Townsville and Abbot Point &ndash; over the next decade.</p> <p>Jeff Seeney, Queensland&rsquo;s deputy premier, said the plan &ldquo;aligns&rdquo; with recommendations made by Unesco that there should be no new port development alongside the Great Barrier Reef, in order to avoid the ecosystem being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/18/great-barrier-reef-united-nations\">listed as &ldquo;in danger&rdquo; next year</a>.</p> <p>&ldquo;We need to find a sensible way forward and work within the existing port networks to ensure our state can still do business but not put at risk our greatest natural asset, the Great Barrier Reef,&rdquo; said Seeney.</p> <p>However, the plan makes no mention of protecting the Fitzroy delta on the largest estuary flowing into the reef, in what amounts to an apparent snub to Greg Hunt, the federal environment minister.</p> <p>Last month, Hunt said that following talks with the state government he was &ldquo;very hopeful that we are able to protect this wonderful area&rdquo;.</p> <p>But the ports strategy doesn&rsquo;t cite any mitigation of the effects of a proposed terminal on the delta that would export 22m tonnes of coal a year. Conservationists claim the development would destroy a pristine area that is home to a sub-species of the rare snubfin dolphin and other prized marine creatures such as sea turtles.</p> <p>Hunt told Guardian Australia: &ldquo;Whilst this is a draft report, it is a positive step to the long-term protection of the Great Barrier Reef. This report is in line with the Unesco design to consolidate port footprints. The draft report identifies five areas for development and Balaclava island (on the Fitzroy delta) is not one of them.&rdquo;</p> <p>Environmental campaigners point out that Unesco has called for no expansion of existing ports that threaten the &ldquo;outstanding universal values&rdquo; of the reef, as well as a halt to new ports. They claim that sediment disturbed by dredging, to allow more ships to access ports, severely damages marine life.</p> <p>&ldquo;Unesco was very clear about the expansion of existing ports but that seems to have been conveniently forgotten by the Queensland government,&rdquo; said Felicity Wishart, campaign director at the <a href=\"http://www.marineconservation.org.au\">Australian Marine Conservation Society</a>. &ldquo;This just seems like a business as usual destruction of the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>&ldquo;We would&rsquo;ve liked to see an explicit ban on dumping dredged spoil onto the reef and the protection of places such as the Fitzroy delta. Instead, we are spending more money on expanding coal export ports at a time when existing ports are operating well below capacity and the price of coal is falling.&rdquo;</p> <p>Greenpeace also criticised the strategy, claiming that it won&rsquo;t prevent a single port development proposal or dredging in the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area.</p> <p>\"It's a complete con for the government to claim they are doing the right thing for the environment, it's nothing more than greenwash,\" said Greenpeace Queensland campaigner Louise Matthiesson.</p> <p>\"There are already proposals for around 40m tonnes of dredging along the Great Barrier Reef coast, and the ports strategy will allow all of that to go ahead,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>\"The five priority port areas earmarked for fast-tracked development include large undeveloped natural areas like Keppel Bay near Yeppoon and Abbot Point near Bowen, which have incredible natural beauty and environmental significance.</p> <p>\"The World Heritage committee will be deciding next June whether to list the reef as 'in danger' and we'll be making sure they understand what this policy really means for the future of the reef.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420211591|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|579cbc2fece1b3ecbe77e771c5a9d0af0f7cc5c2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Iran signalled the possibility of significant concessions over its nuclear programme in talks that closed on Wednesday, bringing the prospect of a breakthrough closer than at any time in the last decade, according to western diplomats.</p><p>A senior US official said that for the first time the two sides were at the start of negotiations \"where one could imagine that you could possibly have an agreement\". The White House said the presentation Iran brought to Geneva was \"a new proposal with a level of seriousness and substance\" not seen before.</p><p>However, both western and Iranian officials cautioned that there was a huge amount of diplomatic work still to be done to hammer out a trade-off between western sanctions relief and Iranian acceptance of curbs on its uranium enrichment and other nuclear work. All sides agreed to reconvene on a senior level on 7 November, with lower-level expert discussions before that.</p><p>Those discussions will focus on Iranian indications in Geneva that Tehran could agree limits on its nuclear programme that ensure it can be used for peaceful purposes, and ultimately accept more stringent international monitoring. Iran has also requested that the US delegation bring financial experts to go into detail on how the economic straitjacket on Iran could be loosened.</p><p>Diplomats from a six-nation negotiating group who took part in the two days of talks in Geneva said they were unlike any that had gone before. One western official said the two-day meeting in Geneva marked the beginning of the first true negotiations between Iran and the west since the Iranian nuclear programme first came to light in 2002.</p><p>\"Before, the Iranians came to make speeches. This had a completely different tone and atmosphere,\" said a western official. \"Everything was on the table and we discussed everything in depth.\"</p><p>In an unprecedented joint statement, the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who chairs the six-nation group, and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, described the two days in Geneva as \"substantive and forward-looking negotiations\". It noted that Zarif had begun the meeting by presenting \"an outline of a plan as a proposed basis for negotiation, which is being carefully considered by the [six-nation group] as an important contribution.\"</p><p>Very few details of Zarif's PowerPoint presentation, entitled Closing an Unnecessary Crisis: Opening New Horizons, were released. However, Iranian and western diplomats made clear that the plan involved a timetable that included initial confidence-building steps at the start, implemented within the first six months, leading eventually to a comprehensive and permanent settlement, in which Iran could pursue a peaceful atomic programme without suffering punitive measures.</p><p>Iranian officials said they had put on the table a variety of possible limitations on Iran's enrichment of uranium in return for sanctions relief and international recognition of Iran's sovereign right to carry out enrichment, which is necessary to make both power reactor fuel and fissile material for weapons.</p><p>To reassure the international community that the Iranian programme was entirely peaceful, the Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said Tehran could contemplate acceptance of more intensive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The inspections regime, known as the additional protocol, allows inspectors to go to sites where they suspect there could be nuclear-related activity, and not just those declared by Iran.</p><p>However, both Araqchi and Zarif, in a press conference at the end of the negotiations, stressed that acceptance of the protocol could only come at the end of negotiations and was currently ruled out by Iran's parliament, the Majlis.</p><p>In return, western officials have signalled that a final settlement could include a form of words that acknowledges Iran's enrichment of uranium as an established fact, as long as it is limited to producing low-enriched uranium necessary for a peaceful power-generating programme.</p><p>\"I've been doing this now for about two years,\" a senior US official said, \"and I have never had such intense, detailed, straightforward, candid conversations with the Iranian delegation before.\"</p><p>The official added: \"Although there remain many differences in each area, and what sanctions relief might be appropriate, specific and candid discussions took place.\"</p><p>The two days of talks were completed despite severe back pains that came close to immobilising Zarif. He was accompanied by a doctor, underwent acupuncture during the talks and arrived at a concluding press conference in a wheelchair to be lifted bodily onstage. However, his health problems provided common ground with his western counterparts.</p><p>\"There is no one among us that doesn't have a back problem with all the flying we all do,\" the American official said. \"Every one of us had a back story for him, and had suggestions for books he should read, things he could try.\"</p><p>William Hague hailed the Geneva talks as the first substantive discussions with Iran \"on how to address the international community's serious concerns about Iran's nuclear programme\".</p><p>\"I hope that negotiations will lead soon to concrete results. Iran will need to take the necessary first steps on its programme and we are ready to take proportionate steps in return. It is important that we maintain the positive momentum of the negotiations but we should not forget that Iran's nuclear programme is continuing to develop. There is a great deal of hard work ahead, but we must not waste this opportunity.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420183250|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|d0200e245a88ca3b92387433f18ab5a101231460 -->",

        "body":"<p>An Australian Greenpeace activist detained in Russia on piracy charges will have his bail hearing later on Thursday, along with three other members of the &ldquo;Arctic 30&rdquo;.</p> <p>Colin Russell, a 59-year-old marine radio operator from Tasmania, is one of the Greenpeace group &ndash; 28 activists and two freelance journalists &ndash; held in Murmansk, north-west Russia, after security forces detained them last month during a direct action in the Pechora Sea.</p> <p>On Wednesday, New Zealander Jonathon Beauchamp was denied bail, along with three others. All members of the group have been charged with piracy and could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. None has received bail so far.</p> <p>Relatives of some of the six British citizens held in Murmansk <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/16/greenpeace-arctic-30-families-appeal-release\">met with UK foreign office officials on Wednesday and appealed in public for their release</a>.</p> <p>Clifford Harris, father of Alexandra Harris, 27, a Greenpeace digital communications officer based in Sydney and holding Australian residency, said: \"It's a traumatic time for all of us and we just want to see an end to this as soon as possible &hellip; The Russian legal system we can do nothing about. We just hope and pray that they conduct this in a sensible manner.\"</p> <p>Harris said they had managed to speak to Alexandra on Friday night and that she was doing well given the \"fairly basic\" conditions of her captivity.</p> <p>\"She's not complaining about how she's treated,\" he said. \"She's terrified &ndash; she's certainly not used to living in that sort of situation &ndash; but mentally she was holding it together quite well, which surprises us because she's a very sensitive girl.\"</p> <p>Greenpeace says the Russian Presidential Human Rights Council will submit an appeal against the arrests to the prosecutor general of the Russian Federation later this week.</p> <p>The Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, raised Russell&rsquo;s case with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Igor Morgulov, at the Apec summit earlier in the month. Greenpeace says Russell is receiving consular assistance in Murmansk.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420201656|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|b43f0955ca33c644a8827abb4d597dce20150ce9 -->",

        "body":"<p>A campaign donation by internet entrepreneur and alleged copyright pirate Kim Dotcom has forced the resignation of a New Zealand government minister.</p> <p>John Banks resigned on Wednesday as minister for regulatory reform and small business after the Auckland district court ordered him to stand trial over allegations of electoral fraud relating to Dotcom&rsquo;s NZ$50,000 ($44,144) donation.</p> <p>Banks is accused of knowingly filing a false election return in his failed 2010 Auckland mayoral bid, listing donations from Dotcom and casino operator SkyCity Entertainment Group Ltd as anonymous when he knew who they were from &ndash; an offence under the Electoral Act.</p> <p>He denies the allegations.</p> <p>Banks&rsquo;s resignation as a minister in John Key&rsquo;s government is the latest twist in Dotcom&rsquo;s New Zealand story. Armed police stormed the German&rsquo;s Auckland mansion in January last year after the US alleged his Megaupload cloud-storage internet site was at the centre of the biggest copyright infringement case in its history. Key was later forced to apologise to Dotcom &ndash; who still faces extradition to the US &ndash; over the government&rsquo;s illegal spying on him.</p> <p>Dotcom gave evidence that Banks asked him to split his donation into two NZ$25,000 cheques after Banks was flown in Dotcom&rsquo;s private helicopter to his mansion in 2010, Fairfax Media reported.</p> <p>&ldquo;I was offended. I don&rsquo;t mind if people know,&rdquo; Dotcom told the court, according to Fairfax.</p> <p>Dotcom said Banks told him: &ldquo;Kim, if I help you in the future it&rsquo;s better no one knows about your donation.&rdquo;</p> <p>Banks has said he cannot recall the helicopter ride and is innocent of the charges.</p> <p>&ldquo;I have nothing to fear and I have nothing to hide,&rdquo; he told state broadcaster Television New Zealand.</p> <p>Banks is the leader of the ACT party, which supports Key&rsquo;s minority government. Banks did not hold a cabinet-level position and remains in parliament, meaning the resignation of his portfolios does not pose a risk to the government.</p> <p>&ldquo;Mr Banks maintains his innocence but realises this is a distraction for the government,&rsquo;&rsquo; Key said. &ldquo;If Mr Banks is successful on appeal or proved to be not guilty at trial, it is my intention to reinstate him as a minister.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420200484|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|9f94c893d581f9bad57d20a6cc2514113aceefce -->",

        "body":"<p>A Coalition MP has threatened to sue a Queensland-based scuba diving instructor who took out a newspaper advertisement warning that voters might &ldquo;dump&rdquo; him over his support for port development alongside the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>George Christensen, the federal member for Dawson, told Guardian Australia that he was &ldquo;seeking legal advice&rdquo; over the ad, which was placed by Tony Fontes in two local newspapers, the Whitsunday Times and Mackay Daily Mercury.</p> <p>The ad showed two pictures of Christensen, below the text &ldquo;George Christensen has said the reef tourism industry needed to be protected from dredge dumping. But then they got to him.&rdquo;</p> <p>One picture of Christensen is next to a speech bubble showing a quote from February, when the MP said he had &ldquo;major concerns&rdquo; about proposed dredging and dumping of the seabed to enlarge the Abbot Point coal port, which is near the town of Bowen.</p> <p>The other picture shows a quote from Christensen in May, which shows an apparent change of position, with the MP asking the federal environment minister to approve the dredging. The ad contains the text &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dump on the reef, George, or people might dump you.&rdquo;</p> <p>Environmentalists claim that dredging spoil from Abbot Point would adversely impact marine life such as dugongs, dolphins and sea turtles. The Gladstone Ports Corporation, which has proposed the development, has denied there will be any long-term effects.</p> <p>Christensen has written to the Bowen Independent to claim that Fontes, who stood as a Greens candidate in 2004, is &ldquo;more concerned about shutting down all mining than any impact on fishing or tourism&rdquo;.</p> <p>&ldquo;I maintain that people who want to stop the Abbot Point port expansion for the sake of stopping all mining are extremists,&rdquo; he added.</p> <p>Christensen wrote that there was broad community support for the Abbot Point expansion, accusing Fontes of failing to take up an offer to meet with him to discuss concerns over the impact on the tourism industry.</p> <p>&ldquo;Instead, he chose to run a defamatory half-page advertisement in the local newspaper in Airlie beach that insinuated I was &lsquo;on the take&rsquo; for pushing for the Abbot Point expansion,&rdquo; Christensen wrote. &ldquo;Mr Fontes can expect legal action as a result of that public assertion. Mr Fontes and his fellow extreme Greens assume anyone supporting jobs and development must be in the pockets of big business.&rdquo;</p> <p>Fontes, who placed the ad on behalf of the <a href=\"http://www.ouchvolunteers.com\">Order of Underwater Coral Heroes</a> volunteer group, was unavailable for comment on the legal threat.</p> <p>The scuba instructor has, however, previously spoken about the environmental threats faced by the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>&ldquo;I have lived and worked as a dive instructor in the Whitsundays for 30 years,&rdquo; he told WWF.</p> <p>&ldquo;The most notable change has been the increase in coral bleaching each year during the summer months. In the early 1980s bleaching was a non-event, &ndash; rarely, if ever, noted. By the mid-1990s, bleaching was seen regularly each summer by myself as well as other divers.</p> <p>&ldquo;If the coral reefs of the world are to survive, we cannot afford the predicted two to three degree increase in ocean temperature. But we also need to look at the more local picture and work to reduce all impacts on the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>&ldquo;This would include improving the water quality of the reef. I feel that Australia needs to lead the way. After all, we have as much to lose as any country. Perhaps more.</p> <p>&ldquo;It is going to be hard to explain to our kids how we lost the Great Barrier Reef.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420223299|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|b69a8fec18843d14c5c66bec5ec4be0d96601446 -->",

        "body":"<p>Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, has revealed more details of the media organization he is creating with journalist Glenn Greenwald.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/15/glenn-greenwald-announces-departure-guardian\">Greenwald announced on Tuesday that he was leaving the Guardian</a>, where he has broken a series of stories on the National Security Agency, based on documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p> <p>In an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pressthink.org/2013/10/why-pierre-omidyar-decided-to-join-forces-with-glenn-greenwald-for-a-new-venture-in-news/\">interview with Jay Rosen</a>, media critic and NYU professor of journalism, Omidyar said he was committing an initial $250m to the as-yet-unnamed venture. Omidyar told Rosen the decision was fuelled by his &ldquo;rising concern about press freedoms in the United States and around the world&rdquo;.</p> <p>Omidyar said he hopes the project will promote &ldquo;independent journalists with expertise, and a voice and a following&rdquo; while using Silicon Valley knowhow to build an audience. &ldquo;Companies in Silicon Valley invest a lot in understanding their users and what drives user engagement,&rdquo; Omidyar said. The company will be online only and all proceeds will be reinvested in journalism.</p> <p>In a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://omidyargroup.com/pov/2013/10/16/my-next-adventure-in-journalism/#.Ul7elruHe_H\">blogpost,&nbsp;</a>the eBay billionaire revealed that he had been exploring a purchase of the Washington Post, which was ultimately bought by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.</p> <p>&ldquo;That process got me thinking about what kind of social impact could be created if a similar investment was made in something entirely new, built from the ground up. Something that I would be personally and directly involved in outside of my other efforts as a philanthropist,&rdquo; wrote Omidyar.</p> <p>&ldquo;I developed an interest in supporting independent journalists in a way that leverages their work to the greatest extent possible, all in support of the public interest. And, I want to find ways to convert mainstream readers into engaged citizens. I think there&rsquo;s more that can be done in this space, and I&rsquo;m eager to explore the possibilities,&rdquo; he wrote.</p> <p>Omidyar said he was in the &ldquo;very early stages of creating a new mass media organization. I don&rsquo;t yet know how or when it will be rolled out, or what it will look like.&rdquo; He said the organization would cover general news as well as investigative journalism.</p> <p>&ldquo;As part of my learning process, I recently reached out to Glenn Greenwald to find out what journalists like him need to do their jobs well. As it turns out, he and his colleagues Laura Poitras [video documentarian] and Jeremy Scahill [author and national security expert], were already on a path to create an online space to support independent journalists. We had a lot of overlap in terms of our ideas, and decided to join forces,&rdquo; wrote Omidyar.</p> <p>&ldquo;I have always been of the opinion that the right kind of journalism is a critical part of our democracy,&rdquo; he told Rosen.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420187659|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|11b8e91018fd8650290bfecac952a713f8404937 -->",

        "body":"<p>Outdoor air pollution has been officially classified as carcinogenic by the cancer arm of the World Health Organisation.</p><p>The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said air pollution from traffic and industrial fumes was a definite cause of lung cancer and also linked to bladder cancer. The strong verdict from IARC, a cautious body that pronounces only when the evidence is strong, will put pressure on governments to take action.</p><p>\"The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances,\" said Dr Kurt Straif, head of the IARC monographs section, which assesses evidence and publishes official warnings. \"We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths.\"</p><p>Air pollution is already known to increase the risks for other diseases, including heart and respiratory disease. The numbers of those exposed to air pollution have risen rapidly as countries have industrialised. The most recent data suggests there were 233,000 deaths from lung cancer caused by air pollution around the world in 2010.</p><p>IARC monitors studies on cancer risks and issues official monographs when it has come to conclusions about a potential carcinogen. It has put out warnings about individual chemicals in the air. Diesel engine exhaust, solvents, metals and dusts have all been labelled carcinogenic. This is the first time it has classified air pollution in general as a cause of cancer.</p><p>\"Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants,\" said Dr Dana Loomis, deputy head of the monographs section.</p><p>\"The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution.\"</p><p>The main sources of air pollution are traffic, power stations, industrial and agricultural emissions and heating and cooking fumes from the home, the IARC said. The levels of air pollution vary from place to place, but every country in the world was affected and should do something about it, it said.</p><p>\"Classifying outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic to humans is an important step,\" said the IARC director, Dr Christopher Wild. \"There are effective ways to reduce air pollution and, given the scale of the exposure affecting people worldwide, this report should send a strong signal to the international community to take action without further delay.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420243863|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|44623540d2ce9efc865cb5a7ab8d3fb4fa6a9a57 -->",

        "body":"<p>Facebook has removed a restriction for users under 18 that limited who could see their online posts.</p> <p>Facebook said teenagers would now be able to manually alter the setting and share information with the public. Until now, posts by those who registered their age as less than 18 could be viewed only by their friends, and by friends of their friends. </p> <p>\"Teens are among the savviest people using of social media, and whether it comes to civic engagement, activism, or their thoughts on a new movie, they want to be heard,\" Facebook said in an announcement of the changes.</p> <p>\"While only a small fraction of teens using Facebook might choose to post publicly, this update now gives them the choice to share more broadly, just like on other social media services,\" the company said.</p> <p>Facebook is under increasing competition for younger users from a new crop of mobile and social services, such as SnapChat and WhatsApp.</p> <p>The executive director of the non-profit Center for Digital Democracy, Jeffrey Chester, said Facebook was sacrificing the safety and privacy of teenage users to further its business.</p> <p>\"Teens don't necessarily have good judgment and to the extent that they make themselves visible to the wider public, there's all kind of people &ndash; from predators to junk food marketers &ndash; who are surveilling Facebook for new kinds of targets,\" Chester said.</p> <p>Other social media services also allow teens to share information with the broader public. But Chester said the amount of personal information users had on Facebook was much more extensive than on other social services, where users can create accounts with pseudonyms.</p> <p>Facebook said teenage users would now also be allowed to use the \"Follow\" feature, which lets strangers automatically receive public posts from another user without requiring that the two be connected on the service as mutual friends.</p> <p>Facebook's manager of privacy and public policy, Nicky Jackson Colaco, said the changes would allow teenagers to share information that might benefit from dissemination to a broader audience, such as information about fundraising efforts, or a teen rock band trying to promote an upcoming performance.</p> <p>The 16-year-old Pakistani activist&nbsp;Malala Yousafzai would not have been able to use Facebook as a broad communication channel under the previous policy, said Stephen Balkam, of the Family Online Safety Institute, a non-profit body that receives funding from several internet companies, including Facebook.</p> <p>Facebook said it would show teenage users a special notice the first couple of times they attempted to post information to the public, reminding the user that the post can be seen by anyone.</p> <p>The restrictions on teen use of Facebook's private messaging feature will not change, with users under 18 able to receive messages only from their friends and from friends of their friends.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420198663|2013-10-17T12:53:04Z|4007eb34e9b72da81a8a237ab2669ff8e6cf565e -->",
