        "body":"<p>Games Three and Four of the 2013 World Series ended in strange, to say the least, circumstances. The St Louis Cardinals <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/27/obstruction-call-cardinals-world-series-game-three-red-sox\">won Game Three with an incredibly rare obstruction call</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/28/boston-red-sox-tie-world-series-st-louis-cardinals\">the Boston Red Sox won Game Four with a walk-off pickoff</a>, not such a rare play, but unique in World Series game-ending circumstances.</p> <p>This prompted us to consider the strangest ends to sporting events:</p> <h2>Devon Loch, Grand National 1956</h2> <p>The Queen Mother's horse Devon Loch was well fancied to win the 1956 Grand National and with just a few lengths to go looked a clear winner when suddenly and inexplicably the horse jumped, landed on its stomach and was overtaken by E.S.B. Devon Loch's rider was Dick Francis, who went on to become a famed thriller and crime writer.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62fPLtL8h7s\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/62fPLtL8h7s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <h2>The Play, California Golden Bears vs Stanford Cardinal, 1982</h2> <p>With four seconds remaining, Stanford had taken a 20-19 lead but then a kick-off return featuring five lateral passes earned the Golden Bears a controversial, game-winning touchdown. Not least because the Stanford Band was already on the field celebrating the victory. The incident became known as The Play.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfebpLfAt8g\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mfebpLfAt8g?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <h2>Cella Renda vs Paul Samuels, 2009</h2> <p>Middleweights Cella Renda and Paul Samuels were in the second round of their bout when both connected with left hooks. Both hit the canvas. It wasn't quite the end though, as both beat the count. The referee stopped the fight in the next round, giving victory to the 36-year-old Samuel.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCU389zi4wc\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCU389zi4wc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>For more fight-ending boxing weirdness, how about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=843Wc2uah0s\">this Mother deciding that her son has had enough</a>. Or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKoAlpWD_Lg\">the&nbsp;Riddick Bowe vs Evander Holyfield fight featuring a parachutist</a>.</p> <h2>Alex Bogomolov vs Bradley Klahn, 2013</h2> <p>Alex Bogomolov was trailing American Bradley Klahn 2-1 in the third and final set at the Nielsen USTA Pro Tennis Championship, Winnetka, when he just decided to stop playing. Had there been a call of &quot;out&quot; from the stands? Was that enough reason to give up?</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHifflPwDlc\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gHifflPwDlc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <h2>England vs South Africa, Cricket World Cup, 1992</h2> <p>The 1992 Cricket World Cup semi-final was finely poised with South Africa needing 22 runs to win from 13 balls when there was a brief rain interruption. After the break the competition's <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/508066.html\">controversial rain rules</a> came into play and South Africa required an impossible 21 runs from one ball.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ofJEcdFMe8\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ofJEcdFMe8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>Please feel free to add further examples in the comments below.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421126842|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|80633d18f5713aa3450004b498f8bd64af0cd9a8 -->",

        "headline":"Kell Brook calls out Amir Khan after stopping Vyacheslav Senchenko",
        "body":"<p>Kell Brook had what he wanted but talk quickly turned to what else he could ask for. Unsurprisingly, it was the promoter who was saying the most, with Eddie Hearn insisting Brook, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/27/kell-brook-vyacheslav-senchenko-boxing\" title=\"\">having finished off Vyacheslav Senchenko inside four rounds</a>, was ready for the mandatory International Boxing Federation welterweight title shot coming his way. However, he would also consider other challenges, specifically taking on the man he has called out more than once already – Amir Khan.</p><p>\"The IBF will send a letter out to us on 18 December and we've then got 90 days to make that fight happen, but I've been working on all kinds of options and the obvious one is Amir Khan,\" Hearn said. \"We're led to believe he's close to a fight with [Floyd] Mayweather but if that doesn't happen, that's a fight we'd love. Kell wants to win a world title, but he'd take the Khan fight for no world title.\"</p><p>Brook versus Khan is a mouth-watering prospect and, as Hearn confidently suggested, could sell out a football stadium in this country. But after years of trading insults there is no real sense the pair will meet any time soon, especially with Khan so keen to finally step up from light-welterweight to welterweight and head straight into a career-defining, bank-busting showdown with Mayweather Jr before the American packs up for good.</p><p>Brook, too, has his own long-standing target and as he hurled more mud at Khan and his potential showdown with the self-styled \"Pretty Boy\" – \"he doesn't deserve that fight, but this is boxing; money talks and bullshit walks\" – there was a sense that the 27-year-old's primary aim was to nail down his world-title shot which, until late on Saturday, was proving agonisingly out of reach.</p><p>Having beaten the Argentinian Hector Saldivia in an IBF eliminator at this venue 12 months ago, Brook saw three fights with the champion Devon Alexander fall through. Twice, in January and May, it was an injury to the Sheffield man that forced the cancellation and with many observers, as well as some in his own camp, beginning to doubt Brook's ambitions, it felt as if he may have blown his big chance. As Hearn said here: \"Kell could've fizzled out of the sport.\"</p><p>Having dispatched Carson Jones in his rematch with the American three months ago, Brook found himself back in Sheffield on Saturday night and back within one fight of a title shot. Senchenko came into this bout as a former World Boxing Association champion with 34 wins to his name – in the 33rd he ended Ricky Hatton's career with a one-punch knockout in the Mancunian's comeback fight last November. It was no great shock to see Brook start cautiously against the tall and rangy Ukrainian but he soon picked up the pace and floored Senchenko with a swinging right in the third.</p><p>The 36-year-old recovered and showed his power with a big right of his own early in the fourth which rocked Brook back on to the ropes. Panic gripped the 8,000-plus crowd in attendance but the hometown boy soon re-established control and flattened Senchenko for good with a left-right combination midway through the same round.</p><p>It is now 31 straight wins for Brook and he has the reward of facing the winner of Alexander and Shawn Porter's contest in Texas next month. Such is boxing politics and posturing that Brook could yet be denied that opportunity, hence why he and Hearn were so keen, and wise,  to talk up a fight with Khan, and even the hugely talented and outrageously egotistical Adrien Broner.</p><p>It is now about negotiating positions and before potentially making it fourth-time lucky against Alexander, Brook's hand is undeniably a strong one.</p><p>\"I got a lot of stick for what happened with the Alexander fight, so I knew I had something to prove,\" said Brook. \"Nothing's going to stop me now getting that world title.\"</p><p>Achieving that would make Brook the fourth graduate of Brendan Ingle's much lauded Wincobank gym to reach boxing's summit, following in the footsteps of Jonny Nelson, Junior Witter and, Brook's childhood hero, Naseem Hamed. In front of the watching Ingle, the boy who dreamt of being the new Prince moved one step closer to becoming a king.</p><p>Earlier, Anthony Joshua comfortably came through his second professional fight. The 24-year-old, who won super heavyweight gold at the London Olympics and beat the Italian Emanuele Leo with a first-round knockout in his first pro contest just three weeks ago, stopped the veteran Paul Butlin in the second round of their six-round bout after planting a powerful right on the 37-year-old, who could barely see after suffering a horrendous cut to his eye in the opening round.</p><p>\"I'm now beginning to think about what I'm doing and not just throwing shots for the fun of it,\" said Joshua, having confirmed he will fight again on 14 November.</p><p>Another fighter who secured a world title-shot on Saturday was Brian Rose, albeit with a controversial split-decision victory over Javier Maciel. Rose struggled to assert any control over the aggressive Argentinian but the 28-year-old from Blackpool got the decision and is  scheduled to face the winner of Demetrius Andrade and Vanes Martirosyan's contest for the vacant WBO title in Texas next month.</p><p>Far more impressive was the super middleweight Callum Smith, who stopped another Argentinian, Ruben Acosta, with a clubbing body shot in the sixth round. Smith, the youngest and, many believe, most talented of Liverpool's four fighting Smith brothers, had stopped all of his previous six opponents in the first round and so benefited from more ring-time here, albeit against a limited opponent.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421063110|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|76774cf95670fc2f01f002685841f875020587d6 -->",

        "headline":"Bernard Hopkins becomes oldest fighter to retain world boxing title",
        "body":"<p>Winning has never been a problem for Bernard Hopkins. Entertaining while doing it hasn't come quite as easy.&nbsp;Neither was a problem on Saturday night.</p> <p>The 48-year-old from Philadelphia rolled to a unanimous decision over Germany&rsquo;s Karo Murat to defend his IBF light heavyweight title at Boardwalk Hall. Seven months after surpassing his own record as the oldest fighter in history to win a major world championship, Hopkins defended it convincingly before 6,324 fans at Boardwalk Hall, many of whom made the 62-mile trip up the Atlantic City Expressway from his hometown. Two of the judges at ringside scored it 119-108, while the third had it 117-110.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fourteen months from his 50th birthday, Hopkins (54-6-2, 32 KOs) continues to humble younger, stronger opponents who are no match for his skill, experience and intelligence. Saturday marked his sixth consecutive fight against an opponent born in the 1980s &ndash; and yet another performance that embodied the ring generalship for which he&rsquo;s become famous.</p> <p>Murat (25-2-1, 15 KOs), installed as a 5-to-1 underdog against a man old enough to be his father, was not considered a serious threat. He hadn&rsquo;t fought in nearly a year and a half and Hopkins only accepted the fight because he was the mandatory contender. (Incredibly, Hopkins entered with more world championship fights under his belt than Murat had pro fights.) But he fought shrewdly in the opening rounds, backing Hopkins up and making him work the full three minutes of each round.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then Hopkins moved him backward with a left-hand counter in the fourth, started to find range with the jab and put his punches together. Murat, an Armenian from Iraq who lives in Berlin, found himself moving backwards for the first time. The fight was on.</p> <p>Hopkins has always drawn from the dark arts - the occasional rule-pushing intended to unsettle and intimidate an opponent - but he emptied out the bag of tricks for this fight. He thudded Murat with a rabbit punch when his back was turned in the second and kissed him on the back of the head coming out of a clinch in the fifth. The gamesmanship reached a flashpoint when a frustrated Murat landed a punch after the bell - and Hopkins fired back.</p> <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only wrong when you get caught,&rdquo; Hopkins said of the gamesmanship.</p> <p>By the sixth, it had descended into a dirty fight - Murat had the first of two point deductions for hitting off the break - but Hopkins appeared fresh while Murat looked exhausted. In the seventh, Hopkins landed a crisp two-punch combination to the head, connected to the body, then opened up with a flurry that backed Murat across the ring and left him stunned and hurt on the ropes. The crowd were on their feet.</p> <p>As he bludgeoned Murat into exhaustion during the eighth - having opened a cut over the corner of his opponent's left eye - Hopkins deliberately backed into the challenger&rsquo;s corner and began talking to Murat&rsquo;s corner men while parrying and countering Murat&rsquo;s punches. When the bell rang, Hopkins didn&rsquo;t sit down between rounds.</p> <p>By the end Hopkins was standing in the pocket, trading punches and getting the better of the exchanges. He clearly didn&rsquo;t fear Murat&rsquo;s power - and the result was his most active and aggressive performance in recent memory.</p> <p>&ldquo;The plan was to let the dog follow the bone into the dark alley,&rdquo; Hopkins said afterward. &ldquo;I wanted the knockout so you have to take risks. I'm an entertainer and this is what the people wanted to see.&rdquo;</p> <p>Hopkins&rsquo; entry into boxing was improbable enough: more than than 30 arrests before age 17, the 56 months at Graterford State Prison for armed robbery, winning the middleweight championship within seven years of his release.</p> <p>Yet his exit threatens to be even more preposterous. He spoke at the post-fight press conference of fighting past his 50th birthday, unifying the light heavyweight championship and even going down to middleweight - the weight class he ruled from 1995 to 2005 while making a division-record 20 title defenses - to fight Floyd Mayweather Jr.</p> <p>&ldquo;You give me until May of next year to make 160, that fight is on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think too many reporters would count me out.&rdquo;</p> <p>Even at 48, time seems to be on Hopkins' side.</p> <p>&ldquo;Fourteen months from being 50, not a bruise on my face, that&rsquo;s ahead of the game,&rdquo; Hopkins said. &ldquo;If you duck more than you take, you can count your own money later on.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421049161|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|1b488240d6946f6db34b2f376dc488abae3a408f -->",

        "headline":"Kell Brook defeats Vyacheslav Senchenko to set up world title shot",
        "body":"<p>Kell Brook's journey to a world title shot has been difficult, but, at last, he is almost there. A fourth-round stoppage of Vyacheslav Senchenko on a raucous night in Sheffield means the boy from the Steel City will face the winner of Devon Alexander and Shawn Porter's contest in Texas next month and, should Brook prevail again, land the IBF welterweight title that would catapult him into global superstardom.</p><p>Alexander is the current holder and there is surely a large part of Brook that hopes it is the 26-year-old southpaw from Missouri whom he faces, most likely early next year, given three previous bouts between the pair had to be cancelled due to injuries to both fighters. Twice, in January and May this year, it was an injury to Brook that stopped the fight going ahead, and for the 27-year-old it felt increasingly like his big moment would never come. Now, however, Alexander is back in Brook's sights and it could be a case of fourth time lucky in more ways than one.</p><p>Brook came into this contest vowing to \"destroy\" Senchenko and, ultimately, did just that. He started cautiously, which was perhaps understandable against a tall and rangy opponent who packs a heavy punch, as Ricky Hatton found out first hand when Senchenko stopped him with a thumping left to the kidneys in Hatton's comeback fight 11 months ago.</p><p>Brook stayed behind his jab and only really picked up the pace in the third round, when he floored the 36-year-old with a powerful right.</p><p>It took the former WBA champion eight seconds to regain his senses and, having done so, had the crowd of 8,000 here panicking after a thumping shot to the head forced Brook on to the ropes early in the fourth. But, having survived that shock, Brook got back on to the front foot and put Senchenko down again with a hard right later in the round. This time there was no coming back for the man from Donetsk, with the American referee, Shada Murdaugh, stopping the fight and handing Brook his 31st straight win.</p><p>\"I made a statement tonight,\" said Brook, who later suggested he would consider a domestic super-fight with Amir Khan over a mandatory challenge with Alexander. \"He [Senchenko] is tougher than he looks but I outboxed him. I proved that I can compete with the best and nothing is going to stop me [becoming a world champion]. I'm ready.\"</p><p>Brook could become the fourth world champion to have graduated from Brendan Ingle's famous gym in the Wincobank district of Sheffield, following in the footsteps of Johnny Nelson, Junior Witter and Brook's childhood hero Naseem Hamed. In front of the watching Ingle, the boy who dreamed of following in the footsteps of the Prince is now on the verge of becoming a king.</p><p>Earlier, Anthony Joshua comfortably came through his second fight since turning professional. The 24-year-old, who won super-heavyweight gold at the London Olympics and beat the Italian Emanuele Leo with a first-round knockout in his first professional contest three weeks ago, stopped the veteran Paul Butlin early in the second round of their six-round bout, planting a left jab on the already bloodied 37-year-old before finishing him off with a powerful straight right.</p><p>\"I'm still improving and this was valuable experience,\" said Joshua, who confirmed he will next fight on 14 November against a yet-to-be-confirmed opponent.</p><p>Meanwhile, another man who secured a world title shot on Saturday night was Brian Rose, with a controversial split decision victory against the Argentinian Javier Maciel. Rose came into the WBO light-middleweight eliminator on the back of an impressive points victory against Alexey Ribchev, but here the 28-year-old struggled to assert any control over an aggressive, sturdy opponent, who many at ringside felt had done enough to win. Nevertheless, it was Rose who got the decision and the Blackpool fighter will now face the winner of Demetrius Andrade and Vanes Martirosyan's contest for the vacant WBO title in Texas on 16 November.</p><p>Far more impressive was the super-middleweight Callum Smith, who stopped another Argentinian, Ruben Acosta, with a clubbing body shot in the sixth round. Smith, the youngest and, many believe, most talented of Liverpool's four fighting Smith brothers, had stopped all of his previous sixth opponents in the first round, so he benefited from more ring time here, albeit against an opponent who offered little threat.</p><p>There was also a victory for Kal Yafai against the Spaniard Santiago Bustos in what was the Olympian's first fight since injuring his bicep against Abigail Medina, another Spaniard, in March.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421043894|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|8a2ea23892dde15ccd7ac7c54893e658fcb04500 -->",

        "body":"<p>Kell Brook is tired of being British boxing's coming man – now he just wants to be the man. After boxing only once in the past year, and watching a world title shot against Devon Alexander fall through three times because of injuries, he says he has been spurred on by taunts from keyboard warriors.</p><p>On Saturday night Brook, who is unbeaten in a nine-year career, faces Ricky Hatton's conqueror Vyacheslav Senchenko in Sheffield. Victory will lead to a world title shot, with a gold-plated carrot that the fight, most likely against Alexander, could be on pay-per-view in the spring.</p><p>Following a frustrating 12 months since stopping Hector Saldivia in a final eliminator for the IBF title, during which he fractured his foot and briefly lost his motivation, Brook insists he is stronger than ever.</p><p>\"When I fractured my foot I felt helpless,\" Brook said. \"It was awful. I didn't know what to do with myself. I've boxed all my life, it's the only thing I know what to do.</p><p>\"I also heard people saying that I didn't want it against Alexander, or I was scared, or I had bottled it. When you hear that it gets to you. They don't know what it's like: being away from my family over Christmas, missing my daughter, and I think it's really ignited me. Those haters have drove me on. You are going to see great things on Saturday night.\"</p><p>Senchenko is a tough Ukrainian who proved his mettle by withstanding Hatton's bombs in the opening rounds before knocking him out late on. He is a former world champion, and his 34-1 record is superficially impressive. The manner of his solitary defeat, against the light-hitting Paulie Malignaggi – who turned his eye every colour of the rainbow with his jab before the referee stopped the fight – suggests that he will struggle against Brook's accuracy and power.</p><p>Not that the Sheffield fighter is taking anything for granted. He has been training away from his family and young daughter, three times a day. \"It's only a short window,\" he says. \"It's a young man's game and I want to get in there and prove I can mix it with the best in the world.\"</p><p>And while Brook wants to fight Alexander \"with a passion\", he also has Amir Khan and the slick WBA welterweight champion Adrien Broner in his sights. \"Broner's a loudmouth and I'd love to give a beating to him. He's got tremendous talent but no champion who is unbeaten on 30-0, like I am, thinks they are going to lose. It would be a very good fight but I'm big and strong and I've got everything needed to take him out.\"</p><p>Brook's trainer Dominic Ingle believes his fighter's dedication will be rewarded with a late stoppage. \"His weight is good, he's looking in tremendous shape and he knows he's just a breath away from a big fight. People have been talking about a world title fight for three or four years. It's well behind time but we know Kell's ready.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420965940|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|b60b81cdef68c2326b3df5b5aa20e509cac0d651 -->",

        "body":"<p>Thanks for all your comments and suggestions on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/19/favourite-things-week-sports-journalism-lance-armstrong\" title=\"\">our last blog</a>.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/mike-tyson-2013-10/\">1) Mike Tyson: my life as a young thug</a></strong></p><p>Not many sportsmen begin anecdotes about their childhood with the line \"we were beefing with these guys called the Puma Boys\". But not many sports articles can mention pistols, rifles and Magnums in their first paragraph and wrap it up with the rueful jab \"you never knew what you'd find when you broke into people's houses\". <strong>Mike Tyson</strong> is no ordinary storyteller and, as this excerpt from his autobiography in <strong>New York magazine</strong> shows, he was no ordinary 10-year-old.</p><p>Tyson started life in Brooklyn in 1966 as a gentle child: \"I was a pudgy kid, very shy, almost effeminate-shy, and I spoke with a lisp.\" Having to wear glasses added to his sense of alienation. He was bullied and battered. His meekness invited ridicule and he was tormented for his appearance.</p><p>One day another kid tried to steal Tyson's food and he ran home. The shame has never left him: \"I still feel like a coward to this day because of that bullying. That's a wild feeling, being that helpless You never forget that feeling. That was the last day I went to school. I was seven years old and I just ever went back to class.\"</p><p>With his school days over, Tyson took to the streets. He became a gofer in a local gang – a \"schmuck slave\" as he calls it – and started to earn a name in the neighbourhood. A lot of that respect disappeared when he turned up to a disco smelling of pigeon shit. Everyone started laughing at him, he began to cry and a local tough guy looked on and sympathised. The next morning they met up and Tyson was invited to join his crew.</p><p>With his confidence growing, his first fight was not long in the making. Again, pigeons were involved. When a local kid stole on of his precious birds, Tyson protested. His rival did not relent: \"He just twisted the bird's head off and threw it at me, smearing the blood all over my face and shirt.\"</p><p>Something in Tyson changed in that moment and he was never to be the same again. He had taken the bullying long enough and was about to stand up for himself. He flailed a few punches through the air and one of them stuck. The pigeon thief fell to the floor and Tyson's reputation went through the roof.</p><p>Tyson kept fighting and was soon known as a guy who would take on anyone for a decent wage. He wasn't yet a teenager, but he'd grind it out with grown men if the price was right.</p><p>Tyson had to sink further before he started to make anything from his aggression. He found a mentor at a juvenile detention centre in the form of Bobby Stewart, a tough ex-professional boxer who gave him a shot at sparring. Stewart invited Tyson into the ring and dropped him with one punch.</p><p>A few months after Tyson had been left vomiting in that first training session, he graduated from Stewart. The 12-year-old Tyson had broken his trainer's nose with a jab and needed to step up. Stewart took him to see Cus D'Amato.</p><p>D'Amato had trained champions and was a hard man, even in Tyson's critical eyes: \"He even talked tough, and he was dead serious; there wasn't a happy muscle in his face.\"</p><p>D'Amato saw greatness in Tyson from the start. The very first time they met, when Tyson was only 13 years old, he told the young fighter that he would become the world champion if he could learn to listen. </p><p>Tyson was stunned: \"Fuck, how could he know that shit? I thought he was a pervert. In the world I came from, people do shit like that when they want to perv out on you. I didn't know what to say. I had never heard anyone say nice things about me before.\"</p><p>We all know the rest. Tyson listened and learned, and went on to become the youngest heavyweight champion in history. As D'Amato put it: \"Give a weak man some strength and he becomes addicted.\"</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://english.gazzetta.it/Football/10-10-2013/racism-sex-depression-truth-according-to-50-serie-players-201331209318.shtml\">2) Racism, sex and depression according to 50 Serie A players</a></strong></p><p>Few things are more boring than interviews with footballers. Now that clubs school players in the art of mundanity, journalists have taken to exaggerating stories, which has only led to a further breakdown in trust and more dull quotes. To enliven their work, <strong>La Gazzetta dello Sport</strong> have adopted a more intelligent approach: let the players speak anonymously. </p><p>The paper polled 50 Serie A players on subjects they would normally avoid, and the players have truly opened up. The results are staggering. More than half of the players said depression is a problem in the game, a third said they have heard a team-mate make a racist comment during a game, and 34% said a gay player would suffer if he came out. They think Mario Balotelli is over-rated, goal-line technology is worth pursuing and – surprise, surprise – they're not keen on the extra referees' assistants who stand beside the goals. </p><p><strong><a href=\"http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2013/afghanistan-united/\">3) Afghanistan United</a></strong></p><p>Taking photographs to convince the guards your camera is not an explosive device; being wary of snipers perched at every corner of the stadium; and watching on as 300 police officers with automatic rifles circle the pitch. Yes, it must be the Afghanistan v Pakistan local derby, the first match between the two countries in 37 years. </p><p><strong>May Jeong</strong> followed the Afghanistan football team for <strong>Roads and Kingdoms</strong> and experienced a nation being transformed by the sport. Public executions were the only entertainment available under the Taliban regime, but now they have football. </p><p>The country's vast collection of AK-47s are now used to rain bullets into the sky to celebrate the national team's victories. They're still a health hazard – five people were hospitalised from falling bullets after Afghanistan became South Asia champions – but it's an improvement on how things used to be.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/sports/deadspins-tim-burke-waits-to-turn-offbeat-moments-into-gifs.html\">4) Maker of animated gifs waits for offbeat moments </a></strong></p><p>They're not pictures, they're not videos and no one is certain how their name should be pronounced, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/the-gifs-that-keep-giving\">gifs</a> are all the rage in online sports reporting. </p><p><strong>Sarah Lyall</strong> met Tim Burke, their most famed creator, for this piece in the <strong>New York Times</strong> and was more than a little impressed: \"He works from home here, in what his colleagues call the 'Burke-puter', for its seamless integration of man and machine. It is less an office than an organism: a flashing, beeping, glowing, thrumming assault of screens, wires, remotes, tuners, phones, receivers, computers and general electronic effluvia wrapped around a person ('the monitor situation up there is insane', said Burke's wife, Lynn Hurtak.). Burke sits here alone in the dark day after day, for about 100 hours a week, watching dozens of sports events simultaneously.\" </p><p>Burke gave up his dissertation on feminist theory and poker to become a gifmaker. We salute him from afar – with 28 screens filtering through his computer at once, he may well be watching. </p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/polish-football-fans-descended-on-wembley-yesterday\">5) Partying with Polish football fans outside Wembley</a></strong></p><p><strong>Jack Blocker</strong> of <strong>Vice</strong> hung around with Polish football fans for a few hours before their World Cup qualifier against England at Wembley. He found them to be a receptive bunch of guys, who were fluent in the art of repartee: \"They agreed to have their photo taken on the condition that I be in it, at which point one began to playfully choke me with his scarf. It became clear that we spoke a common language. The language of 'quality banter'. That and English.\"</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://uppercutting.kinja.com/boxing-is-a-goddamned-tragedy-1450455925\">6) Boxing is a Goddamned tragedy</a></strong></p><p>The headline says it all. But the first paragraph takes it further: \"How does one make any sense of out of something like this? Journeyman bantamweight Francisco 'Franky' Leal has died after being knocked out on Saturday night and never regaining consciousness.\" The writing is poignant in this distressing opinion piece from <strong>Iron Mike Gallego</strong> on <strong>Uppercutting</strong> that becomes sadder with every line. It's hard to disagree with a single word.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/sir-alex-ferguson-fergie-manchester-united\">7) Sir Alex Ferguson on players, politics and the press</a></strong></p><p><strong>Jon Snow</strong> isn't patronised with the congratulatory \"well done\" that Alex Ferguson liked to impart on TV men who had asked questions that suited him in interviews. Snow was not going to be condescended by Ferguson in this 11-minute discussion about politics, the media and leadership. Ferguson says he is more mellow than before, but his obsession with control is always lurking in the foreground. </p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/basketball/weve-dropped-the-ball-big-time-20131020-2vv30.html\">8) We've dropped the ball big time</a></strong></p><p><strong>Tommy Greer</strong> captains the Melbourne Tigers, an Australian basketball team that needs new fans. He has taken to the pages of the <strong>Sydney Morning Herald</strong> to rouse his fellow professionals: \"All basketballers should be asking themselves what they are doing to help promote the game they play and love. For basketball to once again capture attention in the mainstream public consciousness, it is up to us to prove to people that we are worth the price of admission and their attention... We need to be out there in the media and in the community pushing ourselves and our brand. Going to training in the morning and heading home to rest is not going to get it done.\" Can you imagine a Premier League footballer having to think like that?</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/an-irishman-abroad/id683760002\">9) An Irishman Abroad with Tony Cascarino</a></strong></p><p><strong>Jarlath Regan</strong> tends to interview stand-up comedians on his <strong>An Irishman Abroad</strong> podcast, but the inclusion of Tony Cascarino among the usual cast of displaced comics makes for a fascinating episode. Anyone who has read Cascarino's book knows has has a story to tell, and in this 43-minute chat he opens up further about his struggle with confidence, his time with the Ireland team and how an article he wrote for the Times provoked a phonecall from an angry Frank Lampard.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtjzDPTjCFQ\">10) Zlatan's amazing goal</a></strong></p><p>\"It was probably one of my favourite beautiful goals.

Asked whether he was still open to fighting Mundine, Mosley said he'd rather the Australian go to America to fight him.</p><p>\"I'm not thinking about going back out to Australia and messing with the time zone; I don't have time for that,\" said Mosley. \"I would rather he come out here and fight on my terms and on my turf because over there, it seems like they're still behind the times with their boxing. It's almost like the mafia days.</p><p>\"I'm hearing that people watch the judges; they're sitting behind them looking at them while they mark their scores ... Their commission is not really strong like ours, so it's like anything goes. That's what I kept hearing.\"<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420817572|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a6910eb9fa8d68d3cb86bf33edada7df6f021cf9 -->",

Anybody watching could see that the head butts were so overt. I was furious, I was an undisciplined soldier and I lost my composure. So I bit him in the ear.\"</p><p>When Tyson was disqualified for a second bite, he reveals he still wanted to attack Holyfield. \"People were pulling me and blocking me and [Holyfield] was standing in his corner, huddled up ... I was still trying to get at him. I had 50 people on me and I was still fighting the cops.\"</p><p>Tyson also recalls the anger with which the fight was received by the general public. \"Someone even threw a fish head onto my property. They kept it up until some of my security guys shot some BBs in their direction. After a while, I smoked some weed and drank some liquor and went to sleep … Back at the MGM Grand, people were fighting one another in the casino, being sent to the hospital.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/aug/25/mike-tyson-sonny-liston-drug-alcohol-boxing\">In August, Tyson said he was on the verge of dying from ongoing drug and alcohol problems</a>. \"I wanna live my sober life. I don't wanna die. I'm on the verge of dying, because I'm a vicious alcoholic,\" the former heavyweight boxing champion said on ESPN's Friday Night Fights. \"I'm a bad guy sometimes. I did a lot of bad things, and I want to be forgiven. So in order for me to be forgiven, I hope they can forgive me. I wanna change my life, I wanna live a different life now.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420711366|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|a7acc652845daeb081f1ad0a7e55cca2fcd472e1 -->",

He lost the next two encounters with \"The Greatest\" narrowly and contentiously; many believed Norton should have been awarded the decision in all three contests.</p><p>Norton, a former US marine, had a cross-armed defensive style that troubled Ali. Superbly conditioned, with a chiselled muscular physique that made him sought after in Hollywood – his films included Mandingo (1975), with Susan George, and Drum (1976), with Pam Grier – he was a lightly considered underdog when he first fought Ali in 1973.</p><p>Gene Kilroy, who acted as Ali's business manager, said: \"Ali thought it would be an easy fight. But Norton was unorthodox. Instead of jabbing from above like most fighters, he would put his hand down and jab up at Ali.\" Ali was never able to get into his familiar rhythm, and was on the receiving end of a split points decision after 12 rounds. He was left in hospital, where his broken jaw had to be wired up.</p><p>Picked as a supposedly soft touch, Norton had been offered $50,000 for the fight. \"For $50,000, I'd fight the Russian army,\" he said. ABC's commentator Howard Cosell had said before the fight that it was \"the worst mismatch in boxing history and a disgrace\". Later he said: \"Kenny, you made me look silly.\" Norton replied: \"That's OK, Howard, you always look silly.\"</p><p>Six months later, Norton and Ali fought again and this time Ali prevailed by a split decision, setting up a decider in 1976 at the Yankee stadium in New York. By then, Ali was world champion and generating huge sums of money wherever and whenever he fought. The judges gave a narrow points decision against Norton, with booing greeting the verdict from many in the 30,000 crowd.</p><p>Norton was born and brought up in Jacksonville, Illinois. His father, John Norton, was a fire service engineer; his mother, Ruth, was a hospital therapist. An outstanding all-round athlete, Norton won a scholarship to Northeast Missouri State College (now Truman State University) through his proficiency at basketball and American football and as a track athlete. It was only after enlisting in the marine corps that he began boxing, quickly finding that his strength and physique – he stood 191cm (6ft&nbsp;3in) and weighed about 100kg (220lb) – made him ideally suited to the sport.</p><p>Norton was the All-Marine heavyweight champion three times before turning professional in 1967. He made the usual advance of a heavyweight prospect, repelling a succession of the sport's journeymen and soon gained respect in the division. He boosted his earnings with sparring work against the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/08/joe-frazier\" title=\"Joe Frazier obituary\">Joe Frazier</a>, with whom he shared a trainer in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/oct/12/boxing.theguardian\" title=\"Eddie Futch obituary\">Eddie Futch</a>.</p><p>Frazier, who was close to Norton as a friend, never fought him. But Norton did fight another great heavyweight of the 1970s, George Foreman, for the title in 1974. At the peak of his powers, Foreman faced Norton in Caracas, Venezuela, and floored him three times before the stoppage came in the second round, enabling Foreman to dramatically retain the title he had won by defeating Frazier in 1973. Foreman would later become friends with Norton and praised him, saying: \"He fought Ali through all those questionable decisions and, even though he was patriotic [Ali had famously refused to serve in the army], he never used that against Ali. That made me so proud of him. He was humane.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417826431'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2013/9/19/1379608109808/Muhammad-Ali-right-winces-010.jpg' alt='Muhammad Ali, right, winces as Ken Norton lands a punch in their second fight, won by Ali in 1973' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Muhammad Ali, right, winces as Ken Norton lands a punch during their second fight, won by Ali, at the Forum in Inglewood, California, in 1973. Photograph: AP</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the bitter disappointment of losing to Ali in their third fight, Norton rebounded with three wins in 1977 – including victories over the highly rated Duane Bobick and Jimmy Young – and earned himself the position of mandatory challenger for the title, which was claimed by Leon Spinks after his shock victory over Ali in February 1978. The World Boxing Council awarded Norton the title when Spinks agreed to a rematch with the ageing Ali instead of a fight against Norton.</p><p>Norton lost his title in his first defence as champion, again suffering the agonies of being on the wrong end of a split decision, when he took on Larry Holmes in what is now recognised as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS8JXVpJDIk\" title=\"Ken Norton v Larry Holmes in 1978\">one of the all-time classic world heavyweight fights</a>. For 15 rounds at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, the two men traded power punches of almost frightening intensity. Holmes would go on to be recognised as the world No 1 until the mid-1980s, while Norton was never the same fighter again.</p><p>A loss to the big-punching Earnie Shavers in 1979, with Norton suffering a first-round knockout, suggested his time had gone. Another first-round stoppage, against Gerry Cooney in 1981, prompted Norton to announce his retirement from the sport.</p><p>In 1986, a car accident almost killed Norton. He suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured skull and a brain injury that left him with slurred speech. Before then, he had been working as a ringside commentator and had continued to act in films and on television. After a long period of declining health, including a succession of strokes and a heart attack, he moved into a care home.</p><p>Norton is survived by his wife, Rose, and his children Ken (an American football linebacker who now coaches with the Seattle Seahawks), Keith, Kenejon and Kenisha.</p><p><em>• </em>Kenneth Howard Norton, boxer, born 9 August 1943; died 18 September 2013</p><p><em>• </em>This article was updated on 20 September 2013.

        "body":"<p>Three young Afghan women boxers risk missing an official invitation to train and fight in the UK because of \"excessive\" red tape.</p><p>Sadaf Rahimi, Fahima Mohammad and Shabnam Rahman have overcome a host of cultural and financial barriers to pursue their sport in Kabul.</p><p>They were due to visit London for their first bout with UK rivals as part of International Women's Day on Friday. Instead, they have been forced to wait for days in Delhi for paperwork that has already been approved to be \"officially processed\".</p><p>The team from Kabul has \"invited status\" and support for sports visas, but visitors from Afghanistan must get paperwork in India before they can travel to the UK.</p><p>Margaret Pope, founder of the Women in Sport Foundation which had worked to bring the Afghan boxers to the UK, said of the delay: \"It is a frustrating, 11th-hour development to a groundbreaking initiative  … to bring the women to the UK and equip them with skills and experience to take back to Afghanistan.</p><p>\"One of the justifications for the UK military involvement in Afghanistan was to help improve the terrible situation for the country's women,\" she added. \"It is therefore a bitter irony that when there is a clear opportunity to assist some of the bravest, talented and most inspiring young Afghan women, bureaucratic delays are quashing their dreams.\"</p><p>Former aid worker Melanie Brown said: \"Making Afghans who request visas travel to a third country in order to receive them and then wait weeks to hear if they have been successful could cynically be seen as a way of discouraging all those but the very wealthy from visiting the UK.</p><p>\"This is extremely frustrating, there is the considerable cost and the impracticality of staying in Delhi for weeks at a time while waiting for paperwork to be rubberstamped.\"</p><p>Rahimi, Mohammad and Rahman are due to train and attend a charity auction in London to raise money for their gym in Kabul, then travel to Bristol to be coached by Britain's first officially licensed female boxer, Jane Couch MBE.</p><p>Couch is no stranger to struggles with authorities – in 1998 she persuaded an industrial tribunal to overturn a British Boxing Board of Control ruling that had denied her a licence. The BBBC had argued that premenstrual syndrome made women too unstable to box.</p><p>After years of lobbying from British women fighters, women's boxing was officially recognised as an Olympic sport on 14 August 2009. At London 2012 there were women boxers from Kazakhstan, North Korea and Turkey, while British boxer Nicola Adams became the first woman to win an Olympic boxing gold.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405074009|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|085d1ab6a660eea75aa80eff886461a306a6445f -->",

        "headline":"Amir Khan's victory over Carlos Molina begins his climb back",
        "body":"<p>Amir Khan lives not just to fight another day, but another Danny Garcia. After two straight losses – the last one a devastating stoppage in the summer by the Philadelphian that cost him his world light-welterweight belts and led to his split with Freddie Roach – he survived a hat-trick ball to cut down the unbeaten Carlos Molina in a near-perfect performance.</p><p>He knew defeat would leave his career in pieces. Instead his wicked jab and at times bewildering combinations, behind an improved defence – assiduously crafted by his new trainer, Virgil Hunter – earned him a shutout on all three cards after 10 rounds. At that point the referee, Jack Reiss, inspected Molina's carved features for the fourth time and waved it over.</p><p>\"Carlos took some really good shots and he was still coming forward,\" Khan said, \"and that's when I thought I better stick to the plan. Virgil is a great trainer and I'm getting better at boxing and becoming the complete fighter. He is teaching me speed and power, when to throw the big shots. Sometimes I am too brave for my good but now I know it is better to stick to the game plan. Garcia caught me with a good shot but I will fight Danny Garcia again, anytime, anywhere.\"</p><p>Molina, battered but defiant, said: \"I don't know what happened. I couldn't pull the trigger, just couldn't get through. He was so fast and I couldn't get in because he has a long jab. I felt I connected two or three times but I wasn't in the right place to reconnect when I rocked him.\"</p><p>Khan has not boxed with such fixed discipline in one extended performance since he stopped Paulie Malignaggi in New York in 2010. That seems such a long time ago but now he has the opportunity to view 2013 with hope that was not apparent after Garcia had temporarily, at least, evicted him from the elite establishment around 10 stones inhabited by some of the most exciting fighters in the business.</p><p>Khan has to convince Showtime and his American partners, Golden Boy Promotions, not to mention Garcia and his abrasive father, Angel – who had travelled across the country to the west coast to inspect his handiwork – that he is worth a rematch.</p><p>Garcia, who has swagger where once there was untested confidence (considerably buoyed by his recent spectacular stoppage of Erik Morales) has a defence against Zab Judah in New York in February first but has indicated he would fight Khan again if he impressed tonight.</p><p>If Khan gets that gig he will be up against an opponent who has grown into the title, an unbeaten and dangerous foe. But Khan has never shied away from a challenge. He looked unusually nervous during the introductions – with good reason. His whole career was on the line.</p><p>He impressed from the opening bell, his snaking job leaving Molina's round faced visibly marked up in round one, and he only once erred \"in the pocket\", shipping a decent left hook.</p><p>But Molina, who has never been down, has an excellent pedigree (his twin brothers were both Olympians, one for Mexico, one for the United States) and he was not going to fold without fierce resistance. Although he got through with a couple of steadying left hooks in the second, he was too content to box with his face, now reddened beyond cleansing.</p><p>He was more aggressive in the third, leading with a right hook that missed, then marched Khan to the ropes, where he got slightly the better of the exchanges to edge the round, from this vantage point, anyway.</p><p>Ringside observers who have seen a lot of Molina testify to his durability and, even though coming up to 10st for the first time at this level he gave the appearance of immovable solidity. However Khan sensed him wilting a little in the fourth and, for the first time, risked an all-out assault in a blaze of unanswered blows that left his opponent bleeding heavily around the eyes.</p><p>Molina was slow off his stool for the fifth but there was still bounce in his legs as he trundled forward behind a high guard, although, pawing at the leakage around his left eye, he looked bewildered by Khan's jab.</p><p>At the halfway mark Khan had reproduced the sort of focused boxing that dazzled Garcia for two and a half rounds before a disastrous collapse; his challenge was to keep his shape and not hang his chin out as he did on that calamitous night. Molina was still competitive but Reiss took a long look at his wounds before the start of the seventh.</p><p>This was still a fight you could only watch without anxiety in a replay, knowing the result. What appeared on the scorecard like a stroll was in fact a fight loaded with possibilities. However the rebuilt Khan controlled his urge for a brawl, boxing beautifully on the outside.</p><p>After eight rounds Molina had fallen behind to the point where he needed a knockout, increasing the danger for Khan, but there was no sign of his newfound boxing shape deserting him as he moved away from Molina's cocked right.</p><p>The referee called in the ring doctor to inspect Molina's cuts before the ninth and the fighter looked relieved to get the go-ahead. Yet, even buoyed by the reprieve, he could not pierce the shield Khan had constructed behind those whirring combinations and the blood flowed like wine.</p><p>Only a mistake could turn Khan's night bad because, going into the championship rounds, he was in complete control. A bruise had grown ugly around Molina's right eye but his chin showed no sign of deterioration, even under the persistent onslaught.</p><p>But there was no more for him to sacrifice at the end of the round. Molina's father, Miguel, protested in vain. His boy had stepped up, in more ways than one, and might be better moving back to a division where he feels more comfortable.</p><p>The punch stats went overwhelmingly Khan's way: 312 of 679 thrown landing, and he took just 87 of 335 coming the other way. It was the power-punch percentage of 56 that impressed most, however: 156 from 278. That is a staggeringly good return on any fighter's effort to stop his opponent, and way too good for Molina.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/401153721|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|9a5d8ed980fbb606d690f66479ade9d44ad32792 -->",

        "body":"<p>The South African boxer Corrie Sanders has died aged 46 after being shot during an armed robbery at a restaurant in Brits, near Pretoria. Sanders was one of the biggest-punching heavyweights of recent years and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xNoXYgi7o4\" title=\"Corrie Sanders fighting Wladimir Klitschko\">most famously defeated Wladimir Klitschko</a> to win the World Boxing Organisation heavyweight title in 2003.</p><p>Sanders was born in Pretoria. A talented sporting all-rounder, he played rugby and cricket as a schoolboy and later honed a golf game to near-professional standard. His impressive physique and strength, allied to a natural athleticism, helped him develop an intimidating punching power from a southpaw stance, which made him one of the most dangerous fighters of his time.</p><p>Claiming 196 wins from 200 amateur fights, he had won the South African heavyweight title in four consecutive years, from 1985 to 1988, before he moved into the professional sport. He won 42 of his 46 paid fights. Perhaps if he had moved to the US, he would have been a bigger name on the world stage. When asked why he had remained in South Africa, he said: \"I loved this country too much. It might sound strange, but I felt I had more black fans than white. Whenever I was out and about, they would stop me and want to chat. That was always very humbling.\"</p><p>With his career handled by the leading promoter Rodney Berman, Sanders rose steadily up the rankings after making his professional debut in 1989, winning his first 23 contests and becoming the South African champion in only his 11th pro fight. Wins over fringe American contenders such as Smokin' Bert Cooper, Levi Billups and Britain's <a href=\"http://www.johnnynelson.org.uk/\" title=\"Johnny Nelson\">Johnny Nelson</a> alerted the cognoscenti to the fact the he could become a potent force in the division.</p><p>His progress was slowed by a shocking second-round knockout defeat in 1994 against Nate Tubbs. But he remained undefeated thereafter until May 2000, when he lost a dramatic contest against the future champion Hasim Rahman. In the fight, televised by the American channel HBO, Sanders had Rahman down before being stopped himself in the seventh round. He was 37, and probably past his best, by the time he got his title shot fighting Klitschko for the WBO title in Hamburg in 2003.</p><p>The Ukrainian had only lost once in 41 fights and was a hot favourite to repel Sanders, who was quoted as a 40-1 outsider. But the South African produced a devastating display of power-punching to floor the champion twice in the opening round and twice more in the second when the fight ended. Ring Magazine hailed Sanders's win as their \"upset of the year\".</p><p>The following year, Sanders relinquished the then relatively lowly rated WBO belt to fight Wladimir's older brother Vitali for the World Boxing Council title, made vacant by the retirement of Lennox Lewis. This time Sanders looked to have a chance in the early rounds, especially the third when he caught Vitali with his danger punch, the left hook. But Vitali was able to withstand the pressure and went on to establish his dominance before stopping the South African in the eighth.</p><p>Sanders fought four more times before retiring, in 2008, and will be remembered as perhaps South Africa's best ever heavyweight. After moving away from boxing, he was a familiar figure at celebrity golf events and, as well as concentrating on various business interests, also worked as a motivational speaker.</p><p>He is survived by his former wife, Sunette, and a son and a daughter.</p><p>• Cornelius Johannes Sanders, boxer, born 7 January 1966; died 22 September 2012</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/396592535|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|c71b85face77acc3f7a8d360b624430cd9559efc -->",

        "body":"<p>Super heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua sealed an extraordinary run of home success at the London Olympics by coming back against the reigning Olympic champion to win Team GB's 29th gold medal of the Games, just hours before the closing ceremony.</p><p>The Finchley-born fighter became the latest hero created by an Olympics that delivered 65 medals in total – the best since the first time London hosted the Games in 1908. A late run of golds from Russia in athletics, boxing, gymnastics and volleyball was not enough to deprive Great Britain of third place in the medal table.</p><p>Sam Murray won Team GB's 65th and final medal of the 2012 Games in the women's modern pentathlon on Sunday. The 22-year-old from Preston was pipped to top place by Lithuana's Laura Asadauskaite, but was still chuffed. \"I had a lot to make up on the run, I needed that,\" she said. \"I've made a few mistakes today which set me back but I came through in the end. I'm just so pleased, my legs kept running for me. Up the hills was so steep and I just kept working hard.\"</p><p>Before the Games, UK Sport, the body responsible for pouring £312m into Olympic sport over the last four years, set the target of matching the achievement in Beijing four years ago by finishing fourth. The British Olympic Association (BOA) would talk only of an aspiration of winning more medals in more sports – a landmark that was passed last week.</p><p>Overhauling the Russians in third place was considered unlikely by all but the most bullish of forecasters. BOA chairman Lord Moynihan did not believe it would be possible. \"Did I think we could beat them? Probably not. The fact we're set to is phenomenal credit to the athletes and the support of those athletes,\" he said. \"They always come on strongly. I was aware that Putin was very focused on them being better financed than ever before.\"</p><p>One of the most pleasing aspects for sports governing bodies, the BOA and the high-performance team at UK Sport has been the spread of sports that delivered medals. Of the 26 Olympic sports, 16 brought medals for the British team. While cycling, rowing and sailing continued to deliver, there was gold medal success in sports such as taekwondo, dressage and the canoe slalom for the first time.</p><p>Before the Games, both London 2012 chairman Lord Coe and International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge had highlighted the importance of \"golden moments\" that would live in memory. Alongside the achievements of Usain Bolt, the Jamaican sprint team and the record-breaking Michael Phelps, the British athletes delivered more than their fair share of moments.</p><p>Sir Chris Hoy's sixth gold broke records, Ben Ainslie's fourth gold in consecutive Games made him the most successful sailor in Olympic history and Mo Farah wrote his name in the history books by becoming the first British man to win a long distance gold since 1908 – and then repeating the feat a week later.</p><p>Anthony Joshua, who only started boxing four years ago, won Team GB's climactic gold medal on Sunday afternoon in controversial circumstances. Three points behind going into the last round against the Italian Roberto Cammarelle, he was roared on by the crowd and fought back to draw 18-18, winning gold on a countback. The furious Italian camp protested but to no avail. Earlier on Sunday Freddie Evans had to settle for silver in the welterweight category.</p><p>Joshua will now field a host of offers to turn professional, following in the footsteps of super heavyweight gold medal winners such as Lennox Lewis and Audley Harrison. Afterwards, he said: \"It's much more than a gold medal, it's a life experience.\"</p><p>Nicola Adams, who won the first ever women's boxing medal in the Olympics, said she hoped her success would inspire others. \"I'm hoping it brings more women into sport, not just boxing. That would be great for me. I was inspired by Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard,\" she said. \"To be able to get in the ring and perform like they did, it meant everything to me. To have kids in the future with a female role model to look up to would be great.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394618674|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|5ded152a0aab2be95fdb833459420e17410a4554 -->",

        "headline":"Luke Campbell beats John Joe Nevin to claim bantamweight gold",
        "body":"<p>The Olympics have long carried a sense of grand sporting internationalism. But on Saturday the ExCeL arena produced a coming-together of a more parochial nature as British and Irish boxers Luke Campbell of Hull and John Joe Nevin of Mullingar fought for the men's bantam gold before a thrillingly loud and agreeably garrulous UK-Irish crowd. This was not so much ping-pong diplomacy as fists across the water, a meeting of two nations with a rather mixed history of relations, sporting and otherwise, but combining here under the Olympic boxing banner to create another delightfully arresting tableau at these Games.</p><p>In the event it was Campbell who took the gold, producing a display of controlled long range aggression to secure Team GB's 28th gold medal of these rather giddy Games. Medals aside, this was also an occasion of rather deafening sporting kinship inside the ExCel arena. Campbell is also of Irish descent — his family know Nevin's family — and as it had been for the Anglo-Irish bout between Katie Taylor and Natasha Jones earlier in the week, the arena was packed with a boisterous and celebratory crowd, the seats spotted with emerald green Irish football shirts and the entry of both men greeted with a wall of noise that seemed to rattle the 9,000 plastic seats. The cheers for Nevin were as loud as those for the home fighter; for Ireland this has already been a fine Olympics. Five medals, four in boxing, is an excellent return.</p><p>Not that the crowd were particularly concerned with sporting history as Nevin and Campbell set about each other, Campbell the taller man in blue landing some early blows and taking the first round 5-3. The second round went to Nevin, who produced some raucously received combinations to shade it 5-4, before Campbell sealed the fight, even producing a knockdown in the third. The cheers for Campbell were vast, as they were for Nevin at the end of a bout capped by a lingering embrace between the two corners.</p><p>All in all it was another triumphant night for the ExCel, which has been one of the surprise successes of these Games, a multi-roomed docklands hangar of impossibly vast scale, host to more Olympic events under one roof than any other venue in Olympic history. It is not to be tackled lightly: in the first week the venue broadcast manager wore a pedometer and discovered he'd walked eight miles by the end of the day. The boxing concludes here on Sunday with two British gold medal hopes in the ring. They will do well to match the peculiar clamour of Campbell's big night.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394592285|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|b69be63c86d826535fdc8391314c1cd413714752 -->",
