In early trading the price at one point topped $50. It closed the day at $44.90.</p> <p>Twitter's float price was considered restrained, and analysts had been forecasting a surge on the first day of trading, but the scale of the demand was unexpected. Thirteen years since the dotcom crash, there were warnings of a new technology bubble.</p> <p>&quot;I anticipated a very strong open, but when you start to approach these levels, this is absolute froth,&quot; said Jeffrey Sica, president of Sica Wealth Management in New Jersey. &quot;There is nothing supporting this range. I think this is just way, way above what realistically we should be considering.&quot;</p> <p>The float instantly made billionaires of co-founders Ev Williams and Jack Dorsey. Williams owns 59.6m shares, valued at more than $2.69bn. Dorsey holds another 23.4m shares, valued at over $1bn. But the biggest winner was Twitter's largest shareholder, Rizvi Traverse. The private equity group run by reclusive New Yorker Suhail Rizvi holds nearly $4bn worth of the stock, and its Saudi client Prince Alwaleed bin Talal will also share in the bonanza, having taken an early bet on Twitter.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's it for our live coverage today.

And few people do.&quot; The tech magazine then twists the knife by noting that &quot;the truth is that few people here in the States actually use the thing&quot;.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite all the froth around Twitter’s IPO, the company isn’t all that big, with a valuation, at the moment, of around $31.5 billion. Rival Facebook clocks in at around $120 billion, while an icon of the last tech boom, Amazon, is worth $163 billion. Google is at $342 billion. Twitter is closer to being an Intuit or Adobe than the next Facebook.</p> <p>Part of that difference is down to the fact that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/twitter-pales-next-to-facebook/\">Twitter bleeds cash while Facebook gushes profit</a>. After losing $80 million last year, Twitter posted a net loss of $134 million for the first nine months of this year, according to a company&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312513424260/d564001ds1a.htm\">filing</a>&nbsp;with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It has never been profitable. Facebook, in contrast, grew profits for at least three years to $1 billion before it went public.</p> <p>But it’s not just that Twitter is small and unprofitable. The truth is that few people here in the States actually use the thing. The social network remains a niche product, beloved by journalists, celebrities, and a hard core of miscellaneous obsessive users — but few others.</p> <p>Unlike Facebook, it’s not a ubiquitous online utility, and you’re not going to find grandma on there. Twitter has only 53 million monthly active users in the U.S., where it earns most of its ad dollars, as of the third quarter of this calendar year. That’s less than a quarter of its total number of users.

Yes, that makes it the biggest tech IPO since Facebook, but that's like comparing Earth to Jupiter. The Facebook IPO was $16 billion, which is many, many little Twitters. The Google IPO, at $1.9 billion, was also bigger. Twitter is not the biggest IPO of all time; it's not even the biggest IPO of 2013. According to Thomson Reuters, the Twitter debut is the seventh-largest IPO this year.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are also key questions about whether Twitter should be worth that much. At these prices, the company is worth 33 times its sales. That's remarkable because Twitter's active users number about 232 million, while Facebook, with one billion active users, has stock that trades at about half that, or 17 times sales. Google, which we all acknowledge as our Internet overlord, has shares that go for only five times sales.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Twitter IPO is not a capitalist rave. No one will make money except the founders and some people who are already millionaires. So let's all pace ourselves.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:41:15.874Z\">at 10.41am ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-527bab45e4b0625ea40a9cbd\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:02:44.660Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>According to CNBC, citing &quot;initial reports&quot;, Twitter is trading at around <strong>$44-45 per share</strong> after opening at $26.

That sale &quot;proved a disaster&quot;, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/twitter-ipo-26-share\">writes my colleague <strong>Dominic Rushe</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Facebook sold its shares at $38 – the top end of the range it had set – and found that long-term investors were not keen to hold the stock after reports that the company was struggling to make money from mobile advertising. Shares slumped shortly after the IPO and it took a year for the shares to pass the price they launched at. But pricing Twitter's offer too low would reduce the money the company could raise.</p> <p>Before the pricing, Tomas Freyman, director of valuations at BDO, worried that history was about to repeat itself. &quot;Despite Twitter's price range valuing being more modest than some of the numbers bandied about over the last few weeks, this is still very high for a company that has yet to make any profits,&quot; he said. &quot;Value in Twitter is being largely driven by the hype surrounding the brand and the recent successes of other online businesses including Google, LinkedIn and Facebook, despite the latter's early wobbles.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527b9a61e4b0ebad08ff9d20\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T14:16:58.523Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Twitter is going public at 9.30am.</strong>&nbsp;The technology company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and the company will be selling 70m shares at a price of $26 per share.</p> <p>The $26-per-share pricing gives the company – which has not made a profit for the last three years – a value of $14.2bn.</p> <p>The launch will net hundreds and hundreds of millions for some lucky Silicon Valley investors. Co-founder Evan Williams is due to make $1.47bn from the sale. Fellow co-founder Jack Dorsey could make around half that. Other backers including Amazon founder and Washington Post-rescuer Jeff Bezos could also rake in small fortunes to add to their already large ones.</p> <p>Twitter made <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/03/technology/social/twitter-ipo/\">its first public financial statement last month</a> ahead of the big launch. It showed that it lost $79.4m in 2012 and was on track to lose even more in 2013.</p> <p>Those losses are not expected to deter investors from clamouring for a piece of Twitter today, however. Despite its poor financial performance Twitter has promising mobile stats and is set to turn a profit in 2015.</p> <p>How will Twitter fare? Will its share price soar above $26? Or drop below? Or neither? Follow live coverage of all the furore here.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421915262|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|930a146c4da5cb5fd7711ab3afb42fc344272dd6 -->",
