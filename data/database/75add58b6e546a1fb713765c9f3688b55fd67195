        "headline":"The Koch brothers' beer offensive against Obamacare loses its fizz",
        "body":"<p>What's a family values conservative to do when every effort to protect millions of Americans from the scourge of affordable healthcare fails? </p><p>Break out the beer, of course. The latest campaign to kill off Obamacare in its infancy is now playing out on college campuses where a conservative group known as Generation Opportunity (GO), who are funded in part by the billionaire Koch brothers, is using the <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/10/14/3689755/young-are-being-recruited-to-help.html\">lure of free beer</a> and \"opt out\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_koozie\">beer koozies</a> to persuade young students not to buy health insurance – or, at least, not to buy it from the Obamacare exchanges.</p><p>Traditionally, one might expect God-fearing conservatives to be warning youth about the dangers of alcohol consumption, rather than plying them with free liquor, but these are desperate times. The determined Koch brothers have already spent <a href=\"http://www.prwatch.org/news/2013/09/12247/breaking-new-list-dark-money-shell-game-groups-connected-kochs\">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> trying to derail the president's healthcare law. So far, though, despite their best efforts, Obamacare has proved as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-01/will-the-young-invincibles-join-obamacare-.html\">\"invincible\" as the young people</a> it needs to enroll. While it's unlikely that the beer exchanges, shall we call them, will be the game-changer, the Kochs may well end up driving many of us to drink with their relentless and futile vendetta to undo the law – not just the college students.</p><p>Nearly every movement to \"educate the public\" about the \"dangers\" of Obamacare can be linked in some way to the Koch brothers, and this latest college campus effort is no different. Last month, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/koch-brothers-heritage-action-donation-98054.html\">Politico revealed</a> that GO has received $5.04m from the Koch-funded entity known as Freedom Works. This \"grassroots\" movement is now about to embark on an \"<a href=\"http://optout.org/\">Opt Out</a>\" tour of 20 college towns across the country as part of its effort to steer young people away from the Obamacare exchanges. As GO's 29-year-old president, Evan Feinberg, put it:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>What we're trying to communicate is, 'No, you're not actually required to buy health insurance' … you might have to pay a fine, but that's going to be cheaper for you, and better for you.</p></blockquote><p>After coming under criticism for this statement, Feinberg (who previously worked at the Charles Koch Institute) has since clarified that GO is not trying to persuade young people to opt out of buying insurance altogether, just from buying it through the healthcare exchanges.</p><p>Maybe, I'm naive to think that most young Americans will not fall for this cynical ploy, no matter how much free beer they are plied with. It seems to me that any campaign that is based on a false premise – in this case, that young people could get cheaper insurance before Obamacare or since – seems destined for failure. </p><p>According to a report released in September by the Department of the Health and Human Services, <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/09/20130917b.html\">56% of the people</a> who are applying for health insurance today will be able to get coverage through the health insurance marketplace for <em>less than $100 a month</em>. This means that a large percentage of the youth market that GO are targeting would be able to get comprehensive health coverage under Obamacare for a very low rate.</p><p>If Feinberg or any other GO employee genuinely knows about better insurance deals than that for students, it would be really helpful if they listed them on their Opt Out website. Surely, that would be a far better use of their Koch dollars than buying more crates of beer?</p><p>As it is, the Opt Out website contains no information beyond vague and unsubstantiated claims about Obamacare being a \"bad deal\", and two embarrassingly poorly made ads featuring a \"Creepy Uncle Sam\" character who pops up between a woman's legs as she undergoes a gynaecological exam and asks a young man to roll over while he pulls on a surgical glove. The message – that government should stay out of healthcare – is about as subtle as Miley Cyrus' recent sledgehammer licking antics.</p><p>Whether Creepy Uncle Sam and his creepier backers will succeed in bringing down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) remains to be seen, but the prognosis is not good. Since the ACA was signed into law in 2010, it has miraculously managed to withstand \"Hitler death panel\" comparisons, state by state efforts to block its implementation, a US supreme court challenge to its constitutionality and, most recently, a defunding effort that led to the federal government shutdown. </p><p>As the New York Times recently reported, the Koch brothers <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/us/a-federal-budget-crisis-months-in-the-planning.html?_r=0\">have been heavily involved</a> in all of these separate efforts through their generous funding of groups like Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action and, of course, Generation Opportunity. But so far, their efforts have been in vain. Not only is Obamacare still the law of the land, but the law has actually <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/gop-plummets-obamacare-soars-shutdown\">gained a major bump</a> in support since the shutdown stand-off.</p><p>As it happens, even the Koch brothers have begun to realize that their attempts to stop the ACA are getting them nowhere. Last week, a representative of Koch Industries sent a <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/10/koch-industries-doesnt-want-be-tainted-obamacare-prompted-shutdown/70350/\">letter</a> to members of the Senate distancing the company from efforts to defund Obamacare, while still making it clear that Koch really does not like the law. </p><p>Does this mean the Koch brothers are done with their various and multifaceted efforts to bring it down? Probably not, but if they at least scale back their efforts to just distributing free beers, that might not be such a bad thing.</p><p>After what they have put us all through, we deserve one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420191676|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|1d357a6174dea3e638b3e37659b80853598a49b7 -->",

        "body":"<p>I don't believe the Democrats <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/11/democrats-win-house-2014-midterms\">will win back the House of Representatives</a> in 2014. President Obama's low approval rating, combined with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_midterm_election\">usual midterm loss</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cla.temple.edu/ipa/wp-content/blogs.dir/8/files/2012/12/Bafumi-Erikson-Wlezien-Midterm-Elections.pdf\">normal movement away (pdf)</a> from the White House party on the national House ballot, should keep Republicans in control. Yet, there's a difference between thinking whether the Democrats \"will\" win back the House or whether they \"can\" win it back.</p><p>Right now, the Democrats hold a lead of about 4-5pt per the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-national-house-race\">HuffPollster</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/generic_congressional_vote-2170.html\">Real Clear Politics</a> average. Many have concluded that this lead would not be enough to take back the House, if the election were held today. However, I believe that it quite likely <em>would be enough</em>. </p><p>How so? Let's address a bunch of reasons people expect that a 4-5pt Democratic lead on the national House ballot would result in Republicans still holding the House – and then show why I think those could be wrong. </p><p><strong>1. A uniform shift of 4-5pt on all House seats would still leave Republicans winning a majority of seats</strong></p><p>North Carolina Republican Congressman Robert Pittenger was the <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2013/01/02/1382471/thanks-to-gerrymandering-democrats-would-need-to-win-the-popular-vote-by-over-7-percent-to-take-back-the-house/\">\"median\" representative in 2012</a>. Half the races were decided by more than his 6.1pt margin and half were decided by less. Given that Democrats won the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012\">national House vote</a> by 1.4pt, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_national_swing\">uniform swing</a> across all districts would imply that Democrats would need to win the national House vote by 7.5pt to take back the House. </p><p>Count me as one of the people who does not believe in uniform swings. It's not that the uniform swing is uninformative; it's that it is very inexact. There are <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/g-o-p-has-2-in-3-chance-of-taking-house-model-forecasts/\">many factors</a> that go into House races, including challenger quality, money spent, and whether or not the incumbent is running for re-election. Most of those are unknown at this point for key races. </p><p>You only need to look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2006\">2006 election</a> to get an idea. Back <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2004\">in 2004</a>, Republicans won the national House vote by 2.6pt. They won the median district by a little over 10pt. In other words, there was that same 7.5pt pro-Republican bias between the national House vote and the median district in 2004 as there was last year.</p><p>When we examine 2006, we see the bias simply didn't hold. Democrats only won the national House vote by 8pt, which should have given them the thinnest of majorities per a uniform swing. Instead, they took 233, or 13 more, seats than a uniform swing implied. </p><p>The 218th seat won by the Democrats belonged to Leonard Boswell, who had actually taken the seat easily in 2004. He had health problems, which led to a closer than expected re-election campaign. Boswell, with a winning margin of 5.4pt, might have survived even if the national Democratic margin had been closer to 3pt. </p><p>My <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/20/democrats-have-a-chance-2014\">own math</a>, taking into account redistricting in 2011, says a 3pt Democratic win in the national vote and a takeover of the House would not be nearly as likely as in 2006; but a 4 or 5pt victory would probably do the trick.</p><p><strong>2. The experts say there are very few seats up for grabs</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings\">indispensable Cook Political Report</a> has only has 13 Democratic-held seats listed in the relatively competitive tossup or \"lean\" category. Of course, Democrats need to take 17 seats to win the House. The ratings reflect, among other things, a lack of strong challengers for the Democrats and lack of retirements by Republicans.</p><p>The thing is that expert ratings (like most polling) are not all that predictive a year out from an election. At this point in the 2006 cycle, there were 17 Republican seats in the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20060627180349/http://www.cookpolitical.com/races/report_pdfs/2006_house_comp_oct8.pdf\">lean or tossup categories (pdf)</a>. That's well short of the 30 seats that Democrats would ultimately take from Republicans. At this point in the 2010 cycle, there were 28 Democratic seats in the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101029020519/http://cookpolitical.com/charts/house/competitive_2009-10-08_12-03-36.php\">lean or tossup category</a>. Republicans, of course, went onto gain <em>63 seats</em> in 2010.</p><p>It's not until later in the cycle when individual seat rankings become quite useful. That's when potential challengers and incumbents read the national environment and decide to run or not. Chances are that if the 4-5pt Democratic lead holds, the individual seat rankings will reflect that edge. For now, individual seat ratings probably aren't all that helpful to understanding which way and how hard the wind is blowing.</p><p><strong>3. The Abramowitz model says Democrats need something like a 13pt margin on the national House ballot</strong></p><p>Alan Abramowitz's <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/midterm-forecast-democrats-may-gain-house-seats-in-2014-but-majority-probably-out-of-reach/\">national House ballot to seats model</a> seems to have <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/07/news/la-pn-small-democratic-gain-midterm-election-20130207\">unusual sway</a> among some. The model is elegant in the sense that it does a good job of trying to map the midterm penalty and how much exposure the majority party has, in a minimalistic fashion. The problem is that some don't seem to quite understand how the model should work.</p><p>It's not a straight national vote-to-seat equation. It's built for early September of a midterm year. Abramowitz isn't saying that a 13pt Democratic margin in the national House ballot on election day is what Democrats need to take over the House. What he is saying is that a 13pt lead in September is likely to shrink because of the natural movement away from the White House party on the national House ballot during the course of the election year. </p><p>Moreover, the model is inexact. It would be within the margin of error of the model for Democrats to take back the House with a 2pt September lead on the national House ballot. In 2010, the model forecasted a Republican gain of 45 seats per my calculation. That was 18 seats off the final Republican gain of 63 seats. </p><p>Abramowitz's forecast is a good starting-point for understanding how uphill is the Democrats' task in taking back the House, but it is far from perfect.</p><p><strong>4. The final national House ballot surveys are biased against Republicans</strong></p><p>Charlie Cook has a <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/off-to-the-races/midterm-elections-could-be-a-wave-but-who-s-going-to-drown-20130729\">rule that you subtract 2pt</a> from the Democratic margin on the final national House ballot to know how the national House vote is actually going to pan out. That may have worked over five years ago, though it doesn't seem to work anymore. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2008_generic_congressional_vote-2173.html\">2008</a>, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2010_generic_congressional_vote-2171.html\">2010</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2012_generic_congressional_vote-3525.html\">2012</a>, the Real Clear Politics average of the national House ballot underestimated the actual Democratic standing in the national House vote. So, there's no reason to think the final national House ballot will overstate the Democrats' standing in 2014.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There are plenty of reasons the Democrats won't win back the House. But it's not impossible that they will. If the same national environment that is producing a 4-5pt on the national House ballot still exists in a year's time, Democrats may very well win back the House.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420078259|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|65e429fc8dac703cc8c2e7ed19c4d389cd3387b7 -->",

        "body":"<p>I don't think there is anything wrong with making a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2013/oct/14/miley-cyrus-tongue-madonna-pop-star\" title=\"\">role model out of Miley Cyrus</a>, as long as she is not your only role model. But the trouble is there aren't many relatable role models for young girls who have as much substance as they do sex appeal. Cyrus, Rihanna and Taylor Swift are all hugely talented women beloved by teenagers, but they don't talk about much beyond love, sex and the pleasure and pain brought about by both.</p><p>It's hard to find a woman as inspiring as my teen icon, Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill. A documentary about Hanna, <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a>, is being shown at the <a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=punk-singer\" title=\"\">London Film Festival</a> this week, and I would urge young women in the city to go and see it. Hanna showed me that life gets exciting when you start thinking beyond sex, your body and how others see you.</p><p>When puberty hit, I didn't know what to do with myself. At the time, I loved Mariah Carey, but Mariah was so remote and glossy that I thought the Queen was probably a more realistic role model for me. As well as changing physically, I was filled with restlessness. I was ready to abandon the cornerstones of my childhood – Disney films, Little Women and the chunky knitted waistcoats beloved of the parents of small girls in the mid to late 90s. But I had no idea what to replace them with. What came next? I longed for something thrilling to happen, someone to recruit me to their cult and turn my world on its head, and I haunted my tiny town like a grumpy ghost, searching for it among the magazines at the newsagents, and the heavy plum nail polish at the chemist.</p><p>It turned out that it was in the library all along.</p><p>When I saw the <a href=\"http://ellenvonunwerth.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Ellen von Unwerth</a> photograph on the cover of <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/hole-live-through-this-20120525\" title=\"\">Hole's Live Through This</a> album, my relief was visceral. The photograph of a gorgeous, ruined, weeping beauty queen contained the message that being hot doesn't necessarily make you happy. Holding my breath at the checkout desk, I waited for the librarian to deny me access to such subversive material. Luckily, she just wanted 50p.</p><p>Back at home, listening covertly through headphones, I discovered the album's contents were even more potent than the cover. I heard the words of a woman who was blatant about her need to be desired, but furious with those who desired her. Someone who could articulate the urge to objectify yourself before anyone else got there first.</p><p>When it was time for Courtney Love and co to go back to the library, I was ready for their CD rack neighbours, Bikini Kill and their scarily titled Pussy Whipped album. (Looking back, it was quite a progressive library.) Among the insistent stomping beats and sludgy guitar riffs, I found my pubescent Desiderata. Kathleen Hanna represented sex and politics without borders. She made feminism, which I had previously associated with misery and dreariness, sound fabulous and alluring. Hanna made me feel as if I was entitled to join her world and that nothing could stop me from speaking my mind.</p><p>Without Bikini Kill, I might have bought the Spice Girls' confusing messages about girl power and Thatcherism wholesale. And without further context, the messages today's young girls are getting about self-worth, sex and desirability are pretty baffling. The young women I know are smart enough to realise they need something a bit more solid, but they can't find it on TV or on the radio, so they are looking back to bands like Bikini Kill and Hole to provide it.</p><p>We need to search for and celebrate contemporary musicians who invoke the spirit of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/30/riot-grrrl-collection-zine-olivia-laing\" title=\"\">riot grrrl</a> movement, otherwise the girls who need them most will never find them. And it's becoming increasingly unlikely that they'll bump into them at the library.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246998|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|73fcf192037b2cb2a523f96a47cb3e44d6e96e03 -->",

        "headline":"And so America's skewed democracy lurches on toward its next crisis",
        "body":"<p>Just as the House of Representatives was finally voting to reopen the government and save the nation from reneging on debt and inviting a downgrade, a House stenographer <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics-live/liveblog/live-updates-the-shutdown-9/?id=c7c5125a-dbc6-48e0-80e9-3302f05ac32b\">appears to have suffered a breakdown</a>. Grabbing the microphone, she started defending God's honour before the nation.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>He will not be mocked. The greatest deception here is this is not one nation under God. It never was. The constitution would not have been written by freemasons. They go against God. You cannot serve two masters.</p></blockquote><p>After being removed and questioned, she was taken away for psychiatric evaluation.</p><p>Her mental health is no laughing matter. But the <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/16/this-is-not-one-nation-under-god-house-stenographer-taken-from-the-floor-after-bizarre-outburst/\">description of her interjection by much of the media as a \"bizarre\" interruption to the House vote</a> deserves interrogation.</p><p>Because everything about this was bizarre. From the moment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\">Ted Cruz got up and started quoting Ashton Kutcher and talking about Star Wars</a> into the wee hours, this entire process has been nothing but bizarre. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\">America, once again, took the familiar road</a> from the height of dysfunction to the brink of default – until reality grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and slapped it straight, before it did itself and others grave harm.</p><p>Because America is powerful, the world has to take notice of these self-inflicted crises. But because it has become so predictably dysfunctional and routinely reckless, they are difficult to take seriously or, at times, even fathom. To the rest of the world and much of America, this is yet another dangerous folly. The fact that the nation did not default should come as cold comfort. The fact that we are even talking about it defaulting is a problem.</p><p>This particular flirtation with fate was driven by a visceral opposition to the moderate provision of something most western nations take for granted: healthcare. The reforms they opposed had been been passed by the very body of which they are a member and had been been approved by the US supreme court, the guardian of the very constitution they claimed to be defending. For this, they started a fight they never had the numbers to win and carried on waging it long after it was clear they had lost.</p><p>\"We're not going to be disrespected,\" <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\">insisted Republican Indiana Congressman Marlin Stutzman</a>, last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>Nor did anyone else. That's why the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/congress-budget-debate.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;\">Republicans went down to humiliating defeat</a>. As South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham admitted:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We took some bread crumbs and left an entire meal on the table. This has been a really bad two weeks for the Republican party.</p></blockquote><p>But to couch this episode only as a Democratic victory would really miss the point. For the process by which such a shutdown and breakdown could happen is not just the work of a few cranky Tea Party types. It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/shutdown-us-government-republican-party\">rooted in an electoral system that is heavily gerrymandered</a>, where only those who can pay, can play. The reason the Republican dissenters could proceed with such unstrategic zeal is because they are in safe, rigged seats and so risk no challenge at the polls.</p><p>Indeed, given that they only have to fear nomination within their own party, rather than election by the nation at large, there is an incentive to act out in this way because it appeals to the base. When constituencies are so heavily contorted in the interests of incumbents that there is precious little consequence to anything a politician does, then <a href=\" http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/\">you don't really have a democracy</a>, you just have the vote.</p><p>This temporary resolution buys them time, but it does not by them any real solution – since there is absolutely nothing to prevent a repeat performance. Which is what it is: a performance. As said Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid put it on Wednesday night:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm tired. Concluding this crisis is historic. But let's be honest: this was pain inflicted on the nation for no good reason. We cannot … we cannot, cannot make the same mistakes again.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, they can. Almost certainly, they will.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420250081|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|b7f14014e6dda3ab7f94572ce88a821ae1d8f94d -->",

        "headline":"The fight against obesity starts in the head, not in the stomach",
        "body":"<p>Having your pot belly jiggled at any age isn't nice. The doctor (I remember your name, lady – I've not forgotten) who decided mine needed wobbling when I was 16 was rather misguided. No – actually she was tremendously insensitive. Her pinching of my belly fat combined with the question \"when are you going to get rid of this?\" sent me straight home to a packet of salt and vinegar Hula Hoops. After a horrible medical appointment, I indulged in a beautiful, fatty, carb jewellery fest that adorned every finger. I swallowed it fast in an act of fat teenage rebellion.</p><p>The talking-tough approach never worked with me. Over the years various medical professionals tried different techniques to tackle my obesity. There was the slip-it-in-at-the-end-of-the-appointment ploy: \"Have you considered losing a bit of weight?\" Nah, bye! There was the blaming-an-unrelated-medical-condition-on-your-weight tactic, in which you would go in with a sore throat and somehow your weight becomes the issue instead. On one occasion tonsillitis turned out to be a magnificent slimming technique until I discovered 99 flake cornets were quite soothing. However the subject of my weight was tackled by doctors, their manner was often rather aggressive, with a perceptible impatience and distaste.</p><p>The new National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/16/dont-blame-patients-overweight-doctors-told\" title=\"\">doctors must treat obese patients with respect</a> is therefore very welcome. I don't want anyone else to go through having their fat wobbled. Nice's realisation that programmes run by Weight Watchers and Slimming World are not a \"magic bullet\" is commendable too. A female relative has been alternating between both groups for more than a year because the NHS pays for it. Her weight loss from these sessions has been nil. As she says, though, it's a \"great little social club and good to get out\".</p><p>Our obesity problem has gone way beyond the remit of most GPs. As Nice has realised, the important issues in any weight-loss journey are the individual's desire to lose weight and the reason why they are obese in the first place. In my experience this often involves deep-rooted psychological factors, which mean food is an emotional panacea. In many cases you have to address what's going on in the person's head long before you can tackle what is happening to their body.</p><p>Every doctor should have an individual approach for each patient. This softly, softly approach won't work with everyone: a friend lost five stone after being told he would never see his son get married. That would have been way too harsh for many, but the medical profession is caught on the horns of a big fat problem: what will motivate others will send others straight to an entire tub of Häagen Dazs.</p><p>We have to stop seeing doctors as the solution to what happens on our scales and simply as people who can provide a range of services that we can take advantage of – and that for many has to include psychiatric intervention. For others it's as simple as stop making excuses, eat less and move more. As adults our weight is our personal responsibility. We have to work out what we need with the help of the medical profession and not expect them to have any silver bullet – delivered in a soft or more brutal way.</p><p>What partly worked for me was a Sri Lankan gynaecologist who very gently suggested that losing some weight may help me to resume a normal menstrual cycle. He asked me what exercise I enjoyed doing – I said walking with the personal stereo in fields pretending I was in pop videos – and he told me to do it more. At 41 I still do this and it still works. My weight goes up and down – but that's my problem. As it is yours.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420238775|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|b82ea3331303f86019e56569354f81c170053ad7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Throughout my life, whenever I have felt sad, or lonely, or abandoned, especially when there has been no apparent external reason, my mum has reacted by doing this thing. She does the thing most often when it's clear that I am struggling to cope with the world – when things become too much, and I become stressed, or depressed, or anxious, or even, rarely, apoplectic with rage. In other words, she does the thing in times of crisis. The thing is this: she looks at me, then sighs. Her chi setting switches to that of \"failed mother\", as she shakes her head ruefully and says: \"Perhaps I put you in nursery too early.\" She has done this for as long as I remember.</p><p>I thought of her this morning when I saw an article with the headline <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10384281/Children-who-spend-time-in-nurseries-more-likely-to-develop-behavioural-problems.html\" title=\"\">Children who spend time in nurseries \"more likely to develop behavioural problems\"</a> in the Daily Telegraph. The article cites a study that says exposure to some forms of early education could be linked to emotional problems. No shit, I thought, not because my mum did put me into nursery too early and I'm now suffering from deep-seated abandonment issues which manifest themselves when I'm unable to perform simple tasks such as leaving the house with ease and grace, but because it is an inevitable fact of life: human beings cause one another emotional problems. Therefore being around other human beings causes emotional problems.</p><p>The point is, the world is teaming with the emotions of people and some of them are actually really horrible. But you have to get out there sooner or later.</p><p>I can think of countless humans who have caused me emotional problems from pre-school age onwards, including myriad frenemies, flings, boyfriends and a particularly critical ex-flatmate whose vitriol regarding those around her had the power to crush the confidence of even her male physics teacher, whom she once proudly told us she had reduced to tears by telling him he was crap at his job and should just retire now, the failure. But then she once had a childminder, so what do you expect?</p><p>I realise that I am wading into a whole, loaded early-years debate, wherein people are more invested than I can even imagine, and some are even quite nasty to one another (perhaps it's time they all had some squash and some dreamy-nighty-snoozy time). But having already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/vegetarian-parents-kids\" title=\"\">made clear how I feel about home-schooled kids in another column</a>, I might as well extend that to the under-fives.</p><p>This, however, would imply that I care about the choices other women make for their children, which I don't. What I do care about is the persistent conservative agenda regarding early years care, and how its proponents seem to think that, unless a mother is attached to her child at all times, she has basically failed as a parent. Does nursery school make children more hyperactive? Er, probably. Being put in a room with 22 other four-year-olds, all of whom are mad as a box of frogs anyway, can do that to a little fella. But it's also loads of fun. All this worrying makes me wonder just how many of these \"nurseries cause emotional problems\" articles my mother has been exposed to in her time.</p><p>Of course, mums will always blame themselves no matter what. It comes with the job. Sorry, not job, unpaid, 18-year-long internship where a bunch of people who aren't even your boss are constantly telling you how much you suck. As I have mentioned before, my little brother is severely disabled. For this my mum has persistently blamed herself, wondering if it was everything from the food she ate when she was pregnant, to the vaccinations, to her genes, to her age when she conceived, to the diet she fed him, to the epidural. The media have obviously played a massive part in this.</p><p>Perhaps it's high time that we all tell our mums to get rid of the guilt. I'm telling mine now: Mum, stop blaming yourself. There was nothing you could have done.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420233586|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|03567433cd53c3a88f8e78c641309ff02f4bd0f1 -->",

        "headline":"Teachers do not take the decision to strike lightly",
        "body":"<p>The derision with which teachers are treated in much of the rightwing press creates the impression that it is our fault it's all gone to pot. Politicians believe the remedy is to throw more policies at the \"problem\". Meanwhile, teachers themselves are silenced in the cacophony of condemnation.</p><p>Today's co-ordinated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/17/teachers-strike-pay-thousands-schools-nasuwt\" title=\"\">strike action by the NUT and the NASUWT</a> seeks to protect our pensions and address the dismantling of our national pay system and proposals for a longer school day and year. In short, we are looking to be heard.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/08/england-young-people-league-table-basic-skills-oecd\" title=\"\">England \"is the only country in the developed world where the generation approaching retirement is more literate and numerate than the youngest adults</a>\". Some will have found the results confusing. How, at a time of year-on-year increases in the level of GCSE pass rates could we have such levels of illiteracy and innumeracy? Were poor teaching and teachers responsible? Some blame can rightly be apportioned here. Similarly, our fixation with GCSEs and league tables deserves to share in the opprobrium: it has had dire consequences for some of our young. Students in need of basic literacy and numeracy skills have been left behind by a culture which, as a result of government policy, funnelled all effort into the same narrow examination route. Teachers I have worked with over the past six years have been ringing this alarm bell to deaf ears.</p><p>Today's strike action leaves many teachers, myself included, oscillating between inertia and action. Will it serve only to alienate us from the public? How best do we fight for our rights in a climate where, it seems, a race to the bottom is a given reality? What would the acceptable public \"face\" of our strike action look like? We can begin by injecting nuance into our arguments, muddying the clear waters the education secretary, Michael Gove, insists on seeing. I am conflicted by the polarising of positions we are witnessing between the teaching unions and Gove. As a person of the left I cannot abandon my commitment to what the unions stand for. Yet I can see merit in some of Gove's ideas. Denied space in which to voice this or any other position, teachers are left with no choice but to take to the streets.</p><p>Gove's policies are often ideological, rushed and based on little evidence. They have helped to create dangerously low teacher morale. Yet under him we have seen a couple of policies that progressives can be happy with. They stand out among the many that are issued and then, thankfully, scrapped. When, a few weeks ago, Gove's department announced what was in essence the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/29/headteachers-criticise-new-rules-gcse-exams\" title=\"\">scrapping of GCSE resits</a>, I and others begrudgingly admitted that this, perhaps, wasn't all that bad. Yes, the timing of the seismic shift – mid-term, weeks before the November GCSE entries – was a perfect illustration of Gove's disrespect for the profession. He might as well have said: \"To hell with schools, pupils and parents, I can make changes even when courses have already begun.\"</p><p>In spite of the above, many approved of the reform. Even the most liberal of teachers would concede that resits were open to abuse. Yet the problem was not of our making. It is successive governments that have instituted what one colleague calls an \"endless obsession with GCSE results and league tables\". It is disingenuous to accuse schools of \"gaming\" the system when the stakes are so high.</p><p>The controversy over resits in some ways best exemplifies how battlelines cannot easily be drawn. As a profession we perhaps need to instigate an open conversation with the public about the fact that some teachers, a minority, should not be in a classroom.</p><p>The education secretary has expertly played his hand over this particular policy. The unions are doing a disservice to our young by supporting incompetent and under-performing teachers, or so the argument goes. For their part the unions overlook the reality that a minority of teachers are under-performing.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/08/schools-performance-pay-teachers-education\" title=\"\">Performance-related pay </a>is, however, not the answer. Evidence the policy will improve standards is inconclusive. Yet the agenda remains. Such populism ignores teacher's warnings that pay based on performance will damage the collaborative ethos many schools have in place and lead to a toxic competitiveness from which students will suffer most.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, choosing to strike won't be easy or clear-cut. Many, anxious about the public perception, will nevertheless maintain the picket line because of the continued unwillingness by the government to either listen to teachers or view us as legitimate participants in the education debate. Teachers will take action despite being worried that in striking we merely give Gove more rope with which to hang us.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420232888|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|c04e97130fb7aa2ce0a23b9745a0e02085f5a12f -->",

        "body":"<p>Is it necessary to have your own baby in order to flick on the maternal switch?</p><p>I've always thought so, as mine seems to have been permanently turned off throughout my adult life. Getting married, having babies and craving domestic bliss are not milestones I have ever dreamt of. It would have been easier if I had, because I would have done something about it and not be what I am now – a woman in my 30s, with no baby and neither desperately yearning to reproduce nor vehemently against it. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/16/choice-child-free-admirable-not-selfish\" title=\"\">We're a diseased breed, women like me, viewed with suspicion because we sit on the fence</a>. It isn't normal. I repeat: it isn't normal. Is it?</p><p>Of course, I've thought about having children, but time and circumstance haven't brought them about. I thought for years that I must be missing the broody gene.</p><p>I also worried that I might not measure up if I didn't want motherhood badly enough; I might not have enough love in me if I had a child or adopted one, so I shouldn't bother just for the sake of the supposed life-affirming fulfilment that comes with it.</p><p>Now, no longer with the luxury of time on my side, I've no idea what to do. I have started coming to terms with the fact that I may never have a child, but it's not been without some lamenting. I've tried to ignore the suggestion that I'll never be a \"whole woman\" unless I find myself one day lying exhausted and bruised in a labour ward. I've told myself it wasn't meant to be, and that's OK.</p><p>But now a life-changing event I hadn't foreseen, with consequences I didn't bank on, has intervened.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/15/women-over-age-40-babies\" title=\"\">My 53-year-old mother has just had a baby boy</a> and I am ashamed to admit I spent the nine months of his development dreading his arrival. Her pregnancy was a confusing and emotionally loaded time for me. The pressure to have my own child weighed me down. If anyone was meant to be having a baby, it was me, not her. The natural order of things had been upset.</p><p>I panicked. I've never had a sibling and didn't know what to do with babies, least of all someone else's.</p><p>The fear intensified as my mother's due date inched closer, and I worried that I wouldn't connect with her child.</p><p>But as soon as I met him, my fear evaporated. It kicked in the moment I held my new half-brother, 20 minutes old, for the first time at the hospital.</p><p>As he fell asleep, curled into a ball on my chest, warm and heavy, nuzzling my neck and trusting me to hold on to him and keep him safe, I felt as if he was mine. I wanted to keep him. That moment was unlike anything I've ever felt before. It was the best feeling in the world and I never wanted it to end.</p><p>I looked at my formidable mother in awe and disbelief at what she had just done and thought, \"I love this kid. I actually love him.\"</p><p>It's a wonderful thing, being the adult sibling of a baby. I never believed I had a maternal cell in my body, but something's shifted. It may be what parents I know have tried to convey when they've said: \"It changes you.\" It could be a kind of sibling love that I've always been jealous about among my friends but have never known. Or it could, if we cast genetics aside for a moment, simply be that precious love one feels for a baby because it needs to be cared for.</p><p>Just a week old, so vulnerable and incapable of anything more than biting, sucking, crying or sleeping, he's teaching me what falling in love really is. I'm discovering it is an inescapable longing to be near him, a passionate commitment to look out for and protect him above all else.</p><p>I didn't see it coming and don't feel it leaving me any time soon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420035290|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|c6d769b9fbacefcc5992bf4a712c4184bf318d3e -->",

        "headline":"The London housing bubble will gobble up our capital's civic space",
        "body":"<p>I'll tell you what's wrong with the&nbsp;conversation about housing – we all know there's a market failure. Any market of essential goods that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/15/house-prices-hit-record-high\" title=\"\">most people can't afford</a> is a failure. But, in still talking about it entirely as individuals who are unable to buy what they want, we contain ourselves within a relatively small consumer space. We fight the logic of the market with the logic of … consumers who can't afford the market. But what we're really looking at is a crisis of civic space as much as a crisis of personal space.</p><p>The library I learned to read in, and where I had my first Saturday job, has been turned into a prep school. For stupid, sentimental reasons, this saddens me far more than if it had turned into flats. Spaces aren't being distributed away from all children towards rich adults, they're being taken away from all children and given to rich children. The same local authority, along with many others, is talking about selling its town hall. It's entirely reasonable.</p><p>Think how many flats you could get into one of those buildings, and how majestic their windows would be. It would solve a lot of financial crises (at least for a fortnight) in one knock, if those employees could just work from home. The entailments for local democracy would be seismic and irreversible, but it would be hard to put an actual cash value on them. The cash value of the land, meanwhile, is very easily established – and it's massive.</p><p>Local government has seemed so boring for so long that I thought that nothing they could do would be as bad as having to listen to them deciding whether to do it. I've shaken that off now. They could do some terrible things and it wouldn't even be their fault.</p><p>Naturally, this comes back to a property bubble, and the buck ends with a London property bubble. It may not seem important if you're outside London but it is, for two reasons. First, \"London\", in terms of land values, will soon translate as \"anywhere that is commutable to London\". Second, the next general election wouldn't be the first that politicians have fought entirely&nbsp;on the economics of the capital city, and it won't be the last.</p><p>The sheer, dysfunctional exclusivity of the London housing market is obvious to everyone: the fact that the coalition, with its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/help-to-buy-scheme\" title=\"\">Help to Buy scheme</a>, is answering a crisis of affordability by shovelling more money at the richest people they can find merely reflects the&nbsp;intensity of their conservatism. It&nbsp;does not suggest that they're not aware there's a problem. Everybody knows there's a problem.</p><p>David Cameron denies this will create a bubble, saying that he's empowered the Bank of England to stop a bubble being created. This is a little bit like saying you've empowered the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, to stop it raining. If the debt needed to buy a house is far more than most earn, the ratio of household debt to GDP will be very high, and banks will be over-leveraged. These are the preconditions for a housing bubble. This isn't the view of Marxist economists, it's the view of as mainstream a figure as this year's Nobel prizewinner in economics, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-shiller-nyt-housing-bubble-quote-2013-10\" title=\"\">Robert Shiller</a>.</p><p>But there is a reason why Cameron is so unruffled by the idea of a bubble, even if it's not his given reason: there is a perception – which is not, in the short-term, unfounded – that the bubble in the south-east cannot burst. The reason is foreign investment, which runs all the way from the premium properties (75% of central London newbuilds are sold abroad before they even appear on the UK market), to typically undervalued areas, like Brixton in south London, where an estate agent told me recently: \"It's actually not so much young professionals, it's foreign investment, buy-to-lets.\"</p><p>Since people still need to live in the capital, those still almost able to buy are shunted further out, and even quite distant towns take on the glister of London prices. None of this means the bubble won't burst eventually, but it does mean it will take longer than the 18 months we have to go until the election, and that when it does, the bust probably won't function in the classic way.</p><p>The house price crash of the early 1990s meant the genuine degradation of capital. Mortgage companies had fire sales and houses were auctioned, sometimes for less than they were worth. The spectacle was appalling, as well-intentioned people who'd thought they were being responsible and far-sighted were suddenly homeless.</p><p>And yet the result was that, by the mid-90s, property was affordable again. Set this against the 2007/8 sub-prime housing crash, which impacted on London prices for about five minutes.</p><p>Governments now believe that London can no longer go bust. This is probably untrue; anywhere can go bust. The <a href=\"http://arno.unimaas.nl/show.cgi?fid=10696\" title=\"\">Herengracht Canal index</a> is a record of house prices on Amsterdam's most prestigious waterway. Economists love it because it goes back to 1628. But it gives you that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias\" title=\"\">Ozymandias</a> feeling; once upon a time, that was Park Lane. Nowhere stays Park Lane forever. But if we always insulate ourselves against a bust we will, quite quickly, price ourselves out of civic space.</p><p>So, sure, we need to build more houses. We all agree on that, apart from&nbsp;– bizarrely – the people in charge. But at some point we also have to articulate the point of collective ownership, and this will inevitably entail articulating where and why developers aren't welcome, which will become where and why the investment of rest of the world isn't welcome. Either that, or remake a capital elsewhere.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420181374|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|8cf25619e326e168e122426f47c0e15580a7e36b -->",

        "headline":"The fight against obesity starts in the head, not in the stomach",
        "body":"<p>Having your pot belly jiggled at any age isn't nice. The doctor (I remember your name, lady – I've not forgotten) who decided mine needed wobbling when I was 16 was rather misguided. No – actually she was tremendously insensitive. Her pinching of my belly fat combined with the question \"when are you going to get rid of this?\" sent me straight home to a packet of salt and vinegar Hula Hoops. After a horrible medical appointment, I indulged in a beautiful, fatty, carb jewellery fest that adorned every finger. I swallowed it fast in an act of fat teenage rebellion.</p><p>The talking-tough approach never worked with me. Over the years various medical professionals tried different techniques to tackle my obesity. There was the slip-it-in-at-the-end-of-the-appointment ploy: \"Have you considered losing a bit of weight?\" Nah, bye! There was the blaming-an-unrelated-medical-condition-on-your-weight tactic, in which you would go in with a sore throat and somehow your weight becomes the issue instead. On one occasion tonsillitis turned out to be a magnificent slimming technique until I discovered 99 flake cornets were quite soothing. However the subject of my weight was tackled by doctors, their manner was often rather aggressive, with a perceptible impatience and distaste.</p><p>The new National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/16/dont-blame-patients-overweight-doctors-told\" title=\"\">doctors must treat obese patients with respect</a> is therefore very welcome. I don't want anyone else to go through having their fat wobbled. Nice's realisation that programmes run by Weight Watchers and Slimming World are not a \"magic bullet\" is commendable too. A female relative has been alternating between both groups for more than a year because the NHS pays for it. Her weight loss from these sessions has been nil. As she says, though, it's a \"great little social club and good to get out\".</p><p>Our obesity problem has gone way beyond the remit of most GPs. As Nice has realised, the important issues in any weight-loss journey are the individual's desire to lose weight and the reason why they are obese in the first place. In my experience this often involves deep-rooted psychological factors, which mean food is an emotional panacea. In many cases you have to address what's going on in the person's head long before you can tackle what is happening to their body.</p><p>Every doctor should have an individual approach for each patient. This softly, softly approach won't work with everyone: a friend lost five stone after being told he would never see his son get married. That would have been way too harsh for many, but the medical profession is caught on the horns of a big fat problem: what will motivate others will send others straight to an entire tub of Häagen Dazs.</p><p>We have to stop seeing doctors as the solution to what happens on our scales and simply as people who can provide a range of services that we can take advantage of – and that for many has to include psychiatric intervention. For others it's as simple as stop making excuses, eat less and move more. As adults our weight is our personal responsibility. We have to work out what we need with the help of the medical profession and not expect them to have any silver bullet – delivered in a soft or more brutal way.</p><p>What partly worked for me was a Sri Lankan gynaecologist who very gently suggested that losing some weight may help me to resume a normal menstrual cycle. He asked me what exercise I enjoyed doing – I said walking with the personal stereo in fields pretending I was in pop videos – and he told me to do it more. At 41 I still do this and it still works. My weight goes up and down – but that's my problem. As it is yours.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420238775|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|b82ea3331303f86019e56569354f81c170053ad7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Just as the House of Representatives was finally voting to reopen the government and save the nation from reneging on debt and inviting a downgrade, a House stenographer <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics-live/liveblog/live-updates-the-shutdown-9/?id=c7c5125a-dbc6-48e0-80e9-3302f05ac32b\">appears to have suffered a breakdown</a>. Grabbing the microphone, she started defending God's honour before the nation.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>He will not be mocked. The greatest deception here is this is not one nation under God. It never was. The constitution would not have been written by freemasons. They go against God. You cannot serve two masters.</p></blockquote><p>After being removed and questioned, she was taken away for psychiatric evaluation.</p><p>Her mental health is no laughing matter. But the <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/16/this-is-not-one-nation-under-god-house-stenographer-taken-from-the-floor-after-bizarre-outburst/\">description of her interjection by much of the media as a \"bizarre\" interruption to the House vote</a> deserves interrogation.</p><p>Because everything about this was bizarre. From the moment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\">Ted Cruz got up and started quoting Ashton Kutcher and talking about Star Wars</a> into the wee hours, this entire process has been nothing but bizarre. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\">America, once again, took the familiar road</a> from the height of dysfunction to the brink of default – until reality grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and slapped it straight, before it did itself and others grave harm.</p><p>Because America is powerful, the world has to take notice of these self-inflicted crises. But because it has become so predictably dysfunctional and routinely reckless, they are difficult to take seriously or, at times, even fathom. To the rest of the world and much of America, this is yet another dangerous folly. The fact that the nation did not default should come as cold comfort. The fact that we are even talking about it defaulting is a problem.</p><p>This particular flirtation with fate was driven by a visceral opposition to the moderate provision of something most western nations take for granted: healthcare. The reforms they opposed had been been passed by the very body of which they are a member and had been been approved by the US supreme court, the guardian of the very constitution they claimed to be defending. For this, they started a fight they never had the numbers to win and carried on waging it long after it was clear they had lost.</p><p>\"We're not going to be disrespected,\" <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\">insisted Republican Indiana Congressman Marlin Stutzman</a>, last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>Nor did anyone else. That's why the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/congress-budget-debate.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;\">Republicans went down to humiliating defeat</a>. As South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham admitted:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We took some bread crumbs and left an entire meal on the table. This has been a really bad two weeks for the Republican party.</p></blockquote><p>But to couch this episode only as a Democratic victory would really miss the point. For the process by which such a shutdown and breakdown could happen is not just the work of a few cranky Tea Party types. It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/shutdown-us-government-republican-party\">rooted in an electoral system that is heavily gerrymandered</a>, where only those who can pay, can play. The reason the Republican dissenters could proceed with such unstrategic zeal is because they are in safe, rigged seats and so risk no challenge at the polls.</p><p>Indeed, given that they only have to fear nomination within their own party, rather than election by the nation at large, there is an incentive to act out in this way because it appeals to the base. When constituencies are so heavily contorted in the interests of incumbents that there is precious little consequence to anything a politician does, then <a href=\" http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/\">you don't really have a democracy</a>, you just have the vote.</p><p>This temporary resolution buys them time, but it does not by them any real solution – since there is absolutely nothing to prevent a repeat performance. Which is what it is: a performance. As said Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid put it on Wednesday night:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm tired. Concluding this crisis is historic. But let's be honest: this was pain inflicted on the nation for no good reason. We cannot … we cannot, cannot make the same mistakes again.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, they can. Almost certainly, they will.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420250081|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|b7f14014e6dda3ab7f94572ce88a821ae1d8f94d -->",

        "body":"<p>Is it necessary to have your own baby in order to flick on the maternal switch?</p><p>I've always thought so, as mine seems to have been permanently turned off throughout my adult life. Getting married, having babies and craving domestic bliss are not milestones I have ever dreamt of. It would have been easier if I had, because I would have done something about it and not be what I am now – a woman in my 30s, with no baby and neither desperately yearning to reproduce nor vehemently against it. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/16/choice-child-free-admirable-not-selfish\" title=\"\">We're a diseased breed, women like me, viewed with suspicion because we sit on the fence</a>. It isn't normal. I repeat: it isn't normal. Is it?</p><p>Of course, I've thought about having children, but time and circumstance haven't brought them about. I thought for years that I must be missing the broody gene.</p><p>I also worried that I might not measure up if I didn't want motherhood badly enough; I might not have enough love in me if I had a child or adopted one, so I shouldn't bother just for the sake of the supposed life-affirming fulfilment that comes with it.</p><p>Now, no longer with the luxury of time on my side, I've no idea what to do. I have started coming to terms with the fact that I may never have a child, but it's not been without some lamenting. I've tried to ignore the suggestion that I'll never be a \"whole woman\" unless I find myself one day lying exhausted and bruised in a labour ward. I've told myself it wasn't meant to be, and that's OK.</p><p>But now a life-changing event I hadn't foreseen, with consequences I didn't bank on, has intervened.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/15/women-over-age-40-babies\" title=\"\">My 53-year-old mother has just had a baby boy</a> and I am ashamed to admit I spent the nine months of his development dreading his arrival. Her pregnancy was a confusing and emotionally loaded time for me. The pressure to have my own child weighed me down. If anyone was meant to be having a baby, it was me, not her. The natural order of things had been upset.</p><p>I panicked. I've never had a sibling and didn't know what to do with babies, least of all someone else's.</p><p>The fear intensified as my mother's due date inched closer, and I worried that I wouldn't connect with her child.</p><p>But as soon as I met him, my fear evaporated. It kicked in the moment I held my new half-brother, 20 minutes old, for the first time at the hospital.</p><p>As he fell asleep, curled into a ball on my chest, warm and heavy, nuzzling my neck and trusting me to hold on to him and keep him safe, I felt as if he was mine. I wanted to keep him. That moment was unlike anything I've ever felt before. It was the best feeling in the world and I never wanted it to end.</p><p>I looked at my formidable mother in awe and disbelief at what she had just done and thought, \"I love this kid. I actually love him.\"</p><p>It's a wonderful thing, being the adult sibling of a baby. I never believed I had a maternal cell in my body, but something's shifted. It may be what parents I know have tried to convey when they've said: \"It changes you.\" It could be a kind of sibling love that I've always been jealous about among my friends but have never known. Or it could, if we cast genetics aside for a moment, simply be that precious love one feels for a baby because it needs to be cared for.</p><p>Just a week old, so vulnerable and incapable of anything more than biting, sucking, crying or sleeping, he's teaching me what falling in love really is. I'm discovering it is an inescapable longing to be near him, a passionate commitment to look out for and protect him above all else.</p><p>I didn't see it coming and don't feel it leaving me any time soon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420035290|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|c6d769b9fbacefcc5992bf4a712c4184bf318d3e -->",

        "headline":"The London housing bubble will gobble up our capital's civic space",
        "body":"<p>I'll tell you what's wrong with the&nbsp;conversation about housing – we all know there's a market failure. Any market of essential goods that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/15/house-prices-hit-record-high\" title=\"\">most people can't afford</a> is a failure. But, in still talking about it entirely as individuals who are unable to buy what they want, we contain ourselves within a relatively small consumer space. We fight the logic of the market with the logic of … consumers who can't afford the market. But what we're really looking at is a crisis of civic space as much as a crisis of personal space.</p><p>The library I learned to read in, and where I had my first Saturday job, has been turned into a prep school. For stupid, sentimental reasons, this saddens me far more than if it had turned into flats. Spaces aren't being distributed away from all children towards rich adults, they're being taken away from all children and given to rich children. The same local authority, along with many others, is talking about selling its town hall. It's entirely reasonable.</p><p>Think how many flats you could get into one of those buildings, and how majestic their windows would be. It would solve a lot of financial crises (at least for a fortnight) in one knock, if those employees could just work from home. The entailments for local democracy would be seismic and irreversible, but it would be hard to put an actual cash value on them. The cash value of the land, meanwhile, is very easily established – and it's massive.</p><p>Local government has seemed so boring for so long that I thought that nothing they could do would be as bad as having to listen to them deciding whether to do it. I've shaken that off now. They could do some terrible things and it wouldn't even be their fault.</p><p>Naturally, this comes back to a property bubble, and the buck ends with a London property bubble. It may not seem important if you're outside London but it is, for two reasons. First, \"London\", in terms of land values, will soon translate as \"anywhere that is commutable to London\". Second, the next general election wouldn't be the first that politicians have fought entirely&nbsp;on the economics of the capital city, and it won't be the last.</p><p>The sheer, dysfunctional exclusivity of the London housing market is obvious to everyone: the fact that the coalition, with its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/help-to-buy-scheme\" title=\"\">Help to Buy scheme</a>, is answering a crisis of affordability by shovelling more money at the richest people they can find merely reflects the&nbsp;intensity of their conservatism. It&nbsp;does not suggest that they're not aware there's a problem. Everybody knows there's a problem.</p><p>David Cameron denies this will create a bubble, saying that he's empowered the Bank of England to stop a bubble being created. This is a little bit like saying you've empowered the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, to stop it raining. If the debt needed to buy a house is far more than most earn, the ratio of household debt to GDP will be very high, and banks will be over-leveraged. These are the preconditions for a housing bubble. This isn't the view of Marxist economists, it's the view of as mainstream a figure as this year's Nobel prizewinner in economics, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-shiller-nyt-housing-bubble-quote-2013-10\" title=\"\">Robert Shiller</a>.</p><p>But there is a reason why Cameron is so unruffled by the idea of a bubble, even if it's not his given reason: there is a perception – which is not, in the short-term, unfounded – that the bubble in the south-east cannot burst. The reason is foreign investment, which runs all the way from the premium properties (75% of central London newbuilds are sold abroad before they even appear on the UK market), to typically undervalued areas, like Brixton in south London, where an estate agent told me recently: \"It's actually not so much young professionals, it's foreign investment, buy-to-lets.\"</p><p>Since people still need to live in the capital, those still almost able to buy are shunted further out, and even quite distant towns take on the glister of London prices. None of this means the bubble won't burst eventually, but it does mean it will take longer than the 18 months we have to go until the election, and that when it does, the bust probably won't function in the classic way.</p><p>The house price crash of the early 1990s meant the genuine degradation of capital. Mortgage companies had fire sales and houses were auctioned, sometimes for less than they were worth. The spectacle was appalling, as well-intentioned people who'd thought they were being responsible and far-sighted were suddenly homeless.</p><p>And yet the result was that, by the mid-90s, property was affordable again. Set this against the 2007/8 sub-prime housing crash, which impacted on London prices for about five minutes.</p><p>Governments now believe that London can no longer go bust. This is probably untrue; anywhere can go bust. The <a href=\"http://arno.unimaas.nl/show.cgi?fid=10696\" title=\"\">Herengracht Canal index</a> is a record of house prices on Amsterdam's most prestigious waterway. Economists love it because it goes back to 1628. But it gives you that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias\" title=\"\">Ozymandias</a> feeling; once upon a time, that was Park Lane. Nowhere stays Park Lane forever. But if we always insulate ourselves against a bust we will, quite quickly, price ourselves out of civic space.</p><p>So, sure, we need to build more houses. We all agree on that, apart from&nbsp;– bizarrely – the people in charge. But at some point we also have to articulate the point of collective ownership, and this will inevitably entail articulating where and why developers aren't welcome, which will become where and why the investment of rest of the world isn't welcome. Either that, or remake a capital elsewhere.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420181374|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|8cf25619e326e168e122426f47c0e15580a7e36b -->",

        "body":"<p>Throughout my life, whenever I have felt sad, or lonely, or abandoned, especially when there has been no apparent external reason, my mum has reacted by doing this thing. She does the thing most often when it's clear that I am struggling to cope with the world – when things become too much, and I become stressed, or depressed, or anxious, or even, rarely, apoplectic with rage. In other words, she does the thing in times of crisis. The thing is this: she looks at me, then sighs. Her chi setting switches to that of \"failed mother\", as she shakes her head ruefully and says: \"Perhaps I put you in nursery too early.\" She has done this for as long as I remember.</p><p>I thought of her this morning when I saw an article with the headline <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10384281/Children-who-spend-time-in-nurseries-more-likely-to-develop-behavioural-problems.html\" title=\"\">Children who spend time in nurseries \"more likely to develop behavioural problems\"</a> in the Daily Telegraph. The article cites a study that says exposure to some forms of early education could be linked to emotional problems. No shit, I thought, not because my mum did put me into nursery too early and I'm now suffering from deep-seated abandonment issues which manifest themselves when I'm unable to perform simple tasks such as leaving the house with ease and grace, but because it is an inevitable fact of life: human beings cause one another emotional problems. Therefore being around other human beings causes emotional problems.</p><p>The point is, the world is teaming with the emotions of people and some of them are actually really horrible. But you have to get out there sooner or later.</p><p>I can think of countless humans who have caused me emotional problems from pre-school age onwards, including myriad frenemies, flings, boyfriends and a particularly critical ex-flatmate whose vitriol regarding those around her had the power to crush the confidence of even her male physics teacher, whom she once proudly told us she had reduced to tears by telling him he was crap at his job and should just retire now, the failure. But then she once had a childminder, so what do you expect?</p><p>I realise that I am wading into a whole, loaded early-years debate, wherein people are more invested than I can even imagine, and some are even quite nasty to one another (perhaps it's time they all had some squash and some dreamy-nighty-snoozy time). But having already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/vegetarian-parents-kids\" title=\"\">made clear how I feel about home-schooled kids in another column</a>, I might as well extend that to the under-fives.</p><p>This, however, would imply that I care about the choices other women make for their children, which I don't. What I do care about is the persistent conservative agenda regarding early years care, and how its proponents seem to think that, unless a mother is attached to her child at all times, she has basically failed as a parent. Does nursery school make children more hyperactive? Er, probably. Being put in a room with 22 other four-year-olds, all of whom are mad as a box of frogs anyway, can do that to a little fella. But it's also loads of fun. All this worrying makes me wonder just how many of these \"nurseries cause emotional problems\" articles my mother has been exposed to in her time.</p><p>Of course, mums will always blame themselves no matter what. It comes with the job. Sorry, not job, unpaid, 18-year-long internship where a bunch of people who aren't even your boss are constantly telling you how much you suck. As I have mentioned before, my little brother is severely disabled. For this my mum has persistently blamed herself, wondering if it was everything from the food she ate when she was pregnant, to the vaccinations, to her genes, to her age when she conceived, to the diet she fed him, to the epidural. The media have obviously played a massive part in this.</p><p>Perhaps it's high time that we all tell our mums to get rid of the guilt. I'm telling mine now: Mum, stop blaming yourself. There was nothing you could have done.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420233586|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|03567433cd53c3a88f8e78c641309ff02f4bd0f1 -->",

        "headline":"It's immoral to have food banks in one of the world's richest countries",
        "body":"<p>Things have only got better. If you don't feel that, then you are probably some kind of communist who hates this country and turns up at one of the booming enterprises known as \"food banks\" for fun. Because it is a damn sight easier than trekking to the deli. I called 2012 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/19/2012-year-of-the-food-bank\" title=\"\">\"the year of the food bank\"</a>. This week the Trussell Trust said that three times as many people are now using them, with reports that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/01/heat-eat-loan-liverpool\" title=\"\">choice between heating and eating is even more bleak</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless, everything is working out fine, with rising numbers in employment, according to David Cameron. George Osborne said that the use&nbsp;of food banks has increased simply because more people have found out about them from jobcentres. So this is a strange model: supply creates demand. The demand must have magicked itself into being and not arisen, as those who run the food banks suggest, from benefit problems or the three-day emergency food vouchers that doctors and social workers now issue. Do hungry children exist? Teachers say so. Parents say so, though they may go without to give kids toast for tea.</p><p>In the bizarre exchanges that constitute our politics, it is clear that the focus on \"standards of&nbsp;living\" has traction, largely because of the cognitive dissonance between what we are told we are experiencing and how it feels. Maybe I am being overly romantic, but there was a time when those in government at least affected to know how \"ordinary people\" lived. Now they don't even pretend to know the price of milk, never mind the financial knife-edge that many live on, where the lateness of one overdue payment can drive people into despair.</p><p>If the recovery is underway – the new mantra – how come people have less money in their pockets? How come youth employment is refusing to budge, and a generation moves seamlessly into \"the long-term unemployed\"? Pay has stagnated, prices have gone up. To have avoided a fall in standards, one has to be either wealthy or asset-rich. This means owning property in London, as do most of the media/political class, me included.</p><p>Nonetheless, my standard of living is certainly affected by the distress all around: by the numbers of mentally ill people wandering the streets; by what happens in my child's school; by seeing friends and family pushed out of hospital long before they are able to care for themselves. Austerity meant we quickly forgot the happiness index, but we must still comprehend that a decent standard of&nbsp;living&nbsp;comes from understanding rather than undermining mutual dependencies.</p><p>This is what underlies the ongoing argument over care for the elderly: cash versus care does not compute because care as a commodity has a&nbsp;different kind of value. Its value links the public&nbsp;to the private, stubbornly resisting easy marketisation; thus it is undersold. But having undersold the Royal Mail, it appears that the coalitions fail to understand markets at all. Earlier this week in this paper, shadow cabinet minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/ed-miliband-energy-price-freeze-tories\" title=\"\">Stewart Wood correctly identified the \"complete intellectual confusion\"</a> at the heart of the Cameron-Osborne project concerning the relationship between government and the market. Even the most pro-market folk realise reforms are necessary and in the public interest.</p><p>Globally, the pulling away of a super-rich class is deeply disturbing. Still, we are invited to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/15/burberry-angela-ahrendts-new-job-apple\" title=\"\">celebrate the fact that Angela Ahrendts</a> was able to \"de-chav\" Burberry and sell the brand in China and so can go to Apple on probably double her current £17m package. To exist with this ludicrous inequality, a twisted logic comes into play: a logic that makes those at the bottom accountable in ways those at the top never are. No one should be surprised at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/15/dominic-cummings-wealth-genes-inequality\" title=\"\">the thesis on education and genetics</a> written by Dominic Cummings (Gove's former special adviser). If those born to rule feel themselves to be born cleverer and richer than average, then those at the bottom are not just materially poorer but start off with poor genetic material. If this is so, what can government do about it and why should it even try?</p><p>Nonetheless, the endless rhetoric about getting people back to work where there is none keeps reproducing itself. So the jobless, the poor and uncared for must account every day for the awful reality of their own worklessness, or bad parenting, or general inadequacy. The entrepreneurial fantasy plays out on talent shows but becomes ever more impossible in a housing bubble. That even the middle classes don't have a spare quarter of a million pounds to house their offspring is reported as a news story.</p><p>Politicians snipe over graphs of disposable income. Economic doublethink befuddles all parties. In George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, Winston Smith described doublethink as the ability to simultaneously hold two contradictory opinions, but a key aspect is also being able to repudiate morality while laying claim to it. This surely is where the debate about standards of living must start: the immorality of food banks in one of the world's richest countries. Our standards of everything – mine and yours – are lowered by their existence. A society that tolerates this, a governnment that refuses to acknowledge why, is neither \"big\" nor clever. For, actually, the chancers or whoever these genetically poor folk are who use their services, are returning some food because they cannot afford to heat it up. This is no standard. This is not living.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420183583|2013-10-17T12:52:59Z|671ca8d7515c85027510df1f738a206cecbc3e8c -->",
