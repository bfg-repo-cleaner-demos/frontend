        "headline":"TV highlights 05/11/2013",
        "body":"<h2><strong>Football: Real Sociedad vs Manchester United</strong><br />7.30pm, ITV1<br /></h2><p>So far, the Champions League has proven a welcome distraction for Manchester United from their Premier League travails, with David Moyes's side currently top of Group A. United were far from convincing in their 1-0 victory against tonight's opponents a fortnight ago, but a positive result here would go a long way towards assuring qualification for the knockout stage. Over on Sky Sports 2 there's coverage of Manchester City's home tie against CSKA Moscow. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p><h2><strong>The Escape Artist</strong><br />9pm, BBC1<br /></h2><p>David Tennant is an actor who can't help looking pleased with himself, which should make this â€“ in which he stars as spectacularly effective junior barrister Will Burton â€“ difficult viewing. In fact, the unshowy nature of the thing, the gentle exposition of a barrister's moral conundrum and the treatment of workplace competition make this feel tense but grounded. When he is asked to defend the manipulative Foyle, however, Burton is caught in a dilemma: should he accept an intellectual challenge, or go with his gut feeling? <em>John&nbsp;Robinson</em></p><h2><strong>Iceland Foods: Life In The Freezer Cabinet</strong><br />9pm, BBC2<br /></h2><p>It's the final foray into the inner workings of the frozen foods mainstay, and, post-horsegate, CEO Malcolm Walker is looking to refresh the company profile. Seeking a change from the Kerry Katona sheen that most associate with the brand, a team is despatched to a Soho thinkspace to meet creatives. Will the staunchly traditional Walker buy into their ideas? It's head of security Duncan who (ironically) steals the show, wistfully yearning to someday send all \"robbing bastards\" off to the Co-op instead. <em>Mark Jones</em></p><h2><strong>Autism: Challenging Behaviour</strong><br />9pm, BBC4<br /></h2><p>Applied behavioural analysis is a controversial treatment for autism, based on BF Skinner's principle of reinforcement. Autistic children are engaged in intensive one-to-one teaching in an effort to change their behaviour. For the parents of Jack and Jeremiah, it's a chance for their children to live more normal lives. But for critics, it's a dehumanising experience that removes the child's personality. This sensitive documentary picks its way through the arguments and considers big questions about human nature. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2><strong>The Crash Reel</strong><br />9pm, Sky Atlantic<br /></h2><p>Lucy Walker's justly acclaimed documentary charts the literal fall and rise of American snowboarder Kevin Pearce. While training for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Pearce wiped out hideously. The Crash Reel depicts Pearce's life before and after the accident, focusing on his rivalry with fellow rider Shaun White. His family and doctors are understandably not keen on him returning to the half-pipes; the exhilarating shots of Pearce and other snowboarders in action remind us of why he's so determined to do exactly that. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p><h2><strong>Masters Of Sex</strong><br />10pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>Showtime recently commissioned a second series of Masters Of Sex, and you can see why. It's as sharp as anything HBO has come up with of late, increasingly arch yet maintaining the bittersweet quality it established from the off. Tonight's episode finds the duo expanding their sex study to include couples, while Haas learns that his romantic life might affect his medical career. Away from work, Johnson's son prefers to spend time with his father rather than his mum, and Masters is anxious about becoming a parent. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p><h2><strong>Ross Noble: Freewheeling</strong><br />10pm, Dave<br /></h2><p>This week, Ross Noble takes more suggestions from the public via Twitter to determine the next destination for his peculiar travel-meets-improvised comedy show. First up it's a trip to Chesterfield, where Ross is told a shameful tale about Phil Tufnell. Then he's tied up with a massive scarf and lightly harassed at the Women's Institute in St Helens. But easily the best of all is an offer from Martin Daniels to help his dad Paul get an old magic trick out of his shed in Banbury. It's unexpected telly gold. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p><h2><strong>Imagine â€“ Edmund de Waal: Make Pots Or Die</strong><br />10.35pm, BBC1<br /></h2><p>A year in the life of English ceramicist Edmund de Waal â€“ as he prepares his first New York exhibition â€“ with Alan Yentob on his tail every step of the way. The globally acclaimed potter is perhaps better known as an author, however; his award-winning memoir The Hare With Amber Eyes has sold some 1.5m copies worldwide. Here, he talks about researching a new book about the search for the \"meaning of white\", via the medium of&nbsp;porcelain. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421616895|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1147b7ca74c4bcbafe110794771815addf1f8b26 -->",

        "headline":"The Choir: Sing While You Work; Fresh Meat â€“ TV review",
        "body":"<p>Here's something to maybe fill the baking void: singing. Not The X&nbsp;Factor, but middle-class talent television, for the Guardian reader: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008y125\" title=\"\"><strong>The Choir: Sing While You Work</strong></a> (BBC2) with Gareth Malone. Corporate glee.</p><p>Actually It's a shame the Guardian isn't in it (and you have to be to win it, innit). There is a choir here â€“ the Guardian Angels, they call themselves; you can here them practising on a Wednesday lunchtime. What would they do in this? A version of The Snowman theme, rewritten to be about Edward Snowden? We're Spying in the Air â€¦ Or some kind of NWA/NSA gangsta rap, Straight Outta Kings Place. Or something better.</p><p>Anyway, the Guardian's not in it, P&amp;O is. Surely they should do My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion. Or anything by Roxy Music. I'm thinking of the singer. Oh, for the audition they're doing Sailing by Rod Stewart, drearily. \"We are sailing,\" growls Grant, the burly quartermaster. Gareth tells him he sounds like a drain, and he's not lying. But Gareth picks Grant because he wants them to sound like sailors. Maybe Grant should gargle drain cleaner, before the competition proper.</p><p>Gareth has grown a beard. It makes him less of a choirboy, more of a grown-up; maybe it will give him more authority over these sailors. He also has a bowtie and a pair of yellow trousers and has bounded cheerily aboard the company's flagship Spirit of Britain, prowling the decks in search of singers. It's a kind of reverse pressgang â€“ snatching crew members from their ship to take them ashore to join a choir.</p><p>The reactions are interesting. The women all fall immediately in love with Gareth. He's a man, he's got a beard to prove it, and yet he doesn't behave like one. He can communicate, and get things done, he can talk, and sing â€“ even talk and sing in French. He's amazing, inspiring. And the men are a bit suspicious of him, possibly jealous that the women like him so much. Plus he gets them to do things they wouldn't normally do, like sing. The basses â€“ Grant, his brother Jeff, captain Angus â€“ look especially grumpy. They don't like the song, Rock the Boat, which doesn't help.</p><p>I'm a grumpy bass too (though I do like that song). Gareth is indeed amazing, and inspiring. But he's also a teeny bit irritating, in a goody-two-shoes, goody-yellow-trousers kind of way. Bet he was teacher's pet at school, perhaps got a hard time from the other boys. Maybe they called him Gareth GoHo Malone. But now the joke's on them, and on us, the grumpy basses. Gareth could go home with anyone he wanted to (obviously he doesn't, because he's a perfect husband and perfect dad with a perfect homelife too). He's Superman â€“ really, look at the current Radio Times. He is actually Superman on the cover. And we're just grumpy basses, mumbling, grumbling, singing like drains.</p><p>And he wins them â€“ us â€“ over, of course. He takes them up the White Cliffs of Dover, they loosen up, open up and start to sing, with joy in their hearts, for Albion, and for P&amp;O. It's stirring, and moving, and beautiful. Damn you, Malone, you win, again.</p><p>Still to come: Birmingham City Council, Sainsbury's, Cheshire Fire and Rescue and Citibank. Over to you on what they should be singing.</p><p>Dover gets a mention in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/fresh-meat\" title=\"\"><strong>Fresh Meat</strong></a> (Channel 4), back for a new season, and a new university year. Kingsley (Joe Thomas) says that whole weird thing, him and Josie, is \"over like Dover\". Actually, Josie has transferred to Southampton, but she's still a permanent presence in the Manchester student house via Skype on an iPad. And later they go down there, for a traffic light party.</p><p>There's seamen aplenty too â€“ without the \"a\", I'm afraid. \"I've got a sex engine and it runs on cum,\" says red-trousered JP (Jack Whitehall), all in a froth about the new batch of hotties. Since starting his TV acting career in Fresh Meat, he has pretty much become Mr Right Now. Quite rightly â€“ he's hilarious.</p><p>It's sticky and smelly, spunky and puerile. There's not much in the way of story, so it has no right to work over an hour. But it does, somehow. Well, I do know how: by being very funny about the funniest â€“ and most tragic â€“ time (it also rings a bit true, amazingly). I think I can actually feel what a good time Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain had creating  it. I know I'm having a good time watching.</p><p><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/3k4kk/tw via @guardian\" title=\"\">â€¢ TV highlights</a></p><p><a href=\"http://tvlistings.theguardian.com\" title=\"\">â€¢ Full TV listings</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421646405|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|4a33ac199256bc49e2aacc2f0aec2807fc1a955d -->",

        "headline":"Goodies v baddies: in defence of TV heroes",
        "body":"<p>Folksy but malevolent Mags Bennett, pinch-faced creep Wynn Duffy, terrifying sociopath Robert Quarles and, of course, the charming, slippery, dangerous Boyd Crowder. The quality of villains in Justified, where the baddies are as central as the heroes, presents viewers with a sumptuous rogues gallery. The show, about US Marshal Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant), is one of the best dramas I've ever watched. </p><p>While the baddies are colourful and complex, Givens is the truly compelling character because he's gone to the good from a bad background. His father Arlo was a drunken, violent criminal. Raylan was shovelling coal in his teens, palling with Boyd, eking out an existence in poverty-stricken Kentucky. The boy seemed set for a life of ill-deeds. Then Aunt Helen gave him money and an ultimatum: escape to a better life. So Justified opens with Raylan the man â€“ and marshal â€“ returning home to dispense that particularly American brand of rough justice.</p><p>He's no angel: Raylan is hot-tempered, has something of a God complex and provokes deadly confrontation. He kills lawbreakers when necessary, and doesn't lose sleep over it. Other characters describe Raylan as a criminal with a badge, one step away from Boyd. But I saw a fundamentally kind, idealistic, courageous man. And a good man is infinitely more interesting than a bad one.</p><p>Many great shows are centred on villains, or at least anti-heroes: Tony Soprano, Walter White, Don Draper, Stringer Bell. Supposed heroes are often flawed, sometimes grievously: Cracker's Fitz, Jack Bauer, Dexter (he probably qualifies as all of the above). Moral corruption is fascinating, whether we come in when it's complete or observe from inception; even the title Breaking Bad references a term for a solid citizen gone rogue. TV has been inspired to genius by the subject. Everyone loves a good baddie.</p><p>For me, though, the heroes win my attention almost every time. There is something intriguing about people deciding to do right, especially against the odds, as with Raylan. It is easy to do wrong; simple self-interest explains it, if nothing else. But people inspired by principle, love, self-sacrifice: I find them harder to understand, and therefore more interesting. Is it innate, or do they choose? Is it circumstance, blind fate? What makes them take up that struggle? In short, what makes them good?</p><p>As far back as 1990's Wiseguy, while schoolmates would eulogise their favourite mobster, I was gobsmacked by Vinnie Terranova and his hair-raisingly dangerous job. Why would someone go undercover? What motivates them? And where on Earth do you get cojones that big?</p><p>Throughout Twin Peaks, I had a major man-crush on Agent Cooper. In the midst of all that evil and murkiness, he was always resolute, courageous, cheerful and sweet-natured. The camaraderie between Cooper, Sheriff Truman and other \"good\" characters was genuinely moving; maybe it sated some naive desire for the triumph of hope, or even the hope of hope, in a hard, cynical world.</p><p>There are more, too many to list: Daenerys and Tyrion in Game of Thrones, rising above every instinct of blood and heritage by being decent human beings. Peter in Fringe, his sarky righteousness so much more intriguing than, say, Jones's sub-Moriarty scheming. Anyone from Star Trek (Picard is a personal favourite). Grissom, McNulty, Cagney and Lacey. And who isn't fond of Columbo?</p><p>I've no interest in \"black hat, white hat\" moral simplicity â€“ Michael Landon in Bonanza was a bit of a pain, really â€“ but the hero needn't always be compromised, nor the villain venerated. And we needn't spend all our time gazing into the heart of darkness. Sometimes you want to see a good person doing good things for good reasons.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421617876|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|3a496b041638e6433ab8f3eb5a40e43551f48252 -->",

        "headline":"Tom Baker: how I made Doctor Who",
        "body":"<h2><strong>Tom Baker, the Doctor</strong></h2><p>I was an unhappy, out-of-work actor in&nbsp;1974, working on a building site where they all took the mickey and called me <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/olivier\" title=\"\">Laurence Olivier</a>. In desperation, I wrote to the BBC just as&nbsp;they were looking to replace <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-tSQvYGP8\" title=\"\">Jon Pertwee</a>, who was stepping down as Doctor Who. There were plenty of others in consideration, but when the&nbsp;team behind the programme saw <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGkmeARmlzw\" title=\"\">The Golden Voyage of Sinbad</a>, the Ray Harryhausen film in which I played the magician Koura, that was it.</p><p>I didn't consciously try to be different from Jon because I didn't know anything about the series. I was younger, of course â€“ but, having been brought up a Catholic, the idea of disappearing and reappearing, of miraculous events, strange voices and all the other mad things about Doctor Who seemed totally natural to me. Luckily, I got on straight away with my companion Elisabeth Sladen, who played Sarah Jane. She was very influential. The directors didn't always like the things I&nbsp;suggested, like carrying jelly babies, but she thought I was very funny. Because she laughed at what I was doing, the directors noticed and relaxed.</p><p>Costume designer Jim Acheson devised my \"bohemian look\", modelling it on that of a fin-de-siÃ¨cle student in Paris. The multicoloured scarf came about after Jim bought a wagonload of&nbsp;wool. He gave it to a woman who was so excited at being asked to work for Doctor Who that she started knitting it and just didn't stop. When we went to her room, it was so full of scarf, we couldn't get in. She offered to cut it up, but Jim wanted to keep it. Other designers took over and, with each subsequent series, it got longer and longer and more operatic.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIZi6tk_T1Q\" title=\"\">The Daleks</a> were darling chaps. In rehearsals, they used to skim around without the top bits on, holding up their arms in place of the \"telescopic manipulators\", which were actually sink plungers. That was the only time their faces were seen, so they'd take it very seriously. Often, I'd look over and see the <a href=\"http://century.theguardian.com/1960-1969/Story/0,,105542,00.html\" title=\"\">Z Cars</a> boys watching us. They'd be trying not to laugh, yet they all wanted to be in it.</p><p>One early adventure, <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xsgcv8_the-sontaran-experiment-part1_shortfilms\" title=\"\">The Sontaran&nbsp;Experiment</a>, was filmed on&nbsp;Dartmoor. While we were shooting&nbsp;the fight scene, I fell and broke my collarbone. Luckily, I had a&nbsp;good stunt double in Terry Walsh, so&nbsp;from that point on I just stood still&nbsp;for closeups and let Terry do the rest. I was always exuberant, but I never overdid the action scenes again.</p><p>We'd often have to do retakes because the scenery shook. As an actor, walking through a door naturally is an art, and someone once told me that they'd never seen anyone do it as well as me. I&nbsp;didn't like to say that it was because the BBC sets shook, and the doors had to be closed gently.</p><p>Another adventure, The Deadly Assassin, featured a scene in which I almost drowned. It had incurred the wrath of Mary Whitehouse for being so scary, and I was keen to see it when it was transmitted â€“ back then, you couldn't record programmes. I was on a signing tour of the country at the time, and I knocked on the door of a house in Preston, just as a father was settling down to watch it with his two five-year-old sons. He said nothing and just beckoned me inside. I crept into the room and sat quietly in a chair and, as my face came up on screen, you could see the stupefaction on the kids' faces as they noticed me. How could one person be in two places at once? It was just ecstasy. But the whole process of making Doctor Who was a joy.</p><p>â€¢ The Day of the Doctor, part of the BBC's 50th anniversary celebration of the series, is on BBC1 on 23 November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421618378|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|dd8cd5d971c420c43e6a497bc4a1c76d7a7147c8 -->",

        "body":"<h2><strong>Unmissable show?</strong></h2><p><strong>Boardwalk Empire</strong>. My good friend Stephen Graham is in it. I just think it's really thorough, with great stories, and watching the characters grow is brilliant. It's classy, but it's not classy like <strong>Gangster Squad</strong>, which was just overkill. Boardwalk Empire tells the backstory that everyone wants to know: how did Capone get to where he is? Who was the real Nucky Thompson?</p><h2><strong>Box set?</strong></h2><p>I'm a massive <strong>Planet Earth</strong> freak. I can sit and watch that on repeat. It really is eerily beautiful. Obviously, I've just finished <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>. The one thing I will say is, why didn't he try some [crystal meth] at the end? It would have been perfect. I think <strong>Ray Donovan</strong>'s interesting. Something like that, you wouldn't have aired 10 years ago. It wouldn't have survived.</p><h2><strong>TV turn-off?</strong></h2><p><strong>The X Factor</strong> is not my thing. Great viewing for the family when you're making a kebab, maybe. I think it's a good thing â€“ in the sense that we need something that is just supposed to make underground music survive a bit more. You're not going to get the Rebel Alliance without Darth Vader.</p><h2><strong>Come Dine With Me lineup?</strong></h2><p>You're looking for fun characters, so my line-up would be Stephen Fry, Dizzee Rascal, Mani from the Stone Roses, and then someone like Florence And The Machine.  I reckon they'd get on all right.</p><h2><strong>Pitch us a TV showâ€¦</strong></h2><p>I'd take homeless people from Miami and swap them with homeless people from London. It's not about creating a reality show where someone goes, \"Can they survive in Miami?\" It's about profiling an area of society that people would like to forget about. How did they get there? You hear stories about people who are given a flat but who are so used to living on the street that they don't want a hot meal. They'd rather not sleep in a bed. There's something wrong about a society that can turn people like that.</p><p><strong><em>Goldie appears at Fabriclive on 8 November.

        "body":"<p>In the beginning Richard Hammond created the heavens and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of Richard moved upon the face of the waters. And the Hamster said: \"Let there be light\" â€“ and there was light â€¦</p><p>It doesn't quite have the same ring to it, does it? But anyway, here's a late entry in the creationism v science debate. Top Gearism. Not all of them actually. James May is busy playing with his train set and Jeremy Clarkson is counting his money: leaving the little&nbsp;one to do the work. It's called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03hhqw8\" title=\"\"><strong>Richard Hammond Builds a Planet</strong></a> (BBC1, Sunday).</p><p>So, how does he build his planet? Well, he's in the desert, possibly in Nevada or somewhere similar, with a very tall CGI tower. CGI is the main ingredient here. I don't quite understand the significance of the tower, but it looks nice. Then he has his raw materials â€“ iron, oxygen, magnesium and silicon â€“ delivered by a fleet of big trucks, driven by big truckers. The silicon will presumably be used to make massive boobs for the women who will eventually inhabit the Top Gear planet, in order to entertain the chaps who will be driving around very fast in their iron cars. Perhaps that's where Jeremy gets involved.</p><p>First though, all the stuff needs to get sucked up, via CGI, of course, into the sky, where it's blended into a fine dust cloud that swirls around the top of the CGI tower. Next step, stick it back together again. Using gravity, right? Wrong. Using electrostatic forces â€“ and to show Richard doing something fun and exciting in an aeroplane. He takes one of those zero-gravity flight experiences from Cape Canaveral, floats about laughing maniacally in a padded cell in&nbsp;the sky while another man shows us&nbsp;ground coffee clumping together in&nbsp;a box.</p><p>A lot of building a planet is about Richard Hammond having Top Gear-style fun â€“ while in planes or helicopters, playing astronaut, firing machine guns, making explosions and DIY volcanoes, and living boyhood dreams. It's about massive numbers, unzipping and whacking them down on the table. Forty thousand tonnes of meteorite hit us every year, Earth came about four and a half billion years ago, it weighs six septillion tonnes. And it's about translating big numbers into an easy language that we can understand: the language of motorised transport. So if you can't picture the 30-metre object that made a big hole in Arizona, think of it as two doubledecker buses. And those 40,000 tonnes of meteorites? Well, that's like 30,000 Transit vans hitting the Earth every year. Ah, now I've got it. Bloody hell, that's quite a lot.</p><p>You can take RH outta TG but â€¦ etc. To be honest, I'm not quite sure why he is doing this. Except that he likes playing astronauts and space and that; and once, when he was a kid on a family walk, he found a rock that may possibly have been â€“ but probably wasn't â€“ a meteorite. I don't think Professor Brian Cox needs to look over his shoulder, worry too much about his King of Science crown getting nicked.</p><p>It's Top Gear science, how our planet came about for a Top Gear audience. Nothing wrong with that. It did mean that I didn't have any problems getting my head round anything (I&nbsp;mainly speak and understand only the language of motorised transport myself obviously). Hell, some of it I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;actually already knew.</p><p>But it is maybe symptomatic of the Topgearification of all television. Hammond's on science then, plus news and current affairs â€“ why not? May can take over culture, drama and baking. And Clarkson? Well, he's the DG obviously, not just of TV but of everything. And he's the SP, the Supreme Being, he can just sit on his cloud (of carbon dioxide), still counting his money and cackling.</p><p>I hope David Cameron, William Hague, Prince Charles and everyone else going to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Sri Lanka next week saw the shocking <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/no-fire-zone\" title=\"\"><strong>No Fire Zone</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday). And that perhaps, when they're shaking the hand of President Rajapaksa, they'll remember some of the horrific images of the thousands of Tamils lured to soâ€‘called safe havens and slaughtered by his government's forces.</p><p>No? Watching Match of the Day 2 on the other side? No problem, it's available to download. Or if that's too tricky, they can get in touch and I'll send them a link to the previews website I use. I know Dave and William are regular readers and big fans of this column, not sure about Charles to be honest. Perhaps the others could pass the message on? Thanks.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/watchthis\" title=\"\">â€¢ This week's TV highlights</a></p><p><a href=\"http://tvlistings.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\">â€¢ Full TV listings</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421480806|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|85775f75b29d1a782ab23786d3854f31ebd40781 -->",

        "body":"<h2><strong>Tennis: ATP World Tour Finals</strong><br />12noon, Sky Sports 3</h2><p>Day one of the season-ending tournament, held at London's O2 for the fifth consecutive year. With invitations extended only to the world's top eight players, some high-profile names are likely to miss out here, with Roger Federer still sweating on his place at the time of writing. Last year's victor, Novak Djokovic, will be keen to reclaim the title at the end of a year in which he has ceded the world No 1 ranking to a resurgent Rafael Nadal, who will also be competing. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p><h2><strong>Pressure Pad</strong><br />3pm, BBC1<br /></h2><p>John Barrowman presides over this new quiz and its titular pressure pad, a large, circular, lit-up doodah that holds the answers to various general knowledge questions. Stand on the right answer and Bob's your uncle. Two teams of five punters compete against each other in the hope of scooping a jackpot of Â£3,000 â€“ which feels a touch on the miserly side, even by daytime standards. It's repetitive, and the pressure pad itself brings little to the party. Pointless's crown is as safe as houses. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p><h2><strong>Lifetime Launch</strong><br />From 8pm, Lifetime<br /></h2><p>A UK version of the US entertainment channel starts with new female-friendly shows. First up is The Conversation, with Amanda de Cadenet, featuring nice, unguarded interviews with female celebs. That's followed by The Client List, which stars Jennifer Love Hewitt as a single mother/masseuse with extras, and treads a queasy line between feminism and exploitation. On Tuesday at 10pm there' Witches of East End, with Julia Ormond as witch mom to two unwitting witch daughters. It's smarter than it looks. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p><h2><strong>MasterChef: The Professionals</strong><br />8.30pm, BBC2</h2><p>It's goodbye Great British Bake Off, with its high oestrogen content and camaraderie, and hello MasterChef: The Professionals (seven men and one woman), with its big, swinging balls of foody tenacity. It's particularly great how Monica Galetti is introduced as \"chef\" and Gregg Wallace as \"diner\". Ouch. Over the next three nights, the cooks must produce the finest food known to humanity in order for slightly better cooks (and Wallace) to tell them they're good at cooking. High stakes indeed. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p><h2><strong>Ripper Street</strong><br />9pm, BBC1</h2><p>At first glance, the young mother found murdered in Whitechapel's hospital looks like just another vagrant. However, not only is she well dressed beneath the grime, but she also has a vestigial tail. Are either of these details connected to her fate and that of her missing newborn? DI Reid, whose first investigative stop is a freak show, thinks so. What follows is tremendous, a grimy police procedural that pulls off the trick of having Joseph Merrick, aka the Elephant Man, as a central character without seeming contrived. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p><h2><strong>The Choir: Sing While&nbsp;You Work</strong><br />9pm, BBC2</h2><p>Ever sincere and enthusiastic, choirmaster Gareth Malone returns with a new series of the ultimate in feel-good TV. Here he visits five firms to get them singing in harmony before pitting them against each other in an effort to be named best workplace choir, following the example of last year's victors, Severn Trent Water. His first port of call is P&amp;O Ferries, where he has to tackle the sizeable logistical problem of dealing with staff based at sea, and on both sides of the Channel. <em>Martin&nbsp;Skegg</em></p><h2><strong>American Blackout</strong><br />9pm, National Geographic<br /></h2><p>It's hypothetical scaremongering ahoy as National Geographic posits the scenario of a large-scale blackout across America, in the event of a cyberattack. Actors appearing in jerky self-shot footage â€“ along with the occasional onscreen stat â€“ make up this feature-length sort-of-movie. How long would it take before society descends into looting and ugly violence? A surprisingly short time, by this conjecture. Theme park rides stop mid-thrill, people get stuck in lifts and there's not a hot latte in sight. All a bit heavy-handed. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p><h2><strong>Fresh Meat</strong><br />10pm, Channel 4</h2><p>It's series three of Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain's comedy, and its student sextet are now reaping the benefits of becoming worldly-wise second-years. For sex-starved posho JP and \"pig man of Arbroath\" Howard, this means taking over the dry-slope skiing society and inviting female freshers over to an ultimately disastrous hot-tub party. Meanwhile, Oregon and Vod return from backpacking in Mexico, the latter with a boyfriend in tow, and Josie starts afresh in Southampton. But can she resist the lure of Kingsley? <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421469232|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|3294caedac38a365d58c020561be6b868b3bd778 -->",

        "headline":"Fresh Meat's Zawe Ashton, AKA Vod, is the coolest thing on TV right now",
        "body":"<p>Television's coolest characters often come with a signature \"thing\". The Fonz from Happy Days had his leather jacket and his thumbs. Master William from The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air had his hi-top fade and loud trousers. In the Channel 4 comedy Fresh Meat, Vod has her off-the-wall clothes and that withering gaze that cuts down foolishness at 20 paces. She's easily the coolest character on television at the moment, but when I tell that to the woman who plays her, the response is charmingly modest. \"I would really like to keep anyone who says that in my pocket, as I go about my daily life,\" says Zawe Ashton (the Zawe is pronounced like \"Bowie\"). \"When I hit a low point, I'd just ask, 'What's that you're saying in there? I'm the coolest person on TV? OK, I'll take that!'\"</p><p>With the third season of the show starting on Monday, it feels fair to say that Ashton is the breakout star of Fresh Meat. Her many memorable moments include preparing coq au vin with a sword (at posh boy JP's family home) and a lecture-hall monologue about Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (\"I feel like I've got this pompous, fat, naked man sitting on my face, and he's resting his big, overrated bollocks on my airways\"). She is the show's wry centre, looking askance at the dubious decisions made by her housemates and doling out wisdom as necessary. The character works best in concert with the others, though, and the ensemble is excellent, something Ashton puts down to a meticulous casting process and a writing team who really understand  the characters. \"Everyone in this show was put through a very rigorous process,\" she says, \"and I think that's real testament to Sam and Jesse [Bain and Armstrong, the show's creators]. They were determined to find a group that worked together, and not just go, 'Who's hot right now?'\"</p><p>In person, Ashton is only superficially like her plain-speaking, no-holds-barred alter ego: her speaking voice is slightly less deep, far less estuary than Vod's, and she's clearly more prone to both chuckling and thinking before speaking. The source of Vod's cool â€“ The Essence Of Vod, if you will â€“ can be boiled down to a simple but powerful philosophy: she doesn't care what anyone thinks. \"I always describe her as having no subtext, no filters,\" says Ashton. Combined with the fact that she's a girl â€“ and a black girl at that, which is almost never brought up as an issue to be \"tackled\" â€“ Vod was primed for cult status from the start.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421634419'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383148036838/Zawe-Ashton-as-Vod-in-Fre-008.jpg' alt='Zawe Ashton as Vod in Fresh Meat 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Zawe Ashton as Vod in Fresh Meat 2</figcaption></figure><p>\"The door has felt very open in terms of the interpretation of Vod,\" continues Ashton. \"I've never had to take into consideration any external factors, I've been able to find out who this girl is from the inside out.\" The lack of extra racial baggage has paid dividends â€“ last November she won a Creative Diversity Network Award for her performance, with the board praising Vod as a great example of racial diversity on our screens that didn't come served with a side-order of self-congratulation. \"That was so moving for me, because I do think about these things. I'm not the kind of actor who blocks out the undertones of the industry. I've been acting on TV since I was six, so 23 years would be a long time to keep your eyes averted.\" She arches an eyebrow.</p><p>Let's talk about those eyebrows. And lips, and clothes. Where on earth does Vod shop? And how hard is it for Ashton to \"become\" her? She laughs again. \"I'm telling you, once the head was shaved and the dummy was round the neck and the leather jacket and bovver boots were on, it was like, OK, we're ready. The whole birth of that character was so much about hair and makeup and wardrobe. RiRi's only just catching up to the dark blue lip!\" She gives high praise to Janet Horsfield and June Nevin who head the makeup and wardrobe departments. \"They're so collaborative in the process. I was cast the day before we moved to Manchester. I literally got there and was like, 'This is who I think she is â€“ is that all right?' and they just worked in record time and completely understood what all the references were.\" Like what? \"We imagined what her parents listened to musically: a lot of Bowie, dancehall, ska. Plus I feel like her nan had a lot of influence over how she grew up because she's never been close to her mum or dad. Sometimes Vod dresses like an old man, and I feel like she's kind of empathising with her grandparents. She's a forager.\"</p><p>We gain an insight into Vod's mysterious background in an upcoming episode, when her mum comes to visit. \"It's another layer to Vod. [Writer] Penny Skinner met up with me before series three started, and said, 'Look, I really want to write something for Vod. We need something from her past, some kind of key to her upbringing to continue that identification that audiences are having.' I just went, 'Thank you, let's do it.' And the result deepened my empathy for her.\" The character of Vod has evolved over the series and the process, Ashton thinks, has been organic and natural, the big change being that she's now formed real bonds with her housemates. \"I don't imagine she lets people in very easily,\" Ashton says. \"I think Vod is a sage. If she gives you some serious insight into your life, you're going to consider it. Because those nuggets come few and far between, but when they do come, they land.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421634420'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383148115270/Zawe-in-Dreams-Of-A-Life-008.jpg' alt='Zawe in Dreams Of A Life' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Zawe in Dreams Of A Life</figcaption></figure><p>Ashton's parents still live in the east London house where she was raised, the eldest of three children. Her mother Victoria emigrated to the UK from Uganda as a teenager. She became a teacher and married fellow educator Paul, an Englishman who later worked for Channel 4 in educational programming. Victoria encouraged her daughter into drama and she attended the famous Anna Scher school from the age of five. Childhood roles in Desmond's and The Demon Headmaster were followed by parts in Holby City, Casualty and the St Trinian's sequel. Since then, she's popped up in BBC1's Case Histories (as Jackson Brodie's assistant Deborah) and E4's Misfits (as a virgin with an overprotective killer dad). Most notable of all, however, was her performance in Carol Morley's film Dreams Of A Life; Ashton was nominated for a British Independent Film Award for her portrayal of Joyce Vincent, a woman whose lonely death went unnoticed for three years.</p><p>Ashton is more than an actor, too. In 2000 she won the London Poetry Slam Championships, while her play Harm's Way was performed at The Lowry in Salford and nominated for the Verity Bargate award for new writing in 2007. She has just written and directed a short for BBC Films, Happy Toys. \"They approached me because of Fresh Meat and my BIFA nomination,\" she says. \"The film is about a woman who is struggling to get up in the morning and struggling to be a mother.\" Even before playing Joyce Vincent, Ashton was interested in black women and mental health: she wrote a play, For All Those Women Who Thought They Were Mad, which was selected  for the Royal Court's playwriting festival in 2009. \"These are things that affect us all,\" she says. \"Happy Toys has a black actress as the lead, the fabulous Jenny Jules, but it's not a 'banner' film. I'm just trying to make all the dots connect.\" She describes the film-making experience as \"stressful but elating. I'm almost gleeful to be putting something out to the world.\"</p><p>We touch briefly on the recent Doctor Who casting and the Guardian poll that saw her edge out Chiwetel Ejiofor, Stephen Mangan and Ben Whishaw as our readers' favoured Tardis occupier. She thought it was a joke until she saw it online herself. \"I never in a million years would've thought I'd end up on that poll,\" she says, still somewhat incredulous. \"Me, as a mainstream character on the BBC, in a role previously filled by white men! What a wonderful way to illustrate how attitudes towards mainstream casting are beginning to change.\" She cackles. \"It wasn't even that I wanted to be Doctor Who!\"</p><p>It's time for her photoshoot. I accompany Ashton to the studio and, on the way, we see food critic Jay Rayner walking towards the front door. Ashton's eyes go wide. \"Oh my God, it's Jay Rayner. Look!\"  Vod wouldn't even have noticed.</p><p><strong><em>Series three of Fresh Meat starts  Mon, 10pm, C4</em></strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421297519|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|92972310d44ef9c66f98a64a12700f9b6dc8cc58 -->",

        "headline":"Tom Baker: how I made Doctor Who",
        "body":"<h2><strong>Tom Baker, the Doctor</strong></h2><p>I was an unhappy, out-of-work actor in&nbsp;1974, working on a building site where they all took the mickey and called me <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/olivier\" title=\"\">Laurence Olivier</a>. In desperation, I wrote to the BBC just as&nbsp;they were looking to replace <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-tSQvYGP8\" title=\"\">Jon Pertwee</a>, who was stepping down as Doctor Who. There were plenty of others in consideration, but when the&nbsp;team behind the programme saw <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGkmeARmlzw\" title=\"\">The Golden Voyage of Sinbad</a>, the Ray Harryhausen film in which I played the magician Koura, that was it.</p><p>I didn't consciously try to be different from Jon because I didn't know anything about the series. I was younger, of course â€“ but, having been brought up a Catholic, the idea of disappearing and reappearing, of miraculous events, strange voices and all the other mad things about Doctor Who seemed totally natural to me. Luckily, I got on straight away with my companion Elisabeth Sladen, who played Sarah Jane. She was very influential. The directors didn't always like the things I&nbsp;suggested, like carrying jelly babies, but she thought I was very funny. Because she laughed at what I was doing, the directors noticed and relaxed.</p><p>Costume designer Jim Acheson devised my \"bohemian look\", modelling it on that of a fin-de-siÃ¨cle student in Paris. The multicoloured scarf came about after Jim bought a wagonload of&nbsp;wool. He gave it to a woman who was so excited at being asked to work for Doctor Who that she started knitting it and just didn't stop. When we went to her room, it was so full of scarf, we couldn't get in. She offered to cut it up, but Jim wanted to keep it. Other designers took over and, with each subsequent series, it got longer and longer and more operatic.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIZi6tk_T1Q\" title=\"\">The Daleks</a> were darling chaps. In rehearsals, they used to skim around without the top bits on, holding up their arms in place of the \"telescopic manipulators\", which were actually sink plungers. That was the only time their faces were seen, so they'd take it very seriously. Often, I'd look over and see the <a href=\"http://century.theguardian.com/1960-1969/Story/0,,105542,00.html\" title=\"\">Z Cars</a> boys watching us. They'd be trying not to laugh, yet they all wanted to be in it.</p><p>One early adventure, <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xsgcv8_the-sontaran-experiment-part1_shortfilms\" title=\"\">The Sontaran&nbsp;Experiment</a>, was filmed on&nbsp;Dartmoor. While we were shooting&nbsp;the fight scene, I fell and broke my collarbone. Luckily, I had a&nbsp;good stunt double in Terry Walsh, so&nbsp;from that point on I just stood still&nbsp;for closeups and let Terry do the rest. I was always exuberant, but I never overdid the action scenes again.</p><p>We'd often have to do retakes because the scenery shook. As an actor, walking through a door naturally is an art, and someone once told me that they'd never seen anyone do it as well as me. I&nbsp;didn't like to say that it was because the BBC sets shook, and the doors had to be closed gently.</p><p>Another adventure, The Deadly Assassin, featured a scene in which I almost drowned. It had incurred the wrath of Mary Whitehouse for being so scary, and I was keen to see it when it was transmitted â€“ back then, you couldn't record programmes. I was on a signing tour of the country at the time, and I knocked on the door of a house in Preston, just as a father was settling down to watch it with his two five-year-old sons. He said nothing and just beckoned me inside. I crept into the room and sat quietly in a chair and, as my face came up on screen, you could see the stupefaction on the kids' faces as they noticed me. How could one person be in two places at once? It was just ecstasy. But the whole process of making Doctor Who was a joy.</p><p>â€¢ The Day of the Doctor, part of the BBC's 50th anniversary celebration of the series, is on BBC1 on 23 November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421618378|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|dd8cd5d971c420c43e6a497bc4a1c76d7a7147c8 -->",

        "headline":"Goodies v baddies: in defence of TV heroes",
        "body":"<p>Folksy but malevolent Mags Bennett, pinch-faced creep Wynn Duffy, terrifying sociopath Robert Quarles and, of course, the charming, slippery, dangerous Boyd Crowder. The quality of villains in Justified, where the baddies are as central as the heroes, presents viewers with a sumptuous rogues gallery. The show, about US Marshal Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant), is one of the best dramas I've ever watched. </p><p>While the baddies are colourful and complex, Givens is the truly compelling character because he's gone to the good from a bad background. His father Arlo was a drunken, violent criminal. Raylan was shovelling coal in his teens, palling with Boyd, eking out an existence in poverty-stricken Kentucky. The boy seemed set for a life of ill-deeds. Then Aunt Helen gave him money and an ultimatum: escape to a better life. So Justified opens with Raylan the man â€“ and marshal â€“ returning home to dispense that particularly American brand of rough justice.</p><p>He's no angel: Raylan is hot-tempered, has something of a God complex and provokes deadly confrontation. He kills lawbreakers when necessary, and doesn't lose sleep over it. Other characters describe Raylan as a criminal with a badge, one step away from Boyd. But I saw a fundamentally kind, idealistic, courageous man. And a good man is infinitely more interesting than a bad one.</p><p>Many great shows are centred on villains, or at least anti-heroes: Tony Soprano, Walter White, Don Draper, Stringer Bell. Supposed heroes are often flawed, sometimes grievously: Cracker's Fitz, Jack Bauer, Dexter (he probably qualifies as all of the above). Moral corruption is fascinating, whether we come in when it's complete or observe from inception; even the title Breaking Bad references a term for a solid citizen gone rogue. TV has been inspired to genius by the subject. Everyone loves a good baddie.</p><p>For me, though, the heroes win my attention almost every time. There is something intriguing about people deciding to do right, especially against the odds, as with Raylan. It is easy to do wrong; simple self-interest explains it, if nothing else. But people inspired by principle, love, self-sacrifice: I find them harder to understand, and therefore more interesting. Is it innate, or do they choose? Is it circumstance, blind fate? What makes them take up that struggle? In short, what makes them good?</p><p>As far back as 1990's Wiseguy, while schoolmates would eulogise their favourite mobster, I was gobsmacked by Vinnie Terranova and his hair-raisingly dangerous job. Why would someone go undercover? What motivates them? And where on Earth do you get cojones that big?</p><p>Throughout Twin Peaks, I had a major man-crush on Agent Cooper. In the midst of all that evil and murkiness, he was always resolute, courageous, cheerful and sweet-natured. The camaraderie between Cooper, Sheriff Truman and other \"good\" characters was genuinely moving; maybe it sated some naive desire for the triumph of hope, or even the hope of hope, in a hard, cynical world.</p><p>There are more, too many to list: Daenerys and Tyrion in Game of Thrones, rising above every instinct of blood and heritage by being decent human beings. Peter in Fringe, his sarky righteousness so much more intriguing than, say, Jones's sub-Moriarty scheming. Anyone from Star Trek (Picard is a personal favourite). Grissom, McNulty, Cagney and Lacey. And who isn't fond of Columbo?</p><p>I've no interest in \"black hat, white hat\" moral simplicity â€“ Michael Landon in Bonanza was a bit of a pain, really â€“ but the hero needn't always be compromised, nor the villain venerated. And we needn't spend all our time gazing into the heart of darkness. Sometimes you want to see a good person doing good things for good reasons.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421617876|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|3a496b041638e6433ab8f3eb5a40e43551f48252 -->",

Click here to view</a></p><p>The new material is part of a deal with FXX, which gives the channel first option on Baron Cohen's new ideas. \"We're thrilled to be in business with Sacha. He is an amazing talent,\" said Nick Grad, head of original programming.</p><p>Ali G was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JythnVTsZKw\" title=\"\">first seen on The 11 O'Clock Show in 1998</a>, before getting his own series and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/91536/ali.g.in.da.house\" title=\"\">a feature film</a>. In 2007, Baron Cohen <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3670064/Sacha-Baron-Cohen-Killing-off-Borat.html\" title=\"\">bid farewell to the character</a>, a decision he described as \"upsetting, but the success has been great and better than anything I could have dreamed of\".

        "headline":"Richard Hammond Builds a Planet; No Fire Zone â€“ TV review",
        "body":"<p>In the beginning Richard Hammond created the heavens and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of Richard moved upon the face of the waters. And the Hamster said: \"Let there be light\" â€“ and there was light â€¦</p><p>It doesn't quite have the same ring to it, does it? But anyway, here's a late entry in the creationism v science debate. Top Gearism. Not all of them actually. James May is busy playing with his train set and Jeremy Clarkson is counting his money: leaving the little&nbsp;one to do the work. It's called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03hhqw8\" title=\"\"><strong>Richard Hammond Builds a Planet</strong></a> (BBC1, Sunday).</p><p>So, how does he build his planet? Well, he's in the desert, possibly in Nevada or somewhere similar, with a very tall CGI tower. CGI is the main ingredient here. I don't quite understand the significance of the tower, but it looks nice. Then he has his raw materials â€“ iron, oxygen, magnesium and silicon â€“ delivered by a fleet of big trucks, driven by big truckers. The silicon will presumably be used to make massive boobs for the women who will eventually inhabit the Top Gear planet, in order to entertain the chaps who will be driving around very fast in their iron cars. Perhaps that's where Jeremy gets involved.</p><p>First though, all the stuff needs to get sucked up, via CGI, of course, into the sky, where it's blended into a fine dust cloud that swirls around the top of the CGI tower. Next step, stick it back together again. Using gravity, right? Wrong. Using electrostatic forces â€“ and to show Richard doing something fun and exciting in an aeroplane. He takes one of those zero-gravity flight experiences from Cape Canaveral, floats about laughing maniacally in a padded cell in&nbsp;the sky while another man shows us&nbsp;ground coffee clumping together in&nbsp;a box.</p><p>A lot of building a planet is about Richard Hammond having Top Gear-style fun â€“ while in planes or helicopters, playing astronaut, firing machine guns, making explosions and DIY volcanoes, and living boyhood dreams. It's about massive numbers, unzipping and whacking them down on the table. Forty thousand tonnes of meteorite hit us every year, Earth came about four and a half billion years ago, it weighs six septillion tonnes. And it's about translating big numbers into an easy language that we can understand: the language of motorised transport. So if you can't picture the 30-metre object that made a big hole in Arizona, think of it as two doubledecker buses. And those 40,000 tonnes of meteorites? Well, that's like 30,000 Transit vans hitting the Earth every year. Ah, now I've got it. Bloody hell, that's quite a lot.</p><p>You can take RH outta TG but â€¦ etc. To be honest, I'm not quite sure why he is doing this. Except that he likes playing astronauts and space and that; and once, when he was a kid on a family walk, he found a rock that may possibly have been â€“ but probably wasn't â€“ a meteorite. I don't think Professor Brian Cox needs to look over his shoulder, worry too much about his King of Science crown getting nicked.</p><p>It's Top Gear science, how our planet came about for a Top Gear audience. Nothing wrong with that. It did mean that I didn't have any problems getting my head round anything (I&nbsp;mainly speak and understand only the language of motorised transport myself obviously). Hell, some of it I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;actually already knew.</p><p>But it is maybe symptomatic of the Topgearification of all television. Hammond's on science then, plus news and current affairs â€“ why not? May can take over culture, drama and baking. And Clarkson? Well, he's the DG obviously, not just of TV but of everything. And he's the SP, the Supreme Being, he can just sit on his cloud (of carbon dioxide), still counting his money and cackling.</p><p>I hope David Cameron, William Hague, Prince Charles and everyone else going to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Sri Lanka next week saw the shocking <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/no-fire-zone\" title=\"\"><strong>No Fire Zone</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday). And that perhaps, when they're shaking the hand of President Rajapaksa, they'll remember some of the horrific images of the thousands of Tamils lured to soâ€‘called safe havens and slaughtered by his government's forces.</p><p>No? Watching Match of the Day 2 on the other side? No problem, it's available to download. Or if that's too tricky, they can get in touch and I'll send them a link to the previews website I use. I know Dave and William are regular readers and big fans of this column, not sure about Charles to be honest. Perhaps the others could pass the message on?

        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching Downton Abbey series four. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode seven.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/27/downton-abbey-recap-season-four-episode-six\" title=\"\">Click here for Viv's episode six blog</a></p><p>This was not a hateful penultimate episode for series four. Apart from Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the ill-defined tax inspector-estate-manager-suitor types. What is the point of them? If the last episode next week is all about them shutting down Downton because of their weird survey, I'll deprive a piglet of water.</p><p>Pleasingly, Shirley Maclaine (Cora's mother) put her foot down from across the Atlantic and this has proven a most excellent intervention, occasioning some lovely performances and excellent shenanigans regarding valets. And a pleasing setup between Thomas and Baxter, as he passed the Mantle of Evil to her in his absence.</p><p>This is quality Downton: when some people have information which others don't have. Now there's a really interesting situation going on where Lady Mary wants to make things right, Bates wants revenge, Anna wants the whole thing forgotten and Thomas wants to be on the inside of the secret. All we needed was the reappearance of Mr Green/Gillingham/Mini-Den and the whole thing would kick off. And, oh look, here he is â€¦</p><p>But, of course, that's not all. Far from it. There were 47 other things going on. Please help us, not a political subplot with some frantic Googling of Lloyd George and a speech at Ripon! Yes, Uncle Julian, we know you are aware of a lot of contemporary period detail. It gets shoe-horned in when you remember. Why do you burden us with this when we are already preoccupied with Mini-Den, Edith's pregnancy and the deathly pallor in Cousin Violet's face? Plus, this sub-plot turned into another sub-plot about a new love interest for Branson, as well as his political reawakening. Exhausting.</p><p>I was inordinately stressed during the Dame Maggie scenes, as there was plenty of humour but it felt ill-placed. I don't want jokes about Cousin Isobel when there could be a death at any moment. Despite the speedy recovery, I am still very worried that Dame Maggie will not survive this series. If this is the case, it really should be the death of Downton itself. But at least it was a false alarm for now. Goody-goody.</p><p>What else? Lady Edith has bad feelings. She has had a pretty bad life, to be fair. And it's not getting any better. Aunt Rosamund was wonderful, veering between genuine concern and inevitable judgment. But Edith is right. She can't have this baby. \"How did you find it [the 'place']?\" \"There was a magazine in the ladies' waiting room at King's Cross â€¦ \" Oh dear. I can't see things turning out well in the abortion clinic, a place of darkness and copious weeping â€¦ But, what's this? She's changed her mind and it was all a waste of time! Dear me, I'm so, so tired.</p><p>The scene between Mr Green/Gillingham/Mini-Den and Mrs Hughes was superb. As was the closing scene with the cauliflower cheese. The rest of this series can only hinge on this question. Lady Mary: \"We still can't find out who he was?\" Oh, but we can. I'm sure we can. And so can Bates.</p><h2>Random subplot alert</h2><p>Don't let Alfred into the house! Make him stay at the pub! Everyone pretend they've got flu! This was excellent. Lovely interplay between Mrs Patmore and Mrs Hughes. \"Appearances can be deceptive â€¦ \" All the relationships here felt speculative and unclear. So we are supposed to think that Alfred might ask Ivy to marry him and then Daisy will be upset and Jimmy will be annoyed too? Just do it so we can see what happens next! Lots of narrative pussy-footing for little reward.</p><h2>Surprise character development</h2><p>Lady Mary's suitors all meld into one. And as for the dehydrated pig drama â€¦ I give up. How and why would the ill-defined suitor know anything about pig husbandry? And what on Earth was that muddy, slippy-over, agricultural food fight business? Would this be likely to happen? \"What do I look like?\" Like someone stitched up by a pointless plot twist, Lady Mary. Plus, there is no way Carson would not (a) hear someone in the kitchen and (b) let Lady Mary cook.</p><h2>Golden eyebrow award of the week</h2><p>\"It's not my secret to tell.\" \"If you wish to enlist my help â€¦ I must know the facts.\" Eyebrow Central between Mrs Hughes and Lady Mary. But Ivy wins this hands-down. Her face at the sight of the muddy aristos eating a breakfast they'd cooked themselves was a picture.</p><h2>Excuse me, could you just repeat that awkward line of dialogue?</h2><p>â€¢ \"I hope we are good employers. But even we expect to get what we pay for.\" Lady Mary's calculating side is never far away.</p><p>â€¢ \"You're quite a plotter when you want to be.\" I love it when Carson and Mrs Hughes flirt.</p><p>â€¢ \"You seem so <em>preoccupÃ©e</em> lately.\" <em>Fabuleux</em>. Uncle Julian has been at Google Translate.</p><p>â€¢ \"It's a good idea for estates like this to maximise and diversify.\" No comment.</p><h2>Next week</h2><p>There is a large garden party! Rose is determined to be with the jazz man. Dame Maggie seems as if she might know about Edith's (phantom?) pregnancy. Not sure how it's all going to wrap up in one episode. I'm sure Uncle Julian has loads of ideas. And he will put them all in.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421402823|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|a4fa08300a69517985976f16451f7acfd4cdcc20 -->",

        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching the third series of Homeland at UK broadcast pace. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode four â€“ and if you've seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers.</em></p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/homeland-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\"><em>Catch up with Rebecca Nicholson's previous episode blogposts</em></a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>'She's always been on her own'<br /></h2><p>Not another teen movie! The extended recap of Dana's Runaway Love Story didn't bode well, but hopefully, it will be over for a while, at least until the sexting pics come back into play. I thought it was a decent enough week â€“ not dreadful, not great, but functional. And with Carrie now in the hands of Javadi, that should be enough to kick it into life.</p><p></p><p>Saul fills Quinn in on Carrie's new role as a double agent. As Quinn registers the true extent of the deception, Saul looks pleased with himself, explaining: \"We dangled her to let the Iranians in.\" Neither look particularly concerned about Carrie's welfare, which is either careless or cold â€“ she's still off her meds, no matter how much she had to emphasise parts of her illness during her stay in the psychiatric hospital.</p><p></p><p>Is this why she recklessly risks the entire operation to make sure Dana gets home? I found this subplot to be an unnecessary diversion from whatever the increasingly nebulous main storyline is supposed to be. It was fun to find out what the yoga play really was and I loved seeing Virgil, but it was hard to believe Carrie would jeopardise a meeting with Javadi to do right by the Brody family by telling the FBI to pull its socks up. She got herself sectioned for the love of her country, for crying out loud.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Saul is furious, but he has more on his plate: he's about to become director of the CIA for good, and must go duck-hunting to prove to all the other old white men that he's manly enough to do the job. Or at least that's what he thinks he's doing: actually, they just get him there so Senator Lockhart, of committee fame, can tell him that he, not Saul, is the president's chosen man. He takes this opportunity to tell Saul how he feels about espionage, which is, essentially, that using people to spy is old hat. Saul delivers one big public fuck-you with a dignified speech about the men and women on the ground and the phony nature of political appointments, then heads home â€“ to find Meera having dinner with another man. He's had better nights.</p><p></p><p>And so, it seems, has Carrie. No sooner has she told Quinn that she thinks she was \"made\", Javadi's men drop by for an unfriendly late-night visit, force her to strip, take her sim card and whisk her off into the night. Quinn is furious that they've lost her, but Saul is convinced it's still going to plan: \"We're back in business.\" But what exactly does Javadi know? And how will Carrie get out of this one?</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Notes and observations<br /></h2><p>â€¢ Still no Brody, and I still don't mind.</p><p></p><p>â€¢ <a href=\"http://clairedanescryface.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Claire Danes has clearly been giving Morgan Saylor, who plays Dana, lessons</a> in the art of cryface.</p><p>â€¢ We hardly ever see Carrie with Jessica Brody; I thought it was a nice interaction, though unusual to see Carrie being the calm one in a slightly hysterical situation.</p><p>â€¢ There was a bit of humour this week, as Quinn clocked Saul's duck-hunting outfit. \"Saul's just getting dressed.\" \"What as?\" Also, Javadi is sassy: \"Must be all that yoga.\"</p><p>â€¢ Are they lining up a possible Quinn/Carrie romance?</p><p>â€¢ <a href=\"http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/sesame-street-scores-with-homeland-parody-1200772030/\" title=\"\">Sesame Street spoofed Homeland with \"Homelamb\"</a>. (It reminded me that we haven't had any jazz on the actual show for a very long time.)</p><p>â€¢ I'm on holiday next week, so I'm leaving the blog in the capable hands of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesdonaghy\" title=\"\">James Donaghy</a>. See you in a fortnight.</p><p></p><h2>Clunky metaphor of the week<br /></h2><p>Senator Lockhart called \"your bird\" to Saul, then shot it himself. Do you see?</p><p></p><p><em>What did you think of this week's Homeland? Are you enjoying this season, or is it losing its way? Let us know below.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421447281|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|be7c3098a662631ce646909e448baa24916cde05 -->",

        "body":"<p>There's a lot to be said for sticking with what you know and delivering what's expected from you. US cable channel Cinemax staked its claim in the mid-1980s by pumping out more exploitative fare than its competitors. It was a haven for those who love plenty of violence and nudity in their movies, taking over from the vanishing grindhouses and drive-ins; not for nothing did it earn the nickname \"Skin-emax\". If visiting aliens were to judge humanity just by watching Cinemax they'd think us a race that worships <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/chuck-norris\" title=\"\">Chuck Norris</a> and Shannon Tweed. So when the time came for the channel to produce its own original programming it returned to its core values. The wonderful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/may/13/have-you-been-watching-banshee\" title=\"\">Banshee</a> is the result.</p><p>The show follows an unnamed ex-con â€“ fresh out of a 15-year stretch in prison for a diamond robbery â€“ who assumes the identity of head lawman of the small town of Banshee, Pennsylvania. He arrives at the same time as the new sheriff, who has not yet met his new bosses, is gunned down in a bar raid.</p><p>The jewel thief, who we now know as Sheriff Lucas Hood, has come to Banshee to meet his ex-lover and accomplice Anastasia, who fled there to hide from the law and her terrifying Ukrainian gangster father, Mr Rabbit, whom she and Hood doublecrossed. Anastasia has become Carrie Hopewell, a suburban wife and mother with a new life (although she does keep up with her combat training). Following this so far? Banshee packs a lot in, so much action that you don't have time to stop and think about how silly the premise is. Impersonating a small-town sheriff is the sort of thing that works fine in a classic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/westerns\" title=\"\">western</a> but takes some explaining and coincidences to pull off these days. Actually, it helps to think of Banshee as a modern western. The town has several factions vying for a cut of the pie, notably Kai Proctor, a fallen member of the local Amish community turned slaughterhouse-owning crime kingpin. Then there's the local Native-American-run casino, which everyone wants to get their hooks into. Hood has to perform his sheriff duties (in his own manner: high on brutality, low on paperwork) while trying to work crimes of his own.</p><p>Part of the reason all this works so well is that the show's writer/creators, Jonathan Tropper and David Schickler, are both authors and novelists. They're coming to TV fresh â€“ it's all new to them. And the show is overseen by Alan Ball, who with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/six-feet-under\" title=\"\">Six Feet Under</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/true-blood\" title=\"\">True Blood </a>has proved he knows a thing or two about hammering an unusual concept into great television. The cast is great. Old hands such as Ben Cross as Rabbit, Frankie Faison as bar owner Sugar and Ulrich Thomsen (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77262/festen\" title=\"\">Festen</a>) as Proctor play it straight and give it credibility. The real revelation is Antony Starr as Hood: he's the kind of convincing anti-hero action star that cinema has failed to produce recently.</p><p>It is an incredibly violent show: one episode features an epic smackdown lasting for four punishing minutes. The fight ends after three â€“ the final minute is spent with the winner messing up the fallen loser, breaking fingers, snapping bones, that sort of thing. Indeed, in the barfight in the first episode Hood rams a beer bottle into an opponent's mouth then punches it down his throat. It's also hysterically tense. One show has Hood handcuffed to a hotel bed as hitmen close in, while miles away he's needed because armed gunmen have a hostage situation at Banshee's high school (Hood's daughter being one of the hostages). How will he cope with all that? This show is trashy pulp, but, make no mistake, it's trashy pulp of the highest quality.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421391682|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|e207fddd2bf0e6dc3c70c485b666b0d6d2e6fd80 -->",
