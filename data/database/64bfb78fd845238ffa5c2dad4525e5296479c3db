        "headline":"Jake Bugg – review",
        "body":"<p>\"Where were you when we were getting high?\" asks Oasis's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3C7DECI0jU\" title=\"\">Champagne Supernova</a>, booming laconically through the PA just before Nottingham troubadour Jake Bugg takes the stage.&nbsp;The singalong is as deafening as any that accompanies Bugg's own songs tonight and serves as a handy echo-locator. There is no question about where we are. Technically, we're in \"that London\", hearing some new Jake Bugg tunes. More precisely, though, we are in the bosom of orphans – those left bereft by the Gallagher schism; men, women and children left without a figurehead when Oasis finally imploded a few years back.</p><p>Something of that band's alpha northern strut transferred itself naturally to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBsQVP-Olmw\" title=\"\">Kasabian</a>. The rest of it – the early pell-mell jangle, the young Liam Gallagher's smeary sneer, the tales of pills, thrills and bellyaches that ushered in Oasis's imperial period, the better bits, basically – came, somehow, to rest with Bugg, an almost perfect composite of front-cock Liam and Noel, the bard strategist, all wrapped up in an East Midlands urchin persona so perfect that it was only a matter of time before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/shane-meadows\" title=\"\">Shane Meadows</a> descended. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_WmCpZEou4&amp;feature=youtube_gdata\" title=\"\">Kingpin</a>, one of those new, slightly predictable, Oasissy songs, gets a keen reception tonight. It's a fast choogle about being a drug dealer, all lairy bragging, with a side order of fretting about \"all the eyes [being] on your crown\". Then there's Slumville Sunrise, another new, cantering bout of declamatory yearning that forms part of this set's climax. (The last few minutes of the song's knockabout jewel heist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4wTRbW0aos\" title=\"\">video</a>, meanwhile, are worth anyone's time, with Meadows casting a truculent Bugg opposite a pregnant and sulky Rosamund Hanson from <em>This Is England.</em>)</p><p>The 19-year-old's self-titled debut album went to No 1 on release <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/jake-bugg/66751\" title=\"\">last October</a> and has since sold about a million copies worldwide, polarising as it went. It displaced Mumford &amp; Sons at the top of the UK chart, an act many interpreted as a return of grit to Brit rock, and victory of the recession-scarred north over the soft, smug south. Noel Gallagher anointed Bugg with a tour support slot for his High Flying Birds, and the guitarist (he swaps instruments probably a dozen times tonight) hasn't looked back since, picking the sorts of fights with the <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/s103/the-x-factor/news/a432441/jake-bugg-its-my-job-to-keep-x-factor-st-off-number-one.html\" title=\"\"><em>X&nbsp;Factor</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/celebrities/893943/jake-bugg-strikes-again-one-direction-sing-meaningless-tunes\" title=\"\">One Direction</a> that Noel used to pick with all comers in the 90s.</p><p>Bugg's done things for Burberry, been papped with model <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a455611/jake-bugg-performs-at-fashion-party-leaves-with-model-cara-delevingne.html\" title=\"\">Cara Delevingne</a>, and nailed his colours to the mast for \"authenticity\" (whatever that may be) against the pop manufacturing process, a claim slightly tarnished by the professional songwriters on his creative team. There are bevies of teenage girls here who scream, Harry Styles-style, every time Bugg looks even faintly in their direction. This just one of a few small curveballs in the reading of Bugg as Noel's mini-me.</p><p>When he hasn't been touring, Bugg has been working on his second album, due out just a year after his first one; a work ethic that cleaves to the pattern of bygone eras, like Bugg's better music does. <em>Shangri La</em> was recorded in California with US producer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02rubin.t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;\" title=\"\">Rick Rubin</a>, a Yoda-like figure who came up producing hip-hop before turning to metal and stage-managing the exit of the late Johnny Cash (which was how the country-loving Bugg had heard of him). This tour – including three nights at London's capacious Brixton Academy – finds Bugg playing great swaths of <em>Shangri La</em>, whose success is, basically, a given. It's more of the same, but varied and better arranged, with the odd surprise. Kitchen Table – which regrettably doesn't get played tonight – adds the faint hint of jazzy folk to Bugg's balladeering, for one. Tonight's unexpected revelation, meanwhile, is a Neil Young cover, Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black); not the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lPWIa7HAs\" title=\"\">cover itself</a>, which Bugg has been doing for some time, but how easily Bugg's nasal Liam tips into reedy Neil, a connection rarely made by other singers.</p><p>Certainly, neither Gallagher could have written a manifesto such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-5KBxUaGVQ\" title=\"\">There's a Beast and We All Feed It</a>, the first track on <em>Shangri La</em> and tonight's opening salvo. It's a broadside in which skiffle meets Dylan in a parsimonious but pugnacious one minute and 43 seconds; a sequel, of sorts, to Lightning Bolt, but with more electricity in the emotion. \"When my sister suffers/When my mother cries/All I wanna do is look in someone's eyes…\" Bugg seethes. \"There's a beast eating every kind of beauty and we all feed it.\" He has a point here.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420879195|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|23026c251b20cb94f4841e2b6f00eeded75a15ea -->",

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/jake-bugg\" title=\"\">Jake Bugg</a>, 19, was born in Nottingham. At 12 he became interested in the guitar after hearing a <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Don+McLean\" title=\"\">Don McLean</a> song on <a href=\"http://www.thesimpsons.com\" title=\"\">The Simpsons</a>. He took a music technology course at college but dropped out at 16 and played local gigs. In June 2011 played at&nbsp;Glastonbury; a record deal followed and his self-titled debut album went to No 1 last autumn. Dubbed the \"East Midlands Bob Dylan\", he was this year nominated for NME, Brit&nbsp;and Ivor Novello awards. His new single, Broken, is released on 29 July.</p><p><br /><strong>When were you happiest?</strong><br />When my album went to No 1.</p><p><strong>What is your greatest fear?</strong><br />Zombies.</p><p><strong>What is your earliest memory? </strong><br />My third birthday.

There is no question about where we are. Technically, we're in \"that London\", hearing some new Jake Bugg tunes.

The rest of it – the early pell-mell jangle, the young Liam Gallagher's smeary sneer, the tales of pills, thrills and bellyaches that ushered in Oasis's imperial period, the better bits, basically – came, somehow, to rest with Bugg, an almost perfect composite of front-cock Liam and Noel, the bard strategist, all wrapped up in an East Midlands urchin persona so perfect that it was only a matter of time before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/shane-meadows\" title=\"\">Shane Meadows</a> descended. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_WmCpZEou4&amp;feature=youtube_gdata\" title=\"\">Kingpin</a>, one of those new, slightly predictable, Oasissy songs, gets a keen reception tonight. It's a fast choogle about being a drug dealer, all lairy bragging, with a side order of fretting about \"all the eyes [being] on your crown\". Then there's Slumville Sunrise, another new, cantering bout of declamatory yearning that forms part of this set's climax. (The last few minutes of the song's knockabout jewel heist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4wTRbW0aos\" title=\"\">video</a>, meanwhile, are worth anyone's time, with Meadows casting a truculent Bugg opposite a pregnant and sulky Rosamund Hanson from <em>This Is England.</em>)</p><p>The 19-year-old's self-titled debut album went to No 1 on release <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/jake-bugg/66751\" title=\"\">last October</a> and has since sold about a million copies worldwide, polarising as it went. It displaced Mumford &amp; Sons at the top of the UK chart, an act many interpreted as a return of grit to Brit rock, and victory of the recession-scarred north over the soft, smug south. Noel Gallagher anointed Bugg with a tour support slot for his High Flying Birds, and the guitarist (he swaps instruments probably a dozen times tonight) hasn't looked back since, picking the sorts of fights with the <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/s103/the-x-factor/news/a432441/jake-bugg-its-my-job-to-keep-x-factor-st-off-number-one.html\" title=\"\"><em>X&nbsp;Factor</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/celebrities/893943/jake-bugg-strikes-again-one-direction-sing-meaningless-tunes\" title=\"\">One Direction</a> that Noel used to pick with all comers in the 90s.</p><p>Bugg's done things for Burberry, been papped with model <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a455611/jake-bugg-performs-at-fashion-party-leaves-with-model-cara-delevingne.html\" title=\"\">Cara Delevingne</a>, and nailed his colours to the mast for \"authenticity\" (whatever that may be) against the pop manufacturing process, a claim slightly tarnished by the professional songwriters on his creative team. There are bevies of teenage girls here who scream, Harry Styles-style, every time Bugg looks even faintly in their direction. This just one of a few small curveballs in the reading of Bugg as Noel's mini-me.</p><p>When he hasn't been touring, Bugg has been working on his second album, due out just a year after his first one; a work ethic that cleaves to the pattern of bygone eras, like Bugg's better music does. <em>Shangri La</em> was recorded in California with US producer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02rubin.t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;\" title=\"\">Rick Rubin</a>, a Yoda-like figure who came up producing hip-hop before turning to metal and stage-managing the exit of the late Johnny Cash (which was how the country-loving Bugg had heard of him). This tour – including three nights at London's capacious Brixton Academy – finds Bugg playing great swaths of <em>Shangri La</em>, whose success is, basically, a given. It's more of the same, but varied and better arranged, with the odd surprise. Kitchen Table – which regrettably doesn't get played tonight – adds the faint hint of jazzy folk to Bugg's balladeering, for one. Tonight's unexpected revelation, meanwhile, is a Neil Young cover, Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black); not the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lPWIa7HAs\" title=\"\">cover itself</a>, which Bugg has been doing for some time, but how easily Bugg's nasal Liam tips into reedy Neil, a connection rarely made by other singers.</p><p>Certainly, neither Gallagher could have written a manifesto such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-5KBxUaGVQ\" title=\"\">There's a Beast and We All Feed It</a>, the first track on <em>Shangri La</em> and tonight's opening salvo. It's a broadside in which skiffle meets Dylan in a parsimonious but pugnacious one minute and 43 seconds; a sequel, of sorts, to Lightning Bolt, but with more electricity in the emotion. \"When my sister suffers/When my mother cries/All I wanna do is look in someone's eyes…\" Bugg seethes. \"There's a beast eating every kind of beauty and we all feed it.\" He has a point here.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420879195|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|23026c251b20cb94f4841e2b6f00eeded75a15ea -->",

        "body":"<p>Early afternoon in Austin, Texas, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/jake-bugg\" title=\"\">Jake Bugg</a> is perhaps having cause to regret one of his most famous lyrics. It's the line from \"Two Fingers\", one of five singles he released last year, that goes: \"Skin up a fat one, hide from the feds…\"</p><p>\"Our bus got pulled over by the cops in Arizona,\" mutters the 19-year-old, freshly arrived in one redneck state from another. Luckily his touring party had somehow \"had word\" in advance that they might be subject to a&nbsp;police search, so had taken some precautions. A&nbsp;sniffer dog came aboard. Twice. Its nose led to Bugg's luggage. \"But they pulled it out, opened it, and all me laundry exploded out,\" he says, smiling, in his broad Nottingham accent. Nothing else emerged. \"I never have weed in my suitcase.\"</p><p>At the same time, the easygoing amiability of Britain's best new singer-songwriter since the emergence of Noel Gallagher was winning the day. \"I was getting on really well with this state trooper, so it would have been awkward if they'd had to arrest us.\" Awkward indeed. \"They said: 'We know it's on here, but we can't find it.'\"</p><p>In the end, Bugg thinks the friendly \"feds\" tipped him a wink and did the British youngster a favour. \"They said: 'Well, you've just come from California, so we'd expect your bus to smell of marijuana.'\"</p><p>Now, in blazing Texan heat, Bugg – dressed all in black and firmly buttoned up in a Harrington-style jacket – is considering what lies ahead. Today on the singer-songwriter's itinerary: a teatime slot at the <a href=\"http://www.aclfestival.com/\" title=\"\">Austin City Limits festival</a>, another pit stop in a world tour that has lasted, more or less, for a full 18 months. Tomorrow, two flights to reach Mexico City, where the guitarist and his two-piece band are performing at the giant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2012/nov/30/corona-capital-festival-mexico\" title=\"\">Corona Capital event</a>, a few notches beneath headliners Arctic Monkeys. Then home to the UK, an appearance on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/dec/13/alan-carr-chatty-man\" title=\"\">Alan Carr's <em>Chatty Man</em></a>, production rehearsals, and straight into a sold-out British tour.</p><p>He will land at Heathrow a year to the day from the release of his self-titled first album. It entered the charts at number one, making Jake Bugg – 18 at the time – the youngest British male in chart history to debut at the top. Over the following 12 months he picked up a Brit nomination, a place on the Mercury Music Prize shortlist, Olympic ubiquity (his song \"Lightning Bolt\" was the obligatory soundtrack for any Usain Bolt highlights package), support slots with the Rolling Stones and Stone Roses, a celebrity girlfriend (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/cara-delevingne\" title=\"\">Cara Delevingne</a>, although the relationship was short-lived) and worldwide album sales topping 1m.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421485428'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383133107609/Jake-Bugg-portrait-shot-008.jpg' alt='Jake Bugg portrait shot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>‘I’d never been out of England before I went on tour last year’: at Zilker Park, Austin, Texas. Photograph: Julian Broad for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>Not bad for a quiet, undemonstrative lad playing old-fashioned skiffley blues, albeit rebooted with lyrics clawed from an inner-city childhood in very modern Britain. The product of a broken home, Bugg grew up in Clifton, Nottingham, once the biggest housing estate in Europe.</p><p>As the immigration officer at Dallas/Fort Worth airport said to me: \"Ah, Jake Bugg… He's the new Dylan, right?\" Or, he's Gallagher writing for the La's. Either way, he's a phenomenon, and Britain hasn't seen a young artist like him in yonks.</p><p>Backstage at the Austin festival, the compact, poker-faced moptop cuts a curious figure amid the vest-wearing, extravagantly tattooed American rock fraternity. He's had two solid summers of playing Glastonbury, T in the Park and multiple fields in between. Does Jake Bugg enjoy music festivals?</p><p>\"Not particularly. It's either too hot or it's too cold,\" he replies in his default monotone.</p><p>What about touring in general? In spring last year, not long after signing a record deal, he embarked on his first run of support gigs, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/michael-kiwanuka\" title=\"\">Michael Kiwanuka</a> in Europe. \"That was really cool. I'd never been out of England when I did that tour. The first place I&nbsp;went to was Paris. And I did <em>not</em> like it.\"</p><p>All that fancy foreign muck?</p><p>\"That was a toughie, getting into the food,\" he acknowledges.</p><p>These exchanges are typical Bugg. But his scowling demeanour isn't really the whole picture, as that Arizona lawman would attest. It's partly a defence mechanism against the fannish hysteria that increasingly attends his every move. And it's partly a put-on, a grumpy-kid act that amuses him and everyone around him.</p><p>Once you get to know Bugg, he's hilarious, airily dismissive of most of his peers (\"Arctic Monkeys? I love the second record. I ain't had a proper listen to the new one, but what I've heard I haven't been a big fan of\") and pithily aware of the status success has brought. \"I like my clothes and I like to look smart,\" admits this recipient of piles of free clobber courtesy of high rollers such as Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry's Christopher Bailey. \"But I'm not someone who gets absorbed in the fashion world, 'cause it can get very controversial,\" he adds. This could be him being ironic, or could be a reference to his brief experience of that scene when he went out with model Delevingne – much to the tabloids' titillation (\"When posh totty meets pop grotty,\" snarked the <em>Sun</em>).</p><p>Today he frowns like a trooper when I bring up his ex. When we spoke earlier this year, just after their split, he was still confused by the whole paparazzi-friendly blip in his private life. \"I knew, obviously, that people wanted to take photos of her 'cause, you know, she's all over the world. But it was just confusing for me – what you gonna get out of getting a picture of me? What the fuck do you want from that? I'm just gonna smoke a fag and stand here!\"</p><p>When the mood takes him, Bugg can appear reserved to the point of taciturn. Left to his own devices, \"I'd just be in my bedroom, writing tunes,\" he admits. \"I try and be productive with my spare time.\" Yet over the last year, \"I've met a load of new friends and a lot of cool people. And they introduce you to people and you learn to be more sociable. You kind of have to be, doing this,\" he says, gesturing to the tape recorder sitting on the table next to his ever-present packet of fags. \"Especially in America – there's no point doing the promotion if you're not gonna smile your way through it. But I do have to give myself a slap every day, tell myself how lucky I&nbsp;am. This is what I&nbsp;always wanted to do.\"</p><p>Bugg has been in America loads this year, including a short stint making his second album. Yes, a scant year after releasing his first, and despite touring nonstop ever since, Jake Bugg has found time to write and record a follow-up.</p><p>It's called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/12/jake-bugg-second-album-completing\" title=\"\"><em>Shangri La</em></a> and is named after the studio in which it was recorded: the oceanside California base of super-producer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/rick-rubin\" title=\"\">Rick Rubin</a> (Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Neil Diamond, Adele, oh, <em>everyone</em>). And it's fantastic. Two highlights: \"Song About Love\", a glorious ballad – think Nick Drake meets Gram Parsons – and \"Messed Up Kids\", another street-real account of life in his hometown: \"Johnny deals a bit of blow on the side, thinks that he's invincible, hates a fight/Jenny walks the streets alone, she was fine, but she got kicked out of her home in hard times…\"</p><p>\"With that song,\" Bugg says, \"I thought I&nbsp;wasn't gonna sing any more stuff about coming from where I come from, and being as observational as the first record. But it was actually quite interesting to view things from a different perspective after everything that's happened. And to go back to where I'm from and have one last look.\"</p><p>Technically, Bugg is currently homeless. On the brief occasions he's in London he stays in hotels. He's been considering buying a flat for a while, but hasn't had time. His possessions – apart from a burgeoning collection of guitars – amount to the three suitcases he's lugging round the world, and some boxes stored in a music rehearsal space in the capital. But he did make it home to Nottingham this summer, if only to headline a local music festival, <a href=\"http://www.splendourfestival.com/\" title=\"\">Splendour</a> – two years after opening its smallest stage.</p><p>\"In the crowd there was a girl on some lad's shoulders that I went to school with for years. And she always said to me: 'I'll never get your music – why do you listen to that crap?'\" he smiles, referring to his adolescent love of Don McLean, the Everly Brothers and Johnny Cash. \"And she was singing all the words to the songs. That was mad.\"</p><p>The visit also inspired \"Messed Up Kids\". \"That wasn't the reason for my visit; that was just kinda what I stumbled on when I went back for one last look. That was quite interesting. And quite weird. Nottingham's a place that I know better than anywhere in the world, but I've been away from it for such a while.\"</p><p>Does he still feel connected to it? \"Yeah, you never forget where you're from. But I spent so much time there – I lived there all my life – and there was a big world out there, and I wanted to see it.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421485427'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383133608388/Jake-Bugg-on-stage-at-Zil-008.jpg' alt='Jake Bugg on stage at Zilker Park' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>‘I think I can come across as a bit of a twat, to be honest’: Jake Bugg onstage at Zilker Park. Photograph: Julian Broad for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>Hence, in part, the work ethic that has produced two albums in one year. I spend five days with Bugg, in Texas and Mexico, and he's clearly a grafter, turning in quick-fire radio interviews and acoustic singalongs galore. He's also hugely entertaining company, generous and welcoming and straightforward. He likes his music, his band and crew, his football, his weed, his table tennis, his clothes, and that's pretty much it. As both a lad and as an artist, Jake Bugg is proper.</p><p>That said, \"I think I can come across as a bit of a twat, to be honest,\" he admits with a hint of a smile. \"I got a couple of tweets not long ago – 'Jake Bugg, you make great music but why do you have to be such a&nbsp;douche?'\"</p><p>They don't think he's a douche in Mexico. At the airport Bugg is met by a proper boy-band fan crush. At the Corona Capital festival he's greeted with a deafeningly rapturous audience reaction and two offers of marriage. As he saunters offstage, I ask how that was for him.</p><p>At first Bugg gamely tries to maintain his cool. \"Awright,\" he replies with a shrug, his T-shirt sticking to him with sweat. \"Decent,\" he adds. Then the lips twitch into a full smile. \"Pretty fucking mental. It was insane, all the&nbsp;singing along. Was not expecting that.\" He's clearly chuffed to bits.</p><p>In Texas I had asked what he cares about. He had thought for a minute before deciding on family and friends, \"obviously. I think the purpose of life is for it to be lived. And sometimes I think to myself when I'm really knackered: why am I doing this? You're doing it 'cause you love travelling the world and playing music. When my time passes, I don't necessarily want to be remembered. But if there was some slight way you could make a slight change that's better for the world, then I'd feel like I've done something with my years.\"</p><p>Jake Bugg, then: a wise – and staggeringly talented – head on young shoulders. Although the boy himself doesn't think he's that young any more.</p><p>\"I've aged terribly in the last year!\" he said. \"I went back to England recently and didn't get ID'd at either pub I&nbsp;went to. And you have to look over 25 now, which makes it even more annoying.\"</p><p>Shangri La<em> is released on 18 November</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421275620|2013-11-05T11:03:55Z|4ad44f2f5bd8867263442e91ff0c50645ade10a8 -->",
