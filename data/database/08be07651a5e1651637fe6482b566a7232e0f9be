        "headline":"F1 teams need to learn to manage their money, says BBC's Gary Anderson",
        "body":"<p>The Yas hotel, like some giant grey slug, looms over Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina Circuit, its slime trail made up of the hopelessly rich and fashionable, the show-offs and poseurs who had flocked to the area for Sunday's grand prix. There were even a few motorsport fans around the place.</p><p>There is sometimes a vulgarity attached to the great wealth in Abu Dhabi; Depeche Mode played here on Sunday night, but Liberace might have been more appropriate.</p><p>Formula One likes this sort of environment. This is the very pinnacle of motorsport and it is all about noise and glamour, riches and excess but wealth is not what they're talking about in F1 at the moment.</p><p>Lotus have managed to keep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/02/bernie-ecclestone-kimi-raikkonen-unpaid-wages-lotus\" title=\"\">Kimi Raikkonen</a> happy by shoring up their finances, for the timing being but the sport still returned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/03/sebastian-vettel-seventh-straight-race-schumacher\" title=\"\">from Abu Dhabi on Sunday</a> night in a state of incipient crisis. If Lotus, one of the great names of F1, and fighting to be second in this year's constructors' championship, can find themselves in such a mess, what about the small teams?</p><p>Formula One is controversially run, partly because the two men who organise the sport, its chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, and the FIA president, Jean Todt, are busy waging wars elsewhere. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/29/f1-bernie-ecclestone-damages-claim\" title=\"\">Ecclestone, 83 a week ago, is fire-fighting a number of cases, all linked to bribery allegations in Germany,</a> a distraction that may ultimately lead to him losing control of the sport he has governed for 40 years. One started in London's high court last Tuesday. Todt is battling for re-election and has recently been cleared by the governing body's ethics committee of using unfair tactics.</p><p>Meanwhile, cash-strapped teams are fighting for survival as there is also a less than equitable distribution of money among the teams.</p><p>Some may view the teams as the poor, downtrodden victims in all this but not Gary Anderson, BBC F1's technical analyst and one of the most respected voices in the sport. Anderson told me in Abu Dhabi: \"I think it's time teams cut their cloth accordingly, just as you would run a household budget. There is a bit of naivety among some teams. There is poor management on the financial side.</p><p>\"You can't, as a team, say to Bernie or CVC [the private equity company that bought F1 in 2006] you want more money. You can't say: 'We are incapable of looking after ourselves, you've got to give us more.' Is that right? I don't think it is.\"</p><p>Anderson, who designed cars for the Jordan and Stewart grand prix teams, says: \"Spending has to be controlled. I would control the bits you can change on a car. It won't stop teams developing but it would mean a lot less waste. At the moment teams are developing components to get on the car and when they don't work they get put in the bin.</p><p>\"It's only because they're allowed to do it that quickly. If you said: 'OK, after every four or five or six races you can have an update on certain bits on the car,' then you would control that. Teams would have more time to research, there would be less wastage.</p><p>\"Take rear wings. We have probably a different rear wing for most circuits. That's stupid. For me you go to Melbourne for the first race of the season, that rear wing – like the gearbox – would have to last five races. You will save bucket loads of money.</p><p>\"And look at the wheels and tyres. In the pits, most teams will have 11 sets of slick tyres, all mounted, a couple of sets of intermediates, a couple of sets of wets, all mounted. That's 15 sets of wheels, tyres and tyre blankets all sitting outside a garage on a Thursday afternoon.</p><p>\"The most you can use in one individual qualifying session is three sets of soft and three sets of hard. So that's six, plus a set or two of intermediates and wets. So at the most that 10, eight if you can get away with it. Those things add up. Over a season, a team could make a saving in the region of £10m, just through wastage and over extravagance.\"</p><p>Anderson doesn't let off the men in charge completely. He says: \"The FIA needs to look at itself carefully because it is inflicting a huge cost on teams that are already struggling. Next year is going to be a nightmare, a big nightmare, an absolute minefield, because there are so many changes. The FIA needs to instigate regulations that limit the expenditure in development.\"</p><p>On Ecclestone, he says: \"A few years ago Bernie would bang the desk and it would have happened but those days have gone. I don't know quite where they have goneto.</p><p>\"I know Bernie is fire-fighting lots of other stuff but I don't know where the leadership has gone to. The business is no longer his to control. He's doing it for shareholders.</p><p>\"There is a huge lack of leadership but the worst thing that could ever happen in Formula One would be to give it to the teams to run. Someone has to pull the strings because there is no way that 11 or 12 teams would agree to anything. They would all have self-interest in different directions and that would be a nightmare.\"</p><p>Perhaps Formula One really does need a dictator but time could be finally running out for the one it currently has.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421626915|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|8fabd9bdc5aaee8dec41480ccef72f8dbbe79513 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is the only one that starts in sunshine and ends in twilight but for the 21 drivers who follow Sebastian Vettel round in circles, every race must feel like this.</p><p>There was an excoriating sense of deja vu as Vettel did his \"doughnuts\", spins on the pit straight, and squirted his champagne from the podium that now feels like a throne, with no abdication in sight.</p><p>This was his 11th win of the season, the 37th of an extraordinary career but at least there was a fresh sense of emotion. His parents, Norbert and Heike, were there to watch as he equalled Michael Schumacher's 2004 record of seven straight victories.</p><p>If he wins the final two races of the year, in Austin and Brazil, he will equal the record of nine wins in as many races set by Alberto Ascari, though that was over two seasons. He would also equal Schumacher's record of 13 wins in one year.</p><p>With pole man Mark Webber finishing second this was Red Bull's 15th one-two result in their brief history, their 100th podium too.</p><p>Even Vettel has rarely been as dominant as this, winning by half a minute and it could have been more, for his advantage stood at 40 seconds at the time of his  second pit stop on lap 37. After that it was cruise control.</p><p>Through the smoke from the fireworks, which was supplemented by the burning rubber provided by Vettel and Webber as they cavorted at the end, there were more meaningful matters to discuss.</p><p>The troubled Kimi Raikkonen had a bitter-sweet day. His race was over after Turn One, when his light collision with Giedo ven der Garde's Caterham broke his suspension. His exit from the track looked quicker that his start off the grid. It was his first opening-lap retirement since 2006.</p><p>The good news for him is that a deal appears to have been brokered between his manager, Steve Robertson, and Lotus. If this is confirmed by lawyers, Raikkonen will race in the last two races later in the month. On Friday he threatened to  boycott those venues, claiming he had been paid nothing all season.</p><p>It was an important race for Mercedes. With Nico Rosberg finishing third, and Lewis Hamilton seventh, they extended their lead in second place in the  constructors' championship to 11 points over Ferrari.</p><p>It was, however, the fifth time in six races, going back to the Italian round in September, that Hamilton had been  bettered by his Mercedes team-mate. Hamilton is still the quicker man on one-lap Saturday qualifying but the signs are that the German has a greater mastery of his Pirellis, though Hamilton was also unlucky to be held up by Adrian Sutil and Esteban Gutiérrez.</p><p>This was also a significant day for Paul di Resta, who is fighting for his seat at Force India, where he is fighting off competition from Nico Hülkenberg, current team-mate Sutil and possibly Kevin Magnussen, the bright young thing from the McLaren stable.</p><p>Employing a one-stop strategy, Di Resta finished sixth after a stirring battle for fifth place that was much more compelling than anything happening at the pointy end of the race.</p><p>As for McLaren, Sergio Pérez – another threatened driver – beat the admittedly unfortunate Jenson Button for the second time in as many races. McLaren are expected to confirm, imminently, that Pérez will partner  Button – who suffered early damage – once again in 2014. There was another strong drive by Ferrari's Felipe Massa, though he finished only eighth.</p><p>His team-mate, Fernando Alonso who finished fifth, had precautionary checks in hospital after hurting his back on a heavy jolt over the kerbs when he ran wide to avoid a collision with Jean-Eric Vergne's Toro Rosso. \"I still have all my teeth after the impact,\" he said. \"My back is obviously in pain a little bit because it was a big hit.\" A team spokesman said he had been given the all-clear.</p><p>At the end of the evening, though, it was Vettel's performance to which everyone returned. Even Red Bull's team principal, Christian Horner, who could have been excused for exhausting all his superlatives in recent weeks, looked mightily impressed. All over again.</p><p>He said: \"It was absolutely mind-blowing in many respects. After the start, Seb got his head down and just  disappeared. Not only did he have the pace but he kept asking how the tyres were, and they were fine.</p><p>\"He was truly dominant. He has hit a patch of form that is incredible. We know Mark Webber is a very fine racing driver. And in a race which didn't have any safety cars or issues, to achieve what he's done is quite mind-blowing.</p><p>\"I don't have words to describe how phenomenal he is.\" He kept searching, though. So must we all.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421564249|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|27638759445c6dbde3a51c6a95e84f6c52f59a49 -->",

        "headline":"Romain Grosjean: from immature menace to Lotus's future F1 champion",
        "body":"<p>There is a feyness about Romain Grosjean, a certain poet's poise in those innocent eyes and that slender jaw. When you add that to his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/03/grosjean-crash-belgian-grand-prix\" title=\"\">unfortunate tendency last year to drive as recklessly as Toad of Toad Hall</a> it is not difficult to understand why many people were worried about his future in the sport at the end of the season.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/09/f1-romain-grosjean-lotus\" title=\"\">An angry Mark Webber dubbed him \"the first-lap nutcase\"</a> after one of his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te3nXZwQKb8\" title=\"\">more infamous prangs at the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix</a> and said he would have to change his ways if he was to survive in Formula One. But this year the toad, so to speak, has been transformed into a prince. He is the most improved driver of the year and now he is consistently faster than his Lotus team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen.</p><p>Quite what Ferrari – Raikkonen's employers next season – think about that is unknown. But the figures speak for themselves. In the first eight races of the season, up to and including Silverstone, Raikkonen beat Grosjean in qualifying on seven occasions. In the eight races since, the Finn has got the better of the Frenchman on three occasions.</p><p>It is not just in qualifying either. In the races Grosjean has been third in the past three, while Raikkonen has been second, fifth and seventh. Some attribute this to the damaged relationship between Raikkonen and the Lotus team, which reached a head on Friday evening with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/01/kimi-raikkonen-lotus-walk-out-f1\" title=\"\">the driver's threat to quit before the end of the season</a>.</p><p>Others point to the mid-season change of rubber. \"The tyre change after Silverstone definitely seemed to swap them around,\" says the team's trackside operations director, Alan Permane. \"Romain is just quicker over one lap than Kimi on these tyres, yet on the previous tyres it was the other way around.\"</p><p>But Grosjean credits himself and the psychologist he has been seeing for the turnaround in his fortunes in the second half of the season. \"It's not the birth of my son and it's not because Kimi is leaving, as some people want to say,\" says Grosjean. \"It's just the work I do at home, the psychologist's work. Everything is in the head. When you get to Formula One you have proven you are a very good and talented driver. Once you get here what makes the difference is the head.\"</p><p>So what happened last year? \"I did some small mistakes,\" he says, suggesting that understatement might be a bigger problem than understeer in the Lotus garage. \"There were a little bit too much mistakes,\" he adds, stroking that narrow chin. \"Then the Spa story came out. Everyone bit me, which doesn't make it easy to drive, or feel good.\"</p><p>Grosjean made his Formula One debut for Renault in 2009, but lost his seat the following year. His accident-prone 2012 – although there were plenty of examples of his fundamental speed – appeared to confirm the notion that he was not up to the job. Some people even said he had a problem with spatial awareness. \"Japan was my worst mistake last year,\" he says. \"I was trying to be careful, to move forward, and I messed up in the first corner with Mark Webber.\"</p><p></p><p>At the Monaco Grand Prix he had three crashes in the practice sessions and the team principal, Eric Boullier, told him to \"wake up\". His race there ended when he crashed into the back of Daniel Ricciardo. But it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBM4KpxfsPc\" title=\"\">the incident in Spa, where he caused a multicar pile-up, </a>resulting in the elimination of Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Sergio Pérez, as well as himself, which was the most spectacular and brought him a one-race ban. He was the first driver to be banned since Michael Schumacher in 1994.</p><p>\"I've been through very difficult times. All that has helped me to improve myself. I started some very hard work on myself and it's getting better every time. I'm very different now. And I can get even better.</p><p>\"Even last year I never doubted myself. If I lost my confidence I wouldn't be here today. It was hard. But I was the first person to be unhappy with myself, the first one to try and solve the issue. But I never lost the confidence.</p><p>\"I started the year not being aggressive, but being 'neutral'. In the last few races I've been a bit more aggressive at the start. Korea was a good example, and Japan too. I've worked hard and I know the possibilities when a situation comes, and I can choose the right one.</p><p>\"Before I felt I did not see so many possibilities and I did not make the right choices. And Eric has always been behind me.\"</p><p>So what does he think of Raikkonen, the team-mate he might lose earlier than expected? \"Kimi is a fantastic driver and a great world champion and a good reference point for me. But then he's … Kimi. He doesn't speak much, doesn't say much. The relationship is a bit strange.</p><p>\"I've learned almost nothing from Kimi. But from the data, looking at the way he works and set up the car and the way he thinks about things, these things I have taken. And now I'm thinking of being team leader, and maybe world champion one day.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/01/romain-grosjean-f1-lotus\" title=\"\">Grosjean may look a delicate creature but he is tough and fast enough to make a champion</a>. \"Romain is doing a great job in Formula One,\" says Jenson Button. \"The first few years were very difficult for him but in the last few races he's proved he's got speed and maturity. A first win is just around the corner.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421494630|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|15947635b6a24c3e94fc5554169516d0f15fa6d4 -->",

        "body":"<p>Bernie Ecclestone has backed Kimi Raikkonen in his battle with Lotus over unpaid wages worth millions of pounds. Raikkonen had to be talked into racing in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and may still pull out of the last two rounds in Austin and Brazil.</p><p>Ecclestone, Formula One's chief executive, said: \"He has signed a contract with somebody, they need to pay him. He now needs to do what he can to get paid. I feel sorry for him but he should have been a little more sensible when he signed the contract and know what he was signing for. If he drove for me, I'd have paid him. I am not his manager, but I would not have let him get into that trouble in the first place. If he wants to stand down for a couple of races, that's up to him.\"</p><p>Ecclestone also suggested that the Indian Grand Prix may have been written off before its time. There will be no race there next year and in Delhi last week there were serious doubts that the race would ever return.</p><p>But Ecclestone said: \"It's all done. We just need the government to do their bit.\" Ecclestone hinted that the race would go back to India in 2015 in a new long-term deal.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mark Webber won his second pole in three races as Red Bull closed out the front row for the fourth time this season. Webber, 37, drove one of the best single laps of his long career on the track where he almost won the world championship in 2010.</p><p>He equalled Sir Jack Brabham's Australian record of 13 poles. It also happened to be the 67th birthday of another Australian world champion, Alan Jones. Raikkonen suffered further woes after qualifying when his Lotus failed a front floor deflection test and he was moved from fifth to the back of the grid. The Mercedes pair of Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton will be third and fourth but Fernando Alonso failed to make the top 10 for the first time this season and Jenson Button also failed to get to Q3.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421518430|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|4e262430017f58901529f9ae25f56554839f70b7 -->",

        "headline":"Kimi Raikkonen threatens to walk out on Lotus for final two F1 races",
        "body":"<p>Kimi Raikkonen has threatened to walk out on Lotus and miss the last two races of the season unless he is paid what he claims are the missing millions from his salary and bonus package.</p><p>Raikkonen, 34, the 2007 world champion who made a successful return to Formula One with Lotus last year, also said he was close to missing Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. \"I came here only because hopefully we found an understanding on the certain issues we have been having,\" he said. \"Hopefully it will be fixed and we can finish the season as well as we can.\"</p><p>Raikkonen is expected to race  after flying into Abu Dhabi a day later than the other drivers. But when asked whether he would consider not taking part in the final races in the United States and Brazil later in the month he said: \"For sure. I enjoy racing, I enjoy driving – but a big part of it is business.</p><p>\"Sometimes when that is not dealt with like it should we end up in an unfortunate situation. You have to put the line somewhere, and if it goes over that ... it is not really my fault any more.\"</p><p>Raikkonen is thought to be the third best-paid driver in Formula One after Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton. But his package is heavily weighted with bonuses and it these that cash-strapped Lotus have struggled to pay, according to Raikkonen. He has simply driven better than they expected.</p><p>He has already signed for Ferrari for next year but his last spell with Lotus is ending with bitterness. It reached a new level in the last race in India on Sunday when he had a heated exchange with the trackside operations director Alan Permane, who swore at Raikkonen while telling him to get out of the way so that his faster team-mate Romain Grosjean could get past.</p><p>Raikkonen added: \"Everybody has their own view, own ideas of everything. Sometimes it's not very nice when you hear that you don't have the interests of the team. And you've been paid zero euros the whole year it doesn't put you in the best place, but that's how it goes and hopefully we found an understanding on both sides about how we should deal with the situation.\"</p><p>The Lotus team principal Eric Boullier said: \"Kimi has some emotions. He's not as ice man as we all believe he is. He's a normal guy.\" Asked whether he had a reserve driver lined up for this weekend's race he replied: \"We always have.\"</p><p>Regarding the team's finances, he said: \"We are talking to bring the team to the next step in terms of finances and resources. We nearly have it. Depending on the scenario, it may change the driver lineup.</p><p>\"We want to carry on the nice story but there is some reason why Kimi's leaving. We have the highlights on us. But it's not only about us. The costs are too high in F1. To be competitive you have to spend at least a minimum of 50% of the top teams. It still a lot of money and it's not sustainable.\"</p><p>With reference to the radio row, Boullier added: \"There was one word in the phrase which when you get stressed and emotional it can create more emotions.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Alain Prost says Hamilton will not win another Formula One world championship unless he changes his approach to the sport.</p><p>Prost, a four-times champion who is recognised as one of the all-time greats, said: \"The way Sebastian Vettel works with people in the team, we know that he is doing little things different to the rest. That gives him an advantage and makes him more confident. That's why it is always a package.</p><p>\"On the other side, there is a guy like Lewis who is more of a pure racing driver but I think he should change a little bit and look into other things because he could be surprised.</p><p>\"Now you are not driving by yourself. You are going to have all this computerised equipment behind you and you might get a different reaction.</p><p>\"Maybe next year he will find another motivation, but at the moment he is finding it very hard to beat Sebastian, because the way he has his team behind him, maybe Lewis needs to have something different.\"</p><p>Hamilton admitted he might not win another title when he said: \"I have confidence we'll be competitive next year but you never know. Maybe circumstances mean that I never win the world championship again. It could happen in our sport, who knows.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421479478|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|3f0258da3aa15ee0babc0807a16295d2c97a630f -->",

        "headline":"Lewis Hamilton 'not stressing' about Ross Brawn's Mercedes departure",
        "body":"<p>Lewis Hamilton says Mercedes can manage without Ross Brawn, the most successful team principal of his generation, because he believes no team depends on one person.</p><p>Brawn, 58, will quit the team in the near future, probably at the end of November, when the season ends, but next year at the latest.</p><p>He will bring the curtain down on one of the most remarkable careers in Formula One, a run that brought him eight drivers' and eight constructors' world championships. But Hamilton said: \"The team's success does not depend on one individual. So I'm not stressing.\"</p><p>When Hamilton signed for Mercedes a year ago he singled out Brawn for special praise. But the British driver appeared to be in a phlegmatic mood when it was suggested that there would be no one like Brawn.</p><p>\"Maybe, maybe not,\" he said. \"People said there would never be another Michael Schumacher but there is Sebastian [Vettel] now. Never say never.\"</p><p>Neither was Hamilton convinced by the argument that Brawn and Adrian Newey were the two great Formula One leaders of their time. \"I disagree that there are two leaders. Firstly, those two individuals are totally different. Adrian designs the car, which inevitably is the thing that wins the races. Ross gets the team together – it is a different job.</p><p>\"You've got others: Martin Whitmarsh [McLaren], who does an incredible job, you've got Christian Horner [Red Bull], who has clearly done an incredible job, so there's a lot of them here. There is [Stefano] Domenicali, who has done a great job at Ferrari.</p><p>\"It depends on your perception and your approach. There is going to be someone out there who can do the same or better and they just haven't had the chance to do the same. I don't think there is anyone like Adrian [Newey]. I don't think there will ever be anyone like Adrian.\"</p><p>Hamilton appeared to be a lot more positive about Brawn earlier in October, when he said: \"Before I made my decision to join we sat down together and he took me through the team's plans, and where the team was going. He's a great boss and I'm enjoying working with him. I don't know what his plans are for the future, but of course I'd like him to stay.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the already strained relationship between Kimi Raikkonen and his Lotus team was the subject of more speculation here when the Finn failed to appear for Thursday's usual media sessions and race preparations.</p><p>A Lotus spokesman simply said: \"He's not here yet. We expect him tomorrow.\" Raikkonen has decided to spend longer in Europe before flying in for Friday's practice sessions. It is the third time in under a year that the driver has not turned up on Thursday.</p><p>There is a pay issue with Raikkonen, who will leave Lotus to join Ferrari at the end of the season. His pay cheque is bonus-related, and as he has had another strong season (he is currently third in the drivers' championship) Lotus have had to find more money than they expected.</p><p>A number of payments were not made on time, according to Raikkonen, and he said this was a factor in his decision to move.</p><p>Matters came to a head in Sunday's Indian Grand Prix when Lotus's trackside operations director, Alan Permane, shouted in strong language for Raikkonen to let Romain Grosjean past. A clearly miffed Raikkonen replied with another profanity and his non-appearance at the Yas Marina circuit on Thursday has fuelled suggestions of a breakdown in relations.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421400818|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|25ca47f55e91ee5a0eb490bcde597e79d6880d03 -->",

        "headline":"Russians at Sauber and Toro Rosso look young for F1 – but money talks",
        "body":"<p>Sebastian Vettel is not the only driver people are talking about in Formula One. Daniil Kvyat and Sergey Sirotkin are also getting a good airing when it comes to paddock patter.</p><p>Never heard of them? Well, you will soon, as the Russian teenagers prepare to break into Formula One next year. There's a lot of money in Russia – and of course the Sochi circuit will host the inaugural Russian Grand Prix next October.</p><p>Sirotkin, who turned 18 in August, has signed for Sauber as part of a Russian investment package that has bailed out the Swiss team. He also happens to be the son of Oleg Sirotkin, who fronts up the National Institute of Aviation Technologies and who is part of the consortium that has recently secured Sauber's future. Sirotkin's role is all part of the deal.</p><p>\"It's a bit different driving an F1 car,\" young Sirotkin said a few weeks ago, after his first drive in a Sauber. \"I need to get used to the power-steering. Our preparation programme has just started so I am not quite ready, but by the time the first race comes, I will be ready, I know that. There is nothing I am afraid of. I am looking forward to it.\"</p><p>Sirotkin Sr said: \"Sergey performed in Formula Abarth, in F3, in Augo GP, and this whole year he is in the Renault World Series. So he went through all the steps.\"</p><p>Toro Rosso, meanwhile, who were expected to replace the Red Bull-bound Daniel Ricciardo with the brilliant and precocious Antonio Felix Da Costa, have opted instead for Kvyat, 19, a name that only the folk who work on radio and television have learned to pronounce.</p><p>Kyvat has been performing well for the MW Arden GP3 team, owned jointly by Red Bull's team principal, Christian Horner, and their driver Mark Webber. Horner moved quickly to insist the signing was down to ability, and not the vast marketing opportunities that Red Bull will have in Russia. He said: \"The kid's very quick. He's definitely very quick, very naturally talented. He certainly has a lot to learn, he's got a steep learning curve, but 100% he's there on talent.\"</p><p>But how can these two young men possibly be ready for Formula One next year, assuming they get their FIA super licences, of course, which are mandatory for F1 drivers?</p><p>The most experienced driver in the paddock, Jenson Button, says: \"Daniil has done pretty well in GP3 but it is still surprising that Toro Rosso have put someone so young in the car. For me, F1 is more competitive than ever in terms of talent and experience, so it's make or break for the kid. It might have been better if they had turned around when he was 21 and more experienced and ready for the drive, and said 'here you go'. Now, if he has a few bad races, they could replace him.</p><p>\"When I started in F1 in 2000, I wasn't ready, but I had to take the opportunity. He has to take the opportunity but it should be the people on the other side that say you are too young and you need more experience. He was always going to jump to take the opportunity because it may never come again.</p><p>\"With Sirotkin, I have no idea what he has done. I hear he is racing in World Series but when you look at the leaders – Kevin Magnussen and Stoffel Vandoorne – there is a big difference from them down to the next. I am not sure he has ever fought for the lead. It is a strange one, but he obviously has good backing. And again, he is never going to say no, is he?</p><p>\"He knows how to drive a racing car but it is not a question of driving around on your own. A lot of people could do that relatively well. It is when you put them in a race with 21 experienced racing drivers. It is also about how he carries himself out of the car, his fitness and his engineering capabilities.</p><p>\"Next year is possibly the most difficult year to come in and learn. The way the new engines are going to work will mean the driver has to really understand the car before he goes out.\"</p><p>Button also makes the point that a senior driver can learn nothing from a much younger team-mate. \"At 17 or 18 years old, you don't really know a lot on the engineering side. I certainly didn't. My second year in F1 was so tough because, suddenly, my car wasn't so competitive and I didn't know what I was doing.</p><p>\"I had no idea how to set up a Formula One car. Either these guys are schooled very well or they will have to be very good at engineering. It is very difficult on a team-mate of someone who is very inexperienced because he ends up setting up the car and the other guy copies him.</p><p>\"You know what you are doing but you can't pick up anything from your team-mate. You don't learn as much as in a team with two experienced drivers. It does hurt you. Having two experienced drivers in a team is key and next year it will be very important.\"</p><p>And Button is not the only man concerned. \"I am as shocked as anyone,\" says the Force India driver Paul Di Resta. \"It's not easy to predict this game at the moment. Nothing makes sense. It's a big year and a big ask for someone who is 19. He might come out the box and shock us all. I don't underestimate anyone coming in. It's a big jump coming from GP3 to F1, where there is such a big regulation change.\"</p><p>Adrian Sutil says: \"I think it's far too early [for them]. They are kids and you need to be a grown-up man here in Formula One. It's a tough business and it's sometimes a shame because I think you burn a good talent too early. There is no reason to put drivers in so early, but of course we have a Russian Grand Prix next year and it would be nice to have a Russian driver.\"</p><p>Money is everything in Formula One, including having its influence over who earns a drive in an era when all but the leading handful are cash-strapped.</p><p>Lotus, who have yet to finalise their lineup for next season after losing Kimi Raikkonen to Ferrari, face a serious dilemma. Do they go for Nico Hülkenberg or for Pastor Maldonado, who comes with a swag bag of sponsorship money worth more than £20m? It all depends on what funding the team can get.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421314522|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|b3fa41f3b0317bc3ff445d6419ba0d9acd2d0dce -->",

        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>The future of the Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn was the subject of intense speculation on Tuesday following reports that he will leave his position at the end of the year. Brawn had been expected to leave Mercedes, either this year or next, when he would hand over control of the team to the two executive directors, Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, along with the non-executive chairman Niki Lauda.</p><p>But talks between Brawn and Mercedes about his future are believed to be on-going and on Tuesday Mercedes declined to confirm or deny reports that Brawn would leave after the final grand prix in Brazil on 24 November.</p><p>Brawn is the most successful team leader of his generation, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/may/30/formulaone.sport\" title=\"\">the man behind Michael Schumacher's unprecedented seven world championships</a>. Two of them were won at Benetton and a further five at Ferrari before he went on to buy out Honda F1 and head his own team, which delivered Jenson Button's world title in 2009. Then, with Nico Rosberg, he masterminded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/26/nico-rosberg-wins-monaco-gp\" title=\"\">Mercedes' first grand prix win </a>since 1955.</p><p>Brawn was thought to be on the verge of leaving when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/25/paddy-lowe-mercedes-f1-mclaren\" title=\"\">Lowe</a>, the former technical director at McLaren, was signed last winter before Mercedes said they wanted a \"soft transition\". It is thought that Brawn, 58, would prefer to remain with Mercedes until next year, to oversee the biggest technical changes in the sport since 2009. But at stake is what control he would have and Brawn, who has always been his own man, would want to retain overall power.</p><p>A spokesman for the team would only say that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/07/niki-lauda-ross-brawn-mercedes\" title=\"\">Lauda had already confirmed</a> Mercedes will not announce anything regarding Brawn's future until the end of the season. When Brawn does leave, Lowe will take over the running of the team, with Wolff concentrating on sponsorship and the political side.</p><p>Speculation that Brawn could take up another position – and McLaren have been rumoured – may be wide of the mark. Brawn, a keen fisherman, is tempted to retire when he does finally call it a day at Mercedes, ending a motor sport career which began when he joined March Engineering in Bicester in 1976 as a milling machine operator.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421194111|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|3294ffe32e6563f15ac54ff3d4e67b61a34be033 -->",

        "body":"<p>The future of Formula One will be on the line on Tuesday when a damages claim begins in London's High Court against the sport's chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone.</p><p>At the moment F1 is celebrating the climax of another season, after Sebastian Vettel won his fourth world championship in India on Sunday, the future of Ecclestone, who turned 83 on Monday, and with it the sport he has dominated for almost four decades, faces a harsh scrutiny.</p><p>In a civil action, Ecclestone and three other defendants will fight a claim from the German media group Constantin Medie, that a stake in F1 was sold too cheaply to CVC Capital Partners, who now have a controlling 47% of the business.</p><p>The suit is linked to bribery charges from the Munich state prosecutor that Ecclestone could face in Germany next year. It is alleged that Ecclestone's Bambino trust paid a $44m (£27m) bribe to the German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky, the former risk officer of the German bank BayernLB who was last year sentenced to eight and a half years in prison, to sell the stake at an artificially low price.</p><p>Ecclestone has denied any wrongdoing and has claimed that he was being blackmailed. He is yet to find out if a German court will proceed to trial next year after he was indicted on bribery charges, and he may face further possible civil action in the United States.</p><p>Last year he admitted that his employers, CVC, \"will probably be forced to get rid of me if the Germans come after me. It's pretty obvious, if I'm locked up\".</p><p>Ecclestone's age means his position as the sport's commercial rights holder – effectively the biggest player in the sport – has been the subject of mounting speculation in recent years. Many people in F1 feel – but do not say so publicly – that it is time the sport found a new direction.</p><p>At the same time no one is very sure what will happen to F1 once Ecclestone has gone. He has a rare ability to cut deals and holds most of the complex details inside his head.</p><p>But even if he should successfully fight the civil suits and be eventually cleared over the bribery case, the sport as a whole will not like to see him dragged through British and German courts for months. His position could become untenable.</p><p>All that everyone agrees on is that once Ecclestone has gone, for whatever reason, the sport will never be the same.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421165292|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|832d10d4db8202b6f6684a4c9dd09e2695d78240 -->",

Plans drawn up for the event, due to be unveiled on Thursday night, suggest it would be watched by 120,000 people in grandstands along a three-mile route and attract a global television audience in the tens of millions, generating as much as £100m for London's economy.</p><p>Ecclestone said the popularity of the event meant it would pay for itself. \"With the way things are, maybe we would front it and put the money up for it. If we got the OK and everything was fine, I think we could do that,\" he told the Times. \"Think what it would do for tourism. It would be fantastic, good for London, good for England – a lot better than the Olympics.\"</p><p>The plans come at a time when governments around the world are queuing up to buy the rights to stage a grand prix for up to £30m per race.</p><p>Global design practice Populous study has examined the feasibility of staging a London Grand Prix. Assistant principal John Rhodes told the Times the event would not cause major disruption, taking five days to set up equipment and three to dismantle it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/392287954|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|fddc4c2639b8ad545f1a9f458f84351265e4fdea -->",

        "body":"<p>Human rights activists fear further bloodshed and a violent crackdown by authorities in Bahrain after race organisers gave the green light to next weekend's Formula One grand prix in the troubled Gulf kingdom.</p><p>As the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) said it was satisfied that all proper security measures were in place for the race on 22 April, Nabeel Rajab, from the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), said: \"I'm afraid we might see local people who will be killed in the coming days because of the F1.\"</p><p>Anti-government protesters have called for the event to be cancelled, arguing that it lends legitimacy to a regime which continues to perpetrate human rights abuses.</p><p>The FIA, the sport's governing authority, confirmed  that it would go ahead, with beefed-up security, after receiving reassurances.</p><p>John Yates, the former assistant commissioner of the Met who is in Bahrain advising on police reform, wrote to the FIA president, Jean Todt, to say he felt safer living in Bahrain \"than I have often felt in London\".</p><p>Bernie Ecclestone, 81, the F1 supremo, speaking at the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, said of Bahrain: \"I know people who live there, and it's all very quiet and peaceful.\"</p><p>The comments provoked a storm on social media sites as local activists said there were fears of a clampdown on protesters to prevent disruption to the event.</p><p>Pictures emerged of Ecclestone's image being burned in Bahrain posted on a Facebook page called \"Pearl Family Circle – Martyrs' Square\".</p><p>Protests by members of the majority Shia against the Sunni government of the Al-Khalifa royal family take place on an almost daily basis, mostly confined to villages away from the capital where groups have clashed with police using water cannon, teargas, stun grenades and plastic bullets.</p><p>Activists say there have been more than 70 deaths, 20 from teargas suffocation, since February 2011, when the Bahrain uprising began, with an estimated 600 \"political prisoners\" currently detained.</p><p>Civil unrest has escalated in recent weeks, in part due to concerns for the health of imprisoned activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, now 65 days into a hunger strike, being held in a military hospital.</p><p>On Monday, seven policemen were wounded by a homemade bomb outside the capital in what the interior ministry called an \"act of terrorism\", and an explosion in Manama on Thursday night damaged two cars.</p><p>The funeral of Ahmed Ismaeel, 22, described as a citizen journalist by activists, who was shot by a drive-by gunman, was reportedly attended by thousands.</p><p>A planned protest outside the British embassy today by a group calling itself the February 14 Youth Coalition, named after the date of the beginning of the uprising, may also raise tensions.</p><p>A BCHR report said an average of 15 villages were teargassed as collective punishment every night as the Shia majority continue to oppose the Sunni monarchy and call for the implementation of reforms</p><p>\"We are very concerned for our safety. The FIA have got security companies and bullet-proof cars for their drivers and F1 teams,\" said Dr Ala'a Shehabi, a British-born Bahraini academic and activist. \"Who's going to be protecting the Bahrainis who are going to be locked up in their villages, and prevented from protesting, given that they are going to be extremely angry and provoked by the F1?</p><p>\"There's going to be popping champagne corks, live concerts and parties, in the middle of the island, which is a huge provocation to the families of victims who have been killed, and those of hundreds of political prisoners.\"</p><p>She said the comments by Yates had made people very angry. \"To say everything is fine and dandy. Of course it is. The guy's living in his compound, earning a salary that's more than he ever used to dream of in the UK, loving the weather and thinking: 'This is great, why are people even on the streets protesting?\"</p><p>\"And I'm even more surprised at Ecclestone's remark. Because I've spoken to him. He knows about my own personal case, and how my husband was tortured, ambushed, kidnapped, subjected to a military trial and in jail for 10 months.\"</p><p>The BCHR said it had received reports of injuries caused by birdshot allegedly fired by police in villages on Thursday night. \"All the villages in Bahrain last night were turbulent. They are protesting against the F1, and the government wants to hide that from the media,\" said Rajab. \"That's the reality of Bahrain now.\"</p><p>The Guardian was unable to verify Rajab's claims.</p><p>There have been reprisals by groups loyal to the ruling royal family. A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IRrsOdhrssc#!\" title=\"\">video posted on YouTube</a> purports to show Bahraini police officers doing nothing as a Shia-owned supermarket was looted  earlier this week, and was condemned by the human rights group Bahrainwatch as demonstrating \"the continuing culture of impunity among the country's security forces, despite claims of reform by the government\".</p><p>Amnesty International, in advance of the publication on Tuesday of its report \"Flawed Reforms, Bahrain fails to achive justice for protesters\", said: \"Holding the grand prix in Bahrain in 2012 risks being interpreted by the government of Bahrain as symbolising a return to business as usual.</p><p>\"The international community must not turn a blind eye to the ongoing human rights crisis in the country.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/388678455|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|b7304f24139b0b14af0a1aebb2546c0d08408236 -->",

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.lawrence-tune.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chris Lawrence</a>, who has died of cancer aged 78, was a development engineer and racing driver who won more than 100 races. His prowess as a tuner of engines helped revive the fortunes of the Morgan sports car in 1962, when his famous Plus 4 racer won its class in the Le Mans 24-hour race at an average speed of 94mph. He masterminded Morgan's return to Le Mans in 2002 and 2004 with the Aero 8 sports car, his last major project.</p><p>Born in Slough, Berkshire, Chris was the only child of William Lawrence and Joan Sanderson. He inherited an affinity for golf and motorcycles from his father. A naval tradition within the family dictated that he went to the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, Devon, aged 17, and he gained a degree in engineering on HMS Thunderer.</p><p>He had already progressed from motorcycles to his first Morgan, a three-wheeler with no reverse gear that he persuaded his mother to buy for him. In 1952, Chris competed in his first event, in an elderly 750cc MG special. On leaving the navy, he moved on to a works trial MG that he assembled from parts. Later this morphed into the Rotacks MG on a new chassis, built in a cellar in Swiss Cottage, north-west London. When it became obvious that it was too big to emerge from the cellar in one piece, it had to be disassembled and rebuilt in the street. This glass-fibre-bodied MG special made more demands on Chris's driving and his burgeoning engineering ingenuity, but was not sufficiently competitive to get him a win.</p><p>The turning point was the acquisition, in 1958, of a used Morgan Plus 4, registered TOK 258, for £650. Teaching himself the theory and practice of camshaft profiles, combustion chamber design and \"squish\" area, Chris gradually increased the power output of the Morgan's humble two-litre Triumph TR2 engine (originally designed for the Ferguson tractor) from 95bhp to 156bhp. It was in this form that it won the two-litre class at Le Mans in 1962 as an official Morgan factory entry.</p><p>By then Chris had formed Lawrence Tune, based in Acton, west London, where he built his own Deep Sanderson cars – which raced at Le Mans in 1963 and 1968 – and tuned Triumph engines for customers. He raced in Britain and Europe most weekends. There was a brief foray into Formula 1 in the new three-litre formula in 1966 with a Ferrari-engined Cooper and a twin Mini-engined Deep Sanderson, but it was the Monica project, an exotic luxury saloon car built for a French industrialist, Jean Tastevin, that would come to define the second half of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s for Chris.</p><p>Chris designed the entire car, which was named after the patron's wife, Monique. The convoluted development process generated 25 prototypes as the Monica's luxury ambitions and weight increased. Chris, creating the car with his team in a large railway arch in Chiswick, made frequent trips to France, squabbling with Tastevin's French engineers as tensions grew about the Monica being \"too English\".</p><p>The finished Monica of 1974 was a graceful, refined and sophisticated 150mph vehicle and a remarkable effort for a man who had very little experience of luxury road cars. Its only true shortcoming was mistiming; in the wake of the oil crisis, the market for thirsty, expensive cars had collapsed; in the end, only 10 true Monica production cars were built in France. Bernie Ecclestone, then a car dealer, bought the last three at less than half-price.</p><p>Chris escaped the economic gloom of mid-70s Britain for California, where he set up Lawrence Tune West, preparing English classic sports cars for historic racing events. The California adventure lasted 15 years. In his autobiography, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/unclassified/9781900113045/morgan-maverick\" title=\"\">Morgan Maverick</a> (2008), he was candid about the colourful deals and unhappy customers he left behind as a result of the collapse of the old car market and his own sometimes poor business sense.</p><p>Back in the UK, in the early 90s, he began working for the Wiltshire sports car firm Marcos, and managed and engineered an assault on Le Mans in 1995 with a team of LM600 cars before taking a job with Morgan. He regarded the development of the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1971479,00.html\" title=\"\">Aero 8 Morgan</a> as the greatest achievement of his engineering life and was creating a second Le Mans version of the car for 2004 when he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2003. He settled down to retirement in Herefordshire the following year and swapped the Aero 8 that Charles Morgan, the company's managing director, had given to him as a retirement present for a brown Monica registered KUM 999.</p><p>It was at around this time that I first got to know Chris. Although a seemingly curt and blustery character, he was extremely kind and helpful, and more than happy to find some rare parts for my Monica through his many French contacts. His achievements were recognised at a tribute day at Goodwood Motor Circuit in 2005.</p><p>Chris is survived by his third wife, Carrie, and two sons, Gordon and Steve, from his first marriage. A daughter, Joanna, predeceased him.</p><p>• Christopher John Lawrence, racing driver and car designer, born 27 July 1933; died 13 August 2011</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/379181346|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|e0542034de0e22954b31ac06f209757216df7011 -->",

        "headline":"Bill Boddy obituary",
        "body":"<p>William Boddy, who has died aged 98, was the editor of <a href=\"http://www.motorsportmagazine.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Motor Sport</a> magazine from 1936 to 1991. His career spanned 81 years in total; he wrote his first piece for Motor Sport in 1930 and filed his final column for the magazine a week before he died, still working on a typewriter and making copious handwritten corrections to his copy.</p><p>Boddy – known as Bill, or as \"WB\" to generations of devoted readers – was possibly the longest-serving working journalist in Britain, and probably the most important single figure in the development of the vintage and classic car movement in Britain. He championed the cause of older vehicles through Motor Sport's pages when few seemed to be interested during the new car boom of the 1950s and 60s.</p><p>Boddy loved Brooklands in Weybridge, Surrey, the world's first purpose-built motor-racing circuit, which he first visited as a boy in 1926. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of its history that was unsurpassed. His first article for Motor Sport was on the history of the circuit and he later wrote the definitive book on the subject. As early as 1934, he organised an event there for historic Edwardian racers. When the track was declared an industrial area in 1946, Boddy formed the <a href=\"http://www.brooklands.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Brooklands Society</a>, which helped ensure that original buildings and the surviving parts of the track became listed.</p><p>Boddy was born in London. His father was killed in the first world war. On childhood holidays in Wales he had the opportunity to ride in limousines belonging to a wealthy relative, promoting his interest in motoring. He always loved facts and details and as a schoolboy in the 20s wrote endlessly to the motoring periodicals of the time pointing out mistakes. He even managed to get himself, aged 14, a 100mph demonstration ride in a new Mercedes. His first editorial position – after a brief stint as an assistant in a motorcycle shop – was on Brooklands Track and Air magazine, for which he wrote road tests, despite not yet having a driving licence: he wrote the tests by observing the cars' responses from the passenger seat.</p><p>After going freelance in the mid-30s, Boddy did most of his work for Motor Sport, a 10-year-old title that was rapidly going bankrupt. He was owed so much money when the magazine was taken over by the eccentric Wesley J Tee in 1936 that the new publisher promised to make the 23-year-old editor as long as he kept away from the creditors' meeting. Usually on the end of a telephone, Boddy somehow managed to keep the title going in his spare time throughout the second world war while working in the RAF, despite the fact that there was no motor racing or new cars to report on.</p><p>In the 50s and 60s, Boddy built up Motor Sport, with its distinctive green front cover, into an influential title despite having no particular plan. \"I  just thought I'd write about anything  that interested me,\" he explained \"Readers seemed to like it.\" The tradition of using only initials rather than authors' bylines was maintained on the insistence of Tee, who owned the title until his death in 1996.</p><p>Decades before there were dedicated classic car magazines, Motor Sport was a monthly bible for enthusiasts, stuffed with adverts for ageing exotica that could be bought for a few hundred pounds. But it was also the most influential magazine of its type in Europe, and the place to read about motor racing and new cars. Boddy wrote extremely frank road tests of the latest models that sometimes got him into trouble with several manufacturers. He also covered general motoring issues, most memorably campaigning against the introduction of the 70mph national speed limit in the 1960s. He was not afraid of unpopular causes and was a lone but prophetic voice championing the cause of the VW Beetle amid the anti-German atmosphere of the 50s.</p><p>Boddy went on 39 London-to-Brighton veteran car runs; helped form the <a href=\"http://www.750motorclubbrooklands.org.uk/\" title=\"\">750 Motor Club</a>, promoting low-cost motor sport for Austin Seven drivers; was a founder member of the <a href=\"http://www.vscc.co.uk/vsccweb/\" title=\"\">Vintage Sports-Car Club</a>; and promoted the 500cc racing movement, a low-budget form of motor sport which lead to Britain's domination of Formula 1. He was appointed MBE for services to sports journalism in 1997.</p><p>He married Winifred Holbrook in 1944. She died in 1998. Their three daughters survive him.</p><p>• William Charles Boddy, journalist, born 22 February 1913; died 7 July 2011</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/378125666|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|bd236e75ee26b1db6ce907568b55da899e03c876 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sebastian Vettel showed all the other Formula One drivers what they have to beat this season when he put in a stunning lap to grab his 16th pole position for Sunday's Australian grand prix.</p><p>\"We were not too slow,\" he said, with masterful understatement. \"We have done the first step. But we have zero points and it will be a long season.\"</p><p>There was a gasp of amazement in Albert Park as world champion Vettel, who had been fastest in Q1 and Q2, then dominated Q3 with a run which was 0.8 seconds faster than second placed Lewis Hamilton. And Vettel didn't even use reintroduced Kers system, which might have cut another half second to his time.</p><p>\"I was surprised by how well the tyres worked today - I had a good feeling with them,\" he said, modestly. But despite the German's domination there was still good news for Hamilton, who split the Red Bulls of Vettel and local hero Mark Webber to secure a front row place.</p><p>After looking hopelessly off the pace in testing in Barcelona earlier this month it was an heroic drive by the McLaren driver. His team-mate Jenson Button was fourth, ahead of Fernando Alonso, with the Lotus Renault of Vitaly Petrov sixth. But there was also room for the smaller teams in Q3, with Kamui Kobayashi (Sauber) and Sebastien Buemi making it into the top 10.</p><p>Hamilton said afterwards: \"It's been a fantastic, superb effort by the team and there has been a huge improvement in the car. I never said it was a bad car but there was an issue with downforce.\"</p><p>But Vettel was the drive they were all talking about in Melbourne. Last year he won the world championship, to become the youngest ever driver, despite bad lack and a few errors made out of a lack of experience.</p><p>With more experience and a more reliable car he could prove unstoppable. But judging by the way he drove yesterday Hamilton just isn't in the mood to let that happen. And there is still much more to come from Webber.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/373053622|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|71cfbdb5f88e1d60de5e247f3dee26ab30b6e10b -->",

        "headline":"Surgeons fight to save the hand of Formula One star Robert Kubica",
        "body":"<p>The career of one of the most promising young Formula One drivers was hanging in the balance tonight after an accident in a low-key rally in Italy left him badly injured and having surgery to try to save the use of his right hand.</p><p>Robert Kubica, 26, who drives for the Renault team, was competing in a Skoda Fabia on the Ronde di Andora when he suffered a high-speed crash into a church wall and then a barrier shortly after the start. It took rescue crews more than an hour to extract Kubica from the wreckage. Unconfirmed reports from the scene suggest that part of the barrier speared through the car's footwell into the cockpit.</p><p>The Pole, who is a national hero in his homeland, suffered multiple fractures to his right leg, arm and hand. He was airlifted from the crash site in the village of Testico to the Santa Corona hospital in Pietra Ligure on the Mediterranean coast where he underwent lengthy surgery.</p><p>The main area of concern is the driver's right hand, which, although safe from amputation, is severely damaged and it is too early for doctors to give a prognosis on a full recovery. It is the same arm that was badly injured in a road accident in 2003 and left him with titanium bolts to support the shattered bones.</p><p>Kubica's manager, Daniele Morelli, said last night: \"The surgeons are trying to restore the functionality of the right hand. They must now think about the muscle function, but Robert has a very strong temper and will succeed.\" The Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport reported that more surgery will be required after today's preliminary operation.</p><p>Kubica, who was due to start his fifth full season in Formula One in Bahrain next month, set the fastest time in testing last week and grand prix insiders regard him as one of the sport's supreme talents and a future world champion who could have earned anything up to $100m from his career as a driver. He made his debut for the BMW Sauber team in 2006 after eye-catching victories in the junior formulas, the traditional testing ground for emerging talent.</p><p>He hit the headlines in 2007 when he emerged almost unscathed from a terrifying high-speed crash in Montreal that was a testament to the strength of the modern Formula One car. A year later, and at the same track, he won his first, and so far only, grand prix. When BMW withdrew from Formula One at the end of 2009, unable to justify the cost after a dreadful season,  Kubica signed for the Renault team and achieved some strong results, including second in Australia and third at Monaco, considered the greatest test of a driver's skill.</p><p>The feeling was that this would be the year Kubica would take on the sport's elite on the track and would soon be able to match them in the earnings stakes. In the ultra-secret world of Formula One finance hard figures are difficult to come by but Renault are believed to paying Kubica $10m a year until 2012, with Fernando Alonso earning four times that much at Ferrari.</p><p>Modern Formula One drivers' contracts usually forbid them from taking part in \"high-risk\" activities for fear of injury but the drivers are famed for seeking adrenaline rushes away from the track and Kubica is far from the first driver to put his career – and life – in jeopardy pursuing high-risk hobbies.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Renault team, which is based in Enstone in Oxfordshire, would not comment on whether Kubica had sought permission to compete in the rally although he has taken part in club rallies for several years. It is thought the car he crashed today, a powerful model that competes in international events, was one he purchased two years ago.</p><p>In the first three decades of the Formula One world championship, which began in 1950, drivers regularly competed in various brands of motor sport when they were not competing in grands prix. Top drivers such as Stirling Moss, Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart travelled the world to race in anything that might take them to a win.</p><p>Since the 1970s Formula One drivers are very much that, only occasionally skiing or mountain-biking in the off-season to keep fit and satisfy their need for speed and even that has proved hazardous. Two years ago the Australian driver Mark Webber broke a leg when he was hit by a 4x4 while taking part in a bike race.</p><p>Tonight fellow drivers offered their support to the popular Kubica.</p><p>Britain's former world champion Jenson Button, who drives for McLaren said on his Twitter page: \"Shocking news about Robert Kubica. I wish him a speedy recovery.\"</p><p>Williams driver Rubens Barrichello tweeted: \"I would like to ask you for your best wishes to Kubica. He is being operated right now. We all like him and he deserves all the best.\"</p><p>Sebastian Buemi of Toro Rosso said: \"All my support to Robert Kubica. I am with you man.\"They will also be very aware that just as Robert Kubica was about to join the elite of formula one, his career may well have been snatched away from him by his desire to take part in one of the most basic forms of the sport.</p><h2><strong>The need for speed: previous accidents involving F1 drivers</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Mark Webber </strong></p><p>Breaks a leg when hit by a car mountain-biking in Tasmania before the 2009 season. Drives with steel rods in his leg.
