The 26-year-old, who recently starred in the Ron Howard movie Rush, is said to have been a passenger in a Porsche coaching another driver when their car slammed into a wall and caught fire. Police inspector David Preston says the driver has sustained severe physical injuries and adds that the amount of damage caused was due to the speed of the car",

The 26-year-old was in a Porsche 996 as a passenger when it hit the barriers at the circuit on Tuesday. He had been leading the drivers' championship of the Porsche Supercup series, all of the races for which take place at Formula One events.</p><p>Edwards is understood to have been killed instantly when the car left the track and impacted with a tyre wall on the outside of turn six at the track in Ipswich, 25 miles west of Brisbane. The driver was extracted from the wreckage, which had caught fire, by emergency services and was taken to intensive care with life-threatening injuries.</p><p>It is understood it took three hours to remove the driver from the car. Inspector Dave Preston of Queensland police said it had been a difficult operation to get the man out of the mangled wreckage: \"The fire and rescue had to do extensive work in relation to extracting and opening the vehicle up sufficiently to remove him. He was trapped for some time.\"</p><p>The driver, who has yet to be named, was a 20-year-old Brisbane man. His family were understood to be trackside at the time. He was pinned from the waist down in the wreckage for three hours after the crash took place at 11.30am, after which he was airlifted to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.</p><p>Edwards was the son of Guy Edwards who competed in Formula One and the 24 Hours of Le Mans during the 1970s and 1980s and was one of the drivers who helped remove <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/14/james-hunt-niki-lauda-summer-of-speed\" title=\"\">Niki Lauda from his burning car at the 1976 German Grand Prix</a> at the Nürburgring.</p><p>Sean Edwards won the European GT3 Championship in 2006 and gone on to race in the FIA GT Championship, the American Le Mans Series, the Le Mans 24 hours and the Porsche Supercup and Porsche Supercup Germany series. He finished third  in a Porsche in the GT2 class at his very first 24 hour race, at Spa in 2007.</p><p>Having won the Dubai 24 Hours last year he did so again in 2013 and was also a winner for the Black Falcon team at the Nürburgring 24 this year and took the Long Beach round of the American Le Mans series in the GTC class.</p><p>Racing for the Allyouneed by Project 1 team in this year's Porsche Supercup, he had victories in Spain, Monaco and Hungary and was leading the championship by 18 points with two races at Yas Marina due to have taken place on 2-3 November.</p><p>He had also recently taken part in the making of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/15/rush-review-kermode\" title=\"\">film Rush</a>, recounting the 1976 F1 battle between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, advising on the racing scenes and in some parts portraying his father.</p><p>The crash comes just five months after another death at Queensland Raceway. In June a 23-year-old motorbike rider was killed when he hit the back wheel of another rider.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419989015|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|d4521ad80ddee39ef01bf7ff522f1450d1f50860 -->",

        "headline":"Jenson Button believes new regulations and engines will help McLaren",
        "body":"<p>McLaren's Jenson Button is confident his team can return strongly in 2014 when the new F1 regulations, including smaller engine sizes, come into play. The British driver has endured a testing year in a car that was uncompetitive from the off and that has largely undergone development on race weekends rather than at the factory, where resources were shifted early to next year's model.</p><p>Button was ninth in the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday having started from 10th on the grid. It is a circuit he enjoys but he admitted he had made a wrong call on the way to the grid, asking for a front wing adjustment that left him with huge understeer – resulting in frequent lock-ups, affecting the tyres. But although that was disappointing it, like the season itself, has been a learning process.</p><p>\"I think the important thing when you're building next year's car is to understand what's going to work and what's not going to work,\" he said. \"We've been around the block and we've made the mistakes whereas Red Bull haven't, it doesn't seem, but we know exactly where we don't want to put the car. So it does narrow the window and I think we understand what to do with next year's car. I'm not saying it's going to be race-winning because no one knows, but I have a feeling we have a good understanding of why this car isn't,\"</p><p>The 2014 season will feature the introduction of a new engine formula, with 2.4-litre normally-aspirated V8 engines out and 1.6-litre V6 engines in, a return to turbo-charged power for the first time since 1988. There will also be changes to the usage of Kers, while other significant alterations will affect the cars' weight, design and fuel use.</p><p>Red Bull, who are likely to close out the drivers' and constructors' championships at the next race in India, believe that despite the regulation changes they will be able to take aspects of their dominant car into the new season. But Button does not believe it will offer them a significant advantage.</p><p>\"Because there is such a big change it's exciting for most teams up and down the field. New regulations, new ideas and things to work on. I think that's really interesting to people in F1 as it can get a bit stale for them, this is such a big change I think everyone's really excited about the challenge, as they should be.\"</p><p>Button was also honest about the difficulties McLaren have faced this season. Currently they are in fifth place in the constructors' championship, 181 points behind Lotus in fourth, but he believes his team have every opportunity to come back in 2014.</p><p>\"It hurts like hell,\" he said. \"If you haven't ever won a grand prix or won a world championship it doesn't hurt quite as much but when you have been there and that's where you normally are, at least fighting for a world championship, even though it hasn't happened for a while, it really does hurt.</p><p>\"I don't see this happening for long. We have the whole of the factory, several hundred people – we have the resources to pull ourselves out of it, we have the expertise, it will happen, you have just got to hope that it happens next year,\" he said.</p><p>One question mark over those resources remained as the teams packed up after the race and that is when Peter Prodromou, who McLaren announced they had signed from Red Bull as head of aerodynamics over the weekend, will actually join the team.</p><p>Prodromou worked for McLaren between 1991 and 2006 and has since been working closely with Adrian Newey at Red Bull but his contract is not due to expire until the end of next year. McLaren's team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, reiterated that he would be joining but was still unable to define when.</p><p>\"He has a contract that he will be working for us in the future,\" he said. \"But currently he is employed by Red Bull and we have to respect that and that's why I don't think we're talking about time frames.\"</p><p>However Red Bull's principal, Christian Horner, also remained adamant there would be no early release to McLaren. \"The duration of his contract runs for quite a while yet,\" he said. \"We are certainly in no rush to release him early and he will be with the team to the end of his existing agreement.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419905515|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|cf0f74e22d351217e77b7209c075a4322ac7d909 -->",

        "trailText":"<strong> Giles Richards: </strong>Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel only needs a top-five finish in India to clinch his fourth world title but the bile directed at him from F1 fans is just not fair",
        "headline":"Sebastian Vettel has faced criticism that is both personal and unfair",
        "body":"<p>Sebastian Vettel might not have clinched the title at Suzuka on Sunday but he could not have done more. A win was required and a win was delivered. Only Fernando Alonso's dogged determination denied him. The German now only requires a top-five finish in India to finish the job with three races remaining and, while the early part of the year had promised the possibility of a race to the wire, he has dominated the second half with such authority and his car with such pace, that his opponents have been left reeling.</p><p>The company he now keeps would recognise these traits. This will be his fourth consecutive world championship, only Juan Manuel Fangio, Alain Prost and Michael Schumacher have won four or more and only Fangio and Schumacher four on the bounce. Yet at the age of 26 he will also be the youngest to achieve the feat.</p><p>Taking the title here in Suzuka was unlikely, as both he and the team had already admitted, but although Vettel achieved the victory he needed, making it four from five visits to Suzuka and five consecutive wins, Alonso's fourth place was enough to keep the championship alive for at least one more race.</p><p>But, while there was no sense of disappointment at Red Bull who were understandably celebrating the one-two and remain equally focused on winning the constructors' championship, there has been mixed emotions among fans.</p><p>Many decried the \"Multi 21\" incident in Malaysia when Vettel disobeyed team orders and passed Mark Webber to take the win – booing ensued; many have grown tired of seeing \"the finger\"; but most importantly many have seen his domination as boring – hence more booing.</p><p>No one wants to see the season finished so soon even if in so emphatic a fashion – five wins from the past five races, two Grand Chelems among them and with a two-second a lap advantage in Singapore. But some of the bile he and the team is now attracting is simply unfair. Much is of a similar variety that Ferrari have encountered and McLaren – that they are cheating or hiding an advantage, but much is personal towards Vettel.</p><p>Memories, it seems, can often be short. He may have won in 2010 and 2012 but both were cracking seasons and both went to the final race. Had he failed to take the title at either, there would have been three different champions in the past four years – circumstances in which it is hard to imagine there being so much antipathy towards him.</p><p>In which case, while it is understandable that many may lament the season as boring, it is less fair to direct that ire at the man whose task is to win the championship and because he will have done exactly that four times on the trot. Beyond a shadow of doubt any other driver would not consider for a moment that their role was to entertain or extend the season to its finale with a title at stake. Nor can one imagine the same expectation or the same opprobrium being directed at a British driver in similar circumstances.</p><p>A driver rightly drawing plaudits in the wake of the race, however, was Lotus's Romain Grosjean and he deserved them. How much has changed in a year for the Frenchman, who was on the receiving end of a proper Aussie rollicking from Mark Webber at this race last year after he biffed the Red Bull out at turn two. One of several incidents last year when he was seen as F1's loose cannon: quick – but liable to go off in your face.</p><p>He drove a magnificent race at Suzuka, a brilliant start, followed by a flawless period of leading with Webber on his tail ready to pounce on a circuit that punishes any errors. Both Vettel and Webber passed him in the end but he was struggling with the harder tyres and his spot on the podium was fully justified, while his performances this year even earned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/13/sebastian-vettel-japan-christian-horner\" title=\"\">Webber's approval after the race</a>.</p><p>Most importantly this was no flash in the pan. His pace has never been in doubt, but this season, especially in the second half he has shown the maturity, focus and confidence to really make an impact. The last two races he has driven superbly, not only here in Japan but when he was pipped into third by Kimi Raikkonen in Korea only after he lost his lead over the Finn behind the safety car. He has also out-qualified Raikkonen in five of the past six races. Lotus may have lost the latter to Ferrari but after all those weekends when team principal Eric Boullier and his team must have wondered whether it was worth persevering with Grosjean, their patience looks like being rewarded.</p><p>Which leaves the question of who will partner him there? Again answered emphatically at Suzuka by Nico Hülkenberg, who also drove the wheels off his Sauber. The German was at the centre of the battle for the middle points spots and unafraid of going wheel-to-wheel with Alonso. The Sauber is no slouch and has improved recently but Hülkenberg is working it to great effect. A fourth place in Korea matched his career best and his sixth at Suzuka meant that he has now been out of the points only twice since the British Grand Prix.</p><p>All of which makes it rather unfair that his fate might be decided by the arbitrary matter of being rather tall. Height equals weight and, with next season's new powertrains appearing to be heavier than expected, taller drivers may well take cars over the minimum weight limit. Others have spoken out on the subject, including Jenson Button, another tall fellow, although it seems unlikely to be resolved until 2015.</p><p>With each additional 10 kilos costing around 0.3sec a lap, some teams have been hesitant over pursuing Hülkenberg but Boullier has already said he does not believe a driver's weight would be an issue, insisting his engineers would find a way to save it elsewhere. However he and Lotus are still attempting to finalise a deal for financing for next year, so for the moment the Hulk, who is making all the right moves on track, must wait.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419903151|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|17648b636a335b377a4a1661a6e6eee0917f3f51 -->",

        "headline":"Remembering the tragedy and mayhem of the 1982 F1 World Championship",
        "body":"<p>Some Formula 1 seasons have been more eventful and exciting than 2013. Take 1982 for example. What it may have lacked in quality, it made up for in talking points. It was rarely dull. The year started with a drivers' strike, contained a Grand Prix postponement, controversial disqualifications, a boycott, tragedies, last-lap dramas, and a world champion who only won one race. Never mind a blog, there is enough material for a whole book from this period in the sport.</p><h2>The strike</h2><p>The season had barely begun before the chaos started. Unhappy with certain elements of the new super licences proposed by the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), the drivers took the decision to strike during the practice sessions of the opening race in South Africa.</p><p>Thirty drivers boarded a coach – Jochen Mass was unaware of the group actions and was staying in a different location to the other drivers – and departed the Kyalami circuit en masse. Strength in unity was very much the mantra for the group, as the rebels barricaded themselves in a conference room in the Sunnyside Hotel so that they could not be pestered by their teams and the relevant authorities.</p><p>The room was turned into a makeshift dorm, mattresses laid across the floor with drivers sharing beds, and the group being royally entertained by Elio de Angelis and Gilles Villeneuve on the piano. Stories from this episode are boundless, the feeling of camaraderie growing among the usually independent drivers. Only one man backed down – Teo Fabi, who was rumoured to have fled through a bathroom window – a move that hardly endeared him to the other drivers throughout the remainder of the season.</p><p>There were two main gripes with the super licences. Firstly, that each individual driver had to sign a contract stating that they would drive for a given team for a defined period of time, up to three years, thus preventing them from entering contract negotiations with other teams. And secondly, that they could no way speak in a way that would reflect badly on the governing body FISA.</p><p>Represented by Ferrari's Didier Pironi, with the returning Niki Lauda acting as group spokesman, the drivers were determined to stay strong throughout. The situation was looking desperate at various points, with teams actually looking into the option of bringing in other drivers to solve the problem, and the South African Grand Prix was in serious danger of being called off. With only Jochen Mass taking to the track for the practice session, a sense of farce descended over proceedings.</p><p>Eventually the drivers returned, given verbal assurances by FISA President Jean-Marie Balestre that they would not be punished for their misdemeanours. Unfortunately Balestre was not totally honest, his fury over events leading to fines ranging between $5,000-$10,000 and suspended bans varying from two to five races being imposed on the 29 men who stuck things out until the end. The row would rumble on and on.</p><h2>The cancellation</h2><p>Alain Prost won the South African Grand Prix on 23 January, but it would be almost two months before the next race of the season in Brazil. The scheduled follow-up to South Africa – the Argentinian Grand Prix on 7 March – never took place, as the championship lurched from one crisis to another.</p><p>The Argentinian Grand Prix was postponed after race organisers declared that various sponsors had backed out of the event due to the indecision caused by the drivers' strike in South Africa. With potential heavy losses, the Argentinian authorities simply could not afford to take any risks.</p><p>Eventually, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) Court of Appeal adjusted the super licence contract issues, and reduced the fines and suspended race sentences dished out after South Africa. The circus moved on to the Brazilian Grand Prix, but you may have guessed that the controversy did not end there.</p><h2>The disqualification</h2><p>After the hassle of South Africa and the postponement in Argentina, it appeared to be business as usual in Brazil. Nelson Piquet delighted home fans by winning the race in his Brabham, with the Williams driver Keke Rosberg in second place. In 1982 though, nothing could be taken for granted.</p><p>Renault and Ferrari immediately lodged a protest against Brabham and Williams, insisting that both drivers had raced in cars under the minimum legal weight. Another race – the US Grand Prix West at Long Beach, won by Lauda – had taken place before the appeal was heard by the FIA. When Piquet and Rosberg were disqualified, Prost was promoted to first place, thus taking an early lead in the championship, and in the process, opening up a whole new can of worms before the next race in San Marino.</p><h2>The boycott</h2><p>The disqualification of Piquet and Rosberg was one thing, but when a decision was taken by the FIA to adjust the weighing procedures of cars after a race, another messy situation developed in the already volatile world of F1.</p><p>Post-race weighing of cars had previously seen oil and coolant levels topped up before a reading was taken, but now the FIA seemed to be moving the goalposts. After Brazil, the FIA announced that cars would now be weighed before any liquids were added, greatly impacting on any team that used the ballast water tank for cooling brakes through the race (and refilled after finishing). The Britain-based Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA) were up in arms over this new development.</p><p>An emergency meeting was held, with FOCA decreeing that any teams based in Britain were to boycott the forthcoming Grand Prix at Imola. Although some teams (Tyrrell, Osella, ATS and Toleman) ignored this course of action, only 14 cars took part in the San Marino Grand Prix, with the Ferrari's of Villeneuve and Pironi unsurprisingly dominating after both Renaults had retired.</p><p>Even a race involving only 14 cars caused some rancour, however. Villeneuve and Pironi swapped positions at the head of the field five times, but after Pironi regained the lead on the final lap – apparently ignoring team orders to slow down – Villeneuve was furious, allegedly vowing never to speak to Pironi again. Which makes the subsequent disaster in Belgium even sadder.</p><h2>The tragedies</h2><p>Just two weeks after Imola, Villeneuve was killed during the closing stages of qualification for the Belgian Grand Prix. An accidental coming together with Mass' slow-moving March car saw Villeneuve's Ferrari catapulted into the sky, bodywork strewn in all directions, and Villeneuve thrown from the car.</p><p>Villeneuve was given the kiss of life and a heart massage by track marshalls, but after being helicoptered to Louvain hospital with severe neck and brain injuries, he passed away later that evening. Ferrari instantly withdrew from the race, and F1 mourned the loss of a popular and supremely talented driver.</p><p>Sadly this was not the only fatality during the 1982 season. Italian Riccardo Paletti, participating in only his second race, crashed into Pironi's stalled car at the start of the Canadian Grand Prix, and he later died due to massive internal haemorrhaging.</p><p>It was estimated that Paletti had been travelling at 120mph at the time of the collision, but before Pironi and race marshalls could get to the Osella, Paletti's car burst into flames. The fire was extinguished, but there was a delay of half an hour, until Paletti was cut free, and his death, coming so soon after that of Villeneuve, shook the sport further.</p><p>These were not the only safety incidents, however. After surviving a serious crash at the French Grand Prix in July, Mass was a lucky man to hobble away with minor burns, but such had been the impact of Villeneuve's death on the German, that he took his own accident as a sign that he needed to quit the sport. He would never race again in a F1 Grand Prix.</p><p>As ever in sport, the show went on, and it appeared as if Pironi would go on to claim the title. Yet in this troublesome year there would be one more incident which shaped the destiny of the championship.</p><p>During qualification for the German Grand Prix (in wet conditions), Pironi crashed into the back of Prost's Renault and was flung into the air. &quot;Suddenly I felt something hit me very hard in the back. Then I saw the red Ferrari flying over me. It was doing 140 miles an hour,&quot; said Prost.</p><p>The injuries to Pironi's legs were so hideous, that the first driver on the scene vomited at seeing the damage caused to the Ferrari driver. Doctors feared that Pironi would never walk again, and despite recovering after numerous operations, the German Grand Prix would be the last F1 race of his career.</p><p>The German Grand Prix is also remembered for <a href=\"http://that1980ssportsblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/sporting-punch-ups-of-1980s.html\" title=\"\">Nelson Piquet's infamous attack on Eliseo Salazar</a>. This was no ordinary season.</p><h2>The mayhem in Monaco</h2><p>The race after Villeneuve's death was in Monaco, unsurprisingly conducted under grey clouds, both metaphorically and in terms of the weather. For 73 of the 76 laps there had been little to write home about. And then pandemonium.</p><p>Alain Prost looked to be coasting to victory with just two laps to go, until the light rain showers that had hit the circuit started to have an impact. Prost spun out of the race, handing the lead to Riccardo Patrese, before he too appeared to throw away his chance at glory, sliding across a bend at Loews and stalling his Brabham.</p><p>The chaos continued. Pironi now took a turn to be race leader, but agonisingly his car developed an electrical fault on the last lap, ending his hopes. Andrea de Cesaris was briefly promoted to first place, only for his vehicle to run out of fuel. All eyes then turned to Ireland's Derek Daly, yet as the cameras cut to his Williams car grinding to a halt, confusion reigned.</p><p>In the mess, Patrese had been pushed back into a safe position by race marshalls, and had managed to bump start his car while moving downhill. On crossing the finishing line the Italian had no idea he had won his first Grand Prix, mistakenly thinking he was in second place. &quot;On the finishing lap everybody was waving flags and so on, while I was thinking I'd thrown it all away,&quot; said Patrese, who remained unaware of his win until he was ushered towards the podium.</p><p>Five different leaders in the last two laps; it's hardly surprising that Murray Walker described the race at the time as &quot;certainly the most eventful, exciting, momentous Grand Prix I have ever seen&quot;.</p><h2>The champion</h2><p>In Pironi's absence, the world title was up for grabs. With just four races left in the season, the table indicated just how close things were: Pironi 39 points, John Watson 30, Keke Rosberg 27, Prost 25, Lauda 24. In a crazy race for the title, even Pironi still had an outside chance.</p><p>Pironi was only knocked off top spot with two races to go. The man who finally took charge of the championship must at one point have wondered if he was ever destined to win a Grand Prix at all. Keke Rosberg's win in the Grand Prix of Switzerland – hosted in France due to Switzerland's laws on hosting motor racing – was a decisive moment in the season. It gave Rosberg his first ever Grand Prix win and the lead in the championship. After the dramatic events at the previous race in Austria, Rosberg's joy was twofold.</p><p>Rosberg had been denied his maiden win in Austria in one of the closest finishes of all time. With a lap remaining, the Lotus of Elio de Angelis led Rosberg's Williams by 1.64 seconds, but in a gripping finale, the Finn closed the gap, pushing desperately for an opening. De Angelis held on for his first Grand Prix win, beating Rosberg by 0.05 seconds and by just four feet.</p><p>The win in France ensured Rosberg's Austrian agony was quickly forgotten, and come the final race of the season in Las Vegas – the third Grand Prix to have been held in America in 1982 – the Finn needed just a point to secure the title. His fifth-place finish made Rosberg the 1982 world champion, even though he had only won one race during the season. Consistency was the key, although Pironi's career-ending crash was obviously a significant turning point.</p><p>Overall, the 1982 season was fairly unusual. No driver won more than two races, five men secured their maiden wins – Patrese, Patrick Tambay, de Angelis, Rosberg, and Michele Alboreto – with 11 different men winning the 16 races. From the strike shenanigans in South Africa to Rosberg claiming the title, it was a season touched by tragedy, clouded in controversy and enveloped in excitement.</p><p>It has been a delight researching this piece, finding out information on a season which was interesting from the beginning to the end. In fact, it has whetted my appetite so much for the sport that I may go to the loft and dust off my Scalectrix set...</p><p><strong>• This is an article from our </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/series/guardian-sport-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Sport Network</strong></a></p><p><strong>• This blog first appeared on </strong><a href=\"http://that1980ssportsblog.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>That 1980s Sports Blog</strong></a></p><p><strong>• Follow </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/1980sSportsBlog\" title=\"\"><strong>Steven Pye</strong></a><strong> on Twitter</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419896298|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|4fb3f42a7f4220951365ea6923d421248d12016a -->",

        "trailText":"Sebastian Vettel's hard-fought victory in the Japan Grand Prix put him on the verge of his fourth consecutive world championship",
        "headline":"Sebastian Vettel's Japan win earns glowing praise from Christian Horner",
        "body":"<p>Sebastian Vettel once again revelled in the glorious, precise curves of Suzuka, a circuit that favours risk with reward, whose dips and climbs offer elation and danger in equal measure, where errors are costly. The drivers know it. The drivers love it – not least Vettel, who has four wins from five visits here and a victory that has put him on the edge of claiming his&nbsp;fourth consecutive world championship.</p><p>The win, a hard-fought, tense and, in Vettel's and his team's case, clever race, was a thriller and a long way from the recent processions that have turned off so many fans.</p><p>Fernando Alonso finished fourth, which denied Vettel the title on the day, but the German goes to the next round in India knowing that he will be champion with a finish in the top five – almost a certainty, barring a failure.</p><p>It will put him on a par with the only two drivers to have won four world titles in a row – Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher. On the evidence of this race, a combination of speed and subtlety, it will be deserved.</p><p>Vettel and his team-mate Mark Webber were mugged off the start by the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, who quickly showed he had the measure of the track and led with skill. It meant Red Bull, accustomed to managing races from the front, had to think on their feet on this occasion.</p><p>Webber worked his tyres hard in the opening stint and had to come in on lap nine, too soon to make a two-stop strategy work, but Vettel had conserved his rubber, opening up the chance to make fewer stops and presenting the possibility of a showdown with his team-mate at the end of the race. It also left Grosjean struggling on the harder tyres, sandwiched between the two and unable to cover both options. Red Bull were playing chess with their drivers and Vettel's moves gave him checkmate.</p><p>Staying out for 23 laps on his second stint and eking out the last vestiges of grip from his tyres brought Vettel out behind Grosjean, also two-stopping, and the German overtook in a decisive move down the main straight. But when Webber exited from his final stop with fresh tyres he could not overtake the Frenchman until the penultimate lap, enough for a Red Bull one-two but too late to catch his team-mate.</p><p>The German had won, not with the sledgehammer of raw pace but with the scalpel of race craft, staying out longer in his stints on worn rubber and, despite several lock-ups, managing to control the gaps to his rivals to have the advantage at the end.</p><p>Red Bull's team principal, Christian Horner, said the race was \"one of the best races strategically we have ever operated\". That is praise indeed from the head of a team that has won the past three constructors' championships.</p><p>His driver concurred. \"I really tried to manage the gaps in the beginning of the stint and then close the gap, which worked brilliantly, especially with Romain,\" Vettel said. \"Great strategy. It obviously worked. We didn't lose patience early on and tried obviously to make the stints as long as&nbsp;possible to help us at the end of the race.\"</p><p>Horner, again, was generous in praise of Vettel, keen to stress that when the German takes his fourth title it will be because there is more to him than raw pace. \"He manages to adapt. He played the thinking game today; he watched and waited in that first stint, he preserved his tyres,\" Horner said. \"He knew he wasn't going to get priority in the first pit stop because we had discussed it before the race. But he was very smart in the way he handled the race and created the options.\"</p><p>It is a combination of seat-of-the-pants skills and driving intelligence that has seen Vettel put together five consecutive wins, with four races remaining this season. Jim Clark achieved a run of six, Schumacher of six and seven and Alberto Ascari seven (nine counted across 1952-1953). Vettel's form and the pace of his car suggest he could challenge their totals. Certainly Horner has not ruled it out.</p><p>\"Sebastian has won every race since the summer break,\" he said. \"There are still four to go and we will try to carry this momentum into the last four. We couldn't have imagined he would have this run of success but the way he is driving is quite supreme.\"</p><p>Yet Webber, too, was happy with the result in his last F1 appearance at Suzuka. It was his best finish since the British Grand Prix and, despite being frustrated as Grosjean held him off at the end, he was magnanimous towards the Frenchman whom last year he described as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/07/f1-sebastian-vettel-japanese-grand-prix\" title=\"\">\"first-lap nutcase\"</a> after he punted him off at the second corner. \"I think it's very clear that Romain has a very different mental approach to the job at the moment this year,\" Webber said. \"He's driven some quite strong races, putting together the whole weekend, which is a sign of a driver starting to get a bit more relaxed and confident.</p><p>\"You know, we're not here to blow smoke up his arse but in the end he's doing a very good job this year.\"</p><p>As for Alonso, the Spaniard knows \"it's only a matter of time before he [Vettel] will be champion\".</p><p>Alonso, who finished 45 seconds down, added: \"We have different goals now. We will continue to try to do our best on Sundays and, when it is mathematically settled, we will congratulate him.\"</p><p>As for Vettel, his pleasure at the win and admiration for the fans (whose numbers and warm embrace for everything about F1 is something many circuits can only dream of - needless to say there was, rightly, no booing) came through in his enthusiasm and his honesty on what has been a considerable journey to almost becoming a four-time world champion.</p><p>\"When I was small, I was dreaming about Formula One and honestly never thought that one day I would be able to test one of these cars,\" he said after the race. \"First time I tested the car I shit myself the first couple of laps and I thought, all right, that's for real men, not for me. Then I got used to it and obviously wanted to do more.\"</p><p>His rivals may wish he had stuck with the original assessment.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419834166|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|879aa4102dc30dc69a39340dd9eb524f32b376c9 -->",

Lorenzo finished third.</p><p>With three rounds to go and a maximum of 75 points up for grabs, rookie Márquez leads the riders' standings on 298 points, 43 clear of Lorenzo (255) with Pedrosa third on 244. Lorenzo told motogp.com: \"I enjoyed the battle [with Marquez] because it was good fun and went on for a while. I'm happy with the podium because a podium is a podium, but I'm slightly disappointed too because I wanted to beat Dani and if possible win the race.</p><p>\"Today in the heat we were not competitive enough. At the beginning like always we were not so bad but once the rear tyre dropped we weren't strong enough on braking and the other guys recovered so much ground.</p><p>\"In the middle of the race we also started to lose out on acceleration too. Third place was the best result possible and we did everything we could.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419825914|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|e1779284dcef4ab19a8a6e37d6da2b188c5f03f9 -->",

        "body":"<p>A fifth consecutive win for Sebastian Vettel – the first time he has achieved such a feat – was not quite enough to secure the world championship here in Suzuka. </p><p>It was, however, a fine drive, won on strategy, that remained close to the dying laps. To take the title he required his nearest rival, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, to finish ninth or lower but the Spaniard, who had started from eighth on the grid followed Mark Webber and Romain Grosjean home in fourth. Indeed it was Grosjean who matched his best finish of the season here in third, and Webber who kept the action alive until the end. </p><p>Grosjean had taken the lead from fourth on the grid going up the inside of Vettel and Webber, who had poor starts, and powering down the hill into turn one. Lewis Hamilton had also started well, darting between the Red Bulls, but he took a right rear puncture from Vettel's front wing. Although he pitted the same lap, he was then forced to retire after returning to the track seconds off the pace due to a loss of aero perfomance. </p><p>Grosjean, meanwhile held the lead from the two Red Bulls with both dropping back to avoid running in the dirty air of the cars in front. Webber was the first of the leaders to pit on lap 12, and he was followed a lap later by Grosjean. Vettel stayed out until lap 15, taking a very quick 2.5 seconds in his box.</p><p>After the stops panned out Grosjean had maintained a 1.8sec gap to Webber and a further 3.24sec to Vettel, while behind them an engrossing scrap was developing. </p><p>Daniel Ricciardo went long having started on hard tyres, and held up Nico Hulkenberg, Felipe Massa, Alonso, Esteban Gutiérrez and Kimi Raikkonen. Alonso and Hulkenberg made the most of it with the latter punching well above his much-discussed weight in the Sauber. </p><p>Out front, through the second set of stops it became clear Vettel and Grosjean were looking to two-stop against Webber's three and after Webber came in for his second, Vettel immediately pushed up to Grosjean, knocking the gap down to 1.3sec. Grosjean was in on lap 30 but Vettel worked his rubber superbly staying out until lap 37. </p><p>It was 22 laps after his first stop and left him 16 to run to the end and he exited just over three seconds behind Grosjean. With Webber taking a three-stopper at that point he had the lead by 13.9sec from Grosjean with Vettel 2.1sec back on that. </p><p>Vettel was gambling on having enough left in his tyres to hold off Webber who would be on a charge at the end. The German had closed on Grosjean – crucial to having some rubber left for the finish was not running in the dirty air of the Lotus  – and he duly swept past on the straight, completing the move before turn one. </p><p>By lap 43 Webber had a 14.5sec lead over Vettel and he promptly came in for his final stop, fitted new medium option tyres, the faster of the two looking for a sprint to the finish. </p><p>He would not quite make it. A second a lap quicker than Vettel with eight laps remaining and 6.8sec behind, he went for the pass on Grosjean but the Frenchman moved over and Webber ultimately did not make it through until the penultimate lap. That was too late to catch the likely world champion. Vettel and his team had called the strategy perfectly and even after a poor start he took the flag 7.1sec ahead of his team-mate. Vettel can secure the title with a top-five finish at the next race in India but will also take it if Alonso scores no more than 10 points more than him.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419824247|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|1cb2eeac179a58a5057c1dceb10f8ef8456f1012 -->",

        "headline":"Jake Humphrey: 'I Google myself about once a week'",
        "body":"<p><strong>You represent a new generation of sports presenters. Are you expected to be more tech-savvy?</strong></p><p>A lot of people were uneasy when I became the new F1 presenter, and I think technology saved me there, because I was able to use it to bring the audience closer to the race. I wrote a detailed blog of everything I did, which was my way of saying: &quot;I'm lucky to have this job; let me take you with me.&quot;</p><p></p><p><strong>How often do you Google yourself?</strong></p><p>Probably once a week. I don't trust presenters who claim to ignore what people say about them – it's their job to provide a service for the viewers at home; they're not there for their own titillation.</p><p><strong>Could F1 become too technologically advanced?</strong></p><p>If you try to stop F1 from pushing the boundaries of technology, you will kill the sport. F1 is the Nasa of the car world: they invented modern seatbelts and energy-saving brakes. And not only in motoring: the technology developed by F1 teams to monitor racing performance is now being used to monitor patients in hospital.</p><p></p><p><strong>Which is the most advanced studio, BBC Sport, Sky Sports or BT Sport?</strong></p><p>It's BT, hands-down; they have the largest L-shaped studio in the world and a glass floor that can light up to simulate any part of any sports pitch. That race is never over, though.</p><p></p><p><strong>What's the most expensive piece of technology you own?</strong></p><p>The multi-room audio in my house, which I love. I can play a lullaby in [my daughter] Florence's bedroom and Snoop Dogg in the kitchen at the same time. I just have to make sure I don't get it the wrong way round.</p><p><strong>What social media do you use?</strong></p><p>Twitter. It's a good way of being better at my job, because I can find out what people want and ask the questions people want answered.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is technology isolating or connecting?</strong></p><p>It can be both. During my time presenting F1 I saw my wife more over Skype than in the flesh, so in a way technology saved our relationship, but Skype almost makes you long for human contact even more.</p><p></p><p><strong>Alarm clock or mobile phone?</strong></p><p>I wake up, snooze my alarm, check my emails and have a little look at Twitter, all on my phone in the space of two minutes. It's probably the most unhealthy thing for the human brain to do, but that's the way it is.</p><p></p><p><strong>You have a five month-old daughter. Do you use any new parenting technology?</strong></p><p>There are apps to help you with everything from conception to breastfeeding. Florence's nickname is Raspberry, because at one point during pregnancy my wife's app told her: &quot;At this stage your baby is the size of a raspberry.&quot;</p><p></p><p><strong>What's your favourite ever computer game?</strong></p><p><em>Championship Manager</em>. When I was a bachelor, I'd fall asleep playing it, then wake up at 2am to check how my team was doing.</p><p><strong>Do you keep your phone on the table at dinner?</strong></p><p>I would if I were allowed to.</p><p></p><p><strong>When Google Glass is released, what would you like it to do?</strong></p><p>I don't like the look of Google Glass, but if it brought a new perspective to broadcasting maybe I'd change my mind. We could convince John Terry to wear one before a match, coming out of the tunnel and warming up. That would be a great new insight.</p><p></p><p><strong>Three favourite websites?</strong></p><p>BBC Sport, Wikipedia and Hotmail. I haven't moved on. </p><p><strong>If you had to use a biometric security system (fingerprint recognition, retinal scanners etc.) which would it be?</strong></p><p>What's wrong with a good old four-digit code?</p><p></p><p><strong>What if it gets hacked?</strong></p><p>What if your finger gets hacked off?</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>What's your favourite app?</strong></p><p>I have one that checks my heart rate. If you're a hypochondriac, technology is very bad. You'll find a little lump on your kneecap. Then you'll check the internet and find out it's terminal cancer, so you lie awake all night and in the morning you remember you had too much to drink and bumped into a table.</p><p></p><p><strong>How important is technology to sport?</strong></p><p>It's vital, but the human element will always be where the interest comes from. You and I can't relate to a new 1.6 litre V6 turbocharged F1 engine. The wonderful thing about sport is that, fundamentally, it's completely technology-less.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418976612|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|a01e0e4e81ecd4eff4e8d2aa75f0421db2fc9197 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ford's Mark Winterbottom has won his maiden Bathurst 1000 title after a dramatic finish on Mount Panorama on Sunday.</p><p>He held out V8 Supercars series leader and defending champion Jamie Whincup while a fast finishing Craig Lowndes celebrated his 20th Bathurst and 500th career start with third. Remarkably Winterbottom had never podiumed in 10 Bathurst starts before the 2013 race.</p><p>It also marked the first Bathurst triumph for factory backed Ford Performance Racing (FPR), boosting the Blue Oval's overall Mount Panorama tally to 20 wins.<br />The victory came a day after Ford ended speculation and confirmed they would support FPR again next year despite announcing in May they would cease manufacturing in Australia and retire the Falcon by 2016.</p><p>The stirring win by Winterbottom – partnered by Steven Richards – almost made up for the devastation of 2007 when he led with 10 laps left only to slide off the track, a moment Winterbottom rated \"one of the lows of my career\".</p><p>Besides Winterbottom's drought, the win also ended FPR's frustration on the mountain. Despite starting on the front row in six of the last seven Bathursts – including three pole positions – the team had not been able to podium let alone win. FPR's last podium was in 2004.</p><p>Winterbottom had to earn it, holding out desperate four-time winner Whincup – partnered by Paul Dumbrell – in a final sprint to the line in wet, blustery conditions.</p><p>Whincup's Holden team-mate – five-time champion Lowndes who was partnered by Warren Luff – was third in his 20th Bathurst and 500th career race start.<br />Winterbottom eventually held out Whincup by 0.47 of a second, the fifth year in a row that less than a second separated the top two.</p><p>The stage was set for an intense sprint finish when Winterbottom snuck in front of Whincup to effectively take the race lead when he emerged from the pits after 138 laps with both having had their mandatory seven stops.</p><p>All eyes were justifiably on the pair after their spectacular qualifying duel on Saturday, narrowly won by the series leader.</p><p>But a barnstorming finish by Lowndes and Garth Tander threatened to steal the show, tearing around the course at one stage a second faster than race leader Winterbottom despite falling rain.</p><p>Finishing with a wet sail, Lowndes set the race's fastest lap in lap 145 only for Tander to snap it two laps later.</p><p>Holden veteran Jason Bright tried desperately to hold them out in third spot, but in a remarkable move both passed him with three laps to go.</p><p>Every car had to have seven mandatory pit stops during the race to cater for newcomer Nissan and Mercedes' fuel economy issues.</p><p>It ensured the lead changed hands throughout the race - and at one stage Holden's international import Mattias Ekstrom held it despite arriving at Bathurst without driving a V8 Supercar before.</p><p>There were only two safety cars after Todd Kelly's Nissan hit a kangaroo on lap 20 and Holden veteran Greg Murphy crashed into the wall at 135kph on No86 in a major blow to his co-driver James Courtney's title hopes.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419817417|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|088e989eb689881c6472904f201cd59fe465f6af -->",

Plans drawn up for the event, due to be unveiled on Thursday night, suggest it would be watched by 120,000 people in grandstands along a three-mile route and attract a global television audience in the tens of millions, generating as much as £100m for London's economy.</p><p>Ecclestone said the popularity of the event meant it would pay for itself. \"With the way things are, maybe we would front it and put the money up for it. If we got the OK and everything was fine, I think we could do that,\" he told the Times. \"Think what it would do for tourism. It would be fantastic, good for London, good for England – a lot better than the Olympics.\"</p><p>The plans come at a time when governments around the world are queuing up to buy the rights to stage a grand prix for up to £30m per race.</p><p>Global design practice Populous study has examined the feasibility of staging a London Grand Prix. Assistant principal John Rhodes told the Times the event would not cause major disruption, taking five days to set up equipment and three to dismantle it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/392287954|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|a8b02d61a79aa7bc7f5775b96430e2a61aa586df -->",

        "body":"<p>Human rights activists fear further bloodshed and a violent crackdown by authorities in Bahrain after race organisers gave the green light to next weekend's Formula One grand prix in the troubled Gulf kingdom.</p><p>As the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) said it was satisfied that all proper security measures were in place for the race on 22 April, Nabeel Rajab, from the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), said: \"I'm afraid we might see local people who will be killed in the coming days because of the F1.\"</p><p>Anti-government protesters have called for the event to be cancelled, arguing that it lends legitimacy to a regime which continues to perpetrate human rights abuses.</p><p>The FIA, the sport's governing authority, confirmed  that it would go ahead, with beefed-up security, after receiving reassurances.</p><p>John Yates, the former assistant commissioner of the Met who is in Bahrain advising on police reform, wrote to the FIA president, Jean Todt, to say he felt safer living in Bahrain \"than I have often felt in London\".</p><p>Bernie Ecclestone, 81, the F1 supremo, speaking at the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, said of Bahrain: \"I know people who live there, and it's all very quiet and peaceful.\"</p><p>The comments provoked a storm on social media sites as local activists said there were fears of a clampdown on protesters to prevent disruption to the event.</p><p>Pictures emerged of Ecclestone's image being burned in Bahrain posted on a Facebook page called \"Pearl Family Circle – Martyrs' Square\".</p><p>Protests by members of the majority Shia against the Sunni government of the Al-Khalifa royal family take place on an almost daily basis, mostly confined to villages away from the capital where groups have clashed with police using water cannon, teargas, stun grenades and plastic bullets.</p><p>Activists say there have been more than 70 deaths, 20 from teargas suffocation, since February 2011, when the Bahrain uprising began, with an estimated 600 \"political prisoners\" currently detained.</p><p>Civil unrest has escalated in recent weeks, in part due to concerns for the health of imprisoned activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, now 65 days into a hunger strike, being held in a military hospital.</p><p>On Monday, seven policemen were wounded by a homemade bomb outside the capital in what the interior ministry called an \"act of terrorism\", and an explosion in Manama on Thursday night damaged two cars.</p><p>The funeral of Ahmed Ismaeel, 22, described as a citizen journalist by activists, who was shot by a drive-by gunman, was reportedly attended by thousands.</p><p>A planned protest outside the British embassy today by a group calling itself the February 14 Youth Coalition, named after the date of the beginning of the uprising, may also raise tensions.</p><p>A BCHR report said an average of 15 villages were teargassed as collective punishment every night as the Shia majority continue to oppose the Sunni monarchy and call for the implementation of reforms</p><p>\"We are very concerned for our safety. The FIA have got security companies and bullet-proof cars for their drivers and F1 teams,\" said Dr Ala'a Shehabi, a British-born Bahraini academic and activist. \"Who's going to be protecting the Bahrainis who are going to be locked up in their villages, and prevented from protesting, given that they are going to be extremely angry and provoked by the F1?</p><p>\"There's going to be popping champagne corks, live concerts and parties, in the middle of the island, which is a huge provocation to the families of victims who have been killed, and those of hundreds of political prisoners.\"</p><p>She said the comments by Yates had made people very angry. \"To say everything is fine and dandy. Of course it is. The guy's living in his compound, earning a salary that's more than he ever used to dream of in the UK, loving the weather and thinking: 'This is great, why are people even on the streets protesting?\"</p><p>\"And I'm even more surprised at Ecclestone's remark. Because I've spoken to him. He knows about my own personal case, and how my husband was tortured, ambushed, kidnapped, subjected to a military trial and in jail for 10 months.\"</p><p>The BCHR said it had received reports of injuries caused by birdshot allegedly fired by police in villages on Thursday night. \"All the villages in Bahrain last night were turbulent. They are protesting against the F1, and the government wants to hide that from the media,\" said Rajab. \"That's the reality of Bahrain now.\"</p><p>The Guardian was unable to verify Rajab's claims.</p><p>There have been reprisals by groups loyal to the ruling royal family. A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IRrsOdhrssc#!\" title=\"\">video posted on YouTube</a> purports to show Bahraini police officers doing nothing as a Shia-owned supermarket was looted  earlier this week, and was condemned by the human rights group Bahrainwatch as demonstrating \"the continuing culture of impunity among the country's security forces, despite claims of reform by the government\".</p><p>Amnesty International, in advance of the publication on Tuesday of its report \"Flawed Reforms, Bahrain fails to achive justice for protesters\", said: \"Holding the grand prix in Bahrain in 2012 risks being interpreted by the government of Bahrain as symbolising a return to business as usual.</p><p>\"The international community must not turn a blind eye to the ongoing human rights crisis in the country.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/388678455|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|2ff3eed6177b5de947872ee3d92525a49477476d -->",

        "headline":"Chris Lawrence obituary",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.lawrence-tune.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chris Lawrence</a>, who has died of cancer aged 78, was a development engineer and racing driver who won more than 100 races. His prowess as a tuner of engines helped revive the fortunes of the Morgan sports car in 1962, when his famous Plus 4 racer won its class in the Le Mans 24-hour race at an average speed of 94mph. He masterminded Morgan's return to Le Mans in 2002 and 2004 with the Aero 8 sports car, his last major project.</p><p>Born in Slough, Berkshire, Chris was the only child of William Lawrence and Joan Sanderson. He inherited an affinity for golf and motorcycles from his father. A naval tradition within the family dictated that he went to the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, Devon, aged 17, and he gained a degree in engineering on HMS Thunderer.</p><p>He had already progressed from motorcycles to his first Morgan, a three-wheeler with no reverse gear that he persuaded his mother to buy for him. In 1952, Chris competed in his first event, in an elderly 750cc MG special. On leaving the navy, he moved on to a works trial MG that he assembled from parts. Later this morphed into the Rotacks MG on a new chassis, built in a cellar in Swiss Cottage, north-west London. When it became obvious that it was too big to emerge from the cellar in one piece, it had to be disassembled and rebuilt in the street. This glass-fibre-bodied MG special made more demands on Chris's driving and his burgeoning engineering ingenuity, but was not sufficiently competitive to get him a win.</p><p>The turning point was the acquisition, in 1958, of a used Morgan Plus 4, registered TOK 258, for £650. Teaching himself the theory and practice of camshaft profiles, combustion chamber design and \"squish\" area, Chris gradually increased the power output of the Morgan's humble two-litre Triumph TR2 engine (originally designed for the Ferguson tractor) from 95bhp to 156bhp. It was in this form that it won the two-litre class at Le Mans in 1962 as an official Morgan factory entry.</p><p>By then Chris had formed Lawrence Tune, based in Acton, west London, where he built his own Deep Sanderson cars – which raced at Le Mans in 1963 and 1968 – and tuned Triumph engines for customers. He raced in Britain and Europe most weekends. There was a brief foray into Formula 1 in the new three-litre formula in 1966 with a Ferrari-engined Cooper and a twin Mini-engined Deep Sanderson, but it was the Monica project, an exotic luxury saloon car built for a French industrialist, Jean Tastevin, that would come to define the second half of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s for Chris.</p><p>Chris designed the entire car, which was named after the patron's wife, Monique. The convoluted development process generated 25 prototypes as the Monica's luxury ambitions and weight increased. Chris, creating the car with his team in a large railway arch in Chiswick, made frequent trips to France, squabbling with Tastevin's French engineers as tensions grew about the Monica being \"too English\".</p><p>The finished Monica of 1974 was a graceful, refined and sophisticated 150mph vehicle and a remarkable effort for a man who had very little experience of luxury road cars. Its only true shortcoming was mistiming; in the wake of the oil crisis, the market for thirsty, expensive cars had collapsed; in the end, only 10 true Monica production cars were built in France. Bernie Ecclestone, then a car dealer, bought the last three at less than half-price.</p><p>Chris escaped the economic gloom of mid-70s Britain for California, where he set up Lawrence Tune West, preparing English classic sports cars for historic racing events. The California adventure lasted 15 years. In his autobiography, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/unclassified/9781900113045/morgan-maverick\" title=\"\">Morgan Maverick</a> (2008), he was candid about the colourful deals and unhappy customers he left behind as a result of the collapse of the old car market and his own sometimes poor business sense.</p><p>Back in the UK, in the early 90s, he began working for the Wiltshire sports car firm Marcos, and managed and engineered an assault on Le Mans in 1995 with a team of LM600 cars before taking a job with Morgan. He regarded the development of the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1971479,00.html\" title=\"\">Aero 8 Morgan</a> as the greatest achievement of his engineering life and was creating a second Le Mans version of the car for 2004 when he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2003. He settled down to retirement in Herefordshire the following year and swapped the Aero 8 that Charles Morgan, the company's managing director, had given to him as a retirement present for a brown Monica registered KUM 999.</p><p>It was at around this time that I first got to know Chris. Although a seemingly curt and blustery character, he was extremely kind and helpful, and more than happy to find some rare parts for my Monica through his many French contacts. His achievements were recognised at a tribute day at Goodwood Motor Circuit in 2005.</p><p>Chris is survived by his third wife, Carrie, and two sons, Gordon and Steve, from his first marriage. A daughter, Joanna, predeceased him.</p><p>• Christopher John Lawrence, racing driver and car designer, born 27 July 1933; died 13 August 2011</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/379181346|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|e7b1399c555d617f6ea8dc9ab33b3a0594b1f501 -->",

        "headline":"Bill Boddy obituary",
        "body":"<p>William Boddy, who has died aged 98, was the editor of <a href=\"http://www.motorsportmagazine.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Motor Sport</a> magazine from 1936 to 1991. His career spanned 81 years in total; he wrote his first piece for Motor Sport in 1930 and filed his final column for the magazine a week before he died, still working on a typewriter and making copious handwritten corrections to his copy.</p><p>Boddy – known as Bill, or as \"WB\" to generations of devoted readers – was possibly the longest-serving working journalist in Britain, and probably the most important single figure in the development of the vintage and classic car movement in Britain. He championed the cause of older vehicles through Motor Sport's pages when few seemed to be interested during the new car boom of the 1950s and 60s.</p><p>Boddy loved Brooklands in Weybridge, Surrey, the world's first purpose-built motor-racing circuit, which he first visited as a boy in 1926. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of its history that was unsurpassed. His first article for Motor Sport was on the history of the circuit and he later wrote the definitive book on the subject. As early as 1934, he organised an event there for historic Edwardian racers. When the track was declared an industrial area in 1946, Boddy formed the <a href=\"http://www.brooklands.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Brooklands Society</a>, which helped ensure that original buildings and the surviving parts of the track became listed.</p><p>Boddy was born in London. His father was killed in the first world war. On childhood holidays in Wales he had the opportunity to ride in limousines belonging to a wealthy relative, promoting his interest in motoring. He always loved facts and details and as a schoolboy in the 20s wrote endlessly to the motoring periodicals of the time pointing out mistakes. He even managed to get himself, aged 14, a 100mph demonstration ride in a new Mercedes. His first editorial position – after a brief stint as an assistant in a motorcycle shop – was on Brooklands Track and Air magazine, for which he wrote road tests, despite not yet having a driving licence: he wrote the tests by observing the cars' responses from the passenger seat.</p><p>After going freelance in the mid-30s, Boddy did most of his work for Motor Sport, a 10-year-old title that was rapidly going bankrupt. He was owed so much money when the magazine was taken over by the eccentric Wesley J Tee in 1936 that the new publisher promised to make the 23-year-old editor as long as he kept away from the creditors' meeting. Usually on the end of a telephone, Boddy somehow managed to keep the title going in his spare time throughout the second world war while working in the RAF, despite the fact that there was no motor racing or new cars to report on.</p><p>In the 50s and 60s, Boddy built up Motor Sport, with its distinctive green front cover, into an influential title despite having no particular plan. \"I  just thought I'd write about anything  that interested me,\" he explained \"Readers seemed to like it.\" The tradition of using only initials rather than authors' bylines was maintained on the insistence of Tee, who owned the title until his death in 1996.</p><p>Decades before there were dedicated classic car magazines, Motor Sport was a monthly bible for enthusiasts, stuffed with adverts for ageing exotica that could be bought for a few hundred pounds. But it was also the most influential magazine of its type in Europe, and the place to read about motor racing and new cars. Boddy wrote extremely frank road tests of the latest models that sometimes got him into trouble with several manufacturers. He also covered general motoring issues, most memorably campaigning against the introduction of the 70mph national speed limit in the 1960s. He was not afraid of unpopular causes and was a lone but prophetic voice championing the cause of the VW Beetle amid the anti-German atmosphere of the 50s.</p><p>Boddy went on 39 London-to-Brighton veteran car runs; helped form the <a href=\"http://www.750motorclubbrooklands.org.uk/\" title=\"\">750 Motor Club</a>, promoting low-cost motor sport for Austin Seven drivers; was a founder member of the <a href=\"http://www.vscc.co.uk/vsccweb/\" title=\"\">Vintage Sports-Car Club</a>; and promoted the 500cc racing movement, a low-budget form of motor sport which lead to Britain's domination of Formula 1. He was appointed MBE for services to sports journalism in 1997.</p><p>He married Winifred Holbrook in 1944. She died in 1998. Their three daughters survive him.</p><p>• William Charles Boddy, journalist, born 22 February 1913; died 7 July 2011</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/378125666|2013-10-17T12:53:01Z|f770652037f61f7dc25a7937e970ad6198e7d087 -->",

But we have zero points and it will be a long season.\"</p><p>There was a gasp of amazement in Albert Park as world champion Vettel, who had been fastest in Q1 and Q2, then dominated Q3 with a run which was 0.8 seconds faster than second placed Lewis Hamilton. And Vettel didn't even use reintroduced Kers system, which might have cut another half second to his time.</p><p>\"I was surprised by how well the tyres worked today - I had a good feeling with them,\" he said, modestly. But despite the German's domination there was still good news for Hamilton, who split the Red Bulls of Vettel and local hero Mark Webber to secure a front row place.</p><p>After looking hopelessly off the pace in testing in Barcelona earlier this month it was an heroic drive by the McLaren driver. His team-mate Jenson Button was fourth, ahead of Fernando Alonso, with the Lotus Renault of Vitaly Petrov sixth. But there was also room for the smaller teams in Q3, with Kamui Kobayashi (Sauber) and Sebastien Buemi making it into the top 10.</p><p>Hamilton said afterwards: \"It's been a fantastic, superb effort by the team and there has been a huge improvement in the car. I never said it was a bad car but there was an issue with downforce.\"</p><p>But Vettel was the drive they were all talking about in Melbourne. Last year he won the world championship, to become the youngest ever driver, despite bad lack and a few errors made out of a lack of experience.</p><p>With more experience and a more reliable car he could prove unstoppable. But judging by the way he drove yesterday Hamilton just isn't in the mood to let that happen.

        "headline":"Surgeons fight to save the hand of Formula One star Robert Kubica",
        "body":"<p>The career of one of the most promising young Formula One drivers was hanging in the balance tonight after an accident in a low-key rally in Italy left him badly injured and having surgery to try to save the use of his right hand.</p><p>Robert Kubica, 26, who drives for the Renault team, was competing in a Skoda Fabia on the Ronde di Andora when he suffered a high-speed crash into a church wall and then a barrier shortly after the start. It took rescue crews more than an hour to extract Kubica from the wreckage. Unconfirmed reports from the scene suggest that part of the barrier speared through the car's footwell into the cockpit.</p><p>The Pole, who is a national hero in his homeland, suffered multiple fractures to his right leg, arm and hand. He was airlifted from the crash site in the village of Testico to the Santa Corona hospital in Pietra Ligure on the Mediterranean coast where he underwent lengthy surgery.</p><p>The main area of concern is the driver's right hand, which, although safe from amputation, is severely damaged and it is too early for doctors to give a prognosis on a full recovery. It is the same arm that was badly injured in a road accident in 2003 and left him with titanium bolts to support the shattered bones.</p><p>Kubica's manager, Daniele Morelli, said last night: \"The surgeons are trying to restore the functionality of the right hand. They must now think about the muscle function, but Robert has a very strong temper and will succeed.\" The Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport reported that more surgery will be required after today's preliminary operation.</p><p>Kubica, who was due to start his fifth full season in Formula One in Bahrain next month, set the fastest time in testing last week and grand prix insiders regard him as one of the sport's supreme talents and a future world champion who could have earned anything up to $100m from his career as a driver. He made his debut for the BMW Sauber team in 2006 after eye-catching victories in the junior formulas, the traditional testing ground for emerging talent.</p><p>He hit the headlines in 2007 when he emerged almost unscathed from a terrifying high-speed crash in Montreal that was a testament to the strength of the modern Formula One car. A year later, and at the same track, he won his first, and so far only, grand prix. When BMW withdrew from Formula One at the end of 2009, unable to justify the cost after a dreadful season,  Kubica signed for the Renault team and achieved some strong results, including second in Australia and third at Monaco, considered the greatest test of a driver's skill.</p><p>The feeling was that this would be the year Kubica would take on the sport's elite on the track and would soon be able to match them in the earnings stakes. In the ultra-secret world of Formula One finance hard figures are difficult to come by but Renault are believed to paying Kubica $10m a year until 2012, with Fernando Alonso earning four times that much at Ferrari.</p><p>Modern Formula One drivers' contracts usually forbid them from taking part in \"high-risk\" activities for fear of injury but the drivers are famed for seeking adrenaline rushes away from the track and Kubica is far from the first driver to put his career – and life – in jeopardy pursuing high-risk hobbies.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Renault team, which is based in Enstone in Oxfordshire, would not comment on whether Kubica had sought permission to compete in the rally although he has taken part in club rallies for several years. It is thought the car he crashed today, a powerful model that competes in international events, was one he purchased two years ago.</p><p>In the first three decades of the Formula One world championship, which began in 1950, drivers regularly competed in various brands of motor sport when they were not competing in grands prix. Top drivers such as Stirling Moss, Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart travelled the world to race in anything that might take them to a win.</p><p>Since the 1970s Formula One drivers are very much that, only occasionally skiing or mountain-biking in the off-season to keep fit and satisfy their need for speed and even that has proved hazardous. Two years ago the Australian driver Mark Webber broke a leg when he was hit by a 4x4 while taking part in a bike race.</p><p>Tonight fellow drivers offered their support to the popular Kubica.</p><p>Britain's former world champion Jenson Button, who drives for McLaren said on his Twitter page: \"Shocking news about Robert Kubica. I wish him a speedy recovery.\"</p><p>Williams driver Rubens Barrichello tweeted: \"I would like to ask you for your best wishes to Kubica. He is being operated right now. We all like him and he deserves all the best.\"</p><p>Sebastian Buemi of Toro Rosso said: \"All my support to Robert Kubica. I am with you man.\"They will also be very aware that just as Robert Kubica was about to join the elite of formula one, his career may well have been snatched away from him by his desire to take part in one of the most basic forms of the sport.</p><h2><strong>The need for speed: previous accidents involving F1 drivers</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Mark Webber </strong></p><p>Breaks a leg when hit by a car mountain-biking in Tasmania before the 2009 season. Drives with steel rods in his leg. In 2010 goes over the handlebars on a training ride and fractures shoulder one week before the Japanese grand prix</p><p><strong>Juan Pablo Montoya</strong></p><p>Missed two races for McLaren in 2005 after injuring a shoulder \"playing tennis\". Stories that the damage was done when he fell off a motorbike engulf the paddock and McLaren are not amused</p><p><strong>Michael Schumacher</strong></p><p>Potential comeback with Ferrari in 2009 is aborted when neck injury caused by a motorcycle accident can't take the strain</p><p><strong>Patrick Depailler</strong></p><p>Misses the last eight races of the 1979 season – and a shot at the world title – after breaking his legs in a hang-gliding crash. The Ligier team dispense with his services. He joins Alfa Romeo but is killed in a crash at Hockenheim in 1980 during a private testing session</p><p><strong>Didier Pironi</strong></p><p>Survives career-ending crash in practice for the 1982 German grand prix.
