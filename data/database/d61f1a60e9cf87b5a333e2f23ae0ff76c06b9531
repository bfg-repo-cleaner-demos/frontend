        "headline":"John Major 'shocked' at privately educated elite's hold on power",
        "body":"<p>Sir John Major has expressed his shock at the way in which every sphere of modern public life is dominated by a private school-educated elite and well-heeled middle class. He also suggested interest rates should go back to \"normal levels of 3% to 5 %\" as one way of helping pensioners deal with the recent squeeze on earnings.</p><p></p><p>The former prime minister has been warning for months about the threat of so-called net curtain poverty, and claimed the government needed to do more to address the quiet poverty gripping the responsible middle class. He blamed the slowdown in social mobility on Labour policies, including the abolition of grammar schools.</p><p></p><p>In a speech in Norfolk on Friday, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10439303/Truly-shocking-that-the-private-school-educated-and-affluent-middle-class-still-run-Britain-says-Sir-John-Major.html\" title=\"\">reported on Monday by the Daily Telegraph</a>, he claimed that pensioners' savings were being squeezed by a mix of inflation and low interest rates.</p><p></p><p>Major – who went to a grammar school in south London and left with three O-levels – said: \"In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class. To me from my background, I find that truly shocking.\"</p><p></p><p>He blamed this \"collapse in social mobility\" on Labour, claiming that despite Ed Miliband's \"absurd mantra to be the one-nation party, they left a Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration\".</p><p></p><p>Major said: \"I remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost</p><p></p><p>\"Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born, not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born. \"We need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. And it isn't going to happen magically.\"</p><p></p><p>The Commission on Child Poverty and Social Mobility, chaired by Alan Milburn, the former Labour cabinet minister, has found no evidence that social mobility slowed due to Labour policies.</p><p></p><p>The coalition will argue that its pupil premium is aimed specifically  at poorer children and designed to help them achieve higher results than the better resourced middle class. It will also point to free childcare aimed at the poorer two-year-olds.</p><p></p><p>Major also said the government should help pensioners who had saved carefully for their retirement and were being punished by \"cripplingly unfair\" low interest rates. He suggested the Bank of England ought to return interest rates to \"normal levels, say 3% to 5%\", so that society treated \"the saver as fairly as it treats the debtor\".</p><p>Critics will point out that pensioners have been relatively immune from spending cuts, partly due to the triple lock on the value of pensions.</p><p></p><p>There is, however, cross-party concern  about the potential impact of rising interest rates on household debt.</p><p></p><p>At the weekend the Tory MP Mark Garnier told the BBC: \"The important point, I think, is that we have to remember that we're in a period of super-low interest rates: this is not normal, this is the lowest interest rates have been for 300 years.</p><p>\"And actually when we go back to a normal period of low interest rates – so if they rise by 2%-3%, which is perfectly reasonable even before the three years target that [the Bank of England governor] Mark Carney has set – it's going to have a really dramatic effect on quite a number of households that are already suffering a bit of forebearance on their mortgages.\"</p><p></p><p>The thinktank the Resolution Foundation recently warned: \"The number of families in Britain with perilous levels of debt repayments could more than double to 1.2 million if interest rates rise faster than expected in the next four years and household income growth is weak and uneven.\" Current market expectations are for interest rates to reach 1.9% by mid-2017.</p><p></p><p>Major said the Conservative leadership should pull their punches on the UK Independence party (Ukip), saying many of its supporters were \"patriotic Britons who fear their country is changing\", and would ultimately come back to the Tory party.</p><p></p><p>Turning to the Conservatives' prospects for the 2015 general election, the former prime minister said that if the party decided to \"shrink into our comfort zone we will not win general elections – the core vote cannot deliver a general election majority\".</p><p></p><p>Party members were right to feel unsettled by \"bewildering\" changes such as the coalition's decision to legalise same-sex marriage, he said.</p><p></p><p>\"Social mores have moved on from the way in which we were brought up, with the values that we had. They have moved and changed,\" Major added. \"And that is why issues such as gay marriage have proved so toxic for the Conservative party.</p><p></p><p>\"Because for many Conservatives, people who are conservative because their instinct is to conserve, to change slowly and only when you know it is certain for the better, that is classically Conservative.</p><p></p><p>\"For people like that who form the bulk of our party and a great deal of our country too, these are difficult issues, these bewildering social changes, and mostly it is my generation and older who are unsettled by these changes.</p><p></p><p>\"We may be unsettled by them, but David Cameron and his colleagues have no choice but to deal with this new world. They cannot, Canute-like, order it to go away, because it won't.\"</p><p></p><p>Major called for loyalty from party members, saying: \"Public criticism is destructive. Take it from me. Political parties who are divided and torn simply do not win general elections.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422179812|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|0526f3cec6b2e8a14d0b9a435f7cca06ee4ee2ce -->",

The walls are smattered with populist Tory election posters from such glorious years as 1959, 1979 and 1992. Aside from Pickles himself, there are no high-ranking Tories in attendance. But the secretary of state for communities and local government is at pains – perhaps literally, given the stifling heat – to underline the significance of the occasion. \"You should be proud to have been here,\" he tells his audience, \"because this is the place where the Tory revival started.\"</p><p>This is the first of two launch events for Renewal, a new Conservative ginger group dedicated to what its first publication calls \"broadening Tory appeal\". Its founder is 35-year-old David Skelton, until recently deputy director of the Tory thinktank Policy Exchange, as well as a Tory parliamentary candidate in 2010 and a comprehensive-educated native of the north-eastern former steel town of Consett where, he acknowledges, \"Conservatism hasn't done terribly well in the past few elections\".</p><p>Using slightly Lenin-ish vocabulary, he says that if the Tories are to win a majority in 2015 they need to set their sights on being nothing less than \"the new workers' party\". He talks about the importance of black and ethnic minority voters, being nice to trade unionists and public sector workers, boosting the minimum wage and building new council houses. Not for nothing, perhaps, did a few early copies of Access All Areas, Renewal's inaugural collection of essays, come back from the printers with a cover in what Skelton calls Soviet red instead of the intended Tory blue.</p><p>A lot of what Renewal has been founded to explore seems to be about the Conservatives' general mindset as much as policy specifics. Skelton and his allies – most notably the Essex MP Robert Halfon, who advocates what he calls white-van Conservatism – seem to be pushing for a less ideological kind of Tory politics, more contrite about the legacy of the Thatcher years and newly open to such hitherto non-U ideas as an active industrial policy.</p><p>In that sense, for all that Skelton seems to agree with the prevailing Tory wisdom on immigration, Europe and so-called welfare, he is staking out a very different position from that of his party's true ideological believers. Last year a handful of new Conservative MPs published a short book titled Britannia Unchained, which set out a future of 60-hour working weeks and thoroughly deregulated labour markets, as well as claiming that British workers were \"among the most idle in the world\". Renewal's tone is much more emollient, pragmatic, and keen to push beyond what remains of Thatcherism.</p><p>\"It's not so much about a different economic philosophy,\" says Skelton, \"as what's necessary to tackle the needs of the time – cost of living problems, the shortage of housing and the need to be the party of job creation in some parts of the country.\" Here, you begin to suspect, lie the battle lines for a debate that will erupt sooner or later, about the Tories' past, present and future.</p><p>Composing himself in one of the Old Star's quieter corners, Pickles – \"proud to be working class,\" he tells me – dispenses his thoughts a few minutes before his speech. \"It's really important that the Conservative party's attraction, membership, involvement … goes beyond London and the south-east,\" he says.</p><p>Does that mean they need fewer people like George Osborne and David Cameron and more front-rank figures like him? This is batted away with a boilerplate sentence about people's background mattering much less than \"where they're going\". So, another question: how urgent is Renewal's agenda? \"It's urgent and important. Because the Conservative party is lesser if its views aren't heard deep in the country.\"</p><p>Can the Tories become a new workers' party? \"Of course we can. That's where our roots were. We were the first party to understand the enfranchisement of the working class and the artisans. We had a strong tradition of Conservative clubs. So sure, we can do it again.\"</p><p>Less than 24 hours later Renewal hosts another launch event, in parliament's Jubilee Room, where grand aristocratic portraits stare down at the audience of around 50. The speeches and subsequent conversation highlight a lot of the tensions that buzz around what Renewal seems to want to do.</p><p>The north-eastern Tory MP Guy Opperman think the current Tory message is \"right, but we're just not getting it across\", whereas, constantly referring back to his constituents in Harlow, Robert Halfon questions the freshly announced sell-off of Royal Mail, makes slightly sceptical noises about academies and free schools and talks about his party's \"huge mistake\" in opposing the minimum wage.</p><p>Laura Sandys, who represents the Kent seat of South Thanet, thunders about markets fixed against consumers, and the power of big business – an obvious enough argument, but one that sits rather awkwardly with her party's tendency to collude with exactly the interests she rails against. There is real angst about the Tories' reputation for being the party of the rich, but also – as happened at the Old Star – bizarre-sounding claims that this has nothing to do with the backgrounds of the current leadership.</p><p>By the event's end, Skelton seems to think this new initiative has got off to admirable start. For all its unlikeliness, plenty of Tories seem to like the idea of becoming the workers' party. \"They do,\" he nods, before cracking an ever-so-slightly triumphal smile. \"And Conservatives like the idea of winning majorities.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412957437|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|4ece1f016d03e8f84d0940b92ba9b914ac1bcbbe -->",

He has always supported me.\"</a></p><p>Bailey told his friends that the PM's advisers had no interest in concerns about the cost of living or diversity and were heavily conditioned by a public school mindset.</p><p>Cameron has been accused of running an old boys' network at No 10 after he recently promoted several Old Etonians including Jo Johnson, the brother of the London mayor Boris Johnson, and Jesse Norman.</p><p>The prime minister was also educated at Eton, as was Ed Llewellyn, his chief of staff, Oliver Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister, and Sir George Young, the chief whip.</p><p>Bailey was paid a salary of £60,000 to advise the prime minister on youth, crime and race after the 2010 general election but in January he was moved to the Cabinet Office, and renamed \"youth and engagement champion\" with a one-year contract and £36,000 salary.</p><p>Cameron has rejected criticism that he only appoints public school educated people to senior jobs, stressing that William Hague, the foreign secretary, and Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, were educated at comprehensive schools. Sam Gyimah, Cameron's parliamentary private secretary, was also educated at a state school before joining attending Oxford University and working at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker.</p><p>A Downing Street spokesman said: \"Shaun was a highly valued member of the No 10 team, and he is continuing that good work at the Cabinet Office.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/408689172|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|f7f630450be4b136fd392ad9bae00c9aa54b5418 -->",

        "headline":"Eton: why the old boys' network still flourishes",
        "body":"<p>In the Porter's Lodge at Eton, a&nbsp;surprisingly small, panelled room that guards the main entrance to probably the world's most famous and self-conscious school, a recent issue of the Week magazine lies on a table between two chairs for visitors. On the cover is a cartoon of David Cameron, the 19th Old&nbsp;Etonian to be British prime minister, and a photo of the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who may become the 20th. The magazine is well-thumbed: outsiders remain as fascinated by Eton's influence as the school is.</p><p>On the official Eton website, an elegant sales brochure with pictures of sunlit old school walls and pupils in their ancient, photogenic uniforms, there is an extensive section on <a href=\"http://www.etoncollege.com/FamousOEs.aspx\" title=\"\">\"famous Old Etonians\"</a>. The list of most recent \"OEs\" is startling, even to anyone well aware that elite Britain can be narrow. There are smooth media grandees (Geordie Greig, Nicholas Coleridge) and prickly dissenters (the New Left Review veteran Perry Anderson); lifestyle-sellers both macho (Bear Grylls) and gentle (Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall); environmentalists (Jonathon Porritt) and climate change sceptics (Matt Ridley); actors (Hugh Laurie, Dominic West, Damian Lewis) and princes (Harry and William); rising Tory MPs (Rory Stewart, Kwasi Kwarteng) and people who are likely to interview them (BBC deputy political editor James Landale). Reading the long, hypnotic index of Eton eminences, back to the college's foundation in the 15th century, British public life begins to seem little more than Eton – a school of 1,300 13-&nbsp;to 18-year-old boys – talking to itself. And the list is not even comprehensive: at the time of writing, no one has thought to include <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/08/justin-welby-archbishop-canterbury-business\" title=\"\">Justin Welby</a>, the new Archbishop of Canterbury.</p><p>But the power of an institution can be more than its people. Under the coalition, the patchy egalitarianism of postwar state schooling is giving way to a more traditional philosophy: stricter uniforms and rules, pupils organised into private school-style \"houses\", more powerful headteachers, more competition and difference between schools. It is a philosophy increasingly friendly to Eton. The current headmaster, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tony-little\" title=\"\">Tony Little</a>, remembers his first headship at another private school in the late 80s: \"The local comprehensive wouldn't invite me over the threshold. That has changed massively. The number of phone calls I get from heads of academies has greatly risen in the last two, three years. They want to visit, they want to&nbsp;collaborate.\" Eton now has state \"partner schools\" in nearby Slough, and this year joined with seven other private schools to open a free school in Stratford in east London.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-399331920'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/13/1352831556634/Justin-Welby-archbishop-o-010.jpg' alt='Justin Welby, archbishop of Canterbury, November 2012' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Justin Welby, the new archbishop of Canterbury, joins a long list of Old Etonian establishment figures, including David Cameron, Boris Johnson and princes William and Harry. Photograph: Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Other trends are working in Eton's favour. With annual fees of £32,067 – more than the average after-tax British household income – Eton is, more than ever, \"a luxury brand\", as Greig puts it in fellow Old Etonian Nick Fraser's 2006 book <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/jun/24/society.politics\" title=\"\">The Importance of Being Eton</a>. As the super-rich and the wish to imitate them have strengthened, Greig continues, \"luxury brands have come back\". Like Britain's many other luxury businesses, Eton has improved its product. \"When I was there in 1958 to 1963, the bottom 40% of boys did absolutely no work,\" says Simon Head, fellow of the Rothermere American Institute at Oxford University. \"That's gone. Eton has hunkered down. It's mobilised itself for the global economy.\"</p><p>Even the uniform seems more in keeping with the times. In an era of&nbsp;Downton Abbey and dandyish, aristocratic menswear fashions, Eton's waistcoats, tailcoats and stripes look less anachronistic. In the windows of the elderly school outfitters along Eton High Street, the long, theatrical approach to the college through the pretty, prosperous Berkshire town of the same name, there are items you could imagine selling well to east London hipsters.</p><p>Last month, a mildly droll Etonian reworking of the international pop hit Gangnam Style by PSY, called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/video/2012/oct/18/gangnam-style-parody-eton-style-video\" title=\"\">Eton Style</a>, was posted by pupils on YouTube. Filmed around the school, it has had more than 2.6m views. Eton is adept at&nbsp;mocking and advertising itself simultaneously.</p><p>And yet, aspects of the school's success and longevity remain mysterious. What exactly is the source of its pupils' legendary charm and confidence, their almost as legendary slipperiness? In his book, Fraser interviews the late Anthony Sampson, the famous investigator of Britain's elites. \"I'd meet Etonians everywhere I went,\" says Sampson, not one himself. \"I've never understood why they were so good at networking and politics.\" Fraser speculates: \"The Etonian mystique often seems a matter of mirrors, a collusion between those [non-Etonians] hungry for [Eton] notoriety and Etonians who are only too happy to supply it.\" One afternoon last week, I emailed the school to ask if I could visit. Within less than two hours, Little emailed back and offered to meet the next day.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-399331921'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/13/1352831035920/Eton-pupils-on-their-way--010.jpg' alt='Eton pupils on their way to lessons, 2008' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Eton pupils on their way to lessons – known as 'divs' or 'schools' in the college's arcane slang. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Like many British centres of power, Eton owes some of its influence to geography. It was founded in 1440 on the orders of Henry VI, frequently in residence with his court nearby at Windsor Castle. Nowadays, the school emphasises its closeness to London, the great global money hub, a dozen miles to the east. \"About a third of our boys have London addresses,\" says Little, leaving open the possibility that they also have others. For the tenth who live abroad – the proportion \"has grown a little\" since he became head in 2002 – Heathrow airport is even closer. Jets intermittently moan loud and low over the school's spikes and towers.</p><p>But otherwise, for much of the long school day, there is an uncanny hush. As you approach the college, there is no&nbsp;grand announcement of Eton's existence, just small, hand-painted signs, white lettering on black, indicating that an increasing number of the courtyards, alleyways and driveways branching off the High Street are private property. From the open windows of neat classrooms, some late medieval, some Victorian, some Edwardian, some with expensive glass-and-steel modern additions, little of the usual hubbub of secondary school life emerges. Pupils and teachers alike sit upright in the black-and-white uniform, which is somehow both uptight and flamboyant – some might say like Etonians themselves. The uniform was standardised in the 19th century and must be worn for all lessons, AKA \"divs\" or \"schools\" in Eton's elaborate private language.</p><p>When the lesson ends, the spotless pavements are suddenly flooded with pupils. Some are tall and languid, some are chubby and scurrying, some are black or Asian, most are white. Everyone carries old-fashioned ring-binder files, and no one texts or makes a phone call. But some of the boys greet each other with hugs, or bursts of transatlantic up-talking, or say \"like\" with a long \"i\",&nbsp;London-style – for a minute or two, many seem reasonably modern and normal. Then everyone rushes off to the next lesson. \"It is possible to be bored at Eton,\" says the school website, \"but it takes a bit of effort!\"</p><p>\"In many ways it is a conservative institution, with lots of tiny rules,\" says someone who was a pupil from 2002 to 2007. The ambiguous outside status of Eton often makes old boys reluctant to declare themselves. \"But Eton is probably more liberal, more permissive than its reputation. There are amazing cultural facilities, to do art and theatre for example. There were so many opportunities, it seemed churlish to focus on how annoying it was to have to wear a gown in the heat of summer.\" Last month, the History of Art Society, one of dozens of such pupil-run bodies, held a typical extracurricular event, a talk on 20th-century modernism. It was given by the BBC's arts editor, Will Gompertz.</p><p>Some boys are so well-connected when they first arrive at the school, they already have a certain swagger. In focusing on a single institution, Eton's critics are sometimes avoiding the more uncomfortable truth that the roots of Britain's elites go wider and deeper. But for less overwhelmingly privileged boys, says theex-pupil, Eton can be life-changing: \"It's just expected that you will drink from the cup of opportunity. So you become used to being able to do whatever you put your hand to. Or at the least, you learn not to <em>seem</em> fazed by opportunities in the wider world.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-399331922'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/13/1352831302542/Eton-headmaster-Tony-Litt-010.jpg' alt='Eton headmaster Tony Little, 2008' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tony Little, himself an Old Etonian, has been headmaster since 2002. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Little himself was a pupil from 1967 to 1972, \"the first male in my family to be educated past the age of 14\". His study is&nbsp;baronial and high-ceilinged, with a&nbsp;window austerely open to the cold evening, but he is less forbidding than you might expect, with a quiet, calm, middle-class voice, like a senior doctor. \"Dad worked at Heathrow, security for British Airways,\" he says. One of the school's main aims, he continues, is to admit a broader mix. But how can it, given the fees, which have raced ahead of earnings and inflation in recent decades? \"It's a huge amount of money,\" he admits – the appearance of candour is one of Little's tactics when he talks to the outside world. \"Sometimes I think, short of robbing a bank, what d'you do?\"</p><p>Currently, by giving out scholarships on academic and musical merit, and bursaries according to \"financial need\", Eton subsidises the fees of about 20% of its pupils. \"Forty-five boys pay nothing at all,\" says Little. \"Our stated aim is 25% on reduced fees, of whom 70 pay nothing.\" What is the timescale? \"Quite deliberately non-specific. But I'll be disappointed if we have not achieved it in 10 years.\" Not exactly a social revolution. \"A long-term goal\" is&nbsp;for Eton to become \"needs-blind\": to&nbsp;admit any boy, regardless of ability to pay, who makes it through the school's selection procedure of an interview, a \"reasoning test\", and the standard private-school Common Entrance exam. Whether Eton would then become a genuinely inclusive place is open to doubt: one of its selection criteria is an applicant's suitability for boarding, and many people connected with Eton would surely resist its metamorphosis into a meritocracy. Hierarchy is in Eton's bones.</p><p>Either way, Little says, the school does not have nearly enough money to become \"needs-blind\" yet. According to its latest accounts, Eton has an investment portfolio worth £200m. The school looks enviously on the wealth of private American universities: Harvard, the richest, has an endowment of more than £20bn. Eton seems unlikely to return soon to its core purpose as decreed by Henry VI: the&nbsp;education of poor scholars.</p><p>In fact, the school's history has been more erratic than many of its admirers and detractors imagine. Henry VI was deposed when Eton was only 21 years old and its funding was cut off: the college was left with a stunted-looking chapel, built to less than half the intended length. Eton is hardly the oldest British private school – one of its main rivals, Westminster, was founded in 1179. According to Fraser, \"Etonmania\", like so many supposedly eternal British traditions, only started in the reign of Queen Victoria. From the 1860s to the early 1960s, the school enjoyed a&nbsp;golden age of power and prestige. Then its influence plummeted. The Etonian-packed, slightly drifting Tory administrations of Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home were blamed for Britain's apparent decline. Within the school itself, as Harold Wilson's 60s Labour government – there has never been an Etonian Labour prime minister – seemed poised to create a fairer Britain, a friend of Fraser's \"wasn't alone in his belief that Eton was doomed, and should be forthwith incorporated within the state system … The Provost and Fellows [the school's governing body] did consider relocating to Ireland&nbsp;or France, but this was never a&nbsp;very serious notion.\"</p><p>A perceived lack of seriousness hampered Eton for decades afterwards. Reforming headmasters struggled against the school establishment, nostalgic Old Etonians, and sometimes the pupils themselves to make Eton more academic and less obsessed by rules and rituals. Margaret Thatcher still had OEs in her 80s cabinets, but she marginalised and often fired them:&nbsp;they seemed too passive and paternalistic for modern Britain.</p><p>How different Etonians seem now. Little says the school teaches pupils \"how to juggle time, how to work hard\", and how to&nbsp;present themselves in public: \"One thing I say to them when they leave is, if you choose to behave the way a tabloid would expect … you deserve everything you get.\" He&nbsp;downplays <a href=\"http://www.etoncollege.com/glossary.aspx\" title=\"\">Eton slang</a> as \"a quirk and an oddity. A lot of words have fallen out of use.\"</p><p>I wonder if he would say quite the same to a Daily Telegraph journalist. The classic Etonian skills – Cameron has them – have long included adjusting your message to your audience, defusing the issue of privilege with self-deprecation, and bending to the prevailing social and political winds, but only so far. \"Do institutions in England change totally while seeming not to, or do they do the opposite?\" asks Fraser. \"I think the latter. And Eton has changed far less than Oxbridge.\"</p><p>Rushing between lessons with their old-fashioned files, some boys talk earnestly about their essays and marks. But Eton has not quite become an elite academic school: it is usually high, but rarely top, of the exam league tables. \"Eton's view of education encompasses much more than just intellectual achievement,\" says the school's annual report. Nor does Eton participate unreservedly in the global education marketplace: it restricts its number of foreign pupils. \"We are a British school that is cosmopolitan,\" says Little. \"We're not an international school.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-399331923'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/13/1352831750389/Actor-Damian-Lewis-2012-010.jpg' alt='Actor Damian Lewis, 2012' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Actor Damian Lewis is an Old Etonian, as are fellow acting alumni Dominic West and Hugh Laurie. Photograph: Matt Baron/BEI/Rex Features</figcaption></figure><p>Does he think a school can ever be too powerful? For once, his affability gives way to something fiercer: \"I'm unashamed that we're aiming for excellence. We want … people who get on with things. The fact that people who come from here will stand in public life – for me, that is a cause for celebration.\" If Eton is too influential, he suggests, other schools should try harder. Fraser has another explanation for the success of Old Etonians: \"At moments in their lives,\" he writes, \"they are mysteriously available for each other.\" Subtle networking, a sense of mission, an elite that does not&nbsp;think too hard about its material advantages – Eton's is a very British formula for dominance.</p><p>It can be a high-pressure place. For&nbsp;all the Old Etonians who have considered the rest of life an anti-climax, there have been others damaged by the school: by its relentless timetable, by its crueller rituals, such as the \"rips\" torn by teachers in bad schoolwork, and by Eton's strange combination of worldliness and otherworldliness. Compared to most other boarding schools, Eton seems more eccentric and intense, its mental legacy more lingering. \"Eton never left me,\" writes Fraser. Little says: \"I've come across a fair number of casualties who were here [with me] in the 60s.\" Another more recent ex-pupil describes Eton as \"a millstone round my neck every day\".</p><p>After my interview with Little, I had a parting look inside the grand, domed School Hall. The building was empty except for a single boy, onstage in his stiff uniform at a grand piano, and a watching teacher with a clipboard. Dusk had fallen, and his playing rippled gorgeously through the overheated building. When he finished, the teacher immediately came and stood over him. I couldn't catch what she said, but he touched his face nervously and nodded.</p><p>For some people, that is what education should be about. And Eton nowadays works restlessly to satisfy them. Beside its seemingly endless playing fields, the school is building a new quadrangle for 40 more classrooms. Next to the development is a small, bucolic, council-owned park, with litter and rusty goalposts. As Eton flourishes for the next few years at least, the rest of Britain may have to make do.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399328973|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|76654acc9432efc2923c4aaf146fec0c87a3ad27 -->",

        "body":"<p>Jeremy Hunt could be in line for a windfall of up to £17m should Hotcourses, the online directory of courses he founded 17 years ago, be sold to Inflexion, the private equity firm behind the Jack Wills preppy clothing brand.</p><p>The proposed deal, valuing the whole company at about £35m, would cement the health secretary's reputation as one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the House of Commons.</p><p>Other wealthy figures in the cabinet include defence secretary Philip Hammond, who made millions in nursing homes and other ventures. David Cameron and George Osborne were also rated among the most wealthy in a study last year by Wealth-X, though in both case their riches were largely inherited.</p><p>Although Hunt stepped down as a director of Hotcourses in 2009, he is still the largest shareholder, with a 49% stake. His interest in the firm is held via a \"blind trust\" which means he is prevented from having any day to day control of his stake.</p><p>Inflexion is understood to be in a period of exclusive discussions over an acquisition of the business, although it is not certain whether a sale will go through. Hunt, Hotcourses and Inflexion did not reply or declined to comment.</p><p>The firm, which went by the name Elms Hunt International until 2001, is still run by the health secretary's childhood friend and co-founder, Mike Elms. The latest accounts show the business made a pre-tax profit of £2m on a turnover of £6.5m for the seven months to July 2012. Elms said that represented a 17% rise in sales and a jump in profits of more than 50%.</p><p>One of Hotcourses' biggest contracts is a deal to run a website for the British Council, promoting courses in the UK. The council is a quango sponsored by the Foreign Office to promote cultural and educational opportunities abroad. It is part-funded by government grants.</p><p>Hunt has insisted the success of Hotcourses came only after Elms and he had pursued a string of failed ventures. Among their false starts were a scheme to export marmalade to Japan, building children's playgrounds and a tourist guide idea. The two businessmen had also set up a political PR firm, Profile PR, later renamed Heckler, in the early 1990s.</p><p>Hunt has recalled how the pair eventually stumbled on the winning formula that became Hotcourses after they had been publishing student university guides, quickly spotting it as a bigger business opportunity.</p><p>On his website, Hunt reminds his constituents in South West Surrey that he understands the hardship of starting up a new business.</p><p>\"A lot of people who start their own business do so because they think it's a good way to make a lot of money, but when you start it becomes simply a matter of survival. It's a daily struggle, which is why small business people tend to be very down to earth and practical.\"</p><p>The eldest son of Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt, the health secretary was educated at Charterhouse private school and Magdalen College, Oxford, before turning to business and latterly politics.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422050864|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|e3d4284527cdc15d6483493f506cc93b58f80e8a -->",

        "body":"<p>John Harris (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/11/grammar-schools-social-mobility-deluded-thinking\" title=\"\">Grammar schools and the delusion of social mobility</a>, 11 November) is correct in describing the relatively high proportion of \"privileged\" pupils in existing grammar schools, but he is wrong in drawing from that any conclusions about the grammar school model of education. The present situation makes grammar schools a scarce resource, and whenever there is a scarce resource it is the more privileged who will gain the greatest access to it. I contend that if the education system were restored to its form in the 50s with grammar schools almost everywhere, then his reported bias would diminish to insignificance. It is the present system that seems tailored to ensure that those in privileged positions are provided with a plethora of opportunities to select a privileged education for their children, while \"the rest\" are forced to put up with second (or third or fourth) best.<br /><strong>Ian King</strong><br /><em>Westbury on Severn, Gloucestershire</em></p><p></p><p>• Surely if there are social conditions that people need to move from, we should change those social conditions rather than contriving an escape route for a few. The perceived need for social and educational mobility presumes a hierarchy that is principally the result of the age-old English elitism and presumption of the superiority of academia over practical or vocational pursuits. The current national curriculum reflects a disregard for practical engineering and manufacturing skills that the Germans have valued over the past 30 years. In the UK we still believe that \"pure\" education, unsullied by practical skills, is superior and that \"social mobility\" is needed to enable the practically gifted to neglect their own skills and join us academics. As&nbsp;an academic, I am in awe of those I see with practical gifts that were neglected in my grammar school education.<br /><strong>Derek White</strong><br /><em>Wimborne, Dorset</em></p><p></p><p>• John Major has added his voice to those calling for the return of grammar schools as a means of breaking the stranglehold of the privately educated on top jobs (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/11/john-major-social-mobility-speech\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 11 November). While I have every sympathy with the desire to increase social mobility, the argument for selection would be stronger if there were to be a similar outpouring of support from those who went to secondary modern schools. So far there has been nothing but silence from that quarter. There might be a reason for that.<br /><strong>Lynne Copley</strong><br /><em>Longwood, Huddersfield</em></p><p></p><p>• John Major is probably right about New Labour's presiding over increased social inequality but his cited reason \"of ending grammar schools\" probably has less to do with it. Having experienced sufficient racism at school to make serious study difficult, I made it into higher education because of the old Labour provision of evening classes, the mandatory student grant and unconditional subsistence welfare as required. Blair and Brown sacrificed the resourcing of these policies in order to maintain Thatcherite tax rates. I never would have made it under a regime that \"market forces\" the poor into some of the worst employment in western Europe.<br /><strong>Dr Gavin Lewis</strong> <br /><em>Manchester</em></p><p></p><p>• The inequality in educational provision that John Harris cites was also highlighted by Fiona Millar in her piece on the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/07/private-schools-charitable-status-reform\" title=\"\"> \"social apartheid\"</a> (8 October) engendered by fee-charging schools. I benefited from a good education at private schools but our two sons achieved far better at our local comprehensive. Significantly, both have become champions of equality in their respective fields; one is head of maths at an excellent comprehensive. My contemporaries and I owe much to our privileged education. Many of them reached positions of influence but few seem to question such endemic injustice or to advocate for reform – a tragic example of today's blinkered leadership failing the citizens of tomorrow.<br /><strong>Terence Finley</strong><br /><em>Longbenton, Newcastle</em></p><p></p><p>• Scotland has retained the comprehensive system and is not returning to grammar schools. Something to be said for independence?<br /><strong>Bob Holman</strong><br /><em>Glasgow</em></p><p></p><p>• John Harris should be an adviser for the shadow secretary for education, whose policies lack understanding of the need to be radical. It baffles me that the parents of the 7% of children that are privately educated represent such a powerful lobby. Ed Miliband should pledge to rid the education system not only of selective schools but fee-paying ones too. <br /><strong>Linda Karlsen</strong> <br /><em>Whitstable, Kent</em></p><p></p><p>• A fellow pupil at my primary school who failed his 11-plus said his father had suggested we swap secondary school places \"as I live in a private house and you live in a council house\". I naturally refused, but the incident certainly raised my political awareness.<br /><strong>Dr Alan Bullion</strong><br /><em>Tunbridge Wells, Kent</em></p><p></p><p>• \"It is a cruel deception to tell pupils from poor backgrounds that a GCSE in drama will help them get into Oxbridge,\" writes Daniel Johnson (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/07/children-learn-question-not-simply-obey\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 8 November 2013). I wonder what he thinks stops them being thus successful – the poor background or the drama GCSE? I teach at an independent school where students could in no way be described as poor – would he say that those who have made it to Oxbridge did so in spite of their GCSE (or even their A-level) in drama? I&nbsp;venture to suggest that a GCSE in drama – a qualification appreciated by anyone who values the importance of creativity, imagination and resourcefulness – may, in fact, be a stepping stone in developing the confidence and self-assuredness that will help students from more deprived areas of the social spectrum succeed in their aspirations. <br /><strong>Kate Nash</strong><br /><em>Head of drama &amp; theatre studies, Kingswood School, Bath</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422222995|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|0637db2fc22107121f8851e3d5001fec3d4085eb -->",

        "body":"<p>What can we do about the seizing-up of social mobility, the yawning attainment gap between rich and poor, and all the other aspects of inequality about which politicians and commentators affect to fret? If you have never adequately understood the effects of post-Thatcher capitalism on inequality and always mistrusted the idea of comprehensive education, the answer is simple enough: rewind the clock to the 1940s, bring back selection at 11, and usher in a new age of exacting meritocracy.</p><p>Indeed, in certain parts of the country where children sit a version of the 11-plus and grammar schools have never gone away, little islands of wonder are allegedly thriving. Just listen to the former Independent columnist <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/mary-ann-sieghart/mary-ann-sieghart-how-to-change-the-shape-of-the-establishment-in-one-generation-7769595.html\" title=\"\">Mary Ann Sieghart, writing last year</a>: &quot;If you are bright but poor and you live in Kent, Essex, Buckinghamshire or Northern Ireland, your parentage doesn't have to dictate your progress. You have nearly the same chance of becoming a cabinet minister, a judge, a newspaper editor or a top rower as your privately educated neighbour. Why is that? Because these areas still have grammar schools, those turbo-chargers of social mobility.&quot;</p><p>Unfortunately, this is rot. Last week the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Sutton Trust educational charity released a report</a> about who exactly goes to England's 164 remaining grammar schools. Though the news was not exactly revelatory, the figures were still striking: 2.7% of their pupils are entitled to free school meals (FSMs) as against 17.5% in other state schools; 13% of entrants to English state–funded grammars come from fee-paying schools, more than double the proportion of 10-year-olds in private education; <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-battle-for-grammar-school-places-children-from-poorer-homes-should-have-free-tuition-for-11plus-8927598.html\" title=\"\">in areas that have stuck with selection</a>, 66% of high-achievers at 11 who are not on FSMs get places at grammars; among those who are entitled to them, the figure is 40%.</p><p>It's clear what is going on. Affluent parents pay for coaching; many go as far as putting their kids in prep schools, in the expectation they will fly through entrance exams for state grammars, and the money will have been well spent. The Sieghart utopia is a fantasy: in Kent, Buckinghamshire, Trafford, Lincolnshire and the rest, a bright child on FSMs is much less likely to make it to a grammar school (and, if the theory holds true, from there to the cabinet room, the inns of court or the Oxford University Boat Club) than more affluent classmates with the same levels of ability. Even in Northern Ireland, where a superficially creditable 7.4% of grammar school kids are on FSMs, that is still far lower than the 19% of all post-primary children entitled to them, and the 28% who take them in non-grammar schools.</p><p>Somewhat disappointingly, the <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/news/news/sutton-trust-prep-schools-provide-four-times-more-grammar/\" title=\"\">Sutton Trust goes along with the idea</a> that grammars are &quot;here to stay&quot;, and suggests improving outreach programmes, funding some pre-test coaching from the public purse, and suchlike. Inevitably its proposals have the look of lipstick on the proverbial pig – because in the context of such jaw-dropping statistics, the point seems incontestable: quite apart from the brutal stupidity of deciding someone's life chances as they finish primary school, as proved by concerns that go <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/news/news/sutton-trust-prep-schools-provide-four-times-more-grammar/\" title=\"\">all the way back to the 1950s</a>, selection has always dovetailed with social segregation.</p><p>None of this, of course, will change the minds of the stubborn hardcore who claim that the return of the 11-plus would solve many of Britain's problems at a stroke. Such great minds as <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2082388/Why-wont-political-party-dare-champion-grammar-schools-I-owe-everything.html\" title=\"\">Michael Portillo</a>, the irksome Conservative MP Graham Brady and even some <a href=\"http://shiftinggrounds.org/2012/06/more-grammar-schools-please-but-open-them-up/\" title=\"\">voices on the left</a> bang on about grammar schools holding the key to some great revival of social mobility – but they're guilty of a misreading of history that would be found out in any undergraduate sociology tutorial.</p><p>Post-1944, we are told, the grammar schools churned out thousands of elevated proletarians, and the economy just happened to have salaried jobs for them. In fact, that great spurt of embourgeoisement happened because of the expansion of white-collar employment and the public sector: the fact that some of the new middle class had waved goodbye to most of their classmates at 11 and gone to get O-level Latin was beside the point.</p><p>The intersection of selection and class goes to the heart of the malign elements of modern education policy more generally (which, in the case of grammars, has lately taken a turn for the worse: thanks to Michael Gove, though no new grammars can open, existing ones are now free to expand). Here the basic point is simple: in a society as unequal as ours, if you carve up schools into one group held up to be excellent, and another acknowledged to be not nearly as good, the wealthy will tend to stampede towards the former, while the less well-off get the scraps – and inequality will either be&nbsp;perpetuated, or made worse.</p><p>The intake of the Labour government's academies contained fewer disadvantaged children than the schools they replaced. Now, the &quot;converter&quot; schools that have separated themselves from local authorities and become academies have been found to have far fewer pupils on FSMs than the national average. Last year it was revealed that three-quarters of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/apr/23/free-schools-deprived-pupils-average\" title=\"\">free schools admitted a lower proportion of pupils on FSMs</a> than registered in their surrounding areas: one, Canary Wharf College in east London, recorded 2% on FSMs as against a local figure of 48%.</p><p>Where such educational novelty has been held at bay, the picture is rather different. In fact, the author of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/academies-increase-divisions-between-the-rich-and-poor-study-finds-segregation-made-worse-by-a-wider-choice-of-schooling-8797105.html\" title=\"\">a recent report submitted to the British Educational Research Association</a> stated: &quot;Segregation by poverty is highest in areas with fewest 'bog standard' schools and lowest in areas with few independent, selective, faith-based, foundation, city technology colleges or academy schools.&quot;</p><p></p><p>In other words, if we really want to narrow the class-based attainment gaps that seem to keep politicians awake at night, we'll have to reverse the entire policy direction of all three main parties. We should stick with orthodox comprehensives, phase out grammars, do the same to faith schools, and promote the good local school over supposed &quot;choice&quot;. And we should do everything in our power to pull parents away from fee-paying places, starting with an end to their charitable status, and an insistence that the intakes of all Russell Group universities should reflect the proportions of school students in state and private education – and, come to think of it, those who've been to comprehensives and grammars. Imagine that.</p><p>I'm not holding my breath, obviously. But, eventually, a principle so self-evident will have to be acknowledged, one way or another. If you overlay increasing differentiation on deep inequality, you end up with privilege: something I rather thought we'd grasped about two-thirds of the way into the last century.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422132256|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|8804d9a6420735947e2e07176dccdb2d7a747a05 -->",

        "headline":"John Major 'shocked' at privately educated elite's hold on power",
        "body":"<p>Sir John Major has expressed his shock at the way in which every sphere of modern public life is dominated by a private school-educated elite and well-heeled middle class. He also suggested interest rates should go back to \"normal levels of 3% to 5 %\" as one way of helping pensioners deal with the recent squeeze on earnings.</p><p></p><p>The former prime minister has been warning for months about the threat of so-called net curtain poverty, and claimed the government needed to do more to address the quiet poverty gripping the responsible middle class. He blamed the slowdown in social mobility on Labour policies, including the abolition of grammar schools.</p><p></p><p>In a speech in Norfolk on Friday, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10439303/Truly-shocking-that-the-private-school-educated-and-affluent-middle-class-still-run-Britain-says-Sir-John-Major.html\" title=\"\">reported on Monday by the Daily Telegraph</a>, he claimed that pensioners' savings were being squeezed by a mix of inflation and low interest rates.</p><p></p><p>Major – who went to a grammar school in south London and left with three O-levels – said: \"In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class. To me from my background, I find that truly shocking.\"</p><p></p><p>He blamed this \"collapse in social mobility\" on Labour, claiming that despite Ed Miliband's \"absurd mantra to be the one-nation party, they left a Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration\".</p><p></p><p>Major said: \"I remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost</p><p></p><p>\"Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born, not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born. \"We need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. And it isn't going to happen magically.\"</p><p></p><p>The Commission on Child Poverty and Social Mobility, chaired by Alan Milburn, the former Labour cabinet minister, has found no evidence that social mobility slowed due to Labour policies.</p><p></p><p>The coalition will argue that its pupil premium is aimed specifically  at poorer children and designed to help them achieve higher results than the better resourced middle class. It will also point to free childcare aimed at the poorer two-year-olds.</p><p></p><p>Major also said the government should help pensioners who had saved carefully for their retirement and were being punished by \"cripplingly unfair\" low interest rates. He suggested the Bank of England ought to return interest rates to \"normal levels, say 3% to 5%\", so that society treated \"the saver as fairly as it treats the debtor\".</p><p>Critics will point out that pensioners have been relatively immune from spending cuts, partly due to the triple lock on the value of pensions.</p><p></p><p>There is, however, cross-party concern  about the potential impact of rising interest rates on household debt.</p><p></p><p>At the weekend the Tory MP Mark Garnier told the BBC: \"The important point, I think, is that we have to remember that we're in a period of super-low interest rates: this is not normal, this is the lowest interest rates have been for 300 years.</p><p>\"And actually when we go back to a normal period of low interest rates – so if they rise by 2%-3%, which is perfectly reasonable even before the three years target that [the Bank of England governor] Mark Carney has set – it's going to have a really dramatic effect on quite a number of households that are already suffering a bit of forebearance on their mortgages.\"</p><p></p><p>The thinktank the Resolution Foundation recently warned: \"The number of families in Britain with perilous levels of debt repayments could more than double to 1.2 million if interest rates rise faster than expected in the next four years and household income growth is weak and uneven.\" Current market expectations are for interest rates to reach 1.9% by mid-2017.</p><p></p><p>Major said the Conservative leadership should pull their punches on the UK Independence party (Ukip), saying many of its supporters were \"patriotic Britons who fear their country is changing\", and would ultimately come back to the Tory party.</p><p></p><p>Turning to the Conservatives' prospects for the 2015 general election, the former prime minister said that if the party decided to \"shrink into our comfort zone we will not win general elections – the core vote cannot deliver a general election majority\".</p><p></p><p>Party members were right to feel unsettled by \"bewildering\" changes such as the coalition's decision to legalise same-sex marriage, he said.</p><p></p><p>\"Social mores have moved on from the way in which we were brought up, with the values that we had. They have moved and changed,\" Major added. \"And that is why issues such as gay marriage have proved so toxic for the Conservative party.</p><p></p><p>\"Because for many Conservatives, people who are conservative because their instinct is to conserve, to change slowly and only when you know it is certain for the better, that is classically Conservative.</p><p></p><p>\"For people like that who form the bulk of our party and a great deal of our country too, these are difficult issues, these bewildering social changes, and mostly it is my generation and older who are unsettled by these changes.</p><p></p><p>\"We may be unsettled by them, but David Cameron and his colleagues have no choice but to deal with this new world. They cannot, Canute-like, order it to go away, because it won't.\"</p><p></p><p>Major called for loyalty from party members, saying: \"Public criticism is destructive. Take it from me. Political parties who are divided and torn simply do not win general elections.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422179812|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|0526f3cec6b2e8a14d0b9a435f7cca06ee4ee2ce -->",

        "body":"<p>Every era produces politicians who seem to sum up the spirit of their age – and in our own case, the most perfect example might be the Tory cabinet minister Jeremy Hunt.</p><p>Having been the accident-prone culture secretary, he is now in charge of the NHS, and facing the first stirrings of an A&amp;E crisis. But there is good news for him, too. Last week, with Hunt's personal worth already estimated to be around &pound;5m, it was revealed that a company he founded 17 years ago – which now trades as Hotcourses, and works as a kind of online education search engine – i<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/08/jeremy-hunt-17m-hotcourses-sale-inflexion\" title=\"\">s on the verge of being sold to a private equity firm</a>. It will net&nbsp;him somewhere in the region of &pound;17m. His life, then, is almost surreally comfortable – as befits a stereotypical member of the modern elite who was the head boy at Charterhouse (current annual boarding fees: &pound;32,925) and went on to be a contemporary at&nbsp;Oxford of David Cameron and Boris&nbsp;Johnson.</p><p>Hunt's social tribe, needless to say, dominates the cabinet. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9290520/Exclusive-Cabinet-is-worth-70million.html\" title=\"\">Recent figures based on current and previous salaries, shares and property suggest</a> that two thirds of senior ministers are millionaires, with Cameron and his wife Samantha – the daughter of a baronet – thought to be in line for an eventual inheritance windfall of &pound;25m. And though some who sit around the cabinet table came from state schools (the foreign secretary William Hague is a good example), there is still something remarkable about how many of the top political jobs are currently held by people who went to some of Britain's major fee-paying institutions: among them, the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the chancellor, and the mayor of London.</p><p>Then, of course, there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/13/eton-old-boys-network-flourishes\" title=\"\">the Eton factor</a>, which encompasses not just Cameron and Johnson, but plenty of their Tory colleagues, aides and advisers. Cameron's chief of staff is an Old Etonian, as is George Osborne's chief economics adviser. The Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin is too, along with the Tory chief whip, George Young, and the chief of the Downing Street policy unit – Jo Johnson, younger brother of Boris.</p><p>Despite the fact that around only <a href=\"http://www.smith-institute.org.uk/file/Who-Governs-Britain.pdf\" title=\"\">7%&nbsp;of British children are privately educated</a>, 34% of MPs went to fee-paying schools, and the figure for Tory members of parliament is 54% (the Labour figure, to put that in perspective, is a mere 12%). People who have had expensive educations dominate journalism, law, finance – and, of late, even the supposedly meritocratic powerhouse that is British pop music (witness Mumford and Sons, Florence Welch, Lily Allen, Laura Marling et al). &quot;It is remarkable how many positions of wealth, influence, celebrity and power in our society are held by individuals who were privately educated,&quot; said the education secretary, Michael Gove, in May last year.</p><p>Now, another voice has joined the debate. Last Friday evening, John Major – the former Tory PM, who famously left his south-London state school at 16, with only three O-levels – spoke at a dinner organised by the South Norfolk Conservative Association. Having already unsettled the government with his call for a windfall tax on energy firms and worries about &quot;lace curtain poverty&quot;, this time Major focused on the upmarket backgrounds now shared by the people at the top. He tried to blame the last Labour government for a &quot;collapse in social mobility&quot;, which does really not chime with the facts, but his basic point was simple enough: &quot;In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power&nbsp;in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the&nbsp;privately educated or the affluent middle class,&quot; he said. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/11/john-major-shocked-elite-social-mobility\" title=\"\">&quot;To&nbsp;me,&nbsp;from&nbsp;my background, I&nbsp;find that truly shocking.&quot;</a></p><p>Major's revival as a Conservative elder statesman is fascinating to behold. His torrid experience of power and the shambles into which his&nbsp;government fell seem to be fading memories: far more important, it seems, is the huge contrast between his background and bond with Tory voters, and the current Conservative leadership. Somewhere in the party's collective soul, perhaps, is a yearning for the days when they could put their leader's face on an election poster, and&nbsp;accompany it with a winning pitch&nbsp;to voters: &quot;What does the Conservative party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him&nbsp;Prime Minister.&quot;</p><p>As the kerfuffle about Major's comments proves, there are two connected elements in this story. One&nbsp;is bound up with almost the entirety of public life and culture more generally, and the renewed dominance of people from a very small range of backgrounds, from Coldplay's Chris Martin to the Eton-educated archbishop of Canterbury.</p><p>The other is specifically about the Conservative party, and the way that a&nbsp;political force that had long found its leaders among the self-made and state-educated has reverted to type, and what that means for the Tories' prospects. Of course, compared with the days when 172 of 415 Tory MPs came from the aristocracy (as was the case in 1935) and the share of privately educated Conservative MPs exceeded 70%, the party can now claim to have embraced openness and meritocracy. But at the top, things seem to have gone backwards, reflecting that wider sense of the brazenly privileged and wealthy returning to the national foreground in a way that might once have seemed unthinkable.</p><p>Cameron, let us not forget, is the first privately educated Tory PM since 1964 – and to give the story even more piquancy, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/oct/21/uk.toryleadership2005\" title=\"\">won the leadership battle</a> after facing off against David Davis, who was raised on a council estate, educated at a state school, and spent 17 years rising through the corporate hierarchy of the sugar firm Tate &amp; Lyle. Had Davis become Conservative leader back in 2005, things might have been slightly different; certainly, his take on the current state of Tory play was crisply summed up in advice he threw Cameron's way earlier this year: &quot;No more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/11/david-cameron-adviser-shaun-bailey-etonians\" title=\"\">Etonian advisers</a>&quot;.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-422229795\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/11/1384196516084/John-Major-009.jpg\" alt=\"John Major\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>John Major: the former Tory PM has lambasted the dominance of the privately educated elite.

How did the party once led by the state-educated Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher and Major revert, so spectacularly, to type? And what does the private-school domination that Major has decided to decry say about the kind of country Britain has become?</p><p>The renowned historian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-kynaston\" title=\"\">David Kynaston</a> is the author of three near-definitive histories of the postwar UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/20/historybooks.features\" title=\"\">Austerity Britain, Family Britain and Modernity Britain</a> and, as it happens, an alumnus of the fee-paying Wellington College, with a penetrating take on what Major has been talking about. Both Britain and the Conservative party began to turn away from the public-school elite in the early 1960s, when two things were happening: the demise of deference and the blurring of old cultural divides; and an increasing sense that the UK's decline was being worsened by the rule of gentleman amateurs – and, perhaps, what George Orwell called &quot;the decay of ability in the ruling-class&quot;.</p><p>The Tories, he says, took a while to wake up. &quot;There's the astonishing thing that when Harold Macmillan went in&nbsp;'63, they appointed another Old Etonian to be prime minister, in Alec Douglas-Home. In&nbsp;all logic, he&nbsp;should have been trounced at the next&nbsp;election by the meritocratic Harold Wilson, but he&nbsp;actually gave him quite a close race,&nbsp;which perhaps shows you how small-c conservative Britain still was. But, nevertheless, once he goes in&nbsp;'65, it moves to Heath. And Heath actually came from a pretty poor background – which, at the time, seemed really important and symbolic.</p><p>&quot;I grew up through all this,&quot; Kynaston goes on. &quot;And, for years and years, it seemed inconceivable that the Tory party would ever go back to having an Old Etonian as leader.&quot; Society, he points out, was becoming more equal up until the late 1970s, and Britain was also seeing &quot;the semi-collapse of the old cultural hierarchies&quot;. How much social mobility was happening became perhaps over-rated, he reckons, but there was a clear sense of positions of power and influence opening up as never before.</p><p>After Heath came the legendary grocer's daughter Margaret Thatcher. Public-school Conservatism obviously endured (<a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/iainmartin1/100245274/it-is-much-worse-than-sir-john-major-says-a-new-superclass-is-being-created-in-london/\" title=\"\">there were six Old Etonians in Thatcher's first cabinet</a>), but it was offset by the kind of self-made Tory politicians who could speak to working-class voters as a matter of instinct – not&nbsp;least the &quot;Chingford Skinhead&quot; Norman Tebbit, a state-educated former airline pilot. Meanwhile, things at the top of the educational hierarchy were quietly changing, in keeping with the retrospective sense of a small elite becoming detached from society as the free market was allowed to let rip.</p><p>&quot;The private schools got their act together,&quot; says Kynaston. &quot;They became these incredibly sophisticated kinds of marketing organisations. And&nbsp;they became so highly resourced. Now, fees have increased well beyond inflation. The facilities are fantastically impressive. You now get articles in the&nbsp;Spectator, grumbling about the money required.&quot; He also agrees also that privately educated people found a&nbsp;new, demotic voice – think about that&nbsp;alumnus of Fettes College, Tony Blair, with his glottal stops lately imitated by George Osborne – that served to smooth over their origins, and create the impression that the old grouse-moor stereotypes were a thing of the past.</p><p>As it has turned out, though, there is a public sensitivity about senior Tories' backgrounds that will not go away, no matter how many slightly anxious Cameron soundbites (eg &quot;What counts is not where you come from but where you are going&quot;, the line chucked at journalists by the PM's spokesman yesterday) are dreamed up to deal with it. It was surely a factor in his failure to&nbsp;win an election even against the clapped-out Gordon Brown; and three years on, it may partly explain the fact that the Tories cannot seem to correct their ongoing lag in the polls.</p><p>One outer-London Labour MP recently told me that erstwhile working-class Tory voters in his seat &quot;seem to look at Osborne and Cameron and think, 'Who are these people?'&quot; To quote from <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10114822/Ukip-support-fallen-by-a-third-says-latest-poll.html\" title=\"\">a recent story in the Daily Telegraph</a>, &quot;only 29% of voters now think Cameron 'understands people like me', as opposed to 65% who disagree, with the&nbsp;prime minister's Eton background continuing to create a perceived gulf with ordinary people&quot;.</p><p>To some Tories, this is a matter of mild irritation. Others, though, have sounded positively furious – as evidenced by the now-legendary words of the Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries, a&nbsp;native of inner-city Liverpool, whose father was a bus driver. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17815769\" title=\"\">In July 2012, let&nbsp;us not forget, she said:</a> &quot;There is a&nbsp;very tight, narrow clique of a certain group of people and what they do is act as a barrier and prevent Cameron and Osborne and others from really understanding or knowing what is happening in the rest of the country. I think that not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who don't know the price of milk, but they're two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, no contrition, and no passion to want to understand the lives of others – and that is their real crime.&quot;</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-422229796\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/11/1384196754424/Cameron-and-Davis-009.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron and Davis\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>David Cameron and David Davis battled it out for the leadership of the Tory party in 2005. What would be different now if Davis had won? Photograph: David Jones/PA Archive/Press Association Images</figcaption></figure><p>So, will the Tories eventually realise their error, and resume their tradition of picking leaders with more ordinary backgrounds? &quot;My gut feeling would be yes, they will,&quot; says Kynaston, who doesn't fancy the chances of their assumed leader-in-waiting. &quot;It would seem pretty unlikely that they would actually go for Boris Johnson as the next leader. I think it'll go back to the old pattern: Heath, Thatcher, Major, Hague. Unless Cameron wins at the next election, all this will be seen as a&nbsp;big reason why he failed to connect. It'll be interesting on the Labour side, as well – whether they ever again have a privately educated leader. I think it's most unlikely.&quot;</p><p>Within Conservative politics, there seems to be a mounting understanding of all this. Among the ever-increasing number of internal Tory groupings, there is now a pressure group called Blue Collar Conservatism, pledged to &quot;widen the Conservative base and transform the lives of ordinary voters&quot;. This year has also seen the arrival of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/16/renewal-tory-workers-party\" title=\"\">Renewal</a>, an impressive set-up which talks about reinventing the Tories as a &quot;workers' party&quot;. Their founding document bemoans the fact that the parliamentary Conservative party &quot;still comes from a relatively narrow social base&quot;, and at their launch party in Westminster in July, among the posters on the wall was the aforementioned John Major effort from 1992: &quot;proof that the Conservatives have both attracted working-class voters,&quot; said the official blurb, &quot;and have promoted working-class leaders in the past&quot;.</p><p>Renewal's founder is an influential Tory thinker, <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/people/alumni/item/david-skelton\" title=\"\">David Skelton</a>, the former deputy director of the Conservative thinktank <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Policy Exchange</a>. He is the son of a teacher father and a mother who worked in a shop, and he went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;comprehensive school in County&nbsp;Durham.</p><p>&quot;The point John Major is making is that we've got a long-term problem,&quot; he says. &quot;Lots of institutions are dominated by people from a very narrow background: the judiciary, business, the media, politics.&quot; The Tories, he adds, have to be &quot;pro-active about getting people from low-income, working-class backgrounds into politics&quot;. As he sees it, they need to sell their education policies as a matter of widening opportunities, and &quot;ensure there are people from those backgrounds on its benches&quot;.</p><p>I have spoken to Skelton before: when reminded of the fact that there has been such a counter-revolution at the very top of the party, he becomes evasive. And so it proves today: &quot;I&nbsp;obviously think that more needs to be done, to appeal to all kinds of voters – working-class people, people in the north, people in cities – who still aren't voting Conservative in nearly large enough numbers,&quot; he says. The party, he reckons, is making &quot;big steps in the right direction&quot;, and he mentions not just what is happening in schools, but the recent reshuffle, and the promotion of such ascendant talent as the Keighley MP Kris Hopkins, and the new&nbsp;welfare minister Esther McVey, a&nbsp;state-educated Liverpudlian. &quot;The more working-class voices there are, the better,&quot; he says.</p><p>A direct question, then. Will the Heath-Thatcher-Major line of state-educated Tory leaders eventually be&nbsp;resumed?</p><p>&quot;I would say that it doesn't really matter what school people went to providing they have the right policies,&quot; he says. &quot;But, yeah … of course, there will be state-educated Tory leaders in the future.&quot;</p><p>A pause, for emphasis. &quot;Of course there will.&quot;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422227374|2013-11-12T10:05:52Z|f10d026fc393662aca2781b05225befa9da10b00 -->",
