        "body":"<p>Melbourne Victory climbed from the canvas to steal a 2-2 away draw against Adelaide United on Friday night.</p><p>The Victory scored twice in the final 15 minutes to share the spoils before a record A-League crowd in Adelaide of 16,504 spectators at Coopers Stadium.<br />The Reds, with Sergio Cirio scoring from a questionable penalty and Jeronimo Neumann tapping-in from close range, appeared set to bank consecutive home wins to open their campaign.</p><p>But Melbourne substitute Guilherme Finkler scored in the 79th minute and James Troisi equalised three minutes before full-time in a pulsating match.</p><p>Melbourne and their coach Ange Postecoglou, in possibly his last match in charge of the Victory should he take the Socceroos job, could have won if not for bad first-half luck.</p><p>The visitors were unlucky to concede the penalty and also had a clear-cut Mitch Nichols goal disallowed.</p><p>Argentinian striker Jeronimo featured in the two opening goals, creating the first when awarded a dubious penalty. Jeronimo and the Victory goalkeeper Nathan Coe steamed at each other, with the ball between them, in the 20th minute and the Reds' the striker milked slight contact, diving forward, and the referee Alan Milliner awarded a penalty.</p><p>Adelaide's Sergio Cirio scored twice from the spot: his initial conversion was disallowed, then he fooled Coe with a shrewd second attempt, aimed in a different direction than the first.</p><p>Two minutes later, Jeronimo scored after Adelaide's lively substitute Awer Mabil launched a speculative shot from just inside the box. The ball deflected from Melbourne defender Adrian Leijer, struck the near post and, by chance, fell to Jeronimo who tapped in.</p><p>Melbourne should have reduced the deficit in the 35th minute when Archie Thompson, after a piercing run, had the Reds' goalkeeper Eugene Galekovic beat but elected to pass to Nichols instead. Nichols scored from close range, only to be incorrectly ruled offside.</p><p>Melbourne turned the tide in the second half but a series of shots – from Leijer, Troisi and Kosta Barbarouses – all narrowly missed but substitute Finkler's 79th minute goal, from a low shot on the turn, gave the visitors hope. Three minutes into injury time, Troisi equalised with a shot that crashed in off the bar.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420344315|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|7fff14193ab673cf21ebcc988e0452098ac35f70 -->",

        "headline":"The ARU must speculate to accumulate",
        "body":"<p>You know things are really bad when the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) sends out spam email heralding the 'ultimate wallabies sale' with Wallaby kit going at Chinese factory wholesale prices. </p><p>That's exactly what the ARU did last week, and it's an apt metaphor for the current state of Australian rugby – almost broke, utterly dishevelled and on the brink of irrelevance as far as the domestic market is concerned.</p><p>The tone of recent talks between the ARU and players' union is worrying, with the Rugby Union Players Association (Rupa) boss Greg Harris so far <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/wallabies-players-pay-cut-rugby-union\">not ruling out a cut in match payments</a>. In fact, there are unconfirmed reports a new collective bargaining agreement could altogether end players earning match payments of $14,000 a Test, win, lose or draw. If that's true, let's hope the new agreement has an appropriate trade-off, for example higher base retainers for ARU top-up selected players, or some kind of claw-back mechanism for match payments when the ARU is on firmer financial footing.</p><p>These are dangerous days for both the ARU and players' union with a lot of bile floating around about players being paid over the odds. That's absolute rubbish. Sure, the Wallabies have done themselves few favours with shambolic efforts on the field – but the fact remains that there is no conclusive link between rugby team performance and pay. What we have instead is a massive swell of Moneyball-inspired public opinion and commentary, some of it sadly led by former Wallabies, against player wages. It's dangerous because people who should know better are actually buying into it. </p><p>The players, especially, need to be on red alert and ensure Rupa does its bidding on this crucial issue. However, Rupa's recent placating statements suggests it could roll over. That would be a massive miscalculation on its part, one raising serious doubts about Rupa's effectiveness as a voice for professional players. Alas, if only the players had Khoder Nasser in their corner right now.</p><p>Management slashing employee wages is not the cure-all that it's made out to be, and certainly not in rugby where player value is essentially determined by global forces. Too often employees get the blame when the real issue is the quality of management decision-making. The ARU boss Bill Pulver – a multi-millionaire thanks to shares in <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/news/william-pulver-a-local-boy-who-made-it-big/story-fn7x8me2-1226108601217\">NetRatings which sold for $820m in 2007</a> – has gone on record saying he's spent the last six months \"ripping costs out of the place\". He called it a \"cleansing experience\". </p><p>It might sound counter-intuitive and controversial, but there's something to be said about spending your way out of a tough time. By all means, Bill, cut the fat from the administration where you can – but don't rule out spending a dollar to make a dollar. It's a point often lost on unimaginative CEOs who default to convenient cost controls when given charge of a struggling outfit. You don't need a Harvard MBA to not spend money, but spending to actually make money – now that's some real CEO skill.</p><p>This is a time for cool heads and considered opinions, and it means not pandering to the well-meaning but without facts mob on the 'slash player wages until they start winning' bandwagon. Under no circumstances should players accept a pay cut without a clearly defined timeframe in which they can claw-back their losses. If anything, instead of cutting match payments the ARU should consider attaching massive incentive bonuses for wins. If the ARU is fair dinkum about its claim recent performances are hurting the bottom line, then quantify that amount and make it a bonus payable for actually winning Tests. </p><p>Cutting player wages and hard-won entitlements since the game went professional in 1996 will simply result in a massive player exodus overseas. And it will only entrench the existing culture of under-performance for those too silly or not good enough to flee. Instead of hedging against losses, the ARU needs to be spending to incentivise winning. Traditionalists will say the Wallaby jersey will outweigh money. Well, that may have been true back in the day of regular wins against the All Blacks and packed stadiums, but not these days when beating Scotland is a challenge and the gold jersey is being flogged online for peanuts. </p><p>Oh yes, lest we forget, the Wallabies are playing something resembling rugby this weekend. It's against the All Blacks again, only this time in Dunedin, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/17/australia-new-zealand-bledisloe-cup-team\">third and final instalment of the 2013 Bledisloe Cup series</a>. The Wallabies' wretched run against the ABs will turn one day, but not this Saturday. The 2013 ABs are a special bunch, probably one of the most accurate ever. Indeed, history will be very kind to them. Putting aside the result, it's worth keeping an eye on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/17/australia-new-zealand-bledisloe-cup-team\">the Wallabies debutant, Peter Betham</a>. The NZ-born flyer is a class act and should have been picked well before now. Finally, he gets his chance due to injury.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420308542|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|2975d97221aed3d24ba22dd4e6199cd642fdd28f -->",

        "body":"<h2>Socceroos' pain could be the A-League's gain</h2><p>Unless the incoming, yet-to-be-appointed Socceroos coach can find a way to reinvigorate the moribund national team (a job that seems to require not just a firm boot up the posterior but the rather-more-difficult-to-source elixir of youth) then he'll have to reinvent them instead. This may have unexpected benefits for the A-League. Prior to the Socceroos' thrashing by Brazil and France (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwDvF0NtgdU\">O Canada</a>, if only we could play you every week) there were no signs that sacked Holger Osieck was planning on forcing retirement on some of Australia's long-serving stars – never mind they're so entrenched that this would require ambushing them on the street, bundling them into an unmarked white van and driving them to a hidden location where they'd remain bound until the World Cup is over. </p><p>Now, however, there's a chance that forced retirements may indeed be in the offing, giving hope and possibly impetus to a bunch of fringe Socceroos and young up-and-comers who may have thought Australia's World Cup first team was hitherto a closed shop. No one is going to pretend that these players – the likes of Mitchell Duke, Tomi Juric, Trent Sainsbury, James Troisi, and Craig Goodwin – are superstars who have so far been inexplicably overlooked but they are young, talented, and, crucially, have the potential to improve. Will the chance of going to the World Cup – not to mention getting oiled up to play beach football in tiny bathers on Ipanema beach— see them lift their games to new levels? How could it not?</p><h2>More thrills in Adelaide</h2><p>If it's not envy-inducing enough that Adelaide United fans are offered Coopers at their home ground, on early evidence they also have a thrill-a-minute team to watch; and one led by a man with the best name in the A-League: Jeronimo Neumann. The Argentinian striker scored a double in the opening round and, with the Portuguese winger Fabio Ferreira chipping in with a goal and an assist, and Spaniard Isaias contributing a brain-explosion and subsequent red card, Adelaide were eminently watchable if still some way from the kind of 24-carat tiki-taka they're striving to produce. But how will they fare against Ange Postecoglou's well-drilled Victory? Especially now that Josep Gombau will have to change his starting XI given the suspensions of Isaias and Nigel Boogaard. </p><p>Much will depend on the midfield battle. The Victory were allowed to dominate possession against Heart in last week's Melbourne derby but Adelaide's high-tempo pressing game means Victory will need to work harder, and be more aggressive, to get to the final third. In this endeavour they'll miss the sure touches (<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/twomatch-ban-for-pablo-contreras-20131015-2vkto.html#ixzz2hrWyCgSh\">but not the sharp elbows</a>) of suspended marquee man Pablo Contreras. On the flip side Adelaide's sense of adventure may leave the back door ajar for Victory's Connor Pain, Archie Thompson, James Troisi and Mitch Nichols. Victory will also be buoyed by the presence of captain Mark Milligan whose understandable annoyance at making a pointless 30,000km round trip to France must be <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/football/mark-milligan-to-miss-internationals-against-france-and-canada/story-fn63e0vj-1226738119306\">tempered somewhat by the relief that he missed the French lesson</a>. It'll be an intriguing match.</p><h2>To counter or not to counter, that is the question</h2><p>Melbourne Heart will be hoping to set a season precedent by pulling more than 10,000 fans to their opening home game against the Mariners (and it might help that the Victorian Premier League grand final is being staged as a curtain-raiser), but what sort of show will they put on for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/MelbourneHeartFC\">the believers</a>? Fans don't tend to mind their team sitting deep and playing on the counter when away – as the Heart did so well last week in a cagey derby (thanks in big part to centre-backs Patrick Kisnorbo and Rob Wielaert who looked as cool and untroubled as they might have done lazing about a gentlemen's club in smoking jackets while listening to Les Murray crooning Frank Sinatra songs). </p><p>But when at home the unwritten rule says the home team are obliged to make the play. Either way, the Heart will be desperate for the services of Harry Kewell (it's a common refrain, but he's injured – though at least the problem is with his less-than-precious head and not his legs) who proved an effective conduit between defence and attack last week, and who showed signs of developing an understanding with pacey attackers David Williams, Mate Dugandzic and Golgol Mebrahtu (although Mebrahtu might lose his place to Michael Mifsud, returning from international duty). But the Mariners have beaten the Heart in seven of nine matches, and given their more than solid hit out against the Wanderers last week (highlighted by Mitchell Duke's lovely dinked finish from a dagger of a Marcos Flores through-ball), perhaps John Aloisi's team will prefer to again play on the counter. Whether or not this makes the fans happy might just come down to whether it works or not.</p><h2>Roar will be a better test of Sydney's start</h2><p>Brisbane were delighted to pinch an away win in the dying moments against Wellington last week, but Ivan Franjic's winner masked a rather sluggish performance from the Roar's much-heralded midfield, which turned over far too much ball. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/11/sydney-fc-newcastle-jets-a-league-match-report\">Sydney will be delighted with their opener against Newcastle</a>, but how much was the win down to Sydney's solid defence (overseen with distinction by centre-back Nikola Petkovic), and how much was it a result of Newcastle's attack, so blunt it wouldn't take an eye out. Certainly Brisbane's attack should prove a greater threat and as such you'd expect Sydney to be all over Besart Berisha like head lice on a kindergartner. The Albanian scored against Wellington and positioned himself well for more but he was let down by poor first touches which can put down to early season rust. But with that game under his belt, and a goal to boost his confidence (which needs little boosting), he'll be itching to add to his impressive goal record – four in four – against the Sky Blues.</p><h2>Will Michael Bridges spark the Jets?</h2><p>In light of their bright pre-season the Newcastle Jets were the disappointment of round one. Certainly their cause wasn't helped by midfielder Zenon Caravella who played a role in both goals, not least the first when he gifted Alessandro Del Piero a goal-scoring opportunity after barreling his team-mate Connor Chapman onto the ground as if Chapman were engulfed in flames. But calamitous defending aside, the real problem for the Jets was their inability to break down Sydney's organised defence, even though Sydney obliged them by sitting back and allowing them 59% of possession. Yet for all that Newcastle managed just one shot on target. With Emile Heskey still injured Newcastle will need to find a way to threaten Perth, who they have not beaten in five matches. In a sign that youth isn't always the answer, Jets coach Gary van Egmond will be hoping the return of veteran Michael Bridges in the No10 role will help create a few more chances for strikers Adam Taggart and Nathan Burns. Equally important will be the ability of Newcastle to unsettle Perth's back four by getting in behind them and to the byline. You could have had a picnic on Sydney's byline last week and not once had a Newcastle player trample your sandwiches. If they shoot blanks again, Newcastle fans will get an early case of the glooms. </p><h2>Round two</h2><p><strong>Friday:</strong> <br />Adelaide United v Melbourne Victory, Coopers Stadium</p><p><strong>Saturday:</strong><br />Melbourne Heart v Central Coast Mariners, AAMI Park<br />Brisbane Roar v Sydney FC, Suncorp Stadium</p><p><strong>Sunday:</strong><br />Newcastle Jets v Perth Glory, Hunter Stadium<br />Western Sydney Wanderers v Wellington Phoenix, Pirtek Stadium<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420218385|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|d9a593d6d568263176400c682b3b31920a5bb745 -->",

        "trailText":"<p><strong>Joe Gorman: </strong>SBS once hit the mark with its football coverage but its new show does not deliver on humour or insight</p>",
        "headline":"Thursday FC is a gargantuan disappointment",
        "body":"<p>I'm often told by people, real and on the internet, that I need to lighten up. It's true that my cynicism extends to a frighteningly wide range of subjects. At least I am democratic with my criticisms. Thursday FC, SBS's new live weekly entertainment program, added to my ever-growing list. </p><p>This won't be a popular view. There is nothing football fans in this country like more than a bit of self-congratulation and mutual backslapping. Any coverage of the A-League is good coverage. We'd applaud Robert Mugabe if he used the #wearefootball hashtag. </p><p>Before we get to what's wrong with Thursday FC, let's start with what is right. It won't take long. </p><p>It is nice to have football back on free-to-air television. Thursday FC forms part of a new-look football package on SBS2, built around a Friday night telecast of one A-League game. That's something. Not all of us wage-slaves can afford to penetrate Murdoch's paywalls. A Foxtel package doesn't come cheap, and even though there's football on there, everything else is a terrible waste of time and money. There are only so many reruns of Becker and National Geographic shark documentaries one can watch.</p><p>The concept for Thursday FC isn't all that bad. An edgy, fresh take on football with a bit of live music is a necessary addition to the trainwreck that is Australian sports broadcasting. The A-League's main demographic is young Australians,  and if there's one thing young people like, its larfs, tunes and sport. And being treated like they have the mental capacity of a happy clapping seal.</p><p>Lucy Zelic is a natural on camera. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4FdW9KUSULM\">Her pronunciation of European names will surely make Les Murray proud</a>, and harks back to those sepia-toned days when the directors at SBS actually gave a toss about their own charter. I still miss Mariana Rudan, but Zelic performed admirably nonetheless. Why not go for a double female presence?</p><p>The Roy Lichtenstein-esque pop art aesthetic is a nice touch. Never mind that David Zdrilic thinks Roy Lichtenstein is a holding midfielder for CSKA Moscow and pop art is breakfast, those graphics are rather easy on the eye.    </p><p>Also, there's not much else on the box on a Thursday night. On SBS1, there was a cooking show. On Channel 10, there was Revealed, with Hugh Riminton, which is a politics program that sounds like a sex show. Beauty and the Geek. Survivor. In that regard, Thursday FC <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z6GnUTVAF0\">Steve Bradburys</a> into top spot for this particular weeknight's viewing.</p><p>That said, the show, overall, is a gargantuan disappointment. It's an hour of over-enthusiastic football fans laughing at over-enthusiastic presenters cracking barely-there jokes in an over-enthusiastic fashion. </p><p>In fairness, it is hard to be funny – and TV shows such as this often need time to bed in. Even harder to be funnier on stage. Even harder still to be funny on stage in front of cameras, bright lights and a live audience. Presumably that's why SBS hired comedian Matt Okine as host, but regrettably he spends most of the evening looking as if he was going to explode with nervous energy, in between pulling strange faces at the camera when he's not in full gush. </p><p>The in-house band, Cartoon, is to pop rock what <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl-2nCxDfj0\">Australian rapper 360 is to hip hop</a>. Safe. Comfortable. Soul destroying. Last night's guest band, Evermore, should be forced back into whatever hole they've been hiding in for the past few years. </p><p>When guest Nick Giannopoulos stood up in the first episode and imitated a school yard wog boy, yelling \"poofta refareee!\" every football fan in the country got the reference, while Okine looked more uncomfortable than if he'd spewed on Ken Shipp's shoes after a big night out drinking kahlua and milk. </p><p>SBS is known as the station that accepts and invites cultural diversity and difference. Except of course, if you use the word 'soccer'. Now, I prefer the word 'football' as much as the next born-again round-ball evangelical, but a studio audience howling down the Harlem Globetrotters for calling the game 'soccer' during the first episode had to be seen to be believed. </p><p>The only decent segment in last night's program was the interview with Simon Harsent, who has taken some lovely snaps of football grounds <a href=\"http://www.simonharsent.com/the-beautiful-game/#\">for his latest photo exhibition, The Beautiful Game</a>. But he got about as much airtime as Mike 'Mr Cricket' Hussey to promote his book, Under the Southern Cross, the worst title for a book since Bob Katter's <a href=\"http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2012/06/25/1226407/907518-an-incredible-race-of-people.jpg\">An Incredible Race of People</a>.</p><p>Sadly, SBS's football coverage, like much of their content, reminds me of that guy you used to be friends with in high school. After graduation, you drifted apart as new friends were made and the hangers-on went through the great tea strainer of life. These days, you run into him at family parties and school reunions, but it's not the same. </p><p>This guy used to be cool in a daggy, unnerving kind of way. His politics were good. He believed in things. His bullshit radar was finely tuned. He didn't need to shout about his own importance. It was self-evident. He might have been a bit unusual, but at least you could trust him. He taught you things, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Ball_(TV_series)\">and he was always on the ball</a>. </p><p>Now, his politics have been reduced to sloganeering, he folds his ochre-brown chinos up at the ankle, wears plunging v-neck man cleavage shirts and sports one of those silly baseball caps with the sticker still on the underside of the flat-brim. He has lots of cool new friends that are painfully enthusiastic, energetic and hip. In pandering to trends, you're left wondering whether all the tattoo ink he's absorbed over the years has infected his soul irreparably. Also, he's way too excited to see you, and always <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f2LJXz-l2k\">wants to try and engage in the stop and chat</a>. </p><p>The worst part is that SBS have churned through some red-hot talent to get to this. That wonderful lunatic Damien Lovelock, a former frontman for pub-punk band The Celibate Rifles, used to host a nice little segment on The World Game called Fans' Corner. Sam, Santo and Ed's World Cup Fever during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3MdYf994Bo\">struck a careful balance between funny and football</a>. </p><p>But while Damo's back touring with the Celibate Rifles, Santo, Sam and Ed have since migrated behind Murdoch's paywall, taking their routine to Fox Sports. Splitters. </p><p>As the late great Johnny Warren once said, SBS has been Australia's best coach. Its Friday night telecasts still have some of the old magic, but Thursday's offering was a football lobotomy. Regardless, Thursday FC will be a hit with audiences. It wasn't long before the Thursday FC hashtag started trending on Twitter in Australia, and like a pack of deprived addicts, we were soon high off our football fix. </p><p>Thursday FC is a metaphor for what's wrong with football in this country. The show is a substandard product, especially compared with Sam, Santo and Ed's Total Football on Monday night. Yet everybody accepts Thursday FC because it looks and feels something like the game we love. We'd prefer the pure stuff, but most of us can't afford it and since demand outstrips supply, we end up scrambling over the crack cocaine.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420223105|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|94c81388fa719857d45bb2ce8cbf7486774b46a9 -->",

        "body":"<p>England will face two Australian Grand Final winners in their World Cup warm-up game against Italy on Saturday, but for Aidan Guerra and his Sydney Roosters captain Anthony Minichiello, the focus is very much on the Millennium Stadium seven days later.</p><p>Italy will make their World Cup debut against Wales in the second match of the opening-day double-header and Minichiello, the 33-year-old full-back who won 19 caps for Australia between 2003 and 2005, remains quietly confident in their ability to make a major impact on the tournament despite the late loss of Terry Campese and Craig Gower, who would have been their first-choice half-back pairing, with injuries.</p><p>\"We're thrilled to be a part of that opening ceremony,\" Minichiello said from the team's Loughborough training base. \"It's a great opportunity for us to show Wales and the rugby league world what playing for Italy means to us. We always knew Craig and Terry were 50-50, but we've got a bit of depth in the squad.</p><p>\"Everybody wants a run this weekend,\" he confirmed. \"I've just finished my first training session with the boys, to get the old bones going again. But it's more of a trial match for us, to get a game under our belt before the opener against Wales.\"</p><p>Minichiello's father is from Avellino, near Naples, and he actually represented Italy before he played for Australia, in the qualifying tournament for the 2000 World Cup when they were edged out by Lebanon. \"Carlo Napolitano was playing then and now he's our coach, and I'm pretty proud that he's asked me to captain the side,\" added Minichiello, who is also relishing a rare opportunity to line up alongside his younger brother, Mark, a second-row with the Gold Coast Titans.</p><p>\" My dad came over to Australia when he was 13 and he's thrilled that me and Mark are both playing for Italy. He'd be over here with us but my brother's got three kids, and my wife is pregnant, so we needed them to stay at home.\"</p><p>Saturday's game will be a homecoming for Napolitano, who grew up with the England veteran Adrian Morley – a former Roosters team-mate of Minichiello – in Salford, and has since become a driving force behind Italy's route to the World Cup. But the first rugby league meeting of England and Italy will not be a full international, as both teams will be allowed to make unlimited interchanges from a squad of 20, and will inevitably be something of a phoney war. England's coach Steve McNamara will be anxious not to reveal his hand to Australia ahead of the opening fixture in Cardiff, especially as the Salford venue for Saturday's game might have been arranged to suit the Kangaroos, who are based in Manchester.</p><p>It would therefore be dangerous to read too much into the team he announced , with Tom Briscoe starting ahead of Josh Charnley on the wing, Carl Ablett partnering Leroy Cudjoe in the centres, and Michael McIlorum selected at hooker ahead of James Roby, who joins Charnley on the interchange bench.</p><p>With Sean O'Loughlin not considered to give the Wigan captain more time to recover from his performance in the Grand Final – his first match after five weeks out with an achilles problem – and the Warrington second-row Ben Westwood suspended, Zak Hardaker and Tom Burgess would seem to be the major losers from McNamara's selection, as they have been relegated to an England Knights team who will face Samoa in the first part of Saturday's double-header in Salford.</p><p>That means Sam Burgess, the eldest of the three brothers in the World Cup squad, is the only one to start, with Tom's twin George on the interchange bench.</p><p>But Hardaker's selection at centre for the Knights could be significant, as it suggests he is one of the options McNamara is considering for Cardiff in arguably England's weakest position, following the loss through injury of the Yorkshire-born Brisbane Broncos back Jack Reed. Hardaker has played most of the season for Leeds at full-back while Ablett has been in the second row. Kallum Watkins, the Mancunian youngster who was badly affected by an injury in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/27/wigan-leeds-super-league-semi-final\" title=\"\">Rhinos' play-off defeat at Wigan</a> three weeks ago, will start on the bench this weekend, but must remain the most likely option to line up against Greg Inglis in Cardiff.</p><p>The picture on this article was changed on 18 October</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420277336|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|356f1aec4c0ebf01826ba45d5ddd48c381266973 -->",

        "body":"<p>Only one of three Burgess brothers will start for England in their World Cup warm-up game against Italy in Salford on Saturday. Sam Burgess, the eldest and most established of the three siblings included in the squad, has been named at loose-forward with George, one of the 21-year-old twins, on a seven-man interchange bench.</p><p>Tom Burgess, who only forced his way into the South Sydney team late in the National Rugby League season and was therefore a surprise inclusion in the England squad, is one of two players, along with Zak Hardaker of Leeds, who drop into a Knights team to face Samoa in the first part of a double header at the City of Salford Stadium.</p><p>Perhaps significantly, Hardaker is listed at centre, rather than at full-back, where he has played all season for Leeds – suggesting that the England coach, Steve McNamara, sees him as a possible contender for that position, which has become a problem area since the loss of the Yorkshire-born Brisbane Broncos centre Jack Reed through injury.</p><p>McNamara has switched Carl Ablett, another Leeds player who has spent most of the season in the second row, to the centre against Italy, where he will be partnered by Huddersfield's Leroy Cudjoe, with the fourth centre contender, Kallum Watkins, on the interchange bench.</p><p>Other eye-catching and potentially significant selections are Tom Briscoe ahead of Josh Charnley on the wing and Michael McIlorum ahead of James Roby at hooker. But McNamara will be anxious to avoid giving too much away to Australia's coach, Tim Sheens, who has chosen not to arrange a warm-up game in the run-in to the tournament opener, between England and the Kangaroos, at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on Saturday week.</p><p>Two members of England's 24-man squad were not considered – Sean O'Loughlin, the Wigan captain who has played only two matches in the past two months because of achilles problems, and the Warrington second-row Ben Westwood, who is suspended.</p><h2>England team to play Italy, Saturday 4.30pm</h2><p>S Tomkins (Wigan); Briscoe (Hull), Cudjoe (Huddersfield), Ablett (Leeds), Hall (Leeds); Chase (Castleford), Sinfield (Leeds, capt); Graham (Canterbury), McIlorum (Wigan), Mossop (Wigan), Hock (Widnes), Farrell (Wigan), S Burgess (South Sydney).

        "body":"<p>David Warner has found form at just the right time, blasting a ruthless century for NSW against Queensland in the Ryobi Cup.</p><p>Warner has endured a lean spell at both international and domestic level, and was dropped from the Australian one-day side because of poor form.</p><p>He enjoyed a brilliant innings on Thursday though, taking advantage of the batsman-friendly North Sydney Oval. Warner smashed 139 off 126 balls to reassert himself in the minds of selectors. In all, he hammered 13 fours and six sixes in his innings.</p><p>Warner's animated celebration upon bringing up his century from 96 balls, gave an indication of how much he needed a big score. However, his jubilation later turned to disgust, when he spooned one down the ground off Michael Neser.</p><p>Nonetheless, it was a major personal victory for Warner. To start the Ryobi Cup the left-hander had fallen for 4, 0 and 17, with pressure beginning to mount on his Test spot.</p><p>Warner missed the opening two Tests of the Ashes series in England after he was stood down for the Champions Trophy for punching Joe Root in a nightclub. He forced his way back into the team for the third Test at Manchester, after scoring a massive ton for Australia A in South Africa, but despite a 71 in the fourth Test at Chester-le-Street his place at the top of the Australian order was far from secure in a batting line-up that was struggling for consistency.</p><p>Warner was given a slap on the wrist for missing a Sydney grade match, and was warned by NSW chief executive Andrew Jones to cut out off-field distractions. Thursday, though, saw Warner return to his free-hitting best, as he scored his runs all around the ground.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420208790|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|51799f5c4b0e304793ece741905883813d03aa14 -->",

Jeronimo and the Victory goalkeeper Nathan Coe steamed at each other, with the ball between them, in the 20th minute and the Reds' the striker milked slight contact, diving forward, and the referee Alan Milliner awarded a penalty.</p><p>Adelaide's Sergio Cirio scored twice from the spot: his initial conversion was disallowed, then he fooled Coe with a shrewd second attempt, aimed in a different direction than the first.</p><p>Two minutes later, Jeronimo scored after Adelaide's lively substitute Awer Mabil launched a speculative shot from just inside the box. The ball deflected from Melbourne defender Adrian Leijer, struck the near post and, by chance, fell to Jeronimo who tapped in.</p><p>Melbourne should have reduced the deficit in the 35th minute when Archie Thompson, after a piercing run, had the Reds' goalkeeper Eugene Galekovic beat but elected to pass to Nichols instead. Nichols scored from close range, only to be incorrectly ruled offside.</p><p>Melbourne turned the tide in the second half but a series of shots – from Leijer, Troisi and Kosta Barbarouses – all narrowly missed but substitute Finkler's 79th minute goal, from a low shot on the turn, gave the visitors hope. Three minutes into injury time, Troisi equalised with a shot that crashed in off the bar.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420344315|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|7fff14193ab673cf21ebcc988e0452098ac35f70 -->",

At least I am democratic with my criticisms. Thursday FC, SBS's new live weekly entertainment program, added to my ever-growing list. </p><p>This won't be a popular view. There is nothing football fans in this country like more than a bit of self-congratulation and mutual backslapping. Any coverage of the A-League is good coverage. We'd applaud Robert Mugabe if he used the #wearefootball hashtag. </p><p>Before we get to what's wrong with Thursday FC, let's start with what is right. It won't take long. </p><p>It is nice to have football back on free-to-air television. Thursday FC forms part of a new-look football package on SBS2, built around a Friday night telecast of one A-League game. That's something. Not all of us wage-slaves can afford to penetrate Murdoch's paywalls. A Foxtel package doesn't come cheap, and even though there's football on there, everything else is a terrible waste of time and money. There are only so many reruns of Becker and National Geographic shark documentaries one can watch.</p><p>The concept for Thursday FC isn't all that bad. An edgy, fresh take on football with a bit of live music is a necessary addition to the trainwreck that is Australian sports broadcasting. The A-League's main demographic is young Australians,  and if there's one thing young people like, its larfs, tunes and sport. And being treated like they have the mental capacity of a happy clapping seal.</p><p>Lucy Zelic is a natural on camera. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4FdW9KUSULM\">Her pronunciation of European names will surely make Les Murray proud</a>, and harks back to those sepia-toned days when the directors at SBS actually gave a toss about their own charter. I still miss Mariana Rudan, but Zelic performed admirably nonetheless. Why not go for a double female presence?</p><p>The Roy Lichtenstein-esque pop art aesthetic is a nice touch. Never mind that David Zdrilic thinks Roy Lichtenstein is a holding midfielder for CSKA Moscow and pop art is breakfast, those graphics are rather easy on the eye.    </p><p>Also, there's not much else on the box on a Thursday night. On SBS1, there was a cooking show. On Channel 10, there was Revealed, with Hugh Riminton, which is a politics program that sounds like a sex show. Beauty and the Geek. Survivor. In that regard, Thursday FC <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z6GnUTVAF0\">Steve Bradburys</a> into top spot for this particular weeknight's viewing.</p><p>That said, the show, overall, is a gargantuan disappointment. It's an hour of over-enthusiastic football fans laughing at over-enthusiastic presenters cracking barely-there jokes in an over-enthusiastic fashion. </p><p>In fairness, it is hard to be funny – and TV shows such as this often need time to bed in. Even harder to be funnier on stage. Even harder still to be funny on stage in front of cameras, bright lights and a live audience. Presumably that's why SBS hired comedian Matt Okine as host, but regrettably he spends most of the evening looking as if he was going to explode with nervous energy, in between pulling strange faces at the camera when he's not in full gush. </p><p>The in-house band, Cartoon, is to pop rock what <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl-2nCxDfj0\">Australian rapper 360 is to hip hop</a>. Safe. Comfortable. Soul destroying. Last night's guest band, Evermore, should be forced back into whatever hole they've been hiding in for the past few years. </p><p>When guest Nick Giannopoulos stood up in the first episode and imitated a school yard wog boy, yelling \"poofta refareee!\" every football fan in the country got the reference, while Okine looked more uncomfortable than if he'd spewed on Ken Shipp's shoes after a big night out drinking kahlua and milk. </p><p>SBS is known as the station that accepts and invites cultural diversity and difference. Except of course, if you use the word 'soccer'. Now, I prefer the word 'football' as much as the next born-again round-ball evangelical, but a studio audience howling down the Harlem Globetrotters for calling the game 'soccer' during the first episode had to be seen to be believed. </p><p>The only decent segment in last night's program was the interview with Simon Harsent, who has taken some lovely snaps of football grounds <a href=\"http://www.simonharsent.com/the-beautiful-game/#\">for his latest photo exhibition, The Beautiful Game</a>. But he got about as much airtime as Mike 'Mr Cricket' Hussey to promote his book, Under the Southern Cross, the worst title for a book since Bob Katter's <a href=\"http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2012/06/25/1226407/907518-an-incredible-race-of-people.jpg\">An Incredible Race of People</a>.</p><p>Sadly, SBS's football coverage, like much of their content, reminds me of that guy you used to be friends with in high school. After graduation, you drifted apart as new friends were made and the hangers-on went through the great tea strainer of life. These days, you run into him at family parties and school reunions, but it's not the same. </p><p>This guy used to be cool in a daggy, unnerving kind of way. His politics were good. He believed in things. His bullshit radar was finely tuned. He didn't need to shout about his own importance. It was self-evident. He might have been a bit unusual, but at least you could trust him. He taught you things, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Ball_(TV_series)\">and he was always on the ball</a>. </p><p>Now, his politics have been reduced to sloganeering, he folds his ochre-brown chinos up at the ankle, wears plunging v-neck man cleavage shirts and sports one of those silly baseball caps with the sticker still on the underside of the flat-brim. He has lots of cool new friends that are painfully enthusiastic, energetic and hip. In pandering to trends, you're left wondering whether all the tattoo ink he's absorbed over the years has infected his soul irreparably. Also, he's way too excited to see you, and always <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f2LJXz-l2k\">wants to try and engage in the stop and chat</a>. </p><p>The worst part is that SBS have churned through some red-hot talent to get to this. That wonderful lunatic Damien Lovelock, a former frontman for pub-punk band The Celibate Rifles, used to host a nice little segment on The World Game called Fans' Corner. Sam, Santo and Ed's World Cup Fever during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3MdYf994Bo\">struck a careful balance between funny and football</a>. </p><p>But while Damo's back touring with the Celibate Rifles, Santo, Sam and Ed have since migrated behind Murdoch's paywall, taking their routine to Fox Sports. Splitters. </p><p>As the late great Johnny Warren once said, SBS has been Australia's best coach. Its Friday night telecasts still have some of the old magic, but Thursday's offering was a football lobotomy. Regardless, Thursday FC will be a hit with audiences. It wasn't long before the Thursday FC hashtag started trending on Twitter in Australia, and like a pack of deprived addicts, we were soon high off our football fix. </p><p>Thursday FC is a metaphor for what's wrong with football in this country. The show is a substandard product, especially compared with Sam, Santo and Ed's Total Football on Monday night. Yet everybody accepts Thursday FC because it looks and feels something like the game we love. We'd prefer the pure stuff, but most of us can't afford it and since demand outstrips supply, we end up scrambling over the crack cocaine.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420223105|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|94c81388fa719857d45bb2ce8cbf7486774b46a9 -->",

        "headline":"The ARU must speculate to accumulate",
        "body":"<p>You know things are really bad when the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) sends out spam email heralding the 'ultimate wallabies sale' with Wallaby kit going at Chinese factory wholesale prices. </p><p>That's exactly what the ARU did last week, and it's an apt metaphor for the current state of Australian rugby – almost broke, utterly dishevelled and on the brink of irrelevance as far as the domestic market is concerned.</p><p>The tone of recent talks between the ARU and players' union is worrying, with the Rugby Union Players Association (Rupa) boss Greg Harris so far <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/wallabies-players-pay-cut-rugby-union\">not ruling out a cut in match payments</a>. In fact, there are unconfirmed reports a new collective bargaining agreement could altogether end players earning match payments of $14,000 a Test, win, lose or draw. If that's true, let's hope the new agreement has an appropriate trade-off, for example higher base retainers for ARU top-up selected players, or some kind of claw-back mechanism for match payments when the ARU is on firmer financial footing.</p><p>These are dangerous days for both the ARU and players' union with a lot of bile floating around about players being paid over the odds. That's absolute rubbish. Sure, the Wallabies have done themselves few favours with shambolic efforts on the field – but the fact remains that there is no conclusive link between rugby team performance and pay. What we have instead is a massive swell of Moneyball-inspired public opinion and commentary, some of it sadly led by former Wallabies, against player wages. It's dangerous because people who should know better are actually buying into it. </p><p>The players, especially, need to be on red alert and ensure Rupa does its bidding on this crucial issue. However, Rupa's recent placating statements suggests it could roll over. That would be a massive miscalculation on its part, one raising serious doubts about Rupa's effectiveness as a voice for professional players. Alas, if only the players had Khoder Nasser in their corner right now.</p><p>Management slashing employee wages is not the cure-all that it's made out to be, and certainly not in rugby where player value is essentially determined by global forces. Too often employees get the blame when the real issue is the quality of management decision-making. The ARU boss Bill Pulver – a multi-millionaire thanks to shares in <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/news/william-pulver-a-local-boy-who-made-it-big/story-fn7x8me2-1226108601217\">NetRatings which sold for $820m in 2007</a> – has gone on record saying he's spent the last six months \"ripping costs out of the place\". He called it a \"cleansing experience\". </p><p>It might sound counter-intuitive and controversial, but there's something to be said about spending your way out of a tough time. By all means, Bill, cut the fat from the administration where you can – but don't rule out spending a dollar to make a dollar. It's a point often lost on unimaginative CEOs who default to convenient cost controls when given charge of a struggling outfit. You don't need a Harvard MBA to not spend money, but spending to actually make money – now that's some real CEO skill.</p><p>This is a time for cool heads and considered opinions, and it means not pandering to the well-meaning but without facts mob on the 'slash player wages until they start winning' bandwagon. Under no circumstances should players accept a pay cut without a clearly defined timeframe in which they can claw-back their losses. If anything, instead of cutting match payments the ARU should consider attaching massive incentive bonuses for wins. If the ARU is fair dinkum about its claim recent performances are hurting the bottom line, then quantify that amount and make it a bonus payable for actually winning Tests. </p><p>Cutting player wages and hard-won entitlements since the game went professional in 1996 will simply result in a massive player exodus overseas. And it will only entrench the existing culture of under-performance for those too silly or not good enough to flee. Instead of hedging against losses, the ARU needs to be spending to incentivise winning. Traditionalists will say the Wallaby jersey will outweigh money. Well, that may have been true back in the day of regular wins against the All Blacks and packed stadiums, but not these days when beating Scotland is a challenge and the gold jersey is being flogged online for peanuts. </p><p>Oh yes, lest we forget, the Wallabies are playing something resembling rugby this weekend. It's against the All Blacks again, only this time in Dunedin, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/17/australia-new-zealand-bledisloe-cup-team\">third and final instalment of the 2013 Bledisloe Cup series</a>. The Wallabies' wretched run against the ABs will turn one day, but not this Saturday. The 2013 ABs are a special bunch, probably one of the most accurate ever. Indeed, history will be very kind to them. Putting aside the result, it's worth keeping an eye on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/17/australia-new-zealand-bledisloe-cup-team\">the Wallabies debutant, Peter Betham</a>. The NZ-born flyer is a class act and should have been picked well before now. Finally, he gets his chance due to injury.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420308542|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|2975d97221aed3d24ba22dd4e6199cd642fdd28f -->",

        "body":"<p>The India trio Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan put on a batting masterclass as they chased down a huge target of 360 to win the second one-day international against Australia by nine wickets. Australia had looked set to take a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series after compiling 359 for five at Jaipur, with all of their top five contributing half-centuries and captain George Bailey leading the way with a brilliant unbeaten 92.</p><p>However, those knocks were all overshadowed by India's top three as  Sharma (141 not out), Kohli (100 not out) and Dhawan (95) saw the host nation romp home with more than six overs to spare.</p><p>Kohli's 52-ball knock, which included seven sixes and eight fours, was the fastest ODI century by an Indian and the seventh fastest ever, while Sharma was similarly destructive as he hit 17 fours and four maximums in his 123-ball innings.</p><p>Dhawan was no slouch either as he collected 14 boundaries before falling just short of his century when he edged the 86th ball he faced, bowled by James Faulkner, behind to Brad Haddin, who had earlier dropped the opener off a steepling leading edge when he was on 18. That wicket brought an end to an opening stand of 176 in 26 overs but was the only success Australia's bowlers enjoyed on what was a batsman's day.</p><p>Earlier, it was the India attack who found themselves on the receiving end of some brutal batting as Australia, who won the first ODI by 72 runs after scoring 304, again set what had appeared to be a tough target.</p><p>Their captain, Bailey, led the from the front with 92 off 50 balls, including five sixes and eight fours, while Phil Hughes (83), Shane Watson (59), Glenn Maxwell (53) and Aaron Finch (50) were also among the runs. The  total proved to be nowhere big enough as India chased it down in style to level the series.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420177686|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|14168379ccbe79a3e321d14b051053d757557445 -->",

        "headline":"Adelaide United: 10 years on",
        "body":"<p>Rebirth has become a familiar theme for football fans in Australia. The seemingly fatal plunge into crisis is invariably followed by a splendid renaissance. Football historian Ian Syson notes that the game has experienced several periods of boom and bust dating back to the 1880s. Journalists, fans and administrators have grappled with the \"sleeping giant\" complex for several decades. </p><p>Just last year, in April, the Western Sydney Wanderers were born after Clive Palmer's catastrophic Gold Coast United were stripped of their A-League license. Wellington Phoenix owe their moniker to their unlikely rise from the ashes of the New Zealand Knights, an Auckland based franchise that folded in 2007. </p><p>In 2003, football in Adelaide underwent its own revolution in the final season of the National Soccer League (NSL). After Adelaide City (nee Juventus) collapsed just weeks before the start of the season, a new entity, Adelaide United, was hastily thrown together. The club-on-the-run was granted six weeks to prepare, entering the competition in round five, with the earlier fixtures played as midweek catch-up games later in the season.</p><p>The transition from 'City' to 'United' might have seemed minor to outsiders, but the reformation in Adelaide was a microcosm of a larger debate happening in the football community. In April 2003, the Howard Government commissioned the Crawford Report, before Frank Lowy appointed his NSL Task Force in October. </p><p>While the Crawford Report focused primarily on reforming the game's administration, the NSL Task Force – which was headed by several businessmen and former Socceroos Johnny Warren, Charlie Yankos and Jack Reilly – recommended \"the current NSL must cease operations, with a new national competition established in its place.\" </p><p>With the seeds planted for the birth of a new competition, Adelaide United were the youngest of four premature children in the A-League litter. The eldest was Perth Glory, which entered the NSL in 1996 to enormous fanfare, while the middle, more troublesome children were the New Zealand Knights, who entered the NSL in 1999, and Newcastle United Jets, who replaced the Newcastle Breakers in 2000. </p><p>While Newcastle had fielded a single team throughout most of the 28 seasons of the NSL, the New Zealand Knights and Perth Glory were brand new franchises, representing the first club in their respective areas to participate in a national football competition. </p><p>Adelaide United, however, would achieve something quite different. In a recent article for the FFA, <a href=\"http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/kosmina-opinion-display/adelaide--still-united-ten-years-on/76025\">inaugural coach John Kosmina commented</a>, \"the arrival of Adelaide United changed everything. It was a virtual ménage au trois between the South Australian Soccer Federation, the fans, and the local state league clubs. Everyone felt a sense of ownership. Everyone got a piece of the action.\"</p><p>The city of churches had been home to two sides during the NSL. The Italian-backed Adelaide City and the Greek-backed West Adelaide formed a fierce rivalry which had as much to do with ethnicity as it had geography. </p><p>In this context, 'United' was a reference to a coming together of the tribes, and the club strategically chose to wear the red, blue and gold of South Australia. Past greats of football in Adelaide were welcomed into the fold, as well as South Australian sporting luminaries Lleyton Hewitt, Gavin Wanganeen and women's basketball star Rachel Sporn, who all attended the first match. Premier Mike Rann was the club's No1 ticket-holder. </p><p>Community radio stations were warned they had to broadcast in English, before the rights were sold exclusively to Radio 5DN, giving the club a mainstream commercial partner. </p><p>To the Adelaide Advertiser football writer Meno Toutsidis, the public yearned for a team \"as identifiably South Australian as the Adelaide Crows, Port Adelaide, the 36ers, the Redbacks, Thunderbirds and Lightning.\"</p><p>On local businessman Gordon Pickard's dollar, Adelaide were determined to represent the whole of South Australia. The board had a distinct South Australian flavour. Their first coach, Kosmina, came from a strong local football family, while captain Aurelio Vidmar was born and bred in Adelaide. And while most of the squad was inherited from Adelaide City, the decision was made to select new players from the local state competition to provide a bridge for South Australian talent to perform on a national stage. </p><p>Having spent two seasons with Brisbane Strikers, in 2003 Richie Alagich took a job with the South Australian State Federation as a development officer. \"My wife was pregnant with our first child at the time, and I decided I couldn't wait around,\" Alagich told Guardian Australia. \"I thought, if I don't play again for the national league, no dramas. There's more important things.\" Despite this decision, the birth of Adelaide United gave Alagich another chance to play in the NSL. \"I was fortunate in that regard,\" says Alagich.</p><p>The club's first season would be a success, but the first match at Hindmarsh Stadium exactly 10 years ago today was where 'the People's Team' were truly forged. \"I still get goosebumps thinking about walking out that first time to that crowd\", remembers Alagich. \"The first 10 or 15 minutes you couldn't even hear each other on the pitch because of the noise and the excitement.\" </p><p>The official statistics say 15,568 fans squeezed into Hindmarsh Stadium that night, but as Andrew Howe, an United fan and now the resident statistician at the FFA, says, \"I remember one of the main head Adelaide United admin guys telling me how they probably had 2,000 more than official capacity, but they couldn't admit that because of legal implications.</p><p>\"Because I was trying to sell as many copies of my match day program that night, I can vouch for the mayhem at the turnstiles.\"</p><p>A bumper crowd, sparkling fireworks, pre-game entertainment and the weight of expectation all dovetailed to set the stage for their debut match against Brisbane Strikers, one of the competition's strongest sides. </p><p>\"It was a coming together of the entire football community\" remembers Adam Butler, a foundation member of Adelaide United. \"Carl Veart scored the winning goal and Richie Alagich set him up, they were two club legends. It was almost romantic.\" </p><p>For Alagich, that night in front of a full Hindmarsh Stadium has become a memorable moment in his career. \"I get the feeling there was a lot of other players that think that as well. It's not something we thought we'd see in our playing days.\"</p><p>In his match report, Howe suggested, \"that a new team can generate such popularity will instil confidence in the sport's power-brokers and show potential investors that large-scale support for the domestic game does currently exist.\"</p><p>Howe's hypothesis proved correct. Remo Nogarotto, one of the members of the NSL Task Force and then chairman of the competition, was impressed with what he saw at Hindmarsh Stadium. </p><p>\"It was pretty clear that the game had finally 'arrived' as a mainstream sporting product, albeit without the traditional ethnic fan base that had sustained and nurtured the games development for over 50 years\" said Nogarotto in an interview with Guardian Australia. </p><p>\"As a businessman I found the former positively exciting. As a fan and historian of the game I found the latter very sad. It was as if decades of toil and financial sacrifice by the games pioneers had been ripped from the few football annals we had.\"</p><p>According to Adam Butler, \"Adelaide United tried to respect where the club came from and its roots. You can't deny or ignore the history of the game.\" As a former Adelaide City fan, Butler personified the transition from old to new. \"I loved Adelaide City games, and I thoroughly enjoyed the multicultural aspect of the club.\" </p><p>Still, sentimentality and business have never made for comfortable bedfellows, especially in football. Adelaide United were bold, they were exciting, and they scratched the football community right where they itched. </p><p>Ten years on, some of that community focus has waned. To Alagich, change occurred out of circumstance, not design. \"Once a week we'd go and train at a local club, at night because we were still part-time footballers. There was always 300 or 400 people at training, really engaging with the local clubs and the football community.\"</p><p>\"With the A-League we were full time players. As the times change we had to find new ways of engaging the people. We were now training during the day, so if we were to go and do a session at the club, no-one would be there because everybody was working and the kids were at school. Those dynamics have to change.\"</p><p>As the A-League replaced the NSL, once again it was in with the new and out with the old. Many fans believe the FFA has taken some of the personality out of the club. There is no longer such an emphasis on local players, and 'the People's Team' motto has since slipped away. To the FFA, the 'new' clubs were considered the sexiest, in particular Sydney FC, Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.</p><p>Tomorrow evening, <a href=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/p480x480/1374237_10153426792735019_1616793292_n.jpg\">Adelaide United will play in the original club strip</a>, which has been emblazoned with <a href=\"http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/adelaideunited/news-display/Ten-year-anniversary--commemorative-logo/66970\">a special commemorative logo</a> designed by the Adelaide United Historical Committee, of which Adam Butler is a member.</p><p>To Butler, Adelaide \"will always be the People's Team. They were born that way and it must remain that way.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420094016|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|6effcb4d427e0d6369c78352cf48f1fb0bfa9c17 -->",

        "body":"<p>Australia have sacked Socceroos coach Holger Osieck following their 6-0 thumping by France at the Parc des Princes in Paris on Friday night.<br /> <br />Osieck was informed of the decision to end his three-year tenure by Football Federation Australia (FFA) shortly after the heavy defeat.<br /> <br />FFA chairman Frank Lowy said: \"The decision is based on the longer term issues of the rejuvenation of the Socceroos team and the preparations for the World Cup and the Asian Cup.<br /> <br />\"FFA has set a strategic objective of having a highly competitive team in Brazil and then handing over a team capable of winning the Asian Cup on home soil in January 2015.<br /> <br />\"We have come to the conclusion that change is necessary to meet those objectives. </p><p>\"I thank Holger for his contribution to Australian football and wish him well in his future endeavours.\" </p><p>Australia have already booked their place at next year's World Cup finals but Osieck came under increasing pressure following a nervous qualification campaign.<br /> <br />A second successive 6-0 reverse – Australia lost by the same scoreline against Brazil last month – proved the final straw for FFA to act.<br /> <br />Osieck and the players were informed of the decision two hours after the final whistle in Paris.<br /> <br />Socceroos midfielder Tim Cahill tweeted: \"Want to say thank you to Holger for getting us to our third World Cup. Is this a first: get us to the WC and get the sack? Sad day for Football in Oz.\"<br /> <br />The decision comes less than nine months before next summer's World Cup finals but was not unexpected after speculation in Australia that FFA had begun to sound out a new manager.<br /> <br />One of the names reportedly on FFA's wish-list is former boss Guus Hiddink, who came in at short notice to lead the Socceroos to the 2006 World Cup, where they reached the knockout stages.<br /> <br />Hiddink is a fan favourite in Australia and is out of work after he resigned as coach of Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala in July.<br /> <br />Assistant coach Aurelio Vidmar will be in charge for their next match in London on Tuesday night against Canada – coincidentally the only national team Osieck has previously managed.<br /> <br />The 65-year-old German was brought in shortly after the last World Cup in South Africa when an ageing Socceroos squad was blamed for a group-stage exit.<br /> <br />Osieck, who was Franz Beckenbauer's assistant when Germany won the 1990 World Cup, initially had success leading Australia to a 2-1 win over his home nation in Monchengladbach while also steering the Socceroos to the final of the Asian Cup in 2011.<br /> <br />Qualification for the World Cup was not straightforward, however, and a shock loss to Jordan midway through the campaign left them on the brink of disaster as he kept faith in experienced players.<br /> <br />A late run of results eventually sealed Australia's place at a third successive World Cup finals, although it was only confirmed by an 83rd-minute Josh Kennedy header in the final game of their qualification campaign at home to Iraq.<br /> <br />Osieck's perceived over-reliance on the last remaining \"Golden Generation\" of Australia's players was at the heart of the criticism he faced and following Friday night's defeat – when he handed a starting debut to Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Mitch Langerak – he had said he would not walk away from his position. </p><p>\"That's not my call,\" he told Fox Sport Australia.<br /> <br />\"Two heavy losses of that extent gives some food for discussion [about my job]. The merits of the past are forgotten when this happens.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419764857|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|aea60d6bcf2a70178a7a096b80f7f0113b58d1e1 -->",

Those charges have been dropped,\" he said.</p><p>Asked what he was guilty of, Hird replied: \"There's a level of responsibility you have as a senior coach. A senior coach is responsible for a lot of things at a football club.</p><p>\"There's things that went on at our football club that shouldn't have happened last year and as senior coach I have to take some responsibility for what happened and not doing more to stop it.\"</p><p>Hird confirmed he had dropped his supreme court action against the AFL – launched last week after the AFL released its charge sheet against Essendon and four club officials, including him – because he believed it was \"time to move on\".</p><p>\"I think it wasn't good for anyone in our game, particularly our players and our club,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our players need to be able to go and play football and move on. Fighting a battle in the supreme court against the AFL on a matter of principle, I think, was probably not the right thing to do for our players and even for myself and my family.

They went out at the group stages of the ICC Champions Trophy and were soundly beaten by India in the recent Test series. </p><p>There have been problems off the field too: David Warner was disciplined after attacking England's Joe Root in a bar, while four players were dropped on the India tour for failing to respond to a request from the management to pinpoint the reasons for Australia's heavy defeats.</p><p>The former Australia bowler Damian Fleming highlighted the tour of India as a major part of the decision: \"I'm shocked at the timing [but] I would have thought he was on thin ice with the performances of the team on the field in the last six months, particularly that disastrous Indian tour where we lost 4-0, but also what's been happening off the field.</p><p>\"It just shows for me that they're not united and for the leadership within the Australian team, that's the biggest job, to make sure everyone's going in the right direction and that hasn't appeared to be happening in the last six months.\" </p><p>Darren Lehmann, who is in England to after coaching Australia A on their tour, is expected to take over. Lehmann has coached Queensland to the Sheffield Shield, and also has experience in the Indian Premier League. </p><p>Fleming told the BBC he thought Lehmann would be a good replacement: \"[He] was a fine Australian player, they love him up in Yorkshire, he's a legend there and he's done some good work for Queensland. He took over a couple of years ago, they've won the Sheffield Shield, the Big Bash.</p><p>\"He's got the blend of being a fine Australian cricketer in his own right and you don't want to get on the wrong side of [Lehmann].</p><p>\"The only question for him is when you are coaching a new team you want to bring in your own structures. Is he going to be able to so that 20 days out from the Ashes? I don't think so. But I'd like an Australian coach and particularly one who's been a fine player like Darren Lehmann.\" </p><p>Arthur coached South Africa from between 2005 and 2010, and was the first foreigner to take charge of Australia when he was appointed in 2011. His contract had been due to run until the end of the 2015 World Cup.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/poll/2013/jun/24/mickey-arthur-sacked-australia-ashes-coach\">• Poll: was it right to sack Arthur so close to the Ashes?</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/411414492|2013-10-18T13:42:00Z|addebcc4a1c493badca536eef3d437ccf6f88235 -->",
