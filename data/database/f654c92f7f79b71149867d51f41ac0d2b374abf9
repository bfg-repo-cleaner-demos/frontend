The astonishing waves in Portugal rose up from a storm-tossed sea driven in from the Atlantic, as crowds watched wrapped up against the rain.</p><p>Saint Jude killed at least 11 people across Europe and the waves were so dangerous in Portugal on Monday that Brazilian star Maya Gabeira was nearly drowned. She was being knocked unconscious and broke her ankle but was rescued by her compatriot Burle.</p><p>Cotton, from Devon, and Burle are now waiting to see if one of them will be crowned champion, as experts measure the height of their respective waves. The first images, <a href=\"http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/9464-has-carlos-burle-beaten-mcnamaras-largest-wave-record\" title=\"\">seen on the Surfer Today website,</a> suggest either one of them may have gone over the current record, set in the same spot in November 2011 by American Garrett McNamara.</p><p>The record will be announced in May next year, at the Billabong XXL awards.</p><p>Cotton said: \"They were absolutely giant waves, I don't know how you would even begin to measure them. It was really exciting, a big day.\"</p><p>It was also something of a payback for Cotton. He had towed McNamara out on a jetski to ride the wave that set the record two years ago and it was now the turn of his friend to repay the favour. \"I got him the Guinness world record, at the same place, and now he towed me into this one. I've been here in Portugal for a month now and we were lucky to be here, in the right spot,\" he said.</p><p>But big-wave surfing is incredibly hazardous, as the dramatic rescue of Gabeira revealed. \"It's really dangerous out there. It's frightening, there's massive amounts of water surging through. It's deadly,\" said Cotton.</p><p>\"Maya was out on the waves when she came off her board, and was knocked unconscious. She is one of the best surfers in the world, a very experienced big-wave surfer, has surfed everywhere around the world, won numerous awards.\".</p><p>Talking to the <a href=\"http://stabmag.com/carlos-burle-saves-maya-gabeiras-life-surfs-biggest-wave-ever/\" title=\"\">surfing website Stab </a>shortly after rescuing his friend, Burle spoke about the dramatic moment when he thought she had died. \"She got caught inside by a giant wave and she disappeared. Man, she was gone for about five minutes. I couldn't find her anywhere. I was so scared. I didn't want to lose my friend, you know? Then I saw her and raced towards her.\"</p><p>Having found her, Burle then lost her again among the waves and feared that she had drowned, before seeing her floating face down.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421233165'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/29/1383057769418/Brazilian-surfer-Carlos-B-010.jpg' alt='Brazilian surfer Carlos Burle, (2nd r) watches footage of himself suring giant waves in Nazare' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Brazilian surfer Carlos Burle, (2nd r) watches footage of himself suring giant waves in Nazare, Portugal.

Photograph: Miguel Barreira/AP</figcaption></figure><p>\"She was heading for the rocks. It was terrible. The worst situation I have ever faced. I raced up to her, jumped off the ski and grabbed her. I couldn't let her go,\" he said.</p><p>\"We got lucky. I got lucky. We got to the beach. I don't know how, but we made it to the beach. They started administering CPR immediately and she coughed up a bucket load of water and she started breathing. Then they took her away in the ambulance. I was shaking. I'm not the best guy in these situations. I know the ocean, but I wasn't expecting this. I was in shock and so totally scared,\" he said.</p><p>After rescuing Gabeira, he headed back out to sea, but despite having possibly just broken the world record, Burle was far more concerned about his friend. \"I tell you what made me happy was talking and laughing with Maya in the hospital,\" he told Stab.</p><p>\"She told me that she knew that she was dying and that she felt happy. That she was dying happy. I told her that she might have been happy, but I was way more happy that she didn't die.\"</p><p>One of the things that makes Nazaré such a special place for surfers, but also so risky, is its unpredictability, explained Cotton. \"It's a beach, not a point break or a headland, so when the waves break, they could break anywhere. If someone goes down, you don't know where they will go. It's really scary. That's what makes it hard.\". But the risks won't make him stop. \"It's like anything though, like horse riding … it's all dangerous. You can't stop just because someone got hurt.\"</p><p>Cotton, who is married with two children, has been surfing since he was nine and runs through safety procedures with his team before going out to sea. \"We have a safety crew, everyone has radios. It's not just like nipping down to your local beach; there's years of training and practice. It's calculated risk.\"</p><p>When the big storms such as Saint Jude begin to brew, he has no other thought in his mind than to find the best surf. \"That's what we do. We look at the storm and work out where will be best to get the biggest waves. We've been planning for this,\" said Cotton, who works as a lifeguard in the summer months. \"Britain isn't famous for its legendary surf. England has a big surfing community, but you have to travel for the big waves. It's a niche I've found myself in.\"</p><p>But Cotton's parents reminded him he had more prosaic duties to return to at home. They sent him a message after his morning's surfing. \"Darling, Just read journal of your monster wave this morning. Thrilled to bits and very proud. Well done. Keep safe as we have a new washing machine that needs plumbing in! Loads of Love, Mum &amp; Dad.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421205702|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1288b3d06b289a139c88afbfef964fda9f402f64 -->",

The astonishing waves in Portugal rose up from a storm-tossed sea driven in from the Atlantic, as crowds watched wrapped up against the rain.</p><p>Saint Jude killed at least 11 people across Europe and the waves were so dangerous in Portugal on Monday that Brazilian star Maya Gabeira was nearly drowned. She was being knocked unconscious and broke her ankle but was rescued by her compatriot Burle.</p><p>Cotton, from Devon, and Burle are now waiting to see if one of them will be crowned champion, as experts measure the height of their respective waves. The first images, <a href=\"http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/9464-has-carlos-burle-beaten-mcnamaras-largest-wave-record\" title=\"\">seen on the Surfer Today website,</a> suggest either one of them may have gone over the current record, set in the same spot in November 2011 by American Garrett McNamara.</p><p>The record will be announced in May next year, at the Billabong XXL awards.</p><p>Cotton said: \"They were absolutely giant waves, I don't know how you would even begin to measure them. It was really exciting, a big day.\"</p><p>It was also something of a payback for Cotton. He had towed McNamara out on a jetski to ride the wave that set the record two years ago and it was now the turn of his friend to repay the favour. \"I got him the Guinness world record, at the same place, and now he towed me into this one. I've been here in Portugal for a month now and we were lucky to be here, in the right spot,\" he said.</p><p>But big-wave surfing is incredibly hazardous, as the dramatic rescue of Gabeira revealed. \"It's really dangerous out there. It's frightening, there's massive amounts of water surging through. It's deadly,\" said Cotton.</p><p>\"Maya was out on the waves when she came off her board, and was knocked unconscious. She is one of the best surfers in the world, a very experienced big-wave surfer, has surfed everywhere around the world, won numerous awards.\".</p><p>Talking to the <a href=\"http://stabmag.com/carlos-burle-saves-maya-gabeiras-life-surfs-biggest-wave-ever/\" title=\"\">surfing website Stab </a>shortly after rescuing his friend, Burle spoke about the dramatic moment when he thought she had died. \"She got caught inside by a giant wave and she disappeared. Man, she was gone for about five minutes. I couldn't find her anywhere. I was so scared. I didn't want to lose my friend, you know? Then I saw her and raced towards her.\"</p><p>Having found her, Burle then lost her again among the waves and feared that she had drowned, before seeing her floating face down.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421233165'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/29/1383057769418/Brazilian-surfer-Carlos-B-010.jpg' alt='Brazilian surfer Carlos Burle, (2nd r) watches footage of himself suring giant waves in Nazare' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Brazilian surfer Carlos Burle, (2nd r) watches footage of himself suring giant waves in Nazare, Portugal.

Photograph: Miguel Barreira/AP</figcaption></figure><p>\"She was heading for the rocks. It was terrible. The worst situation I have ever faced. I raced up to her, jumped off the ski and grabbed her. I couldn't let her go,\" he said.</p><p>\"We got lucky. I got lucky. We got to the beach. I don't know how, but we made it to the beach. They started administering CPR immediately and she coughed up a bucket load of water and she started breathing. Then they took her away in the ambulance. I was shaking. I'm not the best guy in these situations. I know the ocean, but I wasn't expecting this. I was in shock and so totally scared,\" he said.</p><p>After rescuing Gabeira, he headed back out to sea, but despite having possibly just broken the world record, Burle was far more concerned about his friend. \"I tell you what made me happy was talking and laughing with Maya in the hospital,\" he told Stab.</p><p>\"She told me that she knew that she was dying and that she felt happy. That she was dying happy. I told her that she might have been happy, but I was way more happy that she didn't die.\"</p><p>One of the things that makes Nazaré such a special place for surfers, but also so risky, is its unpredictability, explained Cotton. \"It's a beach, not a point break or a headland, so when the waves break, they could break anywhere. If someone goes down, you don't know where they will go. It's really scary. That's what makes it hard.\". But the risks won't make him stop. \"It's like anything though, like horse riding … it's all dangerous. You can't stop just because someone got hurt.\"</p><p>Cotton, who is married with two children, has been surfing since he was nine and runs through safety procedures with his team before going out to sea. \"We have a safety crew, everyone has radios. It's not just like nipping down to your local beach; there's years of training and practice. It's calculated risk.\"</p><p>When the big storms such as Saint Jude begin to brew, he has no other thought in his mind than to find the best surf. \"That's what we do. We look at the storm and work out where will be best to get the biggest waves. We've been planning for this,\" said Cotton, who works as a lifeguard in the summer months. \"Britain isn't famous for its legendary surf. England has a big surfing community, but you have to travel for the big waves. It's a niche I've found myself in.\"</p><p>But Cotton's parents reminded him he had more prosaic duties to return to at home. They sent him a message after his morning's surfing. \"Darling, Just read journal of your monster wave this morning. Thrilled to bits and very proud. Well done. Keep safe as we have a new washing machine that needs plumbing in! Loads of Love, Mum &amp; Dad.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421205702|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1288b3d06b289a139c88afbfef964fda9f402f64 -->",

        "body":"<p>Ever since the pioneering wave riders of the pre-war era drove north-west from Malibu to paddle into the virgin waves of Rincon near Santa Barbara, the spirit of adventure and discovery has been an integral part of the surfing psyche.</p><p>As surfing grew in popularity in the 1960s, surfers set their sights further, seeking out warm weather and waves around the world, a quest captured by Bruce Brown in his film, Endless Summer, which saw two friends travel to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Tahiti and Hawaii in search of new surf spots.</p><p>At the same time, Australian surfers were discovering Indonesia, starting in Bali, moving on to Lombok and then out to the Mentawai islands off the western coast of Sumatra. New film <a href=\"http://www.londonsurffilmfestival.com/serendipity/\" title=\"\">Serendipity</a> tells of how one Australian surfer, who didn't want to follow the crowds to Indonesia, instead discovered the abundant empty waves of the Maldives – and managed to keep them secret for nearly 15 years.</p><p>Fast-forward to the present day and there are few tropical shores with half-decent waves that are not filled with surf charter boats and surf camps, the line-ups choked with the very people the surfers left home to escape. Even chillier waters are becoming more popular.  In the UK, over half a million people are now taking to the waves around the UK, and 11 UK surfing regions have surfer populations in excess of 10,000, according to a new report by Surfers Against Sewage.</p><p>Surfers keen to ride empty waves are going to ever more remote, often inhospitable shores to find them. This new era of exploration among the world's best surfers is reflected in the films being screened at this year's <a href=\"http://www.londonsurffilmfestival.com/\" title=\"\">London Surf Film Festival</a>. Pro-surfer Pete Devries sails to the remote Canadian island of Haida Gwaii in the film <a href=\"http://www.londonsurffilmfestival.com/the-fortune-wild/\" title=\"\">The Fortune Wild</a>, living under canvas with two friends, foraging food and catching wild salmon as they surf empty perfection.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421371530'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2013/10/30/1383153040276/Surfing-Kamchatka-Russia-008.jpg' alt='Surfing Kamchatka, Russia' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Surfing Kamchatka, Russia. Photograph: Chris Burkard/©ChrisBurkard</figcaption></figure><p>Taking things a step further, artist and filmmaker Chris Burkard and a group of surfers set out to explore the wild and remote Kamchatka peninsula in his film <a href=\"http://www.londonsurffilmfestival.com/russia/\" title=\"\">Russia</a>. With no roads, they are reduced to 4WD trucks and decommissioned Soviet military helicopters in their quest for waves. In <a href=\"http://www.londonsurffilmfestival.com/good-morning-miyazaki/\" title=\"\">Good Morning Miyazaki</a> Canadian Matt Westcott finds world class breaks and a modest group of surfers who have remained well below the radar of the surfing world on the fringes of Japan.</p><p>Is there a limit to the remoteness surfers are striving for, a boundary of ambition? It seems not. A few years ago in Nova Scotia I met a group who were using a snowplough to reach their favourite break; in Hokkaido, Japan, I met a surfer whose winter steed is a skidoo. With high-tech wetsuits enabling surfers to enter water just a few degrees above freezing, a six-foot snowdrift is no longer a barrier to the wave hungry.</p><p>And just when you think you've heard the most extreme surfing tale, you come across someone pushing the limits even further. At last year's festival award-winning filmmaker Inge Wegge described an idyllic place to me. The drawback? \"There are more polar bears than people\".</p><p>Bear Island is an uninhabited speck of land, the southernmost island of the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean. It took one and a half years of planning but Inge and his two brothers eventually made it. A film of their extraordindary experience – of hauling their kit across the snowy wastes, camping on snow-dusted beaches and wading into icy waters – will be out next year. <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/77875258\" title=\"\">Watch the trailer on Vimeo</a>.</p><p><em>• The London Surf Film Festival at the Riverside Studios, Hammersmith, runs from 31 October to 3 November.
