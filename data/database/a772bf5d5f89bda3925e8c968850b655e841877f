        "body":"<p>Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke insists success on the pitch is vital to the club's commercial growth as the Gunners aim to end a trophyless run stretching back to 2005.</p><p>Kroenke addressed the club's annual general meeting at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday morning with Arsenal currently top of the Premier League after completing the club-record £43m signing of Mesut Özil.</p><p>\"We are pleased with the progress of the club, most importantly progress on the pitch,\" Kroenke said. \"None of us up here [on the board], fans, players, or Arsène [Wenger] are happy until we have won trophies, we have said that over again and are committed to that.\"</p><p>\"It is also important for the club to be successful commercially, and we are pleased with that. We have come a long way, with the debt being paid down, commercial revenues are increasing. We have more [deals] coming and are confident. However, nothing works unless we have success on the pitch.\"</p><p></p><p>Some fans had earlier staged a small protest outside the stadium entrance. The Black Scarf Movement carried a banner reading \"kick greed out of football – where has our Arsenal gone?\" and handed out leaflets highlighting the differences between the running of Arsenal and European champions Bayern Munich, plus copies of a letter sent to Kroenke in September calling for direct meetings with the American tycoon.</p><p>Wenger also spoke to the shareholders, where he focused on how the current side would build on impressive displays to deliver long-term success.</p><p>Wenger highlighted how last season's victory over Bayern Munich in the away leg of their Champions League tie, which they lost on aggregate, proved pivotal in developing the belief of the squad.</p><p>\"From the end of March to today, we have lost just one match, that created a huge emotion,\" Wenger said.</p><p>\"We have huge ambition to win the league this season. We were restricted financially and had to be strict, but we have come out of that.</p><p>\"However, we have to defend our style of play and values, that comes from developing our own players, with youth policy and that should be core of our club.\"</p><p>\"We will also look to buy proven quality – we did not need to scout to buy Özil, it was just money. I am pleased we have shown you we are not afraid to spend.\"</p><p>Wenger concluded his speech by adding: \"We are top [of the table] in a very strong position, but the end of November will give a much clearer indication of where everyone lies. I am confident that at the end of May we will all be happy.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420255256|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|c7ed7712c9195f746e25715075893e102bc55ec9 -->",

        "body":"<p>Andros Townsend has defended Roy Hodgson after the England manager was forced into making an apology over a joke he made about a space monkey and the Tottenham Hotspur winger.</p><p>Hodgson has been embroiled in the bizarre race row after it was reported on Wednesday night that he told the joke at half-time during England's 2-0 win against Poland on Tuesday, in an attempt to encourage right-back Chris Smalling to pass more frequently to Townsend.</p><p>Hodgson has been mortified that the remark could be perceived as racist and issued a statement to apologise for any offence that had been caused. Townsend has since tweeted to say: \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p>\"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time,\" said Hodgson. \"There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room.</p><p>\"I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p>Hodgson gained further support on Thursday from Wayne Rooney, who insisted the manager had his players' full support, despite the Sun claiming that at least one player had been offended.</p><p>The Manchester United forward wrote on Twitter: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><p>The supposed joke is one that was popular at American space agency Nasa. It goes:</p><p><blockquote>\"Nasa decided they'd finally send a man up in a capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions. They fire the man and the monkey into space. The intercom crackles: 'Monkey, fire the retros.' A little later: 'Monkey, check the solid fuel supply.' Later still: 'Monkey, check the life support systems for the man.' The astronaut takes umbrage and radios Nasa: 'When do I get to do something?' Nasa replies: 'In 15 minutes – feed the monkey.'\"</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Stan Collymore, the former England striker, said it was ridiculous for anyone to complain about the joke. \"Someone leaked it and I bet 100 per cent confident that no player was offended, not one,\" Collymore wrote on Twitter. \"If they are, do explain why. Racism is hard enough to keep on the agenda as it is without making everyone think a legitimate space tale should be a cause for offence.\"</p><p>However, Piara Powar, the executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare) organisation, suggested Hodgson was wrong to use the term. He wrote on Twitter: \"Hodgson used very silly term within a diverse team environment. He should know better. Assume it wasn't a Freudian slip, no evidence to suggest it was. Some players will see it as reflection of the crude language still used by some coaches and attitudes that still prevail.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420230579|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|4161621c23c5474a0185c44e30a707dd2a3be0ce -->",

        "body":"<p>The anti-racism group Kick It Out has called on the Football Association to investigate a joke about a monkey in space made by Roy Hodgson despite the England winger Andros Townsend's attempts to play down the issue.</p><p>The England manager has apologised to anyone offended by the joke made at half-time during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/15/england-poland-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Poland at Wembley</a>, which was intended to convey the need for England to play the ball more regularly to Townsend. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/17/roy-hodgson-apologises-space-monkey-joke\" title=\"\">The Tottenham Hotspur player says no offence was meant or taken</a>, but Kick It Out's chairman Lord Herman Ouseley has called on the FA to investigate the incident.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.kickitout.org/news.php/news_id/6083\" title=\"\">A statement said</a>: \"Kick It Out, football's equality and inclusion campaign, recognises and shares the concerns of the parties who felt mindful to bring the comments into the public domain.</p><p>\"The matter has been raised by the chair, Lord Herman Ouseley, directly with the Football Association, who acknowledges the apology made by Roy Hodgson, and now seeks an investigation to ascertain the full facts and ensure a similar situation does not arise again.\"</p><p>Townsend, whose father, Troy, works for Kick It Out as its mentoring manager, insists he was not offended and cannot understand why it has generated so much coverage, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andros_townsend/status/390770514849181696\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> the player said:  \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p>In a statement, Hodgson said: \"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p>The joke is one that became popular at Nasa, the US space agency, in the 1960s and 1970s after it sent monkeys into space before humans. One version of the joke is that the first time Nasa sends a man up into space a monkey goes with him and does all the skilled technical jobs inside the rocket. Finally the astronaut gets frustrated and radios Nasa to ask what he should do.</p><p>Nasa replies: \"Don't touch anything – just feed the monkey.\"</p><p>It is believed Hodgson was trying to illustrate the need for England's defenders to play the ball early to Townsend while he was in space on the flanks.</p><p>Piara Powar, executive director of the European anti-discrimination group Fare, said the England manager should be more careful. \"Hodgson used a very silly term within a diverse team environment. He should know better,\" said Power on Twitter.</p><p>Wayne Rooney insists Hodgson did \"nothing wrong\" and that the incident had been blown out of all proportion. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WayneRooney/status/390737351326306304\" title=\"\">The England striker tweeted</a>: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Stan Collymore said the row undermined efforts to tackle racism in football. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StanCollymore/status/390608021111726080\" title=\"\">The former England striker  tweeted</a>: \"Demeans every anti racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH who said NOTHING WRONG. Makes campaigners seem over PC &amp; petty. They're not.\"</p><p>The FA has been especially sensitive to any allegations of racism after John Terry was stripped of the England captaincy and later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/27/john-terry-verdict-chelsea-guilty\" title=\"\">banned for four matches</a> for racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand in a Chelsea match in October 2011.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246078|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|34dc22c7a9ff4964f5dcf294fb29976ceeaff847 -->",

        "body":"<h2>Premier League</h2><p>After seven Premier League games there's reason for optimism for Arsenal and Liverpool fans. The clubs are separated at the top by goal difference as both look to mount serious title challenges for the first time in the last five years.</p><p>Aaron Ramsey's development has been symbolic of Arsenal's rise to the summit, with the midfielder influential in defence and attack. With four league goals and more tackles (35) than any other player, it's little surprise that he's earned a rating of 7.93, behind only the similarly rejuvenated Olivier Giroud (8). Liverpool have been inspired by Daniel Sturridge, who leads the scoring charts with six goals.</p><p>It's been far less encouraging for Manchester United, who are have 10 points from seven games and sit one point behind newly promoted Hull City in the table. </p><p>There's been even less to cheer for Sunderland fans. Their solitary point from seven games – the lowest tally in Europe's top fives leagues – has left them at the foot the table. New manager Gus Poyet has a unenviable task on his hands.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420170207'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/football/Clubs/Club_Home/2013/10/16/1381938289016/WhoScored-Premier-League-001.jpg' alt='WhoScored Premier League' width='460' height='340' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: WhoScored</figcaption></figure><h2>Serie A</h2><p>Roma have stolen the show in Serie A. Juventus and Napoli remain unbeaten, but the <em>Giallorossi</em> have rightly drawn all the plaudits. New manager Rudi Garcia has assembled an impressive squad despite the high-profile and high-grossing departures of Marquinhos to Paris Saint-Germain and Erik Lamela to Spurs, with new signings Gervinho (7.7) and Mehdi Benatia (8.0) in our team of the season so far.</p><p>Benatia has played his part in maintaining what remains the best defensive record in Europe. Roma have conceded just once all season. AC Milan have been far from watertight, however. Only the bottom two clubs have conceded more goals than Massimiliano Allegri's men (13), who will have to repeat their efforts after a similarly disappointing start last season.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420170208'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/football/Clubs/Club_Home/2013/10/16/1381938350433/WhoScored-Serie-A-001.jpg' alt='WhoScored Serie A' width='460' height='340' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: WhoScored</figcaption></figure><h2>La Liga</h2><p>In any other job, Gerardo Martino would be heralded nationwide for an opening run of eight consecutive wins, but Barcelona were not expected to drop many points early in the campaign. Atlético Madrid's equalling of that 100% record has been received better and can be attributed in no small part to Diego Costa's 10 league goals in just eight games – the most in Europe's top leagues to date.</p><p>The Brazilian's place alongside Lionel Messi in our team of the season comes as little shock, though there have been some surprises in La Liga. The ease with which returning Villarreal have readjusted to top-flight football is certainly one of those. They are fourth in the league, with former Spurs youngster Giovani dos Santos playing an integral role with four goals and two assists. Only Barcelona and Atlético have conceded fewer goals (seven).</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420170209'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/football/Clubs/Club_Home/2013/10/16/1381938419907/WhoScored-La-Liga-001.jpg' alt='WhoScored La Liga' width='460' height='340' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: WhoScored</figcaption></figure><h2>Bundesliga</h2><p>Pep Guardiola is another unbeaten new manager. Bayern sit prettily, but far from comfortably, at the top of the Bundesliga. After as many games last saeson, they had scored 11 more goals (26 to 15). Their inability to convert a huge average of 71.1% possession into goals explains why only Franck Ribery (8.2) has claimed a place in our pick.</p><p>There has been no such struggle for goals for Hoffenheim, but, unfortunately for manager Markus Gisdol, they have conceded as many as they have scored. With 20 goals for and 20 goals against, their games have produced an average of five goals each – more than any other side in Europe's top leagues.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420170210'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/football/Clubs/Club_Home/2013/10/16/1381938494794/WhoScored-Bundesliga-001.jpg' alt='WhoScored Bundesliga' width='460' height='340' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: WhoScored</figcaption></figure><h2>Ligue 1</h2><p>In stark contrast to Hoffenheim, Reims have played out more dour affairs in Ligue 1, with just seven goals scored and six conceded in their nine games. They have drawn their last six league matches – the longest such run in Europe – though their current standing of ninth is above expectations and has been aided significantly by the performances of goalkeeper Kossi Agassa, who is our top rated Ligue 1 player with a score of 7.82.</p><p>At the top of the league most felt that free-spending Monaco would offer the biggest threat to Paris Saint-Germain's crown and that has proven to be the case. The moneybags clubs are inseparable as it stands, having played out a stalemate last month to remain unbeaten. Radamel Falcao's seven league goals have gone some way to redeeming his astronomical £51m price tag.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420170211'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/football/Clubs/Club_Home/2013/10/16/1381938556045/WhoScored-Ligue-1-001.jpg' alt='WhoScored Ligue 1' width='460' height='340' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: WhoScored</figcaption></figure><p><strong>• This is an article from our </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/guardian-sport-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Sport Network</strong></a></p><p><strong>• This article first appeared on </strong><a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>WhoScored</strong></a></p><p><strong>• Follow </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhoScored\" title=\"\"><strong>WhoScored</strong></a><strong> on Twitter</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420163185|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|1c6984fe931a9783ed92fff4cb5128f44bf3d709 -->",

        "headline":"Manchester United can take hope from Wayne Rooney's England heroics",
        "body":"<p>Wayne Rooney is 28 next week, although it seemed entirely fitting for a player who has always seemed ahead of his years that Roy Hodgson managed to get his age wrong in the excitement of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/15/england-poland-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">beating Poland to qualify for the World Cup finals</a>. The England manager thought he was 28 already and going on 29, an entirely understandable mistake. Rooney appears to have been around forever.</p><p>He also seems to have been in dispute with Manchester United forever, or at odds with himself, or unhappy with something going on in his life for as long as anyone cares to remember. That was why it was such a joy to see him dashing around so effectively for England in their past two matches.</p><p>Although Steven Gerrard's goal celebrations probably took the biscuit in terms of job-done delight and relief, Rooney's were not far behind. The Manchester United striker was comfortably the pick of England's forward options and deserved his man-of-the-match award, not just for scoring a crucial goal but for chasing back, winning the ball in midfield, spraying first-time passes around to launch attacks and generally doing something useful every time the ball came his way.</p><p>Either side of him Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck were wanting in most of those areas. Welbeck was wasteful, Sturridge appeared to lack the sharpness and instinctive finishing that he has been producing at Liverpool. Only Andros Townsend and Leighton Baines rivalled Rooney for effective use of possession in forward areas, and neither of those two would claim to be goal-getters or out and out strikers.</p><p>So Rooney is in form, arguably at the peak of his powers if not quite able to effortlessly reproduce the sheer effrontery of his youth, and United supporters must be delighted. Here was a player they thought they might have lost, someone who actually spent time angling for a move elsewhere. Rooney does not care to style himself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/26/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-chelsea\" title=\"\">\"the big man\"</a> so much anymore but it takes a big man to toy with the affection of Old Trafford, not to mention the manager whose statue adorns the place and who is starting to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2013/oct/14/alex-ferguson-road-named-manchester-united\" title=\"\">streets named after him in Manchester</a>. Rooney did all that and appears to have survived.</p><p>For England, at least, he looks like a player back to something like his best. For United, he has still to have the game, yet to put in the performance, that puts the smile back on everyone's face. There is no discernible groundswell of anti-Rooney opinion at Old Trafford, just the opposite, if anything.</p><p>Perhaps you do not hear the White Pelé song as often but it has not been mothballed or deleted from the catalogue. It merely awaits a suitable opportunity. Rooney says he has made his peace with the club, that he has no problem with either Robin van Persie or David Moyes, but he needs a celebratory performance to prove it. If Rooney could fire up and inspire United the way he galvanised England against Poland the past would be consigned to history and the future pronounced rosy. All would be well again, and Moyes could set about climbing the league table without worrying about unnecessary distractions.</p><p>We left United, if you remember, escaping the bottom half of the table with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/05/sunderland-manchester-united-premier-league\" title=\"\">hard-fought win over the bottom club Sunderland</a> before the international break. Hard-fought, because without the input of 18-year-old Adnan Januzaj in his first start, it was difficult to see where United were going to get the goals to overcome an interval deficit conceded through sloppy defending. This was not one of the games where Rooney and Van Persie clicked, and but for some hesitant Sunderland finishing in the first-half even Januzaj's contribution might not have been enough to get United back into the game.</p><p>For a short while, a defeat appeared to be on the way, one that would have made Moyes's life a misery with crisis headlines to endure during the break. Instead, the United manager must have rather enjoyed an opportunity to step back and take stock. He took credit for a bold gamble on an untried youngster, just about got away with a centre-half pairing that kept Rio Ferdinand on the sidelines, and would have been pleased to see that United can still summon the drive to come from behind.</p><p>With players of the calibre of Van Persie and Januzaj to call on, not to mention the ever reliable and scandalously unsung Michael Carrick, it is clear that United were only making a temporary visit to the bottom half, whatever their detractors might have hoped.</p><p>Whether they visit the very top of the table, in Moyes's first season, seems to hinge on Rooney. Yes, it was Van Persie's strike rate that clinched the title last season, though that trick alone is unlikely to work as well again and other top-six rivals have strengthened over the summer. Last season was a story of several ordinary sides and one extraordinary striker. This season is already shaping up to be more competitive and, having lost three games already, United will not recover lost ground unless they rediscover the team ethos that was their hallmark under Sir Alex Ferguson and the distinctive attribute of Everton under Moyes.</p><p>Beginning with Southampton on Saturday, tricky opponents who have lost only one match of their opening seven and sit in fourth place, United need to return to stamping their personality on matches. As the most obvious embodiment of United's spirit and personality, Rooney is key to that.</p><p>There are problems elsewhere in the team, notably in defence and midfield, that Moyes will need time and perhaps money to correct but he hopes, and so do most of the supporters, that the Rooney problem is over. If so, good times could be around the corner.</p><p>Seeing is believing, however, and Old Trafford does not want to see Rooney excel only for England. Old Trafford famously does not get too excited about England but the fans will not mind as long as England's best player is United's best player too.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420177976|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|468275c07554b4e3cb0715f6bd2f205b2200806c -->",

        "body":"<p>Generally, insanity is believed to be genetic, but André Villas-Boas is working to a theorem that it can also be determined by name. After first persuading Erik Lamela that <strong>Tottenham</strong> was preferable to Rome, he is now planning to take advantage of <strong>Ezequiel Lavezzi</strong>, whom he wants to relocate from Paris. Should he pull it off, he will experiment further with more physical and abstract targets, aiming to tempt La Manga, La Bamba and Ladysmith Black Mambazo with tales of riots and public transport hot-spots.</p><p></p><p>But, typically, José Mourinho is having none of it, planning to trump Spurs' Ezequiel with an Eliaquim – or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK8iMXq3cg8\" title=\"\">Eliaquim, shout, shout</a>, as he shall come to be known in the Matthew Harding. The boy Mangala, currently at Porto, has, we've been told, \"taken a step towards <strong>Chelsea</strong>\". We know this, apparently, because he has hired Jorge Mendes as his agent and is more footballer than hobo, taking Manchester United out of the equation. However, we also know that he still isn't very good, as Manchester City considered signing him in the summer before preferring Martín Demichelis.</p><p></p><p>And Mourinho will not stop there. He is also keen to take <strong>Wesley Sneijder</strong> from Galatasaray, to play alongside his new right-winger Samuel Eto'o – after which he will first go after Inter's Diego Milito and then win the treble, celebrating by tweaking Rafael Benítez's nipples.</p><p></p><p>With a space for a foreigner in his squad thus available, the notoriously relaxed and tolerant Roberto Mancini will hasten his coronary by signing Nani from <strong>Manchester United</strong>. This will likely please David Moyes, eager to divest his team of unpredictable and skilful players – though in Turkey it has been reported that Mancini would like to sign <strong>Antonio Valencia</strong>. Valencia, though, is unsure of his ability to complete the move, as all flight numbers to Istanbul contain the number seven, therefore exerting a detrimental effect on his mental state.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, another Valencia would like to borrow <strong>Tiago Ilori</strong> from LiverpoolFootballClub Football Club Football Club. Signed in the summer for £7m, he has found himself surplus to requirement, despite a formation designed to include as many centre-backs as possible, in tribute to the football club football club's illustrious ancient history. Exclusively, the Mill was able to reach Ilori for comment, and was told: \"Coming together is a beginning, keeping together is progress, working together is success.\"  It only asked him if he had the time.</p><p></p><p>In other centre-back news, two that Manchester United will not be signing are <strong>Borussia Dortmund</strong>'s Mats Hummels, both likely to move to Barcelona in the summer. As Glazernomics bites once more, they will instead look at No One's Mat Hummel – provided that he signs with Jorge Mendes.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, <strong>West Brom</strong> would like Saido Berahino to sign a contract with them forthwith. After they generously agreed to pay him £800 a week when they thought he either wasn't any good or was thick, now that they know he is good, or isn't thick, they are worried that he might prefer to play for a better team. Arsenal, Chelsea and Everton are all interested.</p><p></p><p>And finally, Sven-Goran Eriksson has emerged as a \"surprise\" candidate for the manager's job at <strong>Sheffield United</strong> – though \"surprise\" does not really do justice to the shock of seeing his name linked with a minor club receiving a sudden influx of money. The only thing that could possibly be possibly more amazing would be if there were, by astounding happenstance, junior skirt involved.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420232203|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|295804de6e844d34cde5036a1efd9b62232ea97c -->",

However, only the top seven teams will join Brazil as the seeds for the draw in Salvador on 6 December.</p><p>Spain, the holders, Argentina, Germany and Belgium were already assured of being in the elite group alongside Brazil before Tuesday's final round of fixtures in Europe, South America and Concacaf.</p><p>Switzerland, as low as 23rd in the rankings in last August and who have not been in the top 10 since October 1995, grabbed a top seed place after their 1-0 win over Slovenia. Colombia, at their first World Cup since they played England in 1998,  ensured their place as fourth seeds after coming from behind to beat Paraguay.</p><p>Uruguay (sixth) will be the other seeded side if they beat Jordan in a two-legged play-off, but if the South Americans lose, the last seeding place will go to Holland, who are joint-eighth in the rankings with Italy. Though both are listed as having 1136 points, the Dutch are on 1135.95 to the Italians' 1135.61, the latter paying a steep price for their draw with Armenia.</p><p>For Monday's European play-off draw, the four seeds will be Portugal, Greece, Croatia and Ukraine, the last beating out France by a single ranking point. The other unseeded play-off teams are Sweden, Romania and Iceland.</p><p>While Moldova's victories against San Marino and Montenegro made them the biggest gainers in terms of places, Scotland were the biggest risers in terms of points thanks to victory against Croatia, their 164-point gain lifting Gordon Strachan's side 28 places from 63rd to 35th. Wales moved up eight places with a win against Macedonia and a draw in Belgium.

        "body":"<p>The anti-racism group Kick It Out has called on the Football Association to investigate a joke about a monkey in space made by Roy Hodgson despite the England winger Andros Townsend's attempts to play down the issue.</p><p>The England manager has apologised to anyone offended by the joke made at half-time during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/15/england-poland-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Poland at Wembley</a>, which was intended to convey the need for England to play the ball more regularly to Townsend. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/17/roy-hodgson-apologises-space-monkey-joke\" title=\"\">The Tottenham Hotspur player says no offence was meant or taken</a>, but Kick It Out's chairman Lord Herman Ouseley has called on the FA to investigate the incident.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.kickitout.org/news.php/news_id/6083\" title=\"\">A statement said</a>: \"Kick It Out, football's equality and inclusion campaign, recognises and shares the concerns of the parties who felt mindful to bring the comments into the public domain.</p><p>\"The matter has been raised by the chair, Lord Herman Ouseley, directly with the Football Association, who acknowledges the apology made by Roy Hodgson, and now seeks an investigation to ascertain the full facts and ensure a similar situation does not arise again.\"</p><p>Townsend, whose father, Troy, works for Kick It Out as its mentoring manager, insists he was not offended and cannot understand why it has generated so much coverage, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andros_townsend/status/390770514849181696\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a> the player said:  \"I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!\"</p><p>In a statement, Hodgson said: \"I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence, and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.\"</p><p>The joke is one that became popular at Nasa, the US space agency, in the 1960s and 1970s after it sent monkeys into space before humans. One version of the joke is that the first time Nasa sends a man up into space a monkey goes with him and does all the skilled technical jobs inside the rocket. Finally the astronaut gets frustrated and radios Nasa to ask what he should do.</p><p>Nasa replies: \"Don't touch anything – just feed the monkey.\"</p><p>It is believed Hodgson was trying to illustrate the need for England's defenders to play the ball early to Townsend while he was in space on the flanks.</p><p>Piara Powar, executive director of the European anti-discrimination group Fare, said the England manager should be more careful. \"Hodgson used a very silly term within a diverse team environment. He should know better,\" said Power on Twitter.</p><p>Wayne Rooney insists Hodgson did \"nothing wrong\" and that the incident had been blown out of all proportion. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WayneRooney/status/390737351326306304\" title=\"\">The England striker tweeted</a>: \"Seen the story on roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Stan Collymore said the row undermined efforts to tackle racism in football. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StanCollymore/status/390608021111726080\" title=\"\">The former England striker  tweeted</a>: \"Demeans every anti racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH who said NOTHING WRONG. Makes campaigners seem over PC &amp; petty. They're not.\"</p><p>The FA has been especially sensitive to any allegations of racism after John Terry was stripped of the England captaincy and later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/27/john-terry-verdict-chelsea-guilty\" title=\"\">banned for four matches</a> for racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand in a Chelsea match in October 2011.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246078|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|34dc22c7a9ff4964f5dcf294fb29976ceeaff847 -->",

        "body":"<p>England have missed out on a place among the top eight seeds for the World Cup, ensuring Roy Hodgson's side face a tougher route to the knock-out stages.</p><p>Tuesday's win over Poland meant that England moved back into the top 10 in <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html\" title=\"\">Fifa's rankings</a> – jumping seven places to 10th. However, only the top seven teams will join Brazil as the seeds for the draw in Salvador on 6 December.</p><p>Spain, the holders, Argentina, Germany and Belgium were already assured of being in the elite group alongside Brazil before Tuesday's final round of fixtures in Europe, South America and Concacaf.</p><p>Switzerland, as low as 23rd in the rankings in last August and who have not been in the top 10 since October 1995, grabbed a top seed place after their 1-0 win over Slovenia. Colombia, at their first World Cup since they played England in 1998,  ensured their place as fourth seeds after coming from behind to beat Paraguay.</p><p>Uruguay (sixth) will be the other seeded side if they beat Jordan in a two-legged play-off, but if the South Americans lose, the last seeding place will go to Holland, who are joint-eighth in the rankings with Italy. Though both are listed as having 1136 points, the Dutch are on 1135.95 to the Italians' 1135.61, the latter paying a steep price for their draw with Armenia.</p><p>For Monday's European play-off draw, the four seeds will be Portugal, Greece, Croatia and Ukraine, the last beating out France by a single ranking point. The other unseeded play-off teams are Sweden, Romania and Iceland.</p><p>While Moldova's victories against San Marino and Montenegro made them the biggest gainers in terms of places, Scotland were the biggest risers in terms of points thanks to victory against Croatia, their 164-point gain lifting Gordon Strachan's side 28 places from 63rd to 35th. Wales moved up eight places with a win against Macedonia and a draw in Belgium. The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland both slipped.</p><p></p><h2>Fifa rankings</h2><p>1 <strong>Spain</strong> 1513pts (1 last month)</p><p>2 <strong>Germany</strong> 1311 (3)</p><p>3 <strong>Argentina</strong> 1266 (2)</p><p>4 <strong>Colombia</strong> 1178 (5)</p><p>5 <strong>Belgium</strong> 1175 (6)</p><p>6 <strong>Uruguay</strong> 1164 (7)</p><p>7 <strong>Switzerland</strong> 1138 (14)</p><p>8= <strong>Holland</strong> 1136 (9)</p><p>8= <strong>Italy</strong> 1136 (4)</p><p>10 <strong>England</strong> 1080 (17)</p><p>11 <strong>Brazil</strong> 1078 (8)</p><p>12 <strong>Chile</strong> 1051 (16)</p><p>13 <strong>USA</strong> 1040 (13)</p><p>14 <strong>Portugal</strong> 1036 (11)</p><p>15 <strong>Greece</strong> 983 (12)</p><p>16 <strong>Bosnia-Herzegovina</strong> 925 (18)</p><p>17 <strong>Ivory Coast</strong> 917 (19)</p><p>18 <strong>Croatia</strong> 901 (10)</p><p>19 <strong>Russia</strong> 874 (15)</p><p>20 <strong>Ukraine</strong> 871 (26)</p><p></p><p><strong><em>Selected others:</em></strong></p><p>21 <strong>France</strong> 870 (25)</p><p>25 <strong>Sweden</strong> 850 (22)</p><p>29 <strong>Romania</strong> 767 (31)</p><p>35 <strong>Scotland</strong> 715 (63)</p><p>44 <strong>Wales</strong> 634 (52)</p><p>46 <strong>Iceland</strong> 633 (54)</p><p>60 <strong>Republic of Ireland</strong> 559 (59)</p><p>90 <strong>Northern Ireland</strong> 399 (86)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420172199|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|e68666b8947efa31d9ab42f27254d44990fc31c5 -->",

        "body":"<p>Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke insists success on the pitch is vital to the club's commercial growth as the Gunners aim to end a trophyless run stretching back to 2005.</p><p>Kroenke addressed the club's annual general meeting at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday morning with Arsenal currently top of the Premier League after completing the club-record £43m signing of Mesut Özil.</p><p>\"We are pleased with the progress of the club, most importantly progress on the pitch,\" Kroenke said. \"None of us up here [on the board], fans, players, or Arsène [Wenger] are happy until we have won trophies, we have said that over again and are committed to that.\"</p><p>\"It is also important for the club to be successful commercially, and we are pleased with that. We have come a long way, with the debt being paid down, commercial revenues are increasing. We have more [deals] coming and are confident. However, nothing works unless we have success on the pitch.\"</p><p></p><p>Some fans had earlier staged a small protest outside the stadium entrance. The Black Scarf Movement carried a banner reading \"kick greed out of football – where has our Arsenal gone?\" and handed out leaflets highlighting the differences between the running of Arsenal and European champions Bayern Munich, plus copies of a letter sent to Kroenke in September calling for direct meetings with the American tycoon.</p><p>Wenger also spoke to the shareholders, where he focused on how the current side would build on impressive displays to deliver long-term success.</p><p>Wenger highlighted how last season's victory over Bayern Munich in the away leg of their Champions League tie, which they lost on aggregate, proved pivotal in developing the belief of the squad.</p><p>\"From the end of March to today, we have lost just one match, that created a huge emotion,\" Wenger said.</p><p>\"We have huge ambition to win the league this season. We were restricted financially and had to be strict, but we have come out of that.</p><p>\"However, we have to defend our style of play and values, that comes from developing our own players, with youth policy and that should be core of our club.\"</p><p>\"We will also look to buy proven quality – we did not need to scout to buy Özil, it was just money. I am pleased we have shown you we are not afraid to spend.\"</p><p>Wenger concluded his speech by adding: \"We are top [of the table] in a very strong position, but the end of November will give a much clearer indication of where everyone lies. I am confident that at the end of May we will all be happy.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420255256|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|c7ed7712c9195f746e25715075893e102bc55ec9 -->",

There followed a scuffle in which Morrison, who has appeared to find a renewed focus following several off-field incidents when a United player, grabbed Zaha.</p><p>Yet after the European Championship qualifier the pair shook hands near the team coach and joked about the bust-up, with it being understood there is no continuing ill-feeling between them.</p><p>Gareth Southgate, the new under-21 manager, admitted that he faces a challenge to ensure there is no repeat from any of his players and that he can build unity. \"It's my job to bring them together as a group, which is going to be a test. We spoke about being a team before the game. We know the potential of the group of individuals.</p><p>\"The key now is how we come together as a team and that will take time because there is a lot of focus on individuals. Sometimes there is pressure on individuals and one or two of those had a point to prove and did that very well.\"</p><p>Nathan Redmond, the Norwich City winger who separated Zaha and Morrison, said: \"It was just a bit of a disagreement, nothing else. We got back in the changing room and sorted it out. You get that with teams everywhere, there is just a bit more&nbsp;of spotlight on this incident because it was for England. We sorted it out behind the scenes.\"</p><p>Redmond hinted at the root of the problem Zaha had with Morrison: \"Rav's a class player, sometimes he just has to move the ball a little bit quicker. Sometimes you do get a little bit frustrated with him but you just have to let Rav be Rav because of the things he is capable of.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/31/ravel-morrison-west-ham-manchester-united1\" title=\"\">Morrison was sold to West Ham by United in January 2012</a> after Sir Alex Ferguson decided he would not fulfil his potential while still living in Manchester. The previous year he received a referral order for witness intimidation and shortly after joining <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/22/ravel-morrison-fined-by-fa\" title=\"\">West Ham he was fined £7,000 by the Football Association</a> for making a homophobic comment on social networking site Twitter.</p><p>While the latest episode involving Zaha cannot be compared with those incidents, the 20-year-old, who was the outstanding performer in the game against Lithuania, will be keen not to become embroiled in further controversy.</p><p>\"I'm very happy with the performance,\" Morrison told West Ham TV. \"I thought the team performance was good and I thought my performance was good&nbsp;too.\" Of what was only his second appearance for the under-21s, he said: \"I've found it great. I've come in and the lads have treated me well and I've got on with everybody. It's a lot different when you're older, everything has been more calm.\"</p><p>On Saturday Manchester City, are at Upton Park for the late kick-off. \"I'm very excited because I used to play for Manchester United but I never played against their first team so I'm really looking forward to it. Of course we can cause a shock. We're a great team and we should have had a lot of goals this season but for some reason we haven't.\"</p><p>West Ham did <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/06/tottenham-west-ham-premier-league\" title=\"\">win their last league game 3-0 against Tottenham Hotspur </a>at White Hart Lane and Morrison said: \"Against Tottenham we managed to get the goals which have been missing which was pleasing. The defence has been solid so if we carry on doing what we're doing we can cause an upset.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420177972|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|82962ddf6e4d455fcf6a542159e6fffbf633a2ee -->",

        "body":"<p>The jubilant grandfather of young football star Harry Wilson is set to bank £125,000 after betting the teenager would play for Wales – back when Harry was only 18 months old.</p><p>The 16-year-old Liverpool academy star made his international debut last night – scoring a big win for his grandfather the moment he came on as a substitute.</p><p>Peter Edwards, 62, walked into a William Hill betting shop in Wrexham in 2000 and bet £50 on the teenager one day playing for Wales, at odds of 2,500-1.</p><p>The teenager scored one for the record books himself during last night's World Cup qualifier against Belgium, becoming the youngest player to represent Wales.</p><p>But one life-changing moment instantly gave rise to another when Edwards decided he would retire with immediate effect on the proceeds of his win.</p><p>He made the decision in his caravan in Buckingham, where he was working, nervously watching the international clash on his iPad.</p><p>The electrical contractor of Corwen, Clwyd, North Wales, works away from home most of the year, spending one weekend a fortnight with wife Dorothy, 58.</p><p>\"She is over the moon. I retired immediately. I told my manager yesterday that if Harry plays I wouldn't be coming back,\" he said.</p><p>\"I've retired one year early. I have come home now and will not be going back. Not bad for a daft bet.\"</p><p>He said he put on the original bet on a whim after seeing how Harry liked playing with a football even as a toddler.</p><p>\"He used to chase the ball around the front room on his hands and knees even before he could walk, that's what gave me the idea. But I hoped the bet would come up.\"</p><p>He said after Harry enrolled in the Liverpool FC academy his skills quickly developed and he returned to William Hill in the hope of placing a second bet.</p><p>\"Harry was about 12 then. But they turned me down and said I already had a substantial bet with them. But they threw in England as a gesture of goodwill.\"</p><p>It meant even if the teenager had opted to play for England, something he could have done because his grandmother was born in Chester, the pay-out would have been safe.</p><p>Harry himself will also benefit from the win, which Edwards said will ensure regular lengthy journeys to and from Liverpool will be made easier.</p><p>He said that as a teenage player with the academy his earnings are still modest and travel costs can be high.</p><p>\"This means I will be able to help Harry out. You can be quite sure that he will get a share of it,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420181055|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|ad7a328eeaee0703328baf3610a1d4b651bd6df0 -->",
