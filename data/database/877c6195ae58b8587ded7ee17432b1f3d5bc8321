A copy of the report was obtained exclusively by the al-Jazeera TV network, which shared it with the Guardian before publication.</p><p>The Swiss report said that even taking into account the eight years since Arafat's death and the quality of specimens taken from bone fragments and tissue scraped from his body and shroud, the results \"moderately support the proposition that the death was the consequence of poisoning with polonium-210\".</p><p>Suha Arafat said the evidence in the report suggested that her then healthy 75-year-old husband, who died in 2004 four weeks after he first fell ill following a meal, was almost certainly murdered by poisoning. She told al-Jazeera: \"This is the crime of the century.\"</p><p>Speaking to the Guardian after receiving the report, she said she would press for answers on who was responsible. \"It's shocking … I remember how Yasser was shrinking at the hospital, how in his eyes there were a lot of questions. Death is a fate in life, it is everybody's fate, but when it's poison it's terrible. We are mourning him again now.\"</p><p>With Zahwa, 18, her daughter by Arafat, she said she suspected a \"conspiracy to get rid of him\", adding: \"My daughter and I have to know who did it. We will not stop in our quest to find out. I hope the Palestinian Authority goes further on it, searching every single aspect of it. It is of course a political crime.\" She said: \"This is separate from the peace process or talks. Any judicial investigation is separate from the peace process.\"</p><p>David Barclay, a British forensic scientist who had studied the report, told al-Jazeera: \"The report contains strong evidence, in my view conclusive evidence, that there's at least 18 times the level of polonium in Arafat's exhumed body than there should be.\"</p><p>He said the report represented \"a smoking gun\". Barclay said: \"It's what killed him. Now we need to find out who was holding the gun at that time,\" adding: \"I would point to him being given a fatal dose. I don't think there's any doubt at all.\"</p><p>The Israeli government, however, dismissed the report. \"The Swiss findings are not conclusive,\" said Yigal Palmor, a foreign ministry spokesman.</p><p>\"Even if they did find traces of polonium that could indicate poisoning, there's no evidence of how that poisoning occurred. Before the Palestinian Authority jumps to conclusions, there are many questions still to be answered.</p><p>\"Israel is not involved in any way. There's no way the Palestinians can stick this on us. It's unreasonable and unsupported by facts. We will see yet another round of accusations, but there's no proof.\"</p><p>Dov Weissglass, a former aide to Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister at the time of Arafat's death, also denied Israeli involvement. \"To the best of my knowledge, we had no hand in this,\" he said, adding that neither the prime minister nor the Israeli security services had played any part in the Palestinian leader's demise.</p><p>\"By the end of 2004, we had no interest in harming him. By then, Arafat was marginalised, his control over Palestinian life was minimal. So there was no logic, no reason.\"</p><p>Danny Rubinstein, a journalist and author of a book about Arafat, had a different memory of events. In the weeks and months before Arafat's death, he said, people in Sharon's inner circle talked constantly about how to get rid of him. \"For me, it was very clear from the beginning. Every day this was the topic – should we expel him, or kill him, or bomb the Muqata [Arafat's HQ]. It was obvious to me that they would find a way.\"</p><p>Palmor said that among the scientists who tested Arafat's remains only the French team were independent. The Swiss were commissioned by Suha Arafat, and the Russians by the Palestinian Authority, he said. \"These results should be taken with a few grains of salt. This story is still as mysterious as it was on day one.\"</p><p>Tawfik Tirawi, head of the Palestinian committee investigating Arafat's death, did not respond to a request from comment. But a senior Palestinian leader, Hanan Ashrawi, said: \"This report confirms the suspicions that we've had all along. We know Arafat was killed, now we know how. And we know who had the means, the opportunity and the motive. Justice must now take its course.\"</p><p>Arafat died in a French military hospital on 11 November 2004,. He had been transferred there from his headquarters in the West Bank after his health deteriorated over weeks, beginning with severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea around four hours after eating dinner on 12 October. French doctors have said he died of a massive stroke and had suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, or DIC. But the records were inconclusive about what brought about the DIC. No autopsy was carried out.</p><p>Allegations that Arafat may have been poisoned emerged immediately after his death and the <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/whatkilledarafat/\" title=\"\">claim was raised again by al-Jazeera TV last summer</a>, following a nine-month investigation culminating in the film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBT7o0piZ8E\" title=\"\">What Killed Arafat?</a></p><p>Al-Jazeera said it was given access to a duffel bag of Arafat's personal effects by his widow, which it passed to a Swiss institute. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/15/yasser-arafat-traces-polonium-210\" title=\"\">Swiss toxicological tests</a> on those samples including hair from a hat, saliva from a toothbrush, urine droplets on underpants and blood on a hospital hat found that the belongings had elevated traces of polonium-210, the lethal substance used to kill the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko.</p><p>The Swiss institute said Arafat's bones would have to be tested to get a clearer answer, warning that polonium decayed fast and an autopsy needed to be done quickly. In August last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/france-yasser-arafat-death-murder\" title=\"\">French prosecutors opened a murder inquiry</a> into Arafat's death. In November, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/27/yasser-arafat-exhumed-reburied-night\" title=\"\">Arafat's corpse was exhumed from its mausoleum in Ramallah</a> in the presence of three international teams of scientists: the Swiss team, a French team that was part of the Paris judicial investigation and a Russian team.</p><p>The Swiss team's report states that they carried out toxicological tests on Arafat's \"almost skeletonised body along with residues from his shroud\". The samples, including fragments of bones taken from his left ribs and pelvis as well as remnants of tissue from the abdominal cavity and grave soil, showed \"unexpectedly high\" activity of polonium-210.</p><p>Suha Arafat's lawyer, Saad Djebbar, told the Guardian the Swiss report was \"evidence that there was a crime committed\". He said he had handed the Swiss report to French investigators, whose inquiry is ongoing. French scientists conducted their own tests as part of the legal investigation but have not published findings as the inquiry continues.</p><p>Arafat's daughter, Zahwa, a student of international relations in Malta, told the Guardian: \"I want to find out who did it and their motive for doing it.\" She said she trusted the French investigation to shed light on that.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421824746|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|841eb772a3cfb0caafa59ff4cbfa9f9458ff80dd -->",

In October 2004, Arafat fell ill in his compound in Ramallah, the Mukataa. With the Israelis' permission, Arafat was flown to France for medical care, but died less than two weeks later",

        "body":"<p>Seven years ago the Kremlin critic and ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko met two Russians in a London hotel. What happened next was one of the most brazen assassinations of modern times. According to British prosecutors, Litvinenko's companions, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, slipped a colourless, odourless substance into his tea. Litvinenko drank. Not much, but enough for him to die in agony three weeks later in University College hospital.</p><p>The substance was polonium-210, a rare and highly radioactive isotope that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/yasser-arafat-poisoned-polonium-tests-scientists\" title=\"\">Swiss team has discovered in Yasser Arafat's exhumed corpse</a>. It is extremely hard to detect. Scientists only identified it in Litvinenko hours before his death. A former FSB officer, and teetotaller, Litvinenko was a fitness fanatic. Doctors say it was only because he was in such good shape that he lasted so long. If he had died sooner, the cause of death would probably never have been uncovered.</p><p>Polonium-210 occurs at very low levels naturally, but is manufactured for use by industrial plants to prevent the buildup of static electricity.</p><p>It is an effective and convenient poison. It emits pure alpha particles, which outside the body can be stopped by a sheet of tissue paper. But if ingested, it causes widespread damage as it passes into organs. The radiation releases energy that creates reactive particles called free radicals. These in turn form toxic compounds that are deadly to surrounding cells.</p><p>Because polonium emits only alpha particles, it can be safely carried in glass vials and will not set off radiation detectors at airports. Once ingested, it is hard to detect, because all the radiation remains in the body. A lethal dose could be as little as a few milligrams, which could be administered as a powder or dissolved in liquid.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421826783|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|8571552baff22bc6fa7e56ceb5c0567743cd58a1 -->",

        "body":"<p>When Palestinian officials opened up Yasser Arafat's grave in November last year, the international scientists standing by were not sure whether the naturally decayed corpse would yield many secrets. The Swiss team present had already found that biological samples on Arafat's final belongings, including urine-stained underwear and blood from a hospital hat, showed \"significant quantities\" of polonium-210, the lethal substance used to assassinate the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko.</p><p>The scientists now wanted to test Arafat's remains for traces of the radioactive substance to establish whether he might have been poisoned by polonium, which he would have to have ingested – perhaps administered to him in food or drink. But polonium decays rapidly. Eight years after burial, it was unclear what state the corpse was in. Certainly, the soft tissue of the liver and kidneys – which would have been best able to show any alleged polonium poisoning had there been an autopsy at the time of death – would now have decomposed. So the teams would have to rely on bone fragments and scraps of tissue still present around bones and on the death shroud.</p><p>Despite worries about decomposition, the Swiss team's report, which was obtained by al-Jazeera and shared with the Guardian prior to publication, found the bone and tissue fragments from the corpse showed \"unexpectedly high\" levels of radioactive polonium-210. David Barclay, a British forensic scientist who had studied the report, said it contained strong evidence of levels of polonium at least 18 times higher than the norm in Arafat's ribs, pelvis and in soil that absorbed his leaked bodily fluids. Barclay called the report's findings \"a smoking gun\".</p><p>The 108-page report describes how Arafat's corpse was located at a depth of around four metres below his mausoleum in Ramallah. With high relative humidity of 70% and temperatures of 17C, the body, which was lying facing upwards, with the left lower leg slightly bent over the right, was \"almost skeletonised\". All the bones showed a dark-brown discolouration but there were remnants of some soft tissue material, such from the abdominal cavity, as well as some hair in the cranial area. A Palestinian medical investigator collected 20 specimens from Arafat's corpse and grave during the exhumation and handed samples of each to three international teams – Swiss, French and Russian – in the presence of additional representatives from the French justice system which is conducting a murder inquiry. The specimens included a tooth, fragments from the scalp, bones such as rib and pelvis bones and remnants of the death shroud. Also collected was soil from the grave, some of which bore a black stain where bodily fluid had seeped. Some tissue matter was able to be scraped from bones.</p><p>The Swiss report concluded that even taking into account the eight years since Arafat's death and the quality of specimens taken from bone fragments and tissue scraped from his decayed corpse and shroud, the results \"moderately support the proposition that the death was the consequence of poisoning with polonium-210\".</p><p>The scientists examined at the length what they called the \"pros and cons\" of the theory that Arafat's death was caused by polonium-210 poisoning. They list a number of points that support the notion that Arafat could have been poisoned by polonium, especially the \"sudden and brutal onset\" of his stomach complaints following a meal \"in a patient who was otherwise in general good health\".</p><p>First, the scientists felt that the acute onset of gastro-intestinal symptoms in Arafat, who first fell ill four hours after eating dinner in October 2004, as well as the progressive deterioration of his state in the following weeks were \"compatible with ingestion of a large quantity of radioactivity\". That Arafat died one month after the onset of symptoms also supported the idea of an acute intoxication. Similarly, the development of Arafat's final symptoms, and his death from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, or DIC, was \"compatible with an acute toxin pathology, possibly the radiosotope polonium-210\".</p><p>The scientists first found \"significant\" quantities of polonium-210 on Arafat's final clothing and belongings which they analysed in early 2012. They then found \"unexpectedly high\" polonium-210 activity in the specimens collected during the exhumation in November 2012.</p><p>The team also pointed out and analysed in depth the presence of lead in the specimens from the corpse. They said this was likely to be compatible with lead impurities measured in sources of polonium-210.  Barclay, after studying the report, explained that lead may be present when polonium is made in a reactor. The report found that the presence and distribution of the lead and polonium were compatible with \"an acute intake\" occurring just before Arafat's clinical symptoms began, four hours after his dinner on 12 October. The scientists stated: \"No other cause to explain the onset of the symptoms could be identified.\" The negative results of initial toxicology tests three weeks after Arafat first fell ill and shortly before he died could be explained by \"metabolism or elimination of some toxic agents\" over the course of those weeks, they said. They also pointed out that those tests could not have eliminated every possible toxic substance. They added that at the time of those tests in 2004, polonium-210 poisoning was not documented except that it was known to be toxic.</p><p>Examining the case against the theory of possible polonium poisoning, the team said that the \"acute radiation syndrome\" that polonium poisoning would have caused often includes hair-loss and decreased bone marrow activity, while Arafat had not lost his hair or displayed the bone marrow symptoms. But the team said those two factors were not always found in poisoning cases. They were more often associated with external radiation exposure, not always with internal exposure. For Arafat to have been killed by polonium-210, he would have need to have ingested the poison and would have been exposed internally.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421827953|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|5733327881b89784ad74eb6307a6e0579087c7c7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Nine years after the presidential compound in Ramallah echoed with chaotic gunfire as the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was laid to rest in a concrete mausoleum, those who have always claimed his death was the result of Israeli poisoning will be grimly buoyed by the findings of Swiss scientists.</p><p>Speculation that Arafat's sudden illness was the result of foul play by the legendary Israeli secret services took hold even before the Palestinian leader died in a hospital near Paris on 11 November 2004. Israel has always categorically denied any involvement.</p><p>But the explosive conclusions of Swiss scientists, who conducted tests on samples taken from Arafat's exhumed corpse last November, will reignite accusations against Israel and deepen the widespread conviction among Palestinians that a man they saw as a revolutionary hero was murdered. They are likely to worsen the already corrosive atmosphere of the faltering peace negotiations and fuel popular demands that the Palestinian leadership walk out.</p><p>Arafat's health deteriorated rapidly in the autumn of 2004, after he had been a virtual prisoner inside the presidential compound in Ramallah, known as the Muqata, for two and a half years. Israeli troops and tanks besieged the rubble of the shelled compound, in which 270 Palestinian leaders and fighters were holed up, controlling everything that went in – including food and water – and ensuring that no one came out.</p><p>After Arafat fell ill with vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pains and fever, he was flown – with Israel's consent – to a military hospital near Paris. He died there less than two weeks later. Arafat's widow Suha refused to allow an autopsy at the time and French doctors determined the cause was a stroke triggered by a blood disorder.</p><p>In a radio interview given more than a year before Arafat's death, the then deputy prime minister Ehud Olmert had said of the Palestinian leader: \"Expulsion is certainly one of the options. Killing is also one of the options.\"</p><p>The Israeli secret services have a long track record of both overt and covert assassinations of their enemies. However last year, Dov Weisglass, a senior aide to Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister at the time of Arafat's death, insisted: \"Israel did not have any hand in this.\" Raanan Gissin, another Sharon aide, said Israel had \"never touched a hair on his head\".</p><p>But in the summer of 2012, the finger of blame was pointed again at Israel after al-Jazeera revealed that tests conducted by a Swiss laboratory had found <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/15/yasser-arafat-traces-polonium-210\" title=\"\">traces of the deadly polonium 210 on Arafat's personal items</a>, including underwear and a toothbrush handed over by his widow. The Palestinian Authority agreed to exhume the dead leader's body to facilitate further tests by Swiss, French and Russian experts. In a six-hour pre-dawn operation last November, the mausoleum was broken open and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/27/yasser-arafat-exhumed-reburied-night\" title=\"\">samples were taken from the corpse</a>.</p><p>The results of French and Russian tests are not known. Last month, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/15/us-palestinians-arafat-russia-idUSBRE99E0LN20131015\" title=\"\">Vladimir Uiba, the head of Russia's Federal Micro-Biology Agency, said its tests had revealed no traces of polonium</a>, but the assertion was later retracted by the agency. The French team has not released results.</p><p>Arafat was a man who divided the world: revered by Palestinians and their supporters, reviled by Israel and its allies. Nine years after his death, a portrait of him still hangs in most Palestinian homes. Nonetheless, the Palestinian people have inevitably moved on. Acts of violence, espoused by Arafat, are rare in the West Bank, and rocket fire from Gaza has dropped; instead, the Palestinian leadership has invested its hopes in diplomacy and negotiations.</p><p>The critical question is whether the Swiss scientists' conclusions will change anything. It is possible the disclosure of the results could trigger protests. But it is more likely that the main effect will be to deepen cynicism and further entrench anti-Israel sentiment in the West Bank and Gaza.</p><p>The findings do not prove Israel murdered Arafat. French investigators, who launched an inquiry last year at the request of Suha Arafat, a French citizen, will have to make that case if they believe one exists. Meanwhile, the international community will have little enthusiasm for anything that could disrupt the delicate peace process, which commands negligible support among the Palestinian public and is already stuck on the starting blocks.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421816191|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|ccdaa7a0827bcba63fd5e71ed8a1ead9bac18fb3 -->",

        "headline":"Yasser Arafat: a farce in Ramallah",
        "body":"<p>At a packed conference in Ramallah today, the retired general Tawfik Tirawi, once head of the Palestinian Authority's feared West Bank intelligence, squarely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/israel-killed-arafat-claims-palestinian-official-polonium\" title=\"\">pointed the finger at Israel for the assassination of Yasser Arafat</a>. There are lots of reasons to suspect Israeli responsibility. The former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon was vocal over the years in admitting he had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/feb/01/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon\" title=\"\">tried but failed to kill Arafat</a>. Israel had famously botched its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20636413\" title=\"\">1997 attempt to poison the political leader of Hamas, Khaled Meshaal</a>. It appears logical for the PA – under Israeli military siege in the Muqata when Arafat suddenly became violently ill on 12 October 2004 – to claim Israel alone is to blame.</p><p>But there are many other possibilities that Tirawi prefers to ignore. He himself was with Arafat during the siege; he was wanted by Israel, the CIA was shunning him, and he was accused of orchestrating suicide attacks against Israelis. That he was in close proximity when Arafat fell ill makes him at best a witness. For him to lead the investigation now is almost as farcical as the PA's entire approach to date.</p><p>For the outside world Arafat was a very cold case until al-Jazeera broadcast its documentary <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/whatkilledarafat/2012/07/20127413371805105.html\" title=\"\">What Killed Arafat?</a> in July 2012. The PA had formed a committee to examine his death immediately after his passing. But it had several changes in leadership, and did little more than rail against Israel, pursuing nothing by way of forensics. Correspondence obtained by al-Jazeera shows that the doctor in charge of the PA cold case review, Abdullah Bashir, wrote a single letter to French authorities – Arafat died in a French military hospital – in 2009 asking for further information. The French stated that all their files had already been released to Suha Arafat, the widow, and Nasser Kidwa, the nephew.</p><p>That was it. No one had bothered to ask Suha the elemental question: did she have any materials that might yield forensic clues? That was the first question scientists had for me when I approached them at the Lausanne University Centre for Legal Medicine. When I asked Suha, she told me about a green gym bag she kept all these years. Arafat had taken it with him to France in his dying days. She was sceptical the Swiss would find anything, but once <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/investigations/killing-arafat/myth-buster-killing-arafat-20131028194036387835.html\" title=\"\">polonium was detected</a>, she became unrelenting in her demands to go to the very end.</p><p>The exhumation of Arafat was not supposed to happen. The PA did not like the fact that Suha sought French jurisdiction. It preferred the UN security council, a curious choice given that it has almost never passed a resolution that benefits Palestinians. The PA also demanded the Arab League investigate, which again amounted to little more than platitudes.</p><p>But when the French government formally demanded access to Arafat's body, it faced a conundrum it had sought to avoid for years. It was the PA that refused to push for an autopsy that most likely would have resolved this mystery years earlier. In a taped interview Nasser Kidwa told me: &quot;I would think this would have meant the end of the peace process, as it stood at that time … because the Palestinian people would have seen a great crime, the crime of the killing of their leader.&quot;</p><p>Instead, the PA chose to use the case as a political weapon in its quest for negotiations with Israel. This also helped it avoid a painful, if not self-evident question: was one of its own involved? Sure, the Israelis controlled the perimeter. But as food, water and medicines were allowed in, a microscopic amount of lethal Polonium 210 would not have been hard to get inside. At a very minimum, his closest aides and bodyguards failed to prevent someone from introducing polonium into Arafat's system, whether by ingestion, injection, or inhalation. Could one of his aides have delivered the dose, with Israeli technical support?</p><p>This is why the idea of Arafat's closest associates conducting their own investigation is inappropriate. For the time being, the proper investigators are the French authorities. Three investigating magistrates will now have the opportunity to review the Swiss testimony and incorporate their own forensic conclusions into the body of evidence. While in Ramallah last November, the French were refused permission by the PA to question its officials without submitting questions in writing. If the PA is serious about finding the truth of who killed their iconic leader, it must afford the French unfettered access.</p><p>If not, the &quot;who killed Arafat&quot; question will remain unresolved, and little more than a convenient political tool.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422042529|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|83f5f295b876ea3dc2b876a383aa789ee7f87397 -->",

        "headline":"Yasser Arafat: from beyond the grave",
        "body":"<p>The Swiss forensic report, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/yasser-arafat-poisoned-polonium-tests-scientists\" title=\"\">which found that results taken from Yasser Arafat's body \"moderately support\"</a> the proposition that he was poisoned with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/polonium-210-poison-alexander-litvinenko\" title=\"\">polonium-210</a>, will surprise few. Speculation about his sudden illness was rife before the Palestinian leader died in a Paris hospital in 2004. Traces of the same poison have already been found on his underwear and a toothbrush handed over by his widow. The evidence is not conclusive, and Mr Arafat did not lose his hair or suffer from bone marrow symptoms, both of which are normally triggered by acute radiation syndrome. Neither do we know the results of French or Russian tests.</p><p>All of this happened nine years ago and, as the Palestinian Authority and Israel are already engaged in talks, there is an argument for saying that both sides should look forwards rather than backwards. If polonium poisoning is definitively identified as the cause of his death, it is unlikely that anyone will be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt where the poison came from or who administered it. The finger of suspicion points strongly at the military forces that were holding Mr Arafat prisoner in his own compound and controlling everything that went in and out – including food and water. Last year, senior aides to Ariel Sharon, the prime minister at the time, insisted Israel had nothing to do with it. But for Mr Arafat to have been personally targeted, the poison itself would have had to have been administered from someone inside the besieged compound. If the truth of what happened to Mr Arafat is destined to stay entombed in the murk, why not concentrate on the here and now?</p><p>The counter argument is no less compelling, and it has little to do with intrigues and plots. It is this: if peace is ever to be achieved between the two peoples, the culture of killing and assassination has to stop. That applies to both sides equally. It will not stop if the alleged killers of Mr Arafat find there is impunity for their actions. Assassination will have less use as a political tool if, however sophisticated the weapon, it has consequences that continue to embarrass and embroil the killers. It only works when there are no consequences. And without them, the same poison could be used again and again.</p><p>Three months after Mr Arafat died, Rafic Hariri, the former prime minister of Lebanon, was assassinated in a truck bombing. The UN-backed special tribunal for Lebanon has just issued its <a href=\"http://www.dw.de/special-lebanon-tribunal-indicts-fifth-suspect-in-hariri-assassination/a-17150855\" title=\"\">fifth indictment</a> for the group it accuses of planning the attack. Hezbollah has denied any involvement and said the indicted will never face trial. But the tribunal, criticised for the slow pace and limited scope of its investigation, grinds on undeterred. If this international effort can be done for Mr Hariri, it could also be done for Mr Arafat. His&nbsp;death should be investigated.</p><p>• The subheading for this editorial was changed on 8 November 2013 to more accurately reflect the article</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421966511|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|234cbbe98057a78e8595c2cdaf32adb277cba87c -->",

A copy of the report was obtained exclusively by the al-Jazeera TV network, which shared it with the Guardian before publication.</p><p>The Swiss report said that even taking into account the eight years since Arafat's death and the quality of specimens taken from bone fragments and tissue scraped from his body and shroud, the results \"moderately support the proposition that the death was the consequence of poisoning with polonium-210\".</p><p>Suha Arafat said the evidence in the report suggested that her then healthy 75-year-old husband, who died in 2004 four weeks after he first fell ill following a meal, was almost certainly murdered by poisoning. She told al-Jazeera: \"This is the crime of the century.\"</p><p>Speaking to the Guardian after receiving the report, she said she would press for answers on who was responsible. \"It's shocking … I remember how Yasser was shrinking at the hospital, how in his eyes there were a lot of questions. Death is a fate in life, it is everybody's fate, but when it's poison it's terrible. We are mourning him again now.\"</p><p>With Zahwa, 18, her daughter by Arafat, she said she suspected a \"conspiracy to get rid of him\", adding: \"My daughter and I have to know who did it. We will not stop in our quest to find out. I hope the Palestinian Authority goes further on it, searching every single aspect of it. It is of course a political crime.\" She said: \"This is separate from the peace process or talks. Any judicial investigation is separate from the peace process.\"</p><p>David Barclay, a British forensic scientist who had studied the report, told al-Jazeera: \"The report contains strong evidence, in my view conclusive evidence, that there's at least 18 times the level of polonium in Arafat's exhumed body than there should be.\"</p><p>He said the report represented \"a smoking gun\". Barclay said: \"It's what killed him. Now we need to find out who was holding the gun at that time,\" adding: \"I would point to him being given a fatal dose. I don't think there's any doubt at all.\"</p><p>The Israeli government, however, dismissed the report. \"The Swiss findings are not conclusive,\" said Yigal Palmor, a foreign ministry spokesman.</p><p>\"Even if they did find traces of polonium that could indicate poisoning, there's no evidence of how that poisoning occurred. Before the Palestinian Authority jumps to conclusions, there are many questions still to be answered.</p><p>\"Israel is not involved in any way. There's no way the Palestinians can stick this on us. It's unreasonable and unsupported by facts. We will see yet another round of accusations, but there's no proof.\"</p><p>Dov Weissglass, a former aide to Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister at the time of Arafat's death, also denied Israeli involvement. \"To the best of my knowledge, we had no hand in this,\" he said, adding that neither the prime minister nor the Israeli security services had played any part in the Palestinian leader's demise.</p><p>\"By the end of 2004, we had no interest in harming him. By then, Arafat was marginalised, his control over Palestinian life was minimal. So there was no logic, no reason.\"</p><p>Danny Rubinstein, a journalist and author of a book about Arafat, had a different memory of events. In the weeks and months before Arafat's death, he said, people in Sharon's inner circle talked constantly about how to get rid of him. \"For me, it was very clear from the beginning. Every day this was the topic – should we expel him, or kill him, or bomb the Muqata [Arafat's HQ]. It was obvious to me that they would find a way.\"</p><p>Palmor said that among the scientists who tested Arafat's remains only the French team were independent. The Swiss were commissioned by Suha Arafat, and the Russians by the Palestinian Authority, he said. \"These results should be taken with a few grains of salt. This story is still as mysterious as it was on day one.\"</p><p>Tawfik Tirawi, head of the Palestinian committee investigating Arafat's death, did not respond to a request from comment. But a senior Palestinian leader, Hanan Ashrawi, said: \"This report confirms the suspicions that we've had all along. We know Arafat was killed, now we know how. And we know who had the means, the opportunity and the motive. Justice must now take its course.\"</p><p>Arafat died in a French military hospital on 11 November 2004,. He had been transferred there from his headquarters in the West Bank after his health deteriorated over weeks, beginning with severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea around four hours after eating dinner on 12 October. French doctors have said he died of a massive stroke and had suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, or DIC. But the records were inconclusive about what brought about the DIC. No autopsy was carried out.</p><p>Allegations that Arafat may have been poisoned emerged immediately after his death and the <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/whatkilledarafat/\" title=\"\">claim was raised again by al-Jazeera TV last summer</a>, following a nine-month investigation culminating in the film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBT7o0piZ8E\" title=\"\">What Killed Arafat?</a></p><p>Al-Jazeera said it was given access to a duffel bag of Arafat's personal effects by his widow, which it passed to a Swiss institute. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/15/yasser-arafat-traces-polonium-210\" title=\"\">Swiss toxicological tests</a> on those samples including hair from a hat, saliva from a toothbrush, urine droplets on underpants and blood on a hospital hat found that the belongings had elevated traces of polonium-210, the lethal substance used to kill the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko.</p><p>The Swiss institute said Arafat's bones would have to be tested to get a clearer answer, warning that polonium decayed fast and an autopsy needed to be done quickly. In August last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/france-yasser-arafat-death-murder\" title=\"\">French prosecutors opened a murder inquiry</a> into Arafat's death. In November, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/27/yasser-arafat-exhumed-reburied-night\" title=\"\">Arafat's corpse was exhumed from its mausoleum in Ramallah</a> in the presence of three international teams of scientists: the Swiss team, a French team that was part of the Paris judicial investigation and a Russian team.</p><p>The Swiss team's report states that they carried out toxicological tests on Arafat's \"almost skeletonised body along with residues from his shroud\". The samples, including fragments of bones taken from his left ribs and pelvis as well as remnants of tissue from the abdominal cavity and grave soil, showed \"unexpectedly high\" activity of polonium-210.</p><p>Suha Arafat's lawyer, Saad Djebbar, told the Guardian the Swiss report was \"evidence that there was a crime committed\". He said he had handed the Swiss report to French investigators, whose inquiry is ongoing. French scientists conducted their own tests as part of the legal investigation but have not published findings as the inquiry continues.</p><p>Arafat's daughter, Zahwa, a student of international relations in Malta, told the Guardian: \"I want to find out who did it and their motive for doing it.\" She said she trusted the French investigation to shed light on that.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421824746|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|841eb772a3cfb0caafa59ff4cbfa9f9458ff80dd -->",

        "body":"<p>Israel was the \"first, fundamental and only suspect\" in the suspicious death of Yasser Arafat, a senior Palestinian official said on Friday after receiving reports by Swiss and Russian scientists on samples taken from the exhumed corpse of the late Palestinian leader.</p><p>Tawfik Tirawi, who heads a Palestinian committee investigating Arafat's death nine years ago, said he did not die from natural causes, but was evasive when asked repeatedly whether he believed Arafat was poisoned by the radioactive substance polonium-210.</p><p>\"It is not important that I say here that he was killed by polonium,\" said Tirawi. \"But I say, with all the details available about Yasser Arafat's death, that he was killed, and that Israel killed him.\"</p><p>He later described Israel as the \"first, fundamental and only suspect in the assassination of Yasser Arafat\".</p><p>However, the Russian report said the evidence of polonium-210 was inconclusive. \"The outcome of the comprehensive report on the levels of polonium-210 and the development of his illness does not give sufficient evidence to support the decision that polonium-210 caused acute radiation syndrome leading to death,\" said Dr Abdullah Bashir, quoting the conclusions of the Russian report.</p><p>But Bashir said that both the Swiss and Russian reports found large amounts of the radioactive isotope in his remains.</p><p>The Russian findings were significantly more cautious than the Swiss conclusions, published by al-Jazeera and the Guardian on Wednesday, which said that its tests \"moderately support the proposition that the death was the consequence of poisoning with polonium-210\".</p><p>A third group of scientists, who took samples from the exhumed corpse at the request of French magistrates who are formally investigating Arafat's death in Paris in 2004, has not disclosed its findings.</p><p>Israel has vigorously denied any role in Arafat's death, saying it had politically isolated him at the time and had no reason to assassinate him.</p><p>\"Let me state this as simply as I can: Israel did not kill Arafat,\" Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said on Friday. \"The Palestinians should stop this nonsense and stop raising these baseless accusations without any shadow of proof.\"</p><p>It has been suggested that, if Israel was responsible, it must have had assistance from one or more of the 270 Palestinians holed up in the besieged presidential compound in Ramallah where Arafat was effectively imprisoned for two and a half years. Israelis security forces controlled everything that entered the compound, including food and water, but had no control over who consumed which items.</p><p>Others have suggested that one or more of Arafat's rivals could have sought his removal.</p><p>The Palestinian committee of investigation has made little progress. Arafat's widow, Suha, this week called for a credible and thorough inquiry.</p><p>Arafat died on 11 November 2004 at a French military hospital aged 75, a month after falling ill at his West Bank compound. At the time French doctors said he died of a stroke and had a blood-clotting problem, but records were inconclusive about what caused that condition.</p><p>Arafat's grave was opened earlier this year, enabling Swiss, Russian and French scientists to take bone and soil samples for separate investigations.</p><p>The Swiss team presented its findings on Thursday, saying it found abnormal levels of polonium-210 and lead in Arafat's remains that could not have occurred naturally and that the results \"reasonably\" support the theory that Arafat was poisoned by polonium. They said the timeframe of Arafat's illness and death was consistent with poisoning from ingesting polonium.</p><p>The substance is rare and lethal even in minuscule amounts, and nine years on it would be difficult to track down anyone who might have slipped it into Arafat's food or drink.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/422006182|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|455cd05407562a037e75a0f625ad1804735f07a7 -->",
