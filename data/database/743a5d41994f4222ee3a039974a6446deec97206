        "headline":"Ernie Els's stance a reminder golfers are concerned about burnout, too",
        "body":"<p>Ernie Els has never been shy to offer an opinion. The South African launched an epic tirade against the set-up at Wentworth, his long-time home course, during the 2012  PGA Championship. \"Really, I am pissed off\" was among Els's more tame sentiments at that time.</p><p>Later last year, Els claimed advances in equipment are responsible for relative parity in top-level golf. \"I look around now and see guys winning, guys who could never have done so 20 years ago,\" he said.</p><p>On Sunday, Els was at it again. This time his target was those behind the European Tour's schedule and, specifically, this year's inaugural Final Series which encompasses two tournaments in China, with one each in Turkey and Dubai. Els has pulled out of the DP World Championship event in Dubai, the lucrative finale of the European Tour season, to emphasise his disquiet. Competitors must play in at least two of the three events preceding Dubai to be eligible for a spot in the Emirate state's 60-man field.</p><p>\"I don't think they really care,\" Els said when asked how the Tour had reacted to the news that he would not feature in Dubai. \"Why would they make a decision like that and expect guys to play? It's farcical. In my view it's an absolute joke.\"</p><p>Els, 44, is neither inexperienced nor loose with his tongue. He will be well aware of the impact of whatever he says and would presumably have the backing of Joost Luiten, who went through the farcical scenario of playing just a single shot at the BMW Masters in Shanghai before withdrawing because of a shoulder injury. By hitting that one drive, Luiten protected his chances of reaching Dubai. Luke Donald, on Twitter, promptly stated \"Can't blame Joost – new rule forced his hand\".</p><p>Ian Poulter, who is based in Florida, offered a similar if softer view to Els, also during the BMW Masters. Poulter said: \"For me it's too far to go home for a week and so I'm away for a month now, missing the kids, finding it difficult and people are trying to make it more difficult.</p><p>\"Don't get me wrong, I love playing here and around the world, and I have a global business. But you do need to pick and choose your events carefully so you can do yourself justice and it's not getting any easier when it gets to the end of a season and people are telling you where you've got to play.\"</p><p>Els and Poulter, like so many at the upper echelon, find themselves with the increasing difficulty of featuring on the more high-profile and wealthy PGA Tour in the United States while maintaining a presence in Europe.</p><p>The European Tour has recently added an incentive for players to participate in tournaments in their home continent but 13 is the minimum figure for members to retain their card.</p><p>Co-sanctioned events such as the four World Championships make that figure attainable but there is clearly increasing disquiet over what some players view as unreasonable demands on their time.</p><p>By Monday lunchtime, the European Tour launched its response to Els. Keith Waters, chief operating officer and director of international policy, said: \"The Final Series is a concept which was initiated through discussions with the membership of the European Tour and their input will continue to be important as the Final Series evolves and moves forward, details of which the chief executive George O'Grady will look to unveil on the final Sunday of this year's DP World Tour Championship.</p><p>\"The current Race to Dubai is building to a thrilling conclusion and with two huge prize funds still to contest, there are over 60 players still with the opportunity of finishing No1 for the 2013 season.</p><p>\"Top-five finishes from Ian Poulter, Graeme McDowell and Justin Rose last week in China saw them all close the gap on Henrik Stenson and we now look ahead to the penultimate tournament of the Final Series this week in Turkey and the season finale next week in Dubai.\"</p><p>In basic terms, the European Tour has to be proactive to fight the continuing talent drain caused by players moving to the United States. Part-replication of the PGA Tour's FedEx series is at least a start in that regard.</p><p>The $30m (£19m) on offer in prize monies throughout China, Turkey and Dubai should be a pretty strong incentive to any player. The Tour has had to move away from traditional venues such as Spain because of economic circumstances; it has not only done that, but to impressive financial effect.</p><p>The European Tour also needs at least some guarantee of player appearances before any tournament can be properly marketed. If scheduling was left completely loose, with the key attractions such as Poulter and Rory McIlroy able to turn up on a whim, sponsors would cite uncertainty as a reason not to be involved.</p><p>Golfers are not exempt from the burn-out that impedes other sportspeople. Tiger Woods, who will play for a considerable appearance fee in Turkey this week, hinted at concerns over playing pressures at the culmination of the FedEx series.</p><p>O'Grady's Dubai address will be intriguing, not only in the sense of what further amendments are made to his Tour's schedule for 2014, but in how the chief executive responds to discord such as that so vehemently stated by Els.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421632718|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|5516b500512f99d4e5384f6142f7654db50bcedf -->",

        "body":"<p>Ernie Els has described as \"farcical\" the European Tour's increased playing demands and will register his disapproval by skipping this week's season-ending event in Dubai.</p><p>The South African is annoyed at the tour's new regulation that its members must play two of the three events leading into Dubai to be eligible for the $8m (£5m)  season finale.</p><p>Els, a four-times major champion and former world No1, has been a member of the European Tour for nearly two decades.</p><p>\"I don't think they really care,\" Els said wearily when asked how the tour had reacted to the news that he would not play in Dubai.</p><p>\"Why would they make a decision like that and expect guys to play? It's farcical. In my view it's an absolute joke.\"</p><p>Els, who is also a member of the US PGA Tour, said he understood why the European Tour wanted to coax its top players into contesting more of the big-money Asian tournaments.</p><p>\"I can see [the tour's point of view] but it's crazy,\" he said. \"I've been playing both tours since 1994 and it's been no problem but for some reason now the European Tour expect us to play a full schedule.</p><p>\"We used to play seven events and you could keep your card in Europe. Now you have to play more than in America. [That is] the direction they're going in. I just think it's the wrong one.</p><p>\"I'm going to have to look at my schedule. I was there for the growth of this tour and now they're making it almost impossible for me to remain playing the tour.</p><p>\"You could always play both tours. You've had Luke Donald and Rory McIlroy win both money lists.</p><p>\"Now we have to make a decision where we never used to do that. Guys are not going to keep doing that. We've got families and schedules to keep.\"</p><p>The European Tour is struggling to keep up with the richer PGA Tour as more and more non-American players choose to play primarily in the United States.</p><p>Adam Scott, the Masters champion from Australia, quietly relinquished his European Tour membership a few years ago and now plays almost exclusively in the US and his homeland.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421583921|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|6f90b6598db71bf062c559401b54cb25a66350b4 -->",

It was a step in the right direction for sure,\" said McIlroy, who moved up to 38th in the Race to Dubai. \"I don't think anyone could have competed with Dustin this week. He played very, very well and obviously is a deserved champion.</p><p>\"I just didn't make enough birdies. I didn't take advantage of the par fives today and some of the short par fours. It's probably one of my only bogey-free rounds of the year but it just didn't contain enough birdies. It's something to build on and nice to go into an off-week now and I know that I'm into Dubai.\"</p><p>Reflecting on his win, Johnson said: \"I didn't get off to the best start and Poulter and McDowell got off to great starts and put a lot of pressure on me, but I am swinging well and putting well so thought just stick to my game plan and play the golf course how I want to play it and it's going to come,\" Johnson said after claiming his eighth PGA Tour title and the first prize of just over €1m (£856,000).</p><p>Johnson has not always handled such pressure so well, McDowell famously winning the 2010 US Open at Pebble Beach after Johnson squandered a three-shot lead in the final round.</p><p>\"It takes a while to learn that [maturity and patience],\" added Johnson. \"I wish I would have had some of that a few times a few years ago, but you learn from your mistakes and try to get better from them and I think I showed a lot of patience and a lot of discipline with clubs I picked and shot selection.</p><p>\"This is the biggest win of my career and hopefully there are better things to come. A major is always the next step. Am I suited best for one or the other? I don't think so. I think they all suit me very well.\"</p><p>Johnson began the final round three shots clear of Poulter but three-putted the opening hole as the Englishman birdied the first and second, while McDowell joined Poulter in the lead with birdies at the first three holes.</p><p>Birdies on the eighth and ninth got Johnson back into a share of the lead and although Poulter edged in front with a birdie on the 12th, Johnson birdied the 13th and matched Poulter's birdie on the 14th to set up a grandstand finish.</p><p>Johnson was left alone in the lead when Poulter was unable to get up and down from a greenside bunker on the 15th, although with the 16th being a reachable par four and the par-five 18th still to come – Johnson took seven there on Saturday – the result was far from settled.</p><p>None of the final group tried to drive the green on the 16th, although Johnson's length meant he could hit a long iron just 10 yards short and he promptly chipped in for an eagle two.</p><p>Poulter's birdie left him two behind and the gap was three when Johnson hit a superb tee shot to eight feet on the 17th and holed the birdie putt.</p><p>\"I guess it was a good defence,\" Poulter said. \"Obviously I'm a little disappointed not to put my hands back on the trophy, but 15 birdies and an eagle at the weekend is some pretty good golf. So it's exciting for the next few weeks ahead and obviously it's some good points on the board obviously for Ryder Cup [qualification] and the Race to Dubai.</p><p>\"I'm in great form. I really am playing well. The work I've done leading up to this run of tournaments has really worked and I couldn't be hitting it any better right now and obviously rolling a few putts in.\"</p><p>Despite a flawless final round McDowell was also disappointed, the Northern Irishman not dropping a single shot over the weekend as he closed the gap on Henrik Stenson at the top of the Race to Dubai to just over 145,000 points.</p><p>\"Obviously there is a pang of disappointment, but generally just very proud of myself the way I played this week, tee to green especially,\" McDowell said. \"On the greens, room for improvement.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421552111|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|26e39427baa62a1c29a7ed279a75c636db5ecdd4 -->",

The result means <strong>Wasps</strong> recorded their first away league win since February as they took a big leap up the table with a bonus-point victory at Kingsholm. Wade scored two  tries, while No8 Nathan Hughes and replacement Guy Thompson were also on the scoreboard, with fly-half Andy Goode claiming 12 points with three conversions and two penalties. \"Nobody else could have scored that try so we probably owe him a victory there,\" Young said of Wade.  <strong>Leicester</strong> director of rugby Richard Cockerill slammed his side for their \"embarrassing\" defensive lapses after they crashed to a 23-16 home defeat by <strong>Harlequins</strong>, who outscored them two tries to one and also leapfrogged them in the table to go fifth. A furious Cockerill said: \"Some of our defence early in the game was embarrassing.\" Quins'  two tries came from Nick Easter and Matt Hopper either side of half-time while Julian Salvi was in the sin-bin. <strong>PA</strong></p><p></p><h2><strong>Golf: Poulter has a chance</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Dustin Johnson gave the chasing pack some hope with a double-bogey on the last to reduce his lead to three shots after the third round of the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai. Despite also making a double-bogey on the 10th, Johnson stood on the 18th tee with his five-shot overnight lead intact thanks to a front nine of 30 for the second day running and four more birdies in succession from the 13th, eventually signing for a final-hole seven and a third round of 66. At 18 under par, Johnson led by three from the defending champion, Ian Poulter, who carded a 63, with Graeme McDowell a shot further back following a 64. Justin Rose, first-round leader Rory McIlroy and Graham DeLaet were all on 12 under. Martin Kaymer was 10 under after setting a course record with a 62. <strong>PA</strong></p><h2></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421540070|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|057a4c9883bc9f76031b76cc35fa42418eeb3c99 -->",

        "body":"<p>Dustin Johnson matched the Sheshan  course record to move into a five-stroke lead after the second round of the WGC Champions tournament.</p><p>The season-long struggles of the first-round leader, Rory McIlroy, returned to haunt him on the back nine and pushed him back into a tie for second with the Americans Bubba Watson and Boo Weekley.</p><p>The American Johnson made six birdies in the first seven holes en route to a nine-under-par 63 on another pleasant day, after ending the first day in a tie for eighth. \"I played really well the last two days,\" said Johnson, who posted a 12-under halfway total of 132.</p><p>Johnson, an aggressive player, vowed to increase his lead rather than protect it over the final two rounds. He has won seven times on the PGA Tour, but is perhaps best known for blowing a chance to win the 2010 US PGA Championship, when he received a two-stroke penalty for grounding a club in a sandy lie on the 72nd hole, costing him a place in a play-off.</p><p>McIlroy had threatened to run away with the tournament when he recorded three successive birdies to charge to 10 under after eight holes. However, his swing deserted him on the back nine. A poor drive at the difficult par-four 11th led to a bogey and it was a struggle from then on as he battled to an even-par 72.</p><p>\"I just hit a couple of bad shots and then I guess I just let it affect me a little bit and then I started to doubt myself sometimes. I didn't hit a lot of quality shots on the back nine. I missed the last six greens in a row, so a bit of work is needed on the range this afternoon.\"</p><p>Weekley (67) made a sluggish start, hitting the ball poorly by his own admission, but a wayward shot into the water at his fifth hole seemed to light a fire. He sank a 25-footer to save par and promptly reeled off three birdies from his seventh hole.</p><p>Weekley, a self-confessed redneck from the Florida Panhandle region, was asked whether he enjoyed the Chinese culture.</p><p>\"It's fun. Just can't understand them,\" he said in his thick southern drawl, adding he had no plans for sightseeing trips in China because \"I don't need to see nothing\".</p><p>Watson, who hails from the same area as Weekley, shot a 69 that included a double bogey from the middle of the fairway at the 10th. \"I left a lot of putts out there,\" the 2012 Masters champion said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421463945|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|9baff01e2922886d3ee2d7ce3ed56b7bc44def9b -->",

The US Open champion Justin Rose, Bubba Watson, Jordan Spieth and Tommy Fleetwood are a shot further back on four under.</p><p>Mickelson had briefly shared the lead with McIlroy when he picked up his sixth birdie of the day on the seventh – having started from the 10th – but ran up a quadruple-bogey nine on the eighth.</p><p>After seeing his third shot come up short of the flag and roll down a bank into water guarding the green, Mickelson took a penalty drop and then span his fifth shot from the drop zone back into the same hazard.</p><p>The left-hander finally found the putting surface with his seventh shot and two-putted, but compounded his misery by hitting his approach to the ninth into the water to the right of the green. That led to a bogey five and meant Mickelson had to settle for an opening 71, one under par.</p><p>McIlroy won five times in 2012, including a second major title by eight shots, to finish top of the money lists on both side of the Atlantic, but his only \"win\" this season came in an 18-hole exhibition match against Tiger Woods on Monday.</p><p>However, the Northern Irishman told a post-round press conference that he was keeping his struggles this year firmly in perspective. \"I've tried to stay patient the entire season and I know that if I am working on the right things, then things will start to fall into place sooner or later,\" he said. \"It's obviously frustrating when you've had a couple of seasons where you have had success and not being able to emulate that.</p><p>\"I wouldn't say that I was restless in terms of trying to get a win this season, because I think that the best way to approach it is to stay patient and not to force the issue too much.</p><p>\"If I have a 25-year career, nine months of a 25-year career isn't actually that long. If you look at in the time you play an 18-hole golf course, it's really a half a hole that you're struggling on.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421390218'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2013/10/31/1383214938918/Rory-McIlroy-in-Shanghai-011.jpg' alt='Rory McIlroy in Shanghai' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland enjoyed an impressive opening round at the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai. Photograph: Lintao Zhang/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking about his round, McIlroy added: \"I feel good, I'm controlling my ball much better, seeing shots the way I like to see shots. It's getting there, it definitely is. It's only one round but it's a great start.</p><p>\"I played very well, controlled my ball very well for the first 12 or 13 holes. I hit a couple of loose shots coming in that I got away with but it was nice to birdie one of the last couple to shoot seven under.\"</p><p>McIlroy is less than €4,000 (£3,400) behind Garth Mulroy in 60th place on the money list, but will now have his eyes firmly on the first prize of just over €1m (£856,000).</p><p>\"As I said, I've got a much better chance of winning this tournament than missing out on Dubai and a round like today only strengthens that position,\" he added.</p><p>Fernández-Castaño carded four birdies in his last five holes and hopes he can maintain his rich vein of form as he looks to secure a first Ryder Cup appearance next year. \"I've done that in the past and hopefully I can keep doing it this week but it's a very good tournament,\" the Spaniard said.</p><p>\"I was feeling a little tired on Tuesday but I guess it's normal after all the adrenalin rush on Sunday and Monday. \"It takes a while to recover but I wasn't in the pro-am on Wednesday so I took a good rest and am feeling 100% again.\"</p><p>Donaldson enjoyed a rollercoaster round featuring six birdies, an eagle and three bogeys, the Welshman driving the green on the short par-four 16th and holing from 25 feet for his eagle.</p><p>The 38-year-old finished 34th last week after an opening 79 and said: \"I was all over the place that first day but sometimes it takes a bit of time to get in stride and today was a good day. I didn't sleep great last week so didn't feel great, but I'm fully acclimatised now and there's no excuses.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421355928|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|c0cd4f77f4eb4827d9ac5b604b8b2cc92637f554 -->",

        "body":"<p>Celebrate good times, come on. There is nothing like a great sporting celebration to get the blood pumping, as all the pressure that has been building inside is finally allowed to disperse, that brief period of time following something special where both athletes and fans experience an overwhelming feeling of elation. Here are five moments when competitors marked success in an unforgettable manner. A high five if you like.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=g5jVGL0g4Eo\" title=\"\">1) Seve Ballesteros: 1984 Open Championship</a></h2><p>Two all-time greats of golf were locked in battle as the conclusion of the 1984 Open Championship at St Andrews drew near. After 71 and 70 holes respectively, Seve Ballesteros and Tom Watson were inseparable at the top of the leaderboard, although the infamous Road Hole was about to put a dent in Watson's hopes of a sixth Open triumph. Ballesteros was in much better shape, standing over a 15-foot birdie putt on the last, a golden opportunity to place one hand on the Claret Jug.</p><p>The Spaniard sent the putt on its way, as the golfing world, including me as an eight-year-old watching my first major, looked on. The right-to-left putt looked good from the moment it left Ballesteros' putter, tracking beautifully at just the right pace and on the correct line. For a brief moment it appeared as if the ball and gravity were going to do the unthinkable and refuse to yield to the charismatic legend of European golf. And then it dropped those final important few inches. Barring a miracle, Seve had joined the likes of Bobby Jones, Sam Snead and Jack Nicklaus, as an Open winner at the home of golf.</p><p>The outpouring of emotion from Ballesteros manifested itself in one of the most memorable celebrations in golf history. Standing on the 18th green, decked in a navy Slazenger sweater, Seve thrust his right hand towards the ground, his face initially contort with ecstatic relief. A joyous expression spread across his face, the words &quot;la meti&quot; (&quot;I put it in&quot;) repeatedly leaving his mouth, which had developed into such a warm and endearing smile. And then came the fist pumps, originally at chest height, then in front of his face, finished off with a couple of arm-straightening punches towards the delighted galleries.</p><p>Such an iconic snapshot, so much so that the silhouette image of Seve's celebration is still widely used. From the image used for the Seve Foundation in support of cancer research, to the logo adorning the bags and sleeves of Europe's heroes at the Miracle of Medinah, the memories come flooding back at a mere glimpse of that outline of a figure who changed the complexion of European golf.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=rjSDvdgTOzg\" title=\"\">2) Ian Botham: 1981 Fourth Ashes Test</a></h2><p>When Ian Botham took Australia's sixth second-innings wicket on the final day of the fourth Test at Edgbaston, it looked like it might be too little too late. Australia still only needed 37 more runs to win the match and take a 2-1 series lead, the feelgood victory at Headingley looking more and more like a delicious one-off freak result.</p><p>Yet post-captaincy Beefy could do no wrong. The wickets of Rod Marsh, Ray Bright, Dennis Lillee and Martin Kent pushed the fragile Aussies close to the brink of another crushing defeat, as an inspired Botham, driven on by an atmosphere that still thrills, began his approach to the crease for the coup de grace.</p><p>Terry Alderman didn't stand a chance, becoming Botham's fifth wicket in 28 balls at the cost of just one run. You can only begin to imagine the adrenaline rush that Botham must have experienced at that precise moment, as he clean bowled Alderman and surged forward to grab a stump in celebration. Watching it still never fails to do funny things to the hairs on the back of my neck.</p><p>That Botham celebration encapsulated the turnaround of his summer, and the force of personality possessed by the great all-rounder, especially after he had returned to the ranks. Barrel-chested, waving a stump triumphantly, Botham looked every inch the heroic lead in a barely believable film. Cricket celebrations were often curtailed in the 1980s due to spectator participation, yet Beefy even managed to get over this small matter in that amazing summer of 1981.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo_Vu1ZenYU\" title=\"\">3) Pat Cash: 1987 Men's Wimbledon final</a></h2><p>Pat Cash had promised himself that if he won Wimbledon he would share the victory with his family and friends in the players' box. So after defeating Ivan Lendl in the 1987 final, he now had to stick to his personal contract. Cash soon realised that this was easier said than done.</p><p>After making a decisive move into the crowd, Cash started to doubt his plan, admitting he was stuck among the confused spectators in a potentially embarrassing situation. His dad and coach continued to provide encouragement, though it would take some divine inspiration to set Cash on his way.</p><p>A man beckoned Cash towards him, imploring the champion to use his shoulders as a stepping stone to the top of the commentary box. &quot;I looked at him, and it was a priest, he had the collar,&quot; Cash later recalled. How's that for providing a service on a Sunday?</p><p>Despite being concerned about the strength of the roof of the commentary box, Cash had now completed the hard yards. He reached the summit and embraced his dad, sister, uncle, girlfriend, coach and best mates, as the viewing public looked on in admiration at such a unique celebration.</p><p>He may have delayed the trophy ceremony, but no one minded in the slightest. Although it has been mimicked in subsequent years, the first time was easily better than any of the sequels, and provided the 1980s with yet another unforgettable sporting celebration.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo_Vu1ZenYU\" title=\"\">4) Tiina Lillak: 1983 Athletics World Championships</a></h2><p>Just one throw remained in the women's javelin at the inaugural World Championships in Helsinki. One person stood at the end of the runway, the only competitor left who could deny Britain's Fatima Whitbread the gold medal. Unfortunately, that woman was the current world record holder and a hometown favourite with the vast majority of the stadium behind her.</p><p>Tiina Lillak; the mere mention of her name must send shivers down the spine of Whitbread, as she is instantly transported back to her own personal nightmare. Whitbread's first round throw of 69.14m had been the benchmark throughout the final and now only Lillak remained. The problem was, the Finn had a winning throw in her locker, and everyone knew it.</p><p>Standing on the track, Lillak psyched herself up, gritted her teeth, before starting on her sprint to the throwing line. Whitbread prowled, trying not to watch but inevitably unable to avoid it. Lillak launched the javelin, the volume of the locals cranking up in direct relation to the length of time that the spear hung in the air. On and on it went, until it landed beyond 70m. And then pandemonium.</p><p>The realisation of what had just happened resonated around the Olympic Stadium, an explosion of noise erupting from the elated locals. As if propelled by this, Lillak tore off around the track, leaping on occasion, punching the air, and celebrating in a style reminiscent of Ian Rush or Alan Shearer. Finally she came to a stop, surrounded by photographers who had at last managed to catch some pictures of Finland's World Champion.</p><p>Of course for every happy story there is a sad element. Look very closely at the clip on YouTube and you can spot a figure in red put her hand to her head as she looks on from the track, seeing her hopes fly off into the distance. Whitbread immediately set off to find her mum, before breaking down in tears, a gold medal snatched away from her at the death. She would perform her own celebration four years later in Rome - her wiggle becoming a trademark - but before then Fatima Whitbread certainly had to experience the lows before enjoying that high.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UdgoeIevhY\" title=\"\">5) Marco Tardelli: 1982 World Cup final</a></h2><p>Every now and then you watch a sporting event that reaffirms your faith. A moment that contains all that is good in something you probably care a little too much about. Marco Tardelli's goal celebration in the 1982 World Cup final was one such demonstration of what playing sport should mean, and what following sport does mean to so many of us.</p><p>The weeks leading up to the final had not been kind to Tardelli and his team mates. One journalist even hinted that the Juventus midfielder was finished, the abuse suffered by Tardelli and the Italian squad reaching a peak during their spluttering first group stage. Somehow the Italians turned things around, beating Argentina and tournament favourites Brazil in their second round group, before beating Poland in the semi-finals to set up a meeting with West Germany.</p><p>Tardelli was a bundle of nerves the night before the final, hardly sleeping, and his state of mind did not improve on the deathly silent coach journey to the Bernabeu. All of these factors - the criticism, the nerves, the tension - combined to create an incredible example of sporting passion, as Marco Tardelli celebrated a goal which edged his team closer to World Cup glory.</p><p>&quot;What I was feeling was like if something was exploding in me .... a volcano inside me,&quot; Tardelli explained, as the world witnessed an emotional goal celebration that told us just what it meant to score for your country in a World Cup final. Wheeling away in delight, Tardelli seemed to enter a different world, as the weeks of hurt, frustration and anxiety flooded out, his scream – l'urlo di Tardelli – releasing all the pent up emotions in his body.</p><p>James Richardson summed up Tardelli's celebration neatly: &quot;If you're looking at football as a vehicle of human emotion and endeavour, it's the money shot&quot;. Quite simply, an exhilarating episode of sporting history, a clip you would use to emphasise why a lot of us spend so much time bothering about football in the first place.</p><p><strong>• This blog first appeared on </strong><a href=\"http://that1980ssportsblog.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>That 1980s Sports Blog</strong></a></p><p><strong>• Follow </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/1980sSportsBlog\" title=\"\"><strong>Steven Pye on Twitter</strong></a></p><p><strong>• Follow </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Sport on Facebook</strong></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421228060|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|d9209e9322e1dac9348b01f595c3b345e61512c3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Sunnylands, the setting for the Xi-Obama summit under way this weekend, bills itself as a magnet for famous golf lovers: Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra and no fewer than four presidents (Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr) have teed off there.</p><p>Obama is known to be partial to 18 holes, but golf enthusiasts should not expect to see him take on Xi Jinping. Chinese leaders have been pictured kicking soccer balls (Xi) and playing basketball (former premier Wen Jiabao); it is practically <em>de rigueur</em> for them to pick up a table-tennis bat or proclaim their love of swimming (not surprising, since Chairman Mao would take to the water when he wanted to demonstrate his vigour). But golf is definitely not on the list of approved sports for the Chinese leadership to be seen playing in public.</p><p>The first and last high-profile golfer was Zhao Ziyang – the general secretary toppled for his sympathy towards the student protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p><p>A photograph in his secretly recorded memoirs shows him chipping a ball into a net in his courtyard home during his house arrest, which lasted until his death - although he was occasionally allowed out to play, surrounded by guards.</p><p>Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney,  suggests the association with Zhao, and its archetypally American image, may have helped to give the sport \"a certain negative flavour\".</p><p>It had already been banned as a bourgeois indulgence during the cultural revolution and courses were dug up, not to re-emerge until the mid-80s.</p><p>But they flourished as the economy boomed, and in 2004 China banned the creation of more courses because of concerns about the declining amount of farmland and water usage. It had little effect: the number is believed to have soared from under 200 that year to around 600.</p><p>Thanks to such illicit openings, and its popularity with China's elite, golf has also become associated with inequality, the excesses of the rich and rampant corruption.</p><p>When China's new anti-corruption chief said last week that discipline and supervision staff should return any prepaid membership cards they had been given, observers were quick to draw the link with golfing.</p><p>\"Many officials' salaries cannot afford expenses at high-end places, such as golf clubs, but they often consume in those places with membership cards,\" Zhu Lijia, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Governance, told China  Daily. </p><p>A 2008 survey by KPMG found the average cost of joining a Chinese club was $53,000: several times the modest annual salary of even a high level official.</p><p>Will the game ever become respectable? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/guan-tianlang\">The emergence of teenage prodigy Guan Tianliang</a> has probably helped to improve its image, as has the news that it will return to the Olympics in 2016.

        "body":"<p>The hallowed fairways of Augusta National, the home of golf's annual Masters tournament, are being opened up to women for the first time, ending an increasingly controversial and anachronistic ban on female membership which had survived for 80 years.</p><p>Bowing to the not-so-modern concept of gender equality, the club announced on Monday it had invited two female members to join the club: former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore. </p><p>\"This is a joyous occasion,\" club chairman Billy Payne said in a statement. \"We are fortunate to consider many qualified candidates for membership at Augusta National. Consideration with regard to any candidate is deliberate, held in strict confidence and always takes place over an extended period of time. The process for Condoleezza and Darla was no different.</p><p>\"These accomplished women share our passion for the game of golf and both are well known and respected by our membership,\" Payne continued. \"It will be a proud moment when we present Condoleezza and Darla their green jackets when the club opens this fall.\"</p><p>In a statement released by the club, Rice, who served in George Bush's administration, said she looked forward to \"playing golf, renewing friendships and forming new ones through this very special opportunity\".</p><p>Moore, the vice-president of private investment firm Rainwater, said being asked to join the Augusta National represented \"a very happy and important occasion in my life\".</p><p>The announcement marks the end of a rearguard action by Payne and the Augusta leadership against the march of sexual equality. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/04/masters-2012\">As recently as the last Masters tournament in April, Payne had reaffirmed the all-male policy</a>.</p><p>After successfully fending off demands to admit women members, the club faced intense scrutiny this year following the appointment of Ginni Rometty as IBM's chief executive officer. IBM is a major sponsor of the Masters, and Rometty's four predecessors had been invited to become members of the club. However, no such invitation was issued to Rometty.</p><p>In the ensuing controversy, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/06/augusta-national-golf-club-women-members\">Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney joined the calls</a> for Augusta to abandon its men-only rule.</p><p>Martha Burk of the National Council of Women's Organisations, who has led the campaign for the club to admit women since 2002, said she was delighted at the news, but added that her invitation to join had yet to arrive. </p><p>\"I am very pleased. The woman's movement has prevailed,\" she said. \"It took a decade, but we did it. It is definitely a vindication.\"</p><p>She added: \"If I get an invite I will accept, absolutely.\"</p><p>Burk had repeatedly clashed with then Augusta chairman Hootie Johnson, who defended the policy even when it meant losing television sponsorship. Corporate sponsors, unnerved by the controversy over sexism, pulled out of the 2003 and 2004 Masters tournaments.</p><p>Before stepping down in 2006, Johnson conceded that Augusta National might one day have a woman in a green jacket, \"but not at the point of a bayonet.\" It became a battle cry for stubborn male members.</p><p>Although under the previous policy women were prohibited from gaining membership, they were allowed onto the course as guests.</p><p>It should not be surprising that Augusta National has taken so long to fall in line with the rest of society. The club, which opened in in December 1932, only accepted its first black member in 1990.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394966913|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|ed726298eaea1bfd4b19068a6926b2fd43f5d9b3 -->",

        "body":"<p>For the first time in its 80-year history, Augusta National Golf Club has female members.</p><p>The home of golf's Masters championship, which has faced increasing criticism because of its all-male membership, invited former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore to become the first women in green jackets when the club opens for a new season in October.</p><p>Both women accepted.</p><p>\"This is a joyous occasion,\" Augusta National chairman Billy Payne said on Monday.</p><p>The move likely ends a debate that intensified in 2002 when Martha Burk of the National Council of Women's Organizations urged the club to include women among its members.

Photograph: David J Phillip/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Payne, who took over as chairman in 2006 when Johnson retired, said consideration for new members is deliberate and private, and that Rice and Moore were not treated differently from other new members. Even so, he took the rare step of announcing two of the latest members to join because of the historical significance.</p><p>\"These accomplished women share our passion for the game of golf and both are well known and respected by our membership,\" Payne said in a statement. \"It will be a proud moment when we present Condoleezza and Darla their green jackets when the club opens this fall. This is a significant and positive time in our club's history and, on behalf of our membership, I wanted to take this opportunity to welcome them and all of our new members into the Augusta National family.\"</p><p>A person with knowledge of club operations said Rice and Moore first were considered as members five years ago. That would be four years after the 2003 Masters, when Burk's protest in a grass lot down the street from the club attracted only about 30 supporters, and one year after Payne became chairman.</p><p>Moore and Johnson are close friends, both with roots in South Carolina and banking, and the person said Payne and Johnson agreed on the timing of a female member. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the club typically does not discuss membership issues, said it was important to Payne to be respectful of the membership process. The person said prospective members often are not aware they are being considered.</p><p>Augusta National, which opened in December 1932 and did not have a black member until 1990, is believed to have about 300 members. While the club until now had no female members, women were allowed to play the golf course as guests, including on the Sunday before the Masters week began in April.</p><p>The issue of female membership resurfaced again this year after Virginia Rometty was appointed chief executive of IBM, one of the Masters' corporate sponsors. The previous four CEOs of Big Blue had all been Augusta National members, leading to speculation that the club would break at least one tradition – membership for the top executive of IBM or a men-only club.</p><p>Rometty was seen at the Masters on the final day wearing a pink jacket, not a green one. She was not announced as one of the newest members.</p><p>Moore, 58, first rose to prominence in the 1980s with Chemical Bank, where she became the highest-paid woman in the banking industry. She is vice president of Rainwater, a private investment company founded by her husband, Richard Rainwater. She was the first woman to be profiled on the cover of Fortune Magazine, and she made a $25 million contribution to her alma mater, South Carolina, which renamed its business school after her.</p><p>Moore was mentioned as a possible Augusta National member during the height of the all-male membership debate in 2002. She and Johnson worked on South Carolina's $300 million capital campaign in the late 1990s.</p><p>\"Augusta National has always captured my imagination, and is one of the most magically beautiful places anywhere in the world, as everyone gets to see during the Masters each April,\" Moore said. \"I am fortunate to have many friends who are members at Augusta National, so to be asked to join them as a member represents a very happy and important occasion in my life.</p><p>\"Above all, Augusta National and the Masters Tournaments have always stood for excellence, and that is what is so important to me.\"</p><p>Rice, 57, was the national security adviser under former President George W. Bush and became secretary of state in his second term. The first black woman to be a Stanford provost in 1993, she now is a professor of political economy at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.</p><p>\"I have visited Augusta National on several occasions and look forward to playing golf, renewing friendships and forming new ones through this very special opportunity,\" Rice said in a statement released by the club. \"I have long admired the important role Augusta National has played in the traditions and history of golf. I also have an immense respect for the Masters Tournament and its commitment to grow the game of golf, particularly with youth, here in the United States and throughout the world.\"</p><p>Rice recently was appointed to the US Golf Association's nominating committee.</p><p>Johnson regarded the membership debate as infringing on the rights of a private club, even though every April it hosts the Masters, the most popular of the four major championships, which brings in millions of dollars through television rights for the highest-rated telecast in golf.</p><p>In a 2002 interview with the Associated Press, Johnson said the makeup of the club was more about four members-only parties each year than who plays the course.</p><p>\"Our club has enjoyed a camaraderie and a closeness that's served us well for so long, that it makes it difficult for us to consider change,\" he said. \"A woman may be a member of this club one day, but that is out in the future.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/394959069|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|5292fe40abc9066b243dcc6e606612e509eb4936 -->",

        "headline":"Tiger Woods' hopes for comeback overshadowed by ex-coach's memoir",
        "body":"<p>When Tiger Woods tees off in the first round of the Masters in Augusta on Thursday, millions of golf fans will be wondering if the former world No&nbsp;1 can bring off one of the greatest comeback stories in professional sport.</p><p>After winning his first tournament in two-and-a-half years last month, Woods appears set finally to put the turmoil of his life and career behind him since details first emerged of his repeated extramarital dalliances.</p><p>\"Americans love second chances and stories of redemption. Most golf fans are very eager to have him back,\" said Orin Starn, a professor of cultural anthropology at  Duke University in North Carolina and author of <em>The Passion of Tiger Woods. \"</em>Like him or hate him, he has provided spectacular drama.\"</p><p>But, like most things in Woods's career since a night-time car accident in Florida first hinted at problems in his domestic life, the path to redemption is still not entirely smooth. Last week Woods's camp reacted with fury to the publication of a tell-all book, <em>The Big Miss,</em> by his former swing coach Hank Haney.</p><p>Haney's book did not contain too many surprises, especially around the string of mistresses who turned the golfer from admired family man to tabloid fodder.</p><p>Instead it just confirmed a portrait of a Woods that most people already thought they knew: hyper-focused, unemotional and self-absorbed. But Woods's agent, Mark Steinberg, issued a slamming statement anyway. \"Haney admits he never had in-depth, personal discussions with Tiger. This self-serving book is full of guesses and false assumptions,\" he said.</p><p>When a journalist asked the fitness-obsessed Woods recently about the book's claim that – in reaction to his personal crises – he had considered giving up golf and joining the elite Navy Seals, Woods got into a terse exchange with the reporter that included him saying: \"You're a beauty, you know that?\" Woods faces another press conference on Tuesday in Augusta.</p><p>More recently pictures of an unsmiling Woods signing autographs showed that his ability to relate comfortably to his public might still need a little polishing. \"He looked like a resentful killer robot signing autographs. He still had that imperious stare. After everything that has changed in his life he is still the same old Tiger Woods,\" said Starn.</p><p>But now there is another blast from the past: Woods is the bookies' favourite for the Masters, one of golf's four major championships. For many observers that matters more to the rehabilitation than any of his still icy behaviour or fresh revelations about his past. In the end Woods and golf – like any sport and its major star – is a business that is all about money and success. An on-form Woods playing at the Masters is already a talking point. If he were to look like winning, then TV ratings for the tournament would go through the roof. It could also mean a bonanza for Woods as advertisers, who abandoned the star in the wake of his fall from grace, might be tempted to flock back with endorsement offers. \"That tide might shift totally after next weekend. If he is in contention to win it, then it will be a huge event,\" said Frank Shorr, the director of the Sports Institute at Boston University.</p><p>But even if Woods does triumph in Augusta – a tournament that he has won four times, but not since 2005 – he will still be a very different figure from the pre-scandal sporting hero. He had always been held up as a family man with the perfect marriage, mixing that with a turbo-charged  style that saw him dominate his sport. That is never coming back.  After an expensive divorce, therapeutic counselling and changes in both caddies and coaches, Woods is rising back to the top of his sport. But there is also a sense that many of the golfing public in America are ready to back him again.</p><p>\"I am sure he will be re-embraced by corporate America. But it will be a different Tiger Woods. It will not be the family man, straight-arrow role model,\" said Starn.</p><p>It is, of course, hard to tell if Woods will care too much. Haney's book repeatedly describes a man whose emotions and thoughts are impossible to read, even for someone who spent six years as a close companion and teacher. \"Whether with friends, business associates, other players, his mother or his wife… he seemed to keep the atmosphere around him emotionally arid,\" Haney wrote.</p><p>Which is something that sounds familiar to any serious follower of Woods's career: the more it has changed the more he has stayed the same.</p><p>His intense, blank expression does not seem to shift. \"He has gone through so many life changes, but when you see him from the outside it is very hard to tell,\" said Shorr.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/388117450|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|ad6815eae5f6d34e9398764e54ecf20770bf8cd4 -->",

        "headline":"Seve Ballesteros remembered by Gary Lineker",
        "body":"<p>My mum fancied Seve Ballesteros to death. It was the only time she'd ever watch golf, if Seve was playing. She thought he was gorgeous.</p><p>When I was a boy he was one of my heroes. He wasn't a conventional golfer – all fairways and greens and cautious play. Rather he was a swashbuckler. He had huge charisma. Whatever position he was in he'd somehow conjure up a magical shot to get out of it.</p><p>I first met him in 1999, playing in a pro-am tournament at Woburn before the British Masters. I remember seeing in the draw that I was playing with Seve; I had about 50 people asking if they could caddie for me, which was wholly unusual. Seve was in great form. Not necessarily in terms of his game – Woburn is a tight course, and Seve is pretty wild off the tee; he was forever in the trees. He still hit some incredible shots. He holed a putt that twisted left and right and up and down before dropping in. A monster shot, and he gave one of his typical celebrations – the big smile and fist pump. The celebration wasn't quite on a par with winning his first British Open, in 1979 in his famous blue jumper, but it wasn't far off.</p><p>I was fortunate to spend a lot of time in his company that day, and latterly I worked with him a number of times through the BBC. I wouldn't presume to claim Seve as a mate, but we got on well. He was a big Barcelona fan  and would always want to talk about football while I would always want to talk about golf.</p><p>He was ill for a long time, having been diagnosed with brain cancer in 2008. It was a constant source of conversation in the game: how's Seve? People were worried about him. At big tournaments, especially the Ryder Cup, there was always an atmosphere, a feeling, a thought towards Seve. It was a difficult time in the game, especially, I imagine, for players who'd played with him, and his close friends, the Spanish guys, José María Olazábal in particular, after that amazing partnership he and Seve had in Ryder Cups over the years.</p><p>After he died, in May, we made a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012lt4d\" title=\"\">tribute film</a> at the BBC. It was great to see new footage of him, and to hear all the stories about him, particularly from his caddies. He was so fiercely competitive, and always, perhaps, quick to blame the caddy – as most golfers are. Always better to blame someone else because confidence is everything in sport. But I think the caddies had a pretty tough time with him; that was something I hadn't realised before, that he could be difficult to work with.</p><p>But there were some terrific stories about him. There was once a kid at the side of the green, making noise, and Seve turned to him to say something like: \"You're nervous? You don't think I am?\" I thought that summed him up. It was a chastisement but done with great charm, great humour. That was Seve.</p><p>I spoke to him on a few occasions before his death. I interviewed him on the phone for the BBC a couple of years ago about his illness. He wanted to raise awareness about brain cancer, and it was a very emotional interview. He spoke deeply about what he was going through, the mental sides of his disease. There were a couple of times when I struggled to speak. Later I called him in the hope that he might be able to come over to receive the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/8405808.stm\" title=\"\">lifetime achievement award</a> at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. He was too ill to fly. That would be the last time I spoke to him.</p><p>Seve was one of the absolute greats, a pioneering European golfer, arguably Europe's first superstar – someone who transcended his sport because of that aura that he had, that charisma, those incredible good looks. We've had great players in Europe before, and we'll have them again. But nothing quite like Seve.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/382900769|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|2e224ae6e907bc42c6dee1be47115d2f04ee86cb -->",
