        "headline":"The Women's Institute is resurgent – and we should not be surprised",
        "body":"<p>Earlier this week in Bromley Heath, Bristol, hundreds of women queued to join a new branch of <a href=\"http://www.thewi.org.uk/about-the-wi\" title=\"\">the Women's Institute</a>. This is the kind of sentence, like \"The clocks were striking thirteen\", where each word is perfectly sensible but the implication is wild. A queue to join the WI! An organisation for the promotion of jam-making, founded during the first world war to boost productivity, is having a surge of popularity. Things must be bad.</p><p>But really, the idea that the WI is the face of 21st century sisterhood should be no surprise at all. The reason why the venerable institution has survived in an increasingly atomised age is because it is founded on an eternal truth: that doing stuff with other women feeds some atavistic communal urge, the sort of thing that made us gather round the fire tatting animal skins. It feels good. A lot of us like it.</p><p>It matters most of all when times are hard. The WI has always put a premium on making do and mending, and doing it with your friends and neighbours. But nothing is quite as it seems, starting with making do which, as branches like <a href=\"http://shoreditchsisters.blogspot.co.uk/search?updated-min=2013-01-01T00:00:00Z&amp;updated-max=2014-01-01T00:00:00Z&amp;max-results=13\" title=\"\">the Shoreditch Sisters</a> have discovered, is just another way of describing vintage.</p><p>And then there's baking. Truly, when Mary Berry has become a style icon, the WI would have to be moribund not to make a killing. The Great British Bake Off has shown a whole new generation that skill and creativity are valuable even when they aren't paid for (although they do seem to be worth more if they win prizes. The world isn't perfect yet.)</p><p>But maybe what the queues outside the WI's new Bromley Heath branch really show is that, at last, it's OK to be a woman, in the sense that being a woman comfortably embraces Mary Berry, Sue Perkins <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/22/great-british-bake-off-ruby-dandoh\" title=\"\">and Ruby Tandoh</a>. Womanhood – to risk the scathing wrath of some – can at last be self-defining. That may explain why the show annoyed so many men. The triumph of the art of baking marks not so much a breakout as a breakthrough. No compulsion to escape from the kitchen any more, because the kitchen itself is cool. Or hot, obviously.</p><p>It's been coming for a while. All those cooking shows. There've even been shows about housework. Housework! Hoovering and dusting and how to clean the bath. This can only be explained by the appeal of the unavailable. Now that most of us work out of the home most of the time, daily domesticity looks like some beguiling luxury. Oh, beware of what you wish for.</p><p>Yet once the daily chores are elevated into an art form, at least in television's terms, the people who always used to do them – that's us, women – have a new authority. It's not about fitting the old prescribed, age-appropriate roles relating to size and shape. It's not even about earning power. It's a kind of permission to be ourselves, and it reflects a different ordering of society that recognises the extent of female friendship.</p><p>And here comes the WI. The WI kept on trucking through the bad times when what happened at home didn't matter because it was all about being out there, consuming not creating, succeeding on your own, not on your own terms. Now its core value, that it's not about who you are, but what you can do, feels exactly right. Just like its appeal to community, to knowing your neighbours and having a good time together. Political parties used to do this stuff, you know.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421269356|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|4e0f829d0f9139b262a2bf5c2eafe919c3a70f2e -->",

However inclusive we are, we have standards to maintain.\"</p><p>Setting aside (as the headteacher himself did) any arguments for special religious dispensation, the head's words speak volumes. Sporting a beard is seen as a choice, and making that choice somehow lowers standards.</p><p>Like all beardies, I don't have a beard through choice. It just grew on the front of my face. I choose to have a beard in the same way that I choose to have two legs. Yes, I suppose I could elect to remove either of the offending limbs, but I'm damned if I'm going to.</p><p>The Accrington headteacher isn't alone. Society seems to think that scraping or strimming the hair off your face is an admirable thing to do; that not doing so is odd. Paxman appears on Newsnight – after the watershed – with full, unadulterated facial hair, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/13/jeremy-paxman-beard-tickles-newsnight-twitter\" title=\"\">Twitter erupts</a>. The Lib Dems' spin-doctor grows a beard, and Nick Clegg immediately <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/17/conference-diary-beards-and-sandals\" title=\"\">orders him to cut it off</a>. Nigel Slater <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/22/diary-working-week-nigel-slater\" title=\"\">sprouts some facial fuzz</a> and braces himself for the inevitable flak. Get over it: they're only beards.</p><p>Men who go for the default (bearded) option aren't making some kind of statement; it's those who choose to mow their faces who seem to have something to prove. What's your problem? Afraid to grow up, boys? Ashamed of your masculinity? In <a href=\"http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/much_2_1.html\" title=\"\">Much Ado About Nothing</a>, Beatrice had it right: \"He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man.\"</p><p>The world is outraged when an 18-year-old pop starlet <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4\" title=\"\">dresses as a schoolgirl</a> to sell a few million singles. Yet when fully grown men shave their faces for that prepubescent-schoolboy look, nobody bats an eyelid. It's all seen as perfectly normal. Standards must be maintained.</p><p>Such nonsense was even going on in 19th-century Tierra del Fuego. When Charles Darwin witnessed the meeting of a man known as York Minster, one of the Fuegian natives abducted during the Beagle voyage, with some of his long-lost compatriots, <a href=\"http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/charles_darwin/voyage_of_beagle/Chapter10.html\" title=\"\">he recorded</a>: \"When York Minster afterwards came on shore, they […] told him he ought to shave; yet he had not twenty dwarf hairs on his face, whilst we all wore our untrimmed beards.\" York Minster was letting his hide-clad, stone-age side down in front of the uncouth Europeans, it would seem.</p><p>What about the environment? Have the face-strimmers ever stopped to consider the carbon footprint of their unnatural daily ritual? Figures I've just made up indicate that, were every man in Britain to refrain from shaving, we would be able to close two medium-sized coal-fired power stations. So there you have it: grow a beard and save the planet. Baby-faced George Monbiot ought to hang his head in shame. He of all people should appreciate the enchantment of going feral.</p><p>Not convinced? Carry on scraping your faces, if it makes you happy, chaps. But don't try to pretend for a second that those of us who don't are the ones making the freakish choice.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419697337|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|128446575b8a1347c4a85951da666e97fb9472e5 -->",

        "body":"<p>As a lifelong cyclist, I'm usually spared the horrors of public transport. Suitcases (and worse) pressing into my coccyx, Metro horoscopes, vomit, delays and the smell of someone else's sweaty armpits – I happily avoid them.</p><p>But one new public transport phenomenon has recently crashed into my consciousness. Tumblr accounts dedicated to secretly photographing, uploading and then critiquing fellow commuters, have spored like bed bugs on a bus seat. From the <a href=\"http://tubecrush.net/\" title=\"\">apparently flattering</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.sleepycommuters.co.uk/\" title=\"\">supposedly endearing</a> to the <a href=\"http://peopleonthebus.tumblr.com\" title=\"\">allegedly hilarious</a>, there seems to be a blog to capture every kind of commuter.</p><p>British law on photographing people in public places is still quite malleable. While the European convention on human rights codifies everyone's right to private and family life, you do not, legally, have to get permission from those you photograph in the street, on the train or sitting on a bus. Meanwhile, despite a European court of human rights declaration that the stop-and-search powers granted under section 44 of the 2000 Terrorism Act were being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/23/photographers-protest-stop-search-terrorism-police\" title=\"\">wrongfully used to target photographers</a>, the law is still apparently misunderstood even <a href=\"http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/photo-news/538898/photographers-slam-police-over-indecent-photos-update\" title=\"\">by the police themselves</a>.</p><p>Frankly, the whole legal issue is murkier than a dimly lit pub toilet selfie. But while the legal argument is fraught, the moral debate surely is not.</p><p>Every day, blogs like <a href=\"http://mentakingup2muchspaceonthetrain.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Men Taking Up Too Much Space On The Train</a> post clandestine pictures of commuters, under the snide and self-proclaimed mission of public shaming. Frankly, if I had a loose assemblage of bulky, heat-sensitive genitals hanging between my legs, I would probably sit with my knees hip-width apart too. Most of these men are doing absolutely nothing wrong. And yet their image, including their faces, is being uploaded to the internet and they are being judged by thousands of strangers, all without their knowledge.</p><p>Turn that gender picture on its head and perhaps you'll see why this is unacceptable. Were a man to secretly photograph me – a young woman – upload that photo to Tumblr and invite comments from other users, I think my sisters would be throwing up their hands in horror. And rightly so – the Japanese iPhone has a shutter sound that <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/07/pervert-alert-j/\" title=\"\">cannot be turned off</a>, specifically to guard against snap-happy perverts. And yet, I rarely hear the same language being applied to women who upload submissions to <a href=\"http://hotguysonthetrain.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Hot Guys On The Train</a>. Last week I saw a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tonygardner/status/382416561933676545\" title=\"\">man tweet:</a> \"Girl sat opposite on tube tried to take a sneaky photo of me. Her flash went off. She was mortified.\" Mortified she might have been, but was he not also angry?</p><p>There is also, of course, the question of money. If these blogs are sufficiently popular to gain advertising space, then those photos are no longer not-for-profit, amusing, public-realm snaps. They are a commodity. And the people in them, by extension, are no longer just strangers on a train – they are models.</p><p>As with all photographs, context and composition are key. While it is one thing to take an unidentifiable snap of a <a href=\"http://shoesonthetube.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">fellow commuter's footwear</a> it is quite another to upload a <a href=\"http://peopleonthebus.tumblr.com/post/3941888941/here-is-the-picture-of-the-homeless-guy-who\" title=\"\">full portrait of a total stranger</a> accompanied by the comment: \"Here is the picture of the homeless guy who threatened to kill me after I took his picture.\"</p><p>Of course, some photos taken on transport are funny. Who among us didn't snicker at <a href=\"http://redditlurker.com/pics/Post/t3_pv7yk\" title=\"\">Hitler on the bus</a>? But that doesn't make it right. Because that wasn't really Hitler, it was just a man, in Plymouth, who got laughed at by millions, without any hope of recourse.</p><p>Call me a ludicrous old libertarian. But I, for one, just don't think we should shoot strangers in public spaces.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418991273|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|ef2b44758370c6e00451cc86221e0a2f35794274 -->",

        "body":"<p>What will become of the class of 2013? Are they already on their way to becoming captains of industry? Have they met the people they plan to have children with? Are they saving all their spare money for a house deposit, so they can tie themselves into a 30-year mortgage at their earliest convenience? If anecdotal evidence is anything to go by, this year's crop of graduates are sat in their bedrooms, tapping \"recruitment agency\" into Google and trying not to burst into tears while panicking about what they will be doing in a year's time, as further anecdotal evidence suggests they will be jobless and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2327674/Staggering-million-parents-50-grown-children-living-home.html\" title=\"\">still sleeping in their teenage bedrooms</a>.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/417222/Why-young-love-will-no-longer-last-for-a-lifetime\" title=\"\">Co-operative has commissioned a study</a> revealing it's taking young adults a bit longer to become proper grown-ups. According to its research, just one in seven people under 30 are married, and one in nine have children – when their grandparents tended to reach the traditional life milestones much quicker, with four out of five over-60s married by the age of 25, and over half with children at that age.</p><p></p><p>This is causing widespread anxiety – and not just among the retired parents desperate for grandchildren. The emergence of a \"quarter-life crisis\" among those in their mid-20s has been well-documented, with many people in that age bracket saying that their distance from perceived \"life goals\" is making them feel depressed and fearful. The problems are economic as well as emotional. Many in their 20s struggle to find jobs that allow them to earn enough to pay rent. If having a house and a family seem out of reach financially, there's less incentive to start looking for a person to share those things with.</p><p></p><p>The clinical psychologist Meg Jay caused a stir with <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/meg_jay_why_30_is_not_the_new_20.html\" title=\"\">a TED talk recently</a> that warned twentysomethings not to treat that period of their life as a \"throwaway decade\", and urged them to start planning their lives as soon as possible. Much of Jay's advice was focused around finding the right partner as soon as possible, and she implied that people in their 20s aren't moving forward with their lives because they're lazy and indecisive. The reality is that most young people don't have enough structural support in their lives to make plans. It has never been harder to buy a house, or forge a career path – and there's not much that people in their 20s can individually do about that, considering the current economic climate.</p><p></p><p>However, I believe there is an upside to forcibly delaying your future. You may be an adult in the eyes of the law, but you're still maturing. Deciding to share your life with someone shouldn't be an arbitrary goal, to be achieved by a certain point, and being forced to wait to settle down means that when you're able to do it, you'll be better prepared for it emotionally.</p><p></p><p>An enforced life delay gives young people time to better explore their options. Younger people who live and study away from home, or go travelling, or use social networks and online dating sites, have much more choice when it comes to finding the person who's right for them. They don't have to settle when they settle down – and they shouldn't have to. Marrying and starting a family as soon as you can is no guarantee of happiness. Arguably, you're better prepared for a lasting relationship if you've given yourself time to mature as a single adult, instead of starting a family when you're still growing up. You can't hurry love.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/413602880|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|f0877eb6037565b064c19b041641b3a98fe1dec6 -->",

        "headline":"'If you are allergic to black people, don't come in' – at first I balked …",
        "body":"<p>Increasingly in today's Britain, the word racism conjures up two very differing images for white and black people (I use black here in the political sense). When I explain to white friends that certain things that I have had said or done to me are racist, it is more often that not met with incredulity. How can that be racist?</p><p>The truth is the most prevalent forms of racism, which many black people experience today, are the insidious kinds. The sideways looks in predominantly white areas suggesting your presence there is beyond the norm. At work, your position of authority undermined by the all-too-easy questioning of your knowledge and experience. And, in the case of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-23248503\" title=\"\">Martha-Renee Kolleh</a>, the knowledge that the reason your cafe has such a low footfall is because you are black; the sight of your skin and not the menu explains why potential customers won't be dining with you after all. Her reaction? To create a sign warning the following: \"Attention! Everyone be aware, I am a black woman, and always will be. If you are allergic to black people, don't come in!\"</p><p>I initially balked at Kolleh's move. I feared it played into the hands of those who long to dismiss the very real problems she is attempting to highlight. She's would be seen as just another angry black woman. Yet, if so, her anger is justified. Though I cannot speak for all black people, I know, from workshops with the group <a href=\"http://www.blackfeminists.org/\" title=\"\">Black Feminists</a>, that far too many feel the same desperation and desire to speak back to the insidious racists.</p><p>Though born in London, I consider myself a Yorkshire lass. A few weeks ago, a trip to a popular Dales village reminded me of why being in all-white areas is increasingly something I am reluctant to do. I was with a disabled pensioner in his 80s and my 10-month-old. We needed a place to park that would be accessible. Two white, middle-aged male cyclists occupied the available spot. I walked over with a smile and while pointing to the car, a few metres away, asked if it was OK for them to move so that we could use the parking space. They looked at me, then at the car and continued to talk to each other. As I was standing there numbed by their rudeness, a white man in an open-top sports car pulled by and asked them the same question I had seconds earlier. They genially replied \"oh, yes\". It all happened so quickly that onlookers would have been fooled into thinking that they had simply not heard me. I won't even mention the number of stares I got just walking around the village and, no, it had nothing to do with my attractiveness or indeed lack thereof.</p><p>The room for doubt is what makes this subtle form of racism so deeply damaging. It calls into question your understanding of reality and further delegitimises your experiences in the eyes of others and sometimes yourself. Its nebulous nature means that the moment and wounding has, more often than not, come and gone before you are able to articulate your anger and frustration. It is so hard to challenge. If, indeed, you are able to confront the subtle racist, you are told that \"you see racism everywhere\", as if to say, it isn't. Worse still, you are called aggressive and if you are particularly lucky, told that you, in fact, are the racist.</p><p>Kolleh made a necessary and brave choice from a set of limited options. She chose not to remain silent. Not to be labelled as paranoid, or blowing out of proportion what she knows and feels to be true. Not to accept that she is in denial about the quality of her restaurant. Not to be \"objective\" when the umpteenth person walked in and then swiftly out after catching a glimpse of her black face. She chose a much more difficult, yet rewarding option. She chose to remain and confidentially challenge. And in speaking back with defiance, she has opened a space for the little town of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossett\" title=\"\">Ossett</a> to engage in a dialogue. People are now discussing the subtle forms of racism some of its inhabitants enact upon others.</p><p>Let us not, however, pretend that such racism only exists in sleepy northern towns and villages. Buying a birthday card in an upmarket gift shop, on one of the most fashionable high streets of Hackney, \"<a href=\"http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ce-pandc-equality-diversity-861.htm\" title=\"\">one of the most racially diverse areas in the UK</a>\", I was \"unseen\" when a cashier attempted to serve a white customer before me. This despite the fact that I was at the counter, with my wallet in my hands. We are either all too visible or conveniently invisible.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412604773|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|c9045b019120341b86984bcf206481fdc84cb5ea -->",

        "headline":"I'd much rather be a slag than a slut",
        "body":"<p>Last week I got asked to speak at an event called <a href=\"http://www.run-riot.com/think/slut-night-other-club\" title=\"\">Slut Night</a>, at a new venture called The Other Club in central London. Organised by some bright young feminists, Slut Night sold out surprisingly fast, as it offered various female writers and performers talking explicitly about the joys of sluttishness. The fanny jokes ran as freely as the wine; it was a right laugh. But when I first heard the name of the event, my immediate reaction was, ugh. That word. Slut. No.</p><p>My immediate reaction should probably have been more specifically – ugh, slut is a grubby little insult and I want no part of it. Ugh, slut is used to pass judgment on women's desires, their social life, the tightness of fabric around their bum, and I'm not interested in trying to reclaim that degree of damage because language reclamation is a pseudo-alchemy and no abusive thing ever turned into a good thing because you sucked the poison out of the sting yourself. Also, ugh, sluttishness – if sexual promiscuity is as emancipatory as I used to think it was, then how come it could only ever emancipate me in cahoots with tequila, kebabs and a really uncomfortable feeling when anyone used highly stressful words such as \"commitment\" or \"love\"?</p><p>But no, my immediate reaction was: ugh, no to sluts – I'd much rather be a slag. You know where you are with the word slag. You are, in my mind, in the closing scene of the greatest film ever made, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091859/\" title=\"\">Rita, Sue and Bob Too</a>, written by the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/12/theatre\" title=\"\">Andrea Dunbar</a> and filmed in 1980s Bradford.</p><p>This is a spoiler, so look away now if you haven't yet seen the greatest film ever made. It closes with the two teenagers, Rita and Sue, lying in Bob's bed. His wife has left him because he's been sneaking off and shagging these schoolgirls in his car. The girls' home lives have fallen apart, too, so one after the other, they've moved in with him. Yes, this is all very creepy, and nobody's saying it's a film that depicts a utopian model of living to which we should all aspire. It's grim. Still, after everything has gone really, horribly wrong, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9-79fHwqpM\" title=\"\">there is a moment of sheer joy when Bob finds them both in his bed and dives right into it</a>. They all beam with happiness. The film ends there – on that dive – a moment of joy that we know can't and won't last. The pure joy of being a slag – as the other characters in the film have already labelled them – Bob, of course, being the biggest slag of them all.</p><p>Why I like slag so much is not because I want to cast aspersions on people's sexual shenanigans, but because it has now become a great all-round handy insult. If you're not convinced, look how skilfully the actor Danny Dyer once deployed the term to discuss terrorism. \"Can't believe it's been nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the twin towers,\" <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/danny-dyer-calls-911-attackers-slags-on-twitter/285600\" title=\"\">he tweeted on 11 September 2012</a>. \"It still freaks my nut out to this day.\"</p><p>Still, I should admit here that my fondness for the word slag doesn't always end well for me. I still shudder with guilt when I think of the time I tweeted a friend and told her to bring another friend, \"that slag\", with her to my house. As a joke. It's a word we use between ourselves, fondly. Only, when I tagged the slag friend, I got her Twitter name slightly wrong and accidentally directed the message to a total stranger with a similar name – who turned out to be a 15-year-old girl in a coma. Whose Twitter account was being run by her loving dad to raise awareness of his daughter's condition. All he could see was that London journalists were insulting his sick child – it took quite a lot of explanation to dig my way out of that one and apologise. Possibly not helped by my friend tweeting him and saying: \"No, you don't understand, it was definitely meant for me and not your daughter, because I really am a massive, massive slag.\"</p><p>I recently met a media studies lecturer who told me he uses #slaggate as an example for his students of how not to use Twitter. Oh God.</p><p>Still, slut feels like a very American word – even if British grandmothers did use it to describe a messy woman who left things on her bedroom floor, not a woman who left her knickers on other people's bedroom floors. Slut is now a word for online porn ads, popping up all over your screen saying that horny sluts with breasts like balloons and buttocks like boiled eggs would like to live-chat with you now.</p><p>Indeed, it turned out that the Slut Night I went to was not about praising the word at all. As the organiser Amelia Abraham explained: \"The goal isn't to reclaim the word 'slut'; it's to completely undermine it.\"</p><p>Slutwalks, organised in cities across the world in defence of women dressing how they want without fear of assault, received criticism from some feminists who felt the word was wrong. I realise they were named after the exact words of a Canadian policeman, but still – I'd probably have gone if they were called slagwalks instead. Let's not put the word slag on the linguistic slagheap.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419100719|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|04d91801040f54d066d8ad313a84f8a774e58dd3 -->",

        "headline":"Breastfeeding won't seem normal until we see more pictures of it",
        "body":"<p>You would have had to have been living in a cave not to have noticed the increased interest in celebrity mums in the media over the last decade. From judgmental and vicious attacks on Nadya Doud-Suleman (more commonly referred to as the \"Octomom\"), to hyperbolic revelry at the Duchess of Cambridge giving birth to Prince George, the insatiable media mill has placed an unprecedented level of scrutiny on mothers.</p><p>Of course it's not a one-way street. Celebrities tweet, Instagram and Facebook their way through their pregnancies. Thinly disguised as sisterly sharing, it often comes across as sanctimonious showing off, and celebrity and audience alike are more aware that the act of becoming a mother can provide valuable exposure.</p><p>However, if you take away the captions and just look at the pictures, what is revealed is a series of old stereotypes: the Madonna motif is repeated, families snuggle together in group hugs and young babies are held up while the mother looks adoringly into their eyes. What's most intriguing about the representation of celebrity mothering in popular culture is what's missing: pictures of breastfeeding and the postpartum body.</p><p>The reaction to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/30/pregnancy-women-bodies-duchess-of-cambridge\" title=\"\">Kate Middleton's weight</a> as she left hospital just days after giving birth revealed that the public is not very good at dealing with realistic pictures of mothering. The fact that so many people were shocked indicates their ignorance that a bump doesn't instantly disappear once a baby has been born. This in itself is not shameful; how can people know this if they have not gone through the experience and have seen no pictures which normalise this?</p><p>Photographers have attempted to address this misconception. Two recent  projects celebrated the postpartum body – Jade Beall's <a href=\"http://www.abeautifulbodyproject.com/\" title=\"\">A Beautiful Body</a> and <a href=\"http://4thtrimesterbodies.com/\" title=\"\">The 4th Trimester Bodies Project</a> by Ashlee Wells Jackson – and went viral on the internet. Shot in a purposefully arty, studio setup in tasteful black and white, they have overtones of Dove's \"empowering\" commercials of real women. However, the poses still repeat the same old tropes, only naked.</p><p>Breasts are even more complicated. Photographic representation of breastfeeding can be read as a shortcut for instant shock value, especially when on pages generally more associated with fashion imagery. In 2006 Steven Klein shot the model Angela Lindvall nursing her son Sebastian for American Vogue, following in the footsteps of Annie Leibovitz, who photographed Jerry Hall breastfeeding her son Gabriel for the cover of the Australian's weekend magazine in 1999. Both of these images have a high level of authority and visual charge that's at odds with the more nurturing and benign Madonna, but they are essentially fashion photographs of models who are well practised at posing.</p><p>Occasionally, one glimpses paparazzi shots of a celebrity shrouding their baby and breast with what is indelicately called a \"hooter hider\" in the US. But there was a huge backlash against the recent Time cover of <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2114427,00.html?pcd=pw-hl\" title=\"\">Jamie Lynne Grumet nursing her three-year-old son</a>, photographed by Martin Schoeller. In this case it was of course not only the exposure of the breast, but the fact that her son was not a newborn that caused indignation. Societal values associated with age and breastfeeding are confused: Britain suggests an arbitrary six months, the US recommends a year and the World Health Organisation advocates at least two.</p><p>Breastfeeding sits in the middle of two very contradictory forces. On one hand it is simply not represented in popular culture; it has yet to be normalised by the sheer repetition of seeing it every day online, on television or in print media. But on the other hand women are shamed if they do not do it. Governmental forces and lobby groups insist it is best, but how can women comfortably do it if it is not accepted visually? The British poet Hollie McNish has written of these overwhelming feelings of shame and being forced to breastfeed in a public toilet, her <a href=\"http://www.closeronline.co.uk/2013/07/british-mum-silences-breastfeeding-critics-with-passionate-poem\" title=\"\">\"baby's first sips are drown-drenched in shite\"</a>.</p><p>Can photography change these attitudes? In 1991, when Leibovitz photographed a heavily pregnant Demi Moore for the cover of Vanity Fair, the western world was shocked. Now the web is awash with pregnant women \"doing a Demi\" and pregnancy has come out of the shadows of subjects that cannot be publicly represented.</p><p>It's up to photographers, photo editors and art directors to be brave enough to commission and publish photos which give new mothers a visual rubric in which to feel comfortable enough to nurse publicly. Facebook needs to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/29/facebook-breastfeeding-photo-policy-confused\" title=\"\">lift its ridiculous nipple ban</a> and nursing pictures should be no big deal on Instagram feeds.</p><p>When images of breastfeeding and postpartum tummies enter our popular culture, they will help to provide a path away from ignorance and embarrassment.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419887950|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|46589eea85e18a286654a8fb03b61525d1f23222 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"OMG, you have to watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\" title=\"\">Breaking Bad</a>! You simply have to. Stop whatever you're&nbsp;doing and watch it right now. Stop resuscitating that patient, and watch Breaking Bad. Stop flying that plane, crash it into that field and fire up&nbsp;Netflix.\"</p><p>As I understand it, we are now all legally obliged to watch Breaking Bad by&nbsp;the end of 2013. Our prisons are already full to bursting with people who&nbsp;failed to watch The West Wing or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\">The Wire</a> when they were expressly told to. I even saw a woman prosecuted last week for not having read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/20/gillian-flynn-gone-girl-review\" title=\"\">Gone Girl</a>. What was she thinking?</p><p>These days we are told we simply have to watch, to read or just to do, very many things: 100 Things to Do Before You Die; 100 Films You Have to See, 100 Books You Must Read If You Don't Want Everyone at Work to Realise Exactly What a Shallow, Self-Obsessed, X Factor Fan You Really Are.</p><p>Like most Guardian readers, I am very&nbsp;keen to do what I'm told at all times. If I'm told there are 25 Must-Dive Reefs or 30 Loganberry Recipes You&nbsp;Can't Live Without then I take that&nbsp;responsibility very seriously and immediately go out shopping for scuba equipment and soft fruit.</p><p>But, while I can't stress enough that I&nbsp;don't wish to be a troublemaker, there is a slight problem with the maths.</p><p>The average human being will live for&nbsp;701,844 hours. You will be asleep for 233,600 of those hours (more if you're a&nbsp;cricket fan). You will be working for 74,060 hours (fewer if you're Usain Bolt)&nbsp;and you'll be waiting for your children to hurry up and get their shoes&nbsp;on for 11,850.</p><p>Take off another 200,000 hours for miscellaneous activities such as being on hold for broadband customer service, queuing at Costa Coffee, or looking up pictures of your ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend on Facebook.</p><p>You suddenly find yourself with just&nbsp;182,334 useful hours in your life for reading, watching films and baking your signature Loganberry Pecan Flapjacks.</p><p>But it gets worse. Given that you are reading the Guardian you are, let's be honest, at least 40. If you were under 40&nbsp;you'd be reading the cheat codes for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\">Grand Theft Auto V</a> instead (FYI, the dirt-bike code is Circle, X, L1, Circle, Circle, L1, Circle, R1, R2, L2, L1, L1). This means your available hours now stand at 91,167. That's what you have left. Just over 90,000 hours. To do everything.</p><p>So, Breaking Bad should be a breeze: just 61 hours, or 0.000667% of the rest of your life. And – I don't know if you've heard – apparently it's amazing.</p><p>But if you wanted to watch every episode of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/jan/12/guardian-50-television-dramas\" title=\"\">the Guardian's Top 50 TV series of all time</a>, that would take up another 2,080 of your precious hours. Add in two new series a year – every year – that you simply have to watch, and that's a further 4,000 hours. Then add in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off\" title=\"\">The Great British Bake Off</a> and, in&nbsp;all, that's around 6,130 hours of television you simply have to see. That's&nbsp;nearly 7% of your available life</p><p>Watching every film on the BFI's list of <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/polls-surveys/greatest-films-all-time\" title=\"\">The Greatest Films of All Time</a> will take you 217 hours (with an extra half-hour if you want to watch the hilarious \"blooper reel\" at the end of Citizen Kane). You will also have to watch at least one new film a month that Charlotte at work keeps banging on about, and one foreign-language film a month because Peter Bradshaw has called it \"a&nbsp;stunning new benchmark for Latvian cinema\". That takes your total for films you simply have to see up to 2,233 hours.</p><p>And now an even bigger problem: books. Let's read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/12/features.fiction\" title=\"\">the Observer's 100 Greatest Novels</a>. Add in one new book a month that Charlotte has recommended (I like Charlotte, but I wasn't absolutely convinced by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/09/james-bowen-bob-cat-addiction-book\" title=\"\">A Street Cat Named Bob</a>) and one new book a month that the Review section has described as Margaret Atwood meets EL James. Sum&nbsp;total of hours spent on books you&nbsp;simply have to read? 6,360.</p><p>Then you also have to find time to swim with dolphins, to watch the sunset&nbsp;over Machu Picchu, to kiteboard in the Andes, and to do any number of other tiresome things you see people doing in their profile pictures on <a href=\"https://soulmates.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\">Guardian Soulmates</a>.</p><p>There are also 50 boutique hotels you must visit, 100 ways to make&nbsp;your garden or your children happy, and 5,000 fonts you can't PowerPoint without.</p><p>And these, of course, are just the things you have to do. The mandatory things. You will still have to find time for the things you actually like doing, such as popping bubble wrap.</p><p>Isn't it time to end this tyranny? In&nbsp;the 1970s we weren't told what we had to do all the time. Mainly because there were only about eight things you actually could do, so everyone simply did all of them as a matter of course. But&nbsp;there are now too many things in the world, too much stuff. None of the old stuff has gone anywhere, and new things are being added all the time. Citizen Kane still exists, but now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/147290/piranha-3dd\" title=\"\">Piranha 3DD </a>does as well.</p><p>Let's end this madness shall we? By&nbsp;all means watch Breaking Bad (I've&nbsp;heard it's good – have you heard it's&nbsp;good?), but the only bit of TV you actually <em>have</em> to see before you die is the&nbsp;episode of Superstars where Kevin Keegan falls off his bike. Use the time I&nbsp;have saved you to watch the TV you&nbsp;actually want to. I recommend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/04/pointless-alexander-armstrong-richard-osman\" title=\"\">Pointless</a>, for example.</p><p>The only films from the BFI's list that&nbsp;you must watch are Some Like It Hot, The Godfather and Singin' in the Rain. You have my permission to never watch FW Murnau's 1927 masterpiece Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hpo5gJK6Jw\" title=\"\">Kenji&nbsp;Mizoguchi's Ugetsu Monogatari</a>. Watch them if you want, but you don't have to. You also don't have to watch the Lord of&nbsp;the Rings trilogy (that's 47&nbsp;hours saved right there).</p><p>Of 100 Greatest Novels, you can happily ignore all of them except <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141187495/scoop-a-novel-about-journalists\" title=\"\">Scoop</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/dec/13/john-crace-miss-jean-brodie-digested-read\" title=\"\">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</a>. I am assuming you've already read To Kill a Mockingbird for O-level. Read Shakespeare if you want to, but you don't have to. (Though if you don't ever&nbsp;read him, you're not allowed to say&nbsp;he's rubbish. Deal?) You should probably read Great Expectations, but feel free to leave <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\" title=\"\">Dickens</a> there. And I&nbsp;think Wuthering Heights is the only&nbsp;Emily Brontë novel worth reading&nbsp;(someone will rise to this, just&nbsp;you wait and see).</p><p>You must never swim with dolphins. If they ever want to swim with you, I'm sure they'll let you know. Forget Machu Picchu; the sunset on the west coast of&nbsp;Scotland is as beautiful as any you'll see in the world, and it's really nearby. And by all means go kiteboarding above the Andes, but that might be the thing you do literally just before you die. And&nbsp;the Guardian would miss your Soulmates subscription.</p><p>In reality there are very few things you actually <em>have</em> to do before you die. They include: ring your mum more often; recycle; watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/24/book-of-mormon-review\" title=\"\">The Book of Mormon</a>.</p><p>Please feel free to leave other suggestions online. The simple things, not the showy things. The things that&nbsp;make the world a better place. I&nbsp;believe, for example, that I've already mentioned popping bubble wrap.</p><p>But before you do that, have you seen Breaking Bad? You must.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418983647|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|02c8b25c57efe0d12fb3fb136715ce449efd03f2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Is it necessary to have your own baby in order to flick on the maternal switch?</p><p>I've always thought so, as mine seems to have been permanently turned off throughout my adult life. Getting married, having babies and craving domestic bliss are not milestones I have ever dreamt of. It would have been easier if I had, because I would have done something about it and not be what I am now – a woman in my 30s, with no baby and neither desperately yearning to reproduce nor vehemently against it. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/16/choice-child-free-admirable-not-selfish\" title=\"\">We're a diseased breed, women like me, viewed with suspicion because we sit on the fence</a>. It isn't normal. I repeat: it isn't normal. Is it?</p><p>Of course, I've thought about having children, but time and circumstance haven't brought them about. I thought for years that I must be missing the broody gene.</p><p>I also worried that I might not measure up if I didn't want motherhood badly enough; I might not have enough love in me if I had a child or adopted one, so I shouldn't bother just for the sake of the supposed life-affirming fulfilment that comes with it.</p><p>Now, no longer with the luxury of time on my side, I've no idea what to do. I have started coming to terms with the fact that I may never have a child, but it's not been without some lamenting. I've tried to ignore the suggestion that I'll never be a \"whole woman\" unless I find myself one day lying exhausted and bruised in a labour ward. I've told myself it wasn't meant to be, and that's OK.</p><p>But now a life-changing event I hadn't foreseen, with consequences I didn't bank on, has intervened.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/15/women-over-age-40-babies\" title=\"\">My 53-year-old mother has just had a baby boy</a> and I am ashamed to admit I spent the nine months of his development dreading his arrival. Her pregnancy was a confusing and emotionally loaded time for me. The pressure to have my own child weighed me down. If anyone was meant to be having a baby, it was me, not her. The natural order of things had been upset.</p><p>I panicked. I've never had a sibling and didn't know what to do with babies, least of all someone else's.</p><p>The fear intensified as my mother's due date inched closer, and I worried that I wouldn't connect with her child.</p><p>But as soon as I met him, my fear evaporated. It kicked in the moment I held my new half-brother, 20 minutes old, for the first time at the hospital.</p><p>As he fell asleep, curled into a ball on my chest, warm and heavy, nuzzling my neck and trusting me to hold on to him and keep him safe, I felt as if he was mine. I wanted to keep him. That moment was unlike anything I've ever felt before. It was the best feeling in the world and I never wanted it to end.</p><p>I looked at my formidable mother in awe and disbelief at what she had just done and thought, \"I love this kid. I actually love him.\"</p><p>It's a wonderful thing, being the adult sibling of a baby. I never believed I had a maternal cell in my body, but something's shifted. It may be what parents I know have tried to convey when they've said: \"It changes you.\" It could be a kind of sibling love that I've always been jealous about among my friends but have never known. Or it could, if we cast genetics aside for a moment, simply be that precious love one feels for a baby because it needs to be cared for.</p><p>Just a week old, so vulnerable and incapable of anything more than biting, sucking, crying or sleeping, he's teaching me what falling in love really is. I'm discovering it is an inescapable longing to be near him, a passionate commitment to look out for and protect him above all else.</p><p>I didn't see it coming and don't feel it leaving me any time soon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420035290|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|52f3673e355fd679beb03c678345a40374de5335 -->",

        "headline":"We don't need to be naked to be sexy",
        "body":"<p>We're all near-naked now. From <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/26/the-x-factor-2013-live-blog-third-live-show#block-526d76a9e4b07140626792b9\" title=\"\">Lady Gaga's appearance on The X Factor</a> to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/10/femen-naked-shock-troops-of-feminism\" title=\"\"> feminist protest group Femen</a>, getting our kit off in public places doesn't seem to be a problem. But at night, in the privacy of our bedrooms, we're not brazen strumpets but coy mistresses, too embarrassed to turn on the light. A survey commissioned by an online pharmacist company claims <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/24/when-was-the-last-time-your-partner-saw-you-naked-4159559/\" title=\"\">one in six women haven't let their partners see them naked in over a year</a>.</p><p>So is there a serious problem with women not feeling sexy? Yes. But that's nothing to do with whether we're comfortable being in the buff. It isn't looking good naked that bothers us; it's being sexy that women struggle with.</p><p>And nakedness is not the same as sexiness.</p><p>Two major exhibitions in London show there's nothing exciting about being nude. Shunga at the British Museum is a vast collection of intricate and very intimate Japanese wood block prints from 17th onwards, all explicit depictions of couples having sex. Nothing is left to the imagination. The sexual organs are fully exposed and finely detailed – not a hair out of place. Visitors press their faces up close, admiring the anatomically optimistic (all the penises are enormous) work.</p><p>At the Wallace Collection, The Male Nude gathers together 18th century pencil and chalk drawings of male models. Here, visitors admire the muscular curve of the youthful model's gluteus maximus. There's no discernible embarrassment among either of these viewing publics. They're in a museum; they have permission to gawp. But they don't have permission to be titillated. It would be odd if they were. That's because all this nakedness doesn't have anything remotely stimulating about it. Seeing unclothed bodies is not the same as finding them sexy.</p><p>The secrets of the bedroom survey is also flawed in forgetting that looking is a two-way activity. It's not just women who don't like to be seen naked; any embarrassment is often in the observer as much as the observed. Some men may ogle at pornographic images, but they find it far more awkward when faced with real-life nakedness. (And this survey is about men and women, not same-sex couples.) Cabaret artist Meow Meow's recent show played on this male discomfort. Every night she picked a man from the audience, sat on his lap and asked him to unbutton her blouse. They squirmed, they giggled, they looked at their friends. Meow Meow moved from male lap to male lap, asking each of them, imploring, begging, helping them by placing their fingers gently on her top button. But not one man would undress her. In the end, frustrated, she unbuttoned herself. It was the same every show. Each night she ended up taking off her own top.</p><p>To make women (and their men) feel more comfortable in the bedroom, we don't need more explicit nudity.</p><p>The film Enough Said has a wonderful, tender scene where two middle-aged lovers Eva and Albert (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini) have sex for the first time. Albert asks Eva whether she opened her eyes. \"No,\" she replies, \"I kept my eyes closed. I figured if I couldn't see you, you couldn't see me.\" It's one of the sexiest scenes in a Hollywood movie for a long time.</p><p>We need to take the advice of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/apr/21/theatre.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Gypsy Rose Lee</a>, often credited for inventing the art of striptease in the 1930s. Although Gypsy was the world's most famous stripper, she never appeared naked in public, not once. The thought abhorred her. She would, like the women in today's bedrooms, have been embarrassed. Her cultivated sexiness relied upon bits of her body remaining properly covered. She knew the illusion of nakedness was far more sensual than the sight of her flawed bare flesh.</p><p>Let's not worry about whether we can expose ourselves to our loved ones late at night. It doesn't really matter. It's sexiness we should be seeking. And to be sexy, you sometimes need to keep your kit on.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421119547|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|ad86c79ad504d4a81cf4535e494dbbf90a78adfe -->",

        "headline":"Word to the west: many Saudi women oppose lifting the driving ban",
        "body":"<p>If you read any western coverage of the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/27/saudia-arabian-women-drivers-campaign-ban\">protest of Saudi Arabia's female driving ban</a>, you probably thought, \"finally, the kingdom is waking up\". But the problem is, that's not what many Saudis think, including Saudi women.</p><p>The Saudi economic newspaper El-Iqtisadiah ran a front-page news story suggesting that women's driving is just a luxury rather than a necessity and that protesters against the ban seek to undermine the kingdom's stability and create sedition.</p><p>That wasn't just propaganda. I conducted a survey of my former Saudi female students at Al-Lith College for Girls (at <a href=\"http://uqu.edu.sa/english\">Um al-Qura University</a>, Mecca). They helped me distribute a large-scale questionnaire to their colleagues from different departments of the college and to their female relatives and friends. It wasn't exactly scientific, but their responses are worth considering. I offered them anonymity in their answers, but even so, some wanted to be recognized.</p><p>To my surprise, 134 (out of 170) respondents said female driving is not a necessity and that it opens the door for sexual harassment and encourages women to not wear the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2013/sep/23/niqab-video-debate\">niqab</a> under the pretext that they cannot see the road when driving. Some also fear that it gives husbands a chance to betray and agree with the assertion that it creates sedition in society.</p><p><strong>Mashaal El-Maliki, a housewife:</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Female driving will destroy family life because it will give husbands a chance to know other women who (as drivers) will be free and without guardians. </p></blockquote><p><strong>Bedoor Elmaliki, a student:</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>In my point of view, female driving is not a necessity because in the country of the two holy mosques every woman is like a queen. There is (someone) who cares about her; and a woman needs nothing as long as there is a man who loves her and meets her needs; as for the current campaigns calling for women's driving, they are not reasonable. Female driving is a matter of fun and amusement, let us be reasonable and thank God so much for the welfare we live in.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Maqbula El-Malawi, a student:</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Honestly, I don't like women to drive. This will create sedition … I agree that there are already different kinds of sedition we see every day, but the right place for a woman is her house; this will really save her from what is happening in the outside world.</p></blockquote><p><strong>A Saudi mother:</strong></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>If they allow women to drive, there will be many negative effects on the whole society (eg, sexual harassment). Furthermore, there will be many things that don't comply with our Islamic principles. This will open the door for women to imitate men in everything, and who knows … there would be calls for banning niqab. This way a woman will lose her femininity; and if a woman goes out without a guardian, she may lose her honor.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Banaader Elmaliki, a 4th year mathematics student:</strong> </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[The driving movement is] just a crazy imitation of America, and doesn't mean more liberation for women. It rather means liquidation of the society and inferiority of its moral values. The biggest evidence on this is the liquidation of American society; we don't want this in our kingdom.</p></blockquote><p>The results of my informal survey were almost identical to those of a questionnaire my former Saudi students conducted. They found 3,209 out of 3,710 Saudi women opposed changing the driving laws, for the same aforementioned reasons. </p><p>Even women who supported driving (about 501) stressed that their support has conditions. Crucially, they stipulated that there must be laws that deter men against sexual harassment and that allow women to drive safely in lanes of their own.</p><p>This stresses that the continuous attempts from the west to impose its values elsewhere are pointless. Western feminism is not only unlikely to take hold in countries like Saudi Arabia, it is not what many women in the kingdom want. Consider what Amany Abdulfadl, member of the Egyptian Centre for Monitoring Women's Priorities, said in a 2007 piece in <a href=\"http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/\">Al-Ahram Weekly</a>: the west's ''definition of equality cannot work in our Arab world because neither will our women find jungles to cut wood in, nor our men ever have breasts to feed babies.''</p><p>People in Saudi Arabia have their own moral views and needs. What works in other societies may not fit in Saudi, and the reverse. In short, instead of launching campaigns to change the driving laws in the kingdom, the west should first ask Saudi women if they really want this or not, and western countries should accept the result, even if it's not to their liking.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421473472|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|7bd7ae0dd821268ad5e20ad1b52e3e2dc564c307 -->",

        "body":"<p>Two films I watched at the London Film Festival this month jarred with me in an unexpected way. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxuxkQF7Bak\" title=\"\">Drinking Buddies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQpXyke3VC4\" title=\"\">Afternoon Delight</a> are what might be called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/may/19/culture.features\" title=\"\">mumblecore</a> movies – all improvised dialogue and plots that home in on relatively minor events in the emotional lives of their protagonists. I'll spare you my reviews, but an incidental aspect of these self-consciously naturalistic portrayals of contemporary urban life depressed me. Namely, the proliferation of gadgetry in the bedroom, by which I do not mean sex toys.</p><p>In a scene from Drinking Buddies, for example, one half of a couple sits in bed one evening, catching up with her emails on a MacBook, while her boyfriend conducts a text conversation on his smartphone, thus rudely inviting interlopers into their intimate space. Technology similarly seeps into the bedroom in Afternoon Delight, with post-coital stressy business texting rendered as quotidian as brushing your teeth.</p><p>There is nothing unusual about this set-up these days – it's just that these films held a mirror up to a facet of my life that I already didn't really approve of, and projected it on to a giant screen. My bedside table usually has a phone and an iPad lying on it, as well as paper books; sometimes there's even a laptop too, although I do try to put that out for the night with the cat, the tiny pulsating \"sleep mode\" light is just too obviously anathema to actual human sleep.</p><p>Is nowhere sacred? Must the ability to text, tweet or post images be at our fingertips while we're sleeping? The fact that our books, films and alarm clocks often live in the same devices as our various inboxes and social network apps lazily justifies our need to take them to bed with us, but I am not alone in checking my emails, or catching up with current affairs last thing before lights out. I know this is not conducive to proper, satisfying sleep but I do it anyway, and wake up with a headache.</p><p>I'm just as bad when I wake up. The first thing I do in the morning is pick up my phone to check the time. Then I compulsively unlock it to \"check the weather\". But as soon as my eyes fix on the screen, my attention scatters a thousand different ways, taking me down all sorts of rabbit holes until I finally set it back down, with a twitchy brain and still no idea whether it's going to rain because it's the one thing I forgot to check.</p><p>Another justification for taking these devices to bed is that there simply isn't enough time to keep up with the continuous tidal wave of computer-related chores and correspondences, and therefore any quiet moment is fair game for a quick holiday-planning/sock-buying/online-banking session. I wouldn't be surprised to find that, if the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying\" title=\"\">Top five regrets of the dying</a> article (which serially returns to the most-read list on this website) were to be updated in 2033, an item about never allowing yourself a break from screen-based life to daydream or properly rest, even when ill in bed, makes an appearance.</p><p>The actor, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10297448/Rachel-Weisz-and-I-ban-technology-from-our-bedroom-says-Daniel-Craig.html\" title=\"\">Daniel Craig, recently credited banning technology from the bedroom</a> as key to his keeping his marriage to Rachel Weisz a happy one. I see his point. Aside from all of this gadgetry allowing friends, colleagues and chores to gatecrash the marital bed, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12287535\" title=\"\">ill-effects of poor sleep on relationships is well documented</a>. One study, which chimed with me, demonstrating the positive effects of gratitude on overall wellbeing, found that poor sleepers were more selfish and <a href=\"http://www.spsp.org/?Gratitude_PR_19Jan13\" title=\"\">less likely to feel gratitude</a>.</p><p>Poor sleep, of course, has countless other negative effects on health, happiness and productivity. And insomnia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/sep/24/lack-sleep-onset-alzheimers\" title=\"\">may predict Alzheimer's</a>. It is not uncommon for people to tweet or update their Facebook status in the middle of the night when they have insomnia.  Aside from the brain-scrambling stimulation of the internet, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/health/05light.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">there is evidence</a> that staring at backlit screens keeps brains more alert and suppresses melatonin levels (although the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/reality-check/2012/sep/11/can-tablet-screens-disrupt-sleep\" title=\"\">jury's out on whether it scrambles melatonin production enough to disrupt sleep </a>.)</p><p>I read this fact in <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/arianna-huffington-implores-you-stop-taking-bright-devices-into-the-bedroom/277269/\" title=\"\">an article reporting that Arianna Huffington</a>, the doyenne of digital publishing herself, has banned phones and computers from her bedroom in the name of a good night's sleep. This reminded me of how I felt when I read that many senior staff at Silicon Valley behemoths including Apple, eBay and Yahoo <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/technology/at-waldorf-school-in-silicon-valley-technology-can-wait.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;\" title=\"\">send their kids to schools based on the Steiner approach</a>, that ban screens from their classrooms and frown upon their use at home: suckered.

        "headline":"Ladies, don't go restyling your partner – it's rude",
        "body":"<p>One thing I've noticed in life is that a remarkable number of men, sometimes intelligent, accomplished men, can be extraordinarily thick about spotting women who manipulate them.</p><p>One area where this keeps happening is appearance, with some men being coerced into making bizarre decisions all in the name of \"self-improvement\". Shane Warne is a case in point. A cricketing uber-bloke, Shane was spirited away into the dark castle of Liz Hurley, to emerge resembling a Ken doll dipped in golden syrup. La Hurley beamed, while the world recoiled at Warne's newly brightened teeth, highlighted hair, Ronseal-hued skin tone, and hints of (thankfully undisclosed) \"man-scaping\".</p><p>This was Shane Warne, but it was <em>not</em> Shane Warne – his Shane Warneness, his laidback masculine appeal, had been ripped off, quite possibly on a wax strip, and dumped into a beautician's pedal bin with a disgusted moue. Not to mince words, Warne looked like a complete tit. Wow, I thought, maybe Liz Hurley truly is evil?</p><p>Away from celebrityland, it seems that ordinary women also like to \"make over\" their men, preferring to upgrade their appearance, groom them, and transform them into Mr Right, rather than compete in the psychosexual scrum for men who are already deemed Mr Right. Occasionally there are studies about these dogged female-on-male makeovers. An image springs to mind of femalekind as deranged Svengalis, taking barely civilised males, with bad haircuts and chronic dress sense, and buffing/grooming/tanning/waxing and clothes shopping them into a semblance of public acceptability. Basically, transforming Mr Write-Off into Mr Right.</p><p>Well, if true, how rude. I say \"if true', because, frankly, I've noticed far more women actively engaged in sabotaging their partners' looks than the other way around. This can be anything, from telling them they look \"wonderful!\" with their manky food-flecked beards/Village People-style moustaches they grew for Movember/haircuts so awful they verge on the inhumane (delete where appropriate), to over-styling grown men so that they look not only tragic, but also bizarrely sexless (see: what Liz did to Shane).</p><p>At the other end of the scale, there is the dark art of benign neglect, where a man can be encouraged to go to seed to the point where even his health might be adversely affected, as certainly are his straying powers. Men also do this to women – explaining the phenomenon of relationships put under immense strain when one of the couple loses weight, or makes some other bid to climb out of the saboteur's hole.</p><p>Getting back to women under-grooming or over-grooming their mate, the goal appears to be that, in their different ways, these men are \"nobbled\", rendered repulsive to the opposite sex. Which, in evolutionary terms, makes far more sense than genuinely improving a man to the point at which you could lose him.</p><p>One argument could be that, as women have been judged almost exclusively on how they look, putting up with the \"male gaze\" for centuries, where is the harm in redressing the balance, giving men a taste of their own medicine? But isn't this too pat? After all, when a man badgers a woman about her appearance, insisting that she look prettier, glossier, thinner, at its extreme, we call it what it is – rudeness verging on psychological abuse. So why, when it is the woman unduly influencing the man, do we use jokey terms such as \"making him over\", or \"taking him in hand\"?</p><p>Unless there are health or hygiene issues, surely no one&nbsp;should feel they have any right whatsoever to comment upon, criticise, mock or alter another person's appearance. It is at best rude, at worst, an exercise in control freakery. Ladies, truly we are better than this. Gentleman, brace yourself for the revelation that, whatever you've been told, neither \"Ken doll\" nor \"weirdy beardy\" are particularly good looks.</p><h2>Wear a poppy. Wear it with pride</h2><p>With Remembrance Sunday approaching, it must be time for people to clamber on to the anti-poppy bandwagon. This year, a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10409297/Remembrance-Day-minister-refuses-to-wear-poppy-because-it-advocates-war.html\" title=\"\">Methodist minister called Patricia Jackson</a> stated that she plans to wear a white poppy to officiate her remembrance service in Shropshire, because the classic red version \"advocates war\".</p><p>Are there people out there who genuinely believe that the poppy supports and celebrates war? Isn't it rather about remembering and honouring people who have fought and died, as well as raising badly needed funds for ageing or disabled service people and the bereaved they left behind? Far from being a glorification or sanitisation of war, the poppy seems to be quite the opposite – representing the human face of the suffering of war. Not one war, but many wars, meaning that politics doesn't come into it.</p><p>Most of us have noticed that war is a \"bad thing\", but the poppy is not the problem, or even the symbol of the problem. Perhaps that's why those who noisily abhor or subvert it mainly come across as attention-seeking. There appears to be this compulsion to promote and defend their stance.</p><p>All this grandstanding seems a spiritual world away from the quiet poignancy of the Remembrance Day service and the unassuming humanity of people who sell poppies from trays in the street.</p><p>Not for the first time, I can't help but think that such poppy narcissists really need to get over themselves. Publicly refusing to wear a poppy, or attempting to subvert the classic design, means nothing compared to making the decision to wear one. If people must make their stand, then obviously that's fine (ironically, this is a free country). However, perhaps they could consider getting into the remembrance spirit of doing so with quiet dignity.</p><p></p><h2>It seems he didn't pick her up, but he sure put her down</h2><p></p><p>Poor <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24770449\" title=\"\">Katy Perry</a>. She said that Mick Jagger made a move on her when she was an 18-year-old backing singer. Jagger, who rarely makes public announcements, denied it, saying that Perry must be \"mistaken\". Mistaken? With respect, Jagger has a rather distinctive look – a cross between an excitable orangutan, a tribal shrunken head, Methuselah's left testicle and a dashboard gonk. There would be no mistaking Mick Jagger under any circumstances and I say that with love.</p><p>Who to believe? When you're 18, you tend to think everyone fancies you; then again, when you're Katy Perry, it's probable that everyone does. Perry also reveals that she managed to avoid Jagger's amorous advances because she \"sacrificed\" her friend to go home with him instead. Yeah, you heard right: she \"sacrificed\" her friend. Call me easily shocked, but I think some introductory feminist literature might be a nice present for Katy this Christmas.</p><p>In the meantime, how embarrassing for Perry that Jagger was so determined to deny publicly an attraction to her. Going by his Lothario past (possible motto: \"Don't be too choosy!\"), this has to rank among the most devastating of rock-pop slap-downs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421518403|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|ac3647b49239b6200b2f9ee6dc0192fa6fdf2903 -->",

        "headline":"A man's perspective on why engagement rings are a joke",
        "body":"<p>Most of us are adult enough to know magic doesn't exist. And yet we're the same species that thinks fat rings are fairy-tale items which somehow \"secure\" another person's love, one step away from a \"happily ever after\". </p><p>They're expensive, useless and, worse, are insulting to <a href=\"http://www.blogher.com/node/10685\">notions of actual love</a>. As anyone who's been in a serious long-term relationship knows, you don't need geology to proclaim (let alone justify) said love.</p><p>Before you take me for a cheapskate who just doesn't want to spend the money on a ring, let me explain a bit more. Many of us, especially men, have strapped our feet to the commercialised notions of what constitutes relationships. We've turned into zombies, hungry for all things red and supposedly lovey dovey. We buy into the baffling displays of romance like the nauseating crimson heart-shaped horror show we call Valentine's Day. Or the flowers and boxed chocolates we're supposed to deliver on anniversaries to celebrate monogamous tolerance and the disbelief you haven't murdered each other.  </p><p>We speed through our finances and morals, enjoying the exhilaration of fitting in to societal expectation, as opposed to reflecting on whether our actions are warranted or justified. And our partners seem all too ready to go along with it.</p><p>Engagement rings – specifically expensive diamond ones – are often prime examples of this unthinking mindset. The problem isn't the rings themselves, but the justifications – or the lack of justifications – behind their acquisition.</p><p>We mustn't confuse engagement rings – given, usually to a woman, when a proposal is accepted – and wedding rings – given on wedding day. (Already, we should recognise how strange it is to need two different kinds of rings.)</p><p>Whatever the long history of engagement items – I've heard claims of it dating from ancient Egypt or Rome, for example – the focus on engagement rings should really start with De Beers, in the 20th century.</p><p>After large diamond mines were discovered here in South Africa<a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1870trollope-southafrica.asp\"> around 1870</a>, the mines' major investors amalgamated their interests to form De Beers Consolidates Mines. They recognised that due to diamonds having l<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp\">ittle intrinsic value</a>, they would need to create demand via (the illusion of) scarcity and pretend worth. So began one of the most successful marketing and public manipulation campaigns of the 20th century, originating from four words: \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/fashion/weddings/how-americans-learned-to-love-diamonds.html?_r=1&amp;\">A diamond is forever</a>\".</p><p>By convincing men their love for their future wife is directly proportional to the expense of the diamond ring, and convincing women to expect love in the form of shiny stone, De Beers and their marketers, NW Ayer, began a tradition so embedded we forget it's a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/opinion/23iht-edepstein.1.20368819.html\">marketing ploy</a>. Genius marketing, to be sure, but marketing nonetheless.</p><p>And guess what? The prices keep going up, as if we are really loving more and deeper these days. According to the <a href=\"http://www.xogroupinc.com/press-releases-home/2011-press-releases/2011-08-30-2011-engagement-and-jewelry-statistics-released.aspx\">XO Group Inc 2011 Engagement Engagement &amp; Jewelry survey</a>, the average engagement ring cost $5,200. If you think that's bad, consider that nearly 12% of US couples spend more than $8,000 for an engagement ring. Of course, we should take such stats with some measure of scepticism, as <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/weddings/2013/06/average_wedding_cost_published_numbers_on_the_price_of_a_wedding_are_totally.html\">Will Oremus highlights</a>. Nonetheless, these are the prices at a time when the average American family earns<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/17/the-typical-american-family-makes-less-than-it-did-in-1989/\"> less than it did in 1989</a>.</p><p>The American bias of these stats shouldn't negate the overall point: diamonds – and therefore diamond rings – are expensive and the demand was created artificially for an item that's only property here is shininess (it decreases in value as soon as you walk out the store).</p><p>Any remotely logical person can see that spending several thousand on actually important items for a new couple like a place to live or putting money in an investment account will serve them far better in the future (and likely help with romantic and/or wedded bliss). </p><p>That engagement ring purchases tend to be for women – not by women – is also insulting to the cause of not viewing women as objects to be acquired. Consider that this is worthy of a headline in a respected US magazine at the beginning of this month: \"<a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/10/women-now-paying-for-their-own-engagement-rings.html\">Women Now Paying for Their Own Engagement Rings</a>\".  </p><p>Many people will say that engagement rings are symbolic of love and devotion. Ignoring that this idea is itself manufactured by the profiting businesses, it also gives an arbitrary definition of \"symbol\": why can't a beautiful home be a symbol? Why can't long-term investments be a symbol? Indeed, would it not be more impressive to show off a house than a finger rock?</p><p>Tradition is another assertion when discussing almost anything to do with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/20/polyamorous-shows-no-traditional-way-live\">monogamy</a> and marriage. But, like nature, tradition is a description not moral justification. Just because we've always done a particular action, doesn't mean it's always (or ever was) justified. Pointing to tradition means pointing to the mistreatment of different races and sexes, human sacrifices, and so on. Longevity, too, doesn't give moral immunity, or automatic goodness, to anything.</p><p>Engagement rings aren't even used to show one is married: they're used before the wedding even occurs. Indeed, even helping avoid awkward social encounters isn't aided, since there are other (and cheaper) ways of showing you're \"in a relationship\" (not to mention just telling people trying to hit on you). </p><p>If you need a ring to prove your love, it's not your lack of a ring that's the problem.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421475218|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|1d2f560c68dead5f2400bf6e8a43b85e640e4645 -->",
