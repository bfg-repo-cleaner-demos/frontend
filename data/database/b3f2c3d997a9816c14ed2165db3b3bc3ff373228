        "trailText":"Sebastian Vettel's hard-fought victory in the Japan Grand Prix put him on the verge of his fourth consecutive world championship",
        "headline":"Sebastian Vettel's Japan win earns glowing praise from Christian Horner",
        "body":"<p>Sebastian Vettel once again revelled in the glorious, precise curves of Suzuka, a circuit that favours risk with reward, whose dips and climbs offer elation and danger in equal measure, where errors are costly. The drivers know it. The drivers love it – not least Vettel, who has four wins from five visits here and a victory that has put him on the edge of claiming his&nbsp;fourth consecutive world championship.</p><p>The win, a hard-fought, tense and, in Vettel's and his team's case, clever race, was a thriller and a long way from the recent processions that have turned off so many fans.</p><p>Fernando Alonso finished fourth, which denied Vettel the title on the day, but the German goes to the next round in India knowing that he will be champion with a finish in the top five – almost a certainty, barring a failure.</p><p>It will put him on a par with the only two drivers to have won four world titles in a row – Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher. On the evidence of this race, a combination of speed and subtlety, it will be deserved.</p><p>Vettel and his team-mate Mark Webber were mugged off the start by the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, who quickly showed he had the measure of the track and led with skill. It meant Red Bull, accustomed to managing races from the front, had to think on their feet on this occasion.</p><p>Webber worked his tyres hard in the opening stint and had to come in on lap nine, too soon to make a two-stop strategy work, but Vettel had conserved his rubber, opening up the chance to make fewer stops and presenting the possibility of a showdown with his team-mate at the end of the race. It also left Grosjean struggling on the harder tyres, sandwiched between the two and unable to cover both options. Red Bull were playing chess with their drivers and Vettel's moves gave him checkmate.</p><p>Staying out for 23 laps on his second stint and eking out the last vestiges of grip from his tyres brought Vettel out behind Grosjean, also two-stopping, and the German overtook in a decisive move down the main straight. But when Webber exited from his final stop with fresh tyres he could not overtake the Frenchman until the penultimate lap, enough for a Red Bull one-two but too late to catch his team-mate.</p><p>The German had won, not with the sledgehammer of raw pace but with the scalpel of race craft, staying out longer in his stints on worn rubber and, despite several lock-ups, managing to control the gaps to his rivals to have the advantage at the end.</p><p>Red Bull's team principal, Christian Horner, said the race was \"one of the best races strategically we have ever operated\". That is praise indeed from the head of a team that has won the past three constructors' championships.</p><p>His driver concurred. \"I really tried to manage the gaps in the beginning of the stint and then close the gap, which worked brilliantly, especially with Romain,\" Vettel said. \"Great strategy. It obviously worked. We didn't lose patience early on and tried obviously to make the stints as long as&nbsp;possible to help us at the end of the race.\"</p><p>Horner, again, was generous in praise of Vettel, keen to stress that when the German takes his fourth title it will be because there is more to him than raw pace. \"He manages to adapt. He played the thinking game today; he watched and waited in that first stint, he preserved his tyres,\" Horner said. \"He knew he wasn't going to get priority in the first pit stop because we had discussed it before the race. But he was very smart in the way he handled the race and created the options.\"</p><p>It is a combination of seat-of-the-pants skills and driving intelligence that has seen Vettel put together five consecutive wins, with four races remaining this season. Jim Clark achieved a run of six, Schumacher of six and seven and Alberto Ascari seven (nine counted across 1952-1953). Vettel's form and the pace of his car suggest he could challenge their totals. Certainly Horner has not ruled it out.</p><p>\"Sebastian has won every race since the summer break,\" he said. \"There are still four to go and we will try to carry this momentum into the last four. We couldn't have imagined he would have this run of success but the way he is driving is quite supreme.\"</p><p>Yet Webber, too, was happy with the result in his last F1 appearance at Suzuka. It was his best finish since the British Grand Prix and, despite being frustrated as Grosjean held him off at the end, he was magnanimous towards the Frenchman whom last year he described as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/07/f1-sebastian-vettel-japanese-grand-prix\" title=\"\">\"first-lap nutcase\"</a> after he punted him off at the second corner. \"I think it's very clear that Romain has a very different mental approach to the job at the moment this year,\" Webber said. \"He's driven some quite strong races, putting together the whole weekend, which is a sign of a driver starting to get a bit more relaxed and confident.</p><p>\"You know, we're not here to blow smoke up his arse but in the end he's doing a very good job this year.\"</p><p>As for Alonso, the Spaniard knows \"it's only a matter of time before he [Vettel] will be champion\".</p><p>Alonso, who finished 45 seconds down, added: \"We have different goals now. We will continue to try to do our best on Sundays and, when it is mathematically settled, we will congratulate him.\"</p><p>As for Vettel, his pleasure at the win and admiration for the fans (whose numbers and warm embrace for everything about F1 is something many circuits can only dream of - needless to say there was, rightly, no booing) came through in his enthusiasm and his honesty on what has been a considerable journey to almost becoming a four-time world champion.</p><p>\"When I was small, I was dreaming about Formula One and honestly never thought that one day I would be able to test one of these cars,\" he said after the race. \"First time I tested the car I shit myself the first couple of laps and I thought, all right, that's for real men, not for me. Then I got used to it and obviously wanted to do more.\"</p><p>His rivals may wish he had stuck with the original assessment.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419834166|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|a033f461fc923aadcac27672348b33834d78fd3d -->",

        "headline":"Who should England start at centre against Australia at Twickenham?",
        "body":"<p>An arresting feature of England's last autumn international campaign was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/dec/01/england-new-zealand-autumn-international\" title=\"\">Manu Tuilagi's 15-minute, match-turning rampage through the New Zealand midfield</a> to ensure that what had been a disappointing campaign ended on the highest of notes in what remains the All Blacks' only defeat since August 2011.</p><p>Tuilagi, then 21, is a player who by the 2015 World Cup will be a centre &nbsp;of experience rather than potential, but as the England head coach Stuart Lancaster prepares for the gathering of his squad in Leeds next week in advance of next month's Tests against Australia, Argentina and New Zealand, midfield will vex him more than any other area, and more than the captaincy.</p><p>Lancaster on Wednesday added Henry Trinder and Joel Tomkins to the elite squad as replacements for Tuilagi and Brad Barritt, who will out of action until December &nbsp;because of an ankle injury. Trinder, 24, has missed Gloucester's last two matches because of a hamstring problem, and may sit it out this weekend when his team travel to Munster, so Northampton's Luther Burrell was added as injury cover.</p><p>The trio join Billy Twelvetrees and Kyle Eastmond as the centres in the squad, five players with a total of seven caps and four Test starts between them, although Owen Farrell, one of three outside-halves in the 34, is an option at inside-centre, a position he regularly filled at Saracens last season.</p><p>Twelvetrees and Burrell are 12s, Trinder and Tomkins 13s with Eastmond comfortable in both positions. At the squad announcement, Lancaster kept repeating the word form: Tomkins and Burrell have been part of consistent teams this season, Saracens and Northampton respectively, but Twelvetrees and Trinder have had to make something out of the little supplied to them by the Gloucester eight.</p><p>Mike Tindall, the former England centre and player-coach at Gloucester, had called last month for England to consider Trinder as one of the solutions to their midfield injury crisis, calling him the \"form player of the year by quite a long way\" at Kingsholm. That his elevation came as a surprise was as a result of his absence from the Saxons squad that was named in the summer after two seasons of injury problems. Indeed he has only made the rare leap straight into the elite set-up after the consent of Premiership Rugby who could have blocked the double jump under the terms of its elite player agreement with the Rugby Football Union.</p><p>\"He had an outstanding Churchill Cup when I coached the Saxons a couple of years ago and he has started the season really well,\" said Lancaster. \"We have had a good look at him and he is chosen on merit. I know Luther well from his time at Leeds and he has come on since the summer tour to Argentina. Joel has also stood out and it is tough on Jonathan Joseph, as I told him. The others have made a difference and centre is such a competitive position that players have to show the X-factor.\"</p><p>The stand-out centres have been Burrell and Tomkins, but would Lancaster risk an uncapped midfield pairing on 2 November against Australia who, for all their deficiencies in the tight five, remain one of the more inventive teams behind. It appears to be a matter of who starts alongside Twelvetrees, who made a notable impact on his Test debut against Scotland last February.</p><p>\"Trinder and Tomkins have impressed us this season,\" said the England backs coach, Andy Farrell. \"Harry has shown maturity to go with his quick feet and hands and a strong kicking game. He has been sensational. Joel has now reached the point where rugby union is instinctive to him and all credit to Saracens for playing him regularly last season: we are seeing the fruits of that.\"</p><p>Nigel Davies, the head coach at Gloucester and who enjoyed a long career as a centre for both Llanelli and Wales, has described Trinder as the complete package in his position. \"He's got a fantastic skill-set, second to none – and I've seen a lot of centres play in my time,\" said Davies.</p><p>The player himself sought to downplay expectations about his immediate hopes of playing in the autumn following his selection. \"Getting back into the mix with England was what I set out to do at the start of the season,\" he said. \"All I could do was play really well and hopefully be in contention. I got a few injuries last season that put me off track so it's good to be back in there. The three autumn Tests are all massive games and it would be an experience if I were to be selected for any of those.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420161196|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|7745d5db9669824639232be9b42156bfc41bb8fd -->",

He had been preparing for a match against the All Blacks on 2 November and complained of a headache on Tuesday night when he returned to Tokyo from an inspection of the Brave Blossoms' training camp.</p><p>White, among Jones's closest friends, told <a href=\"http://keo.co.za/2013/10/16/jones-suffers-stroke/\" title=\"\">Keo.co.za</a> that he had spoken to his wife and that the positive was that he was able to speak.</p><p>\"He is in intensive care and he currently doesn't have movement on his left side but he is talking – and typical of Eddie – it's about the challenge of the All Blacks and the subsequent European tour,\" White said. \"My understanding is he will be in intensive care for at least the next week.\"</p><p>White saw Jones, who is just 53, in Durban last week and was shocked by the news. \"My prayers and thoughts are with him, as I am sure will be the case with all those who know him and have had the privilege of working with him,\" said White.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420114866|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|8a21d492294c6c074702b9ddad28be68bbb11463 -->",

The Scarlets coach, Simon Easterby, felt a yellow card would have been sufficient.</p><p>The red card received by Lifeimi Mafi in the 27-22 defeat at Gloucester means the Perpignan centre will also appear at the disciplinary hearing in Dublin.</p><p>Mafi was sent off in the 74th minute for a dangerous tackle on Ryan Mills.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420047777|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|b3cfcd9baf34d220450780c5b9da15f3a15782c3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Stuart Lancaster has made four changes to England's Elite Player Squad for the autumn international series which begins on 2 November.</p><p>Centres Joel Tomkins, Henry Trinder and Luther Burrell have all been included in a 34-man squad by the England head coach following injuries to Leicester's Manu Tuilagi and Saracens' Brad Barritt.</p><p>There is one other change, among the forwards, where Exeter's Tom Johnson has been given the nod over his Northampton rival Calum Clark to take the step up into the elite squad from the Saxons. Johnson offers Lancaster cover for Tom Wood on the blindside flank with Tom Croft ruled out for the season with a knee injury.</p><p>Alex Corbisiero is included in the squad despite also picking up a knee problem that could rule him out of the start of the series, which begins against Australia on 2 November at Twickenham followed by games on successive weekends against Argentina and world champions New Zealand. Lancaster expects the prop, who has had fluid drained from the knee that has troubled him in recent seasons, and will not be able to put weight on it for another week, to be back in action in a few weeks.</p><p>\"We have not ruled out Alex from any of next month's internationals,\" said Lancaster. \"He has to put his knee up this week as part of his rehab. I hope he will come through and be available for some if not all of the matches. I am optimistic about his long-term prospects: with good management, we can see him through beyond 2015.\"</p><p>Lancaster will decide his captain when the squad gathers next week having refused to answer speculation that he would be replacing one back rower, Chris Robshaw, for another, Tom Wood. He said he was happy with the form of his players, but nearly half the squad, 16, are playing for clubs who were wither poor or fickle in the first five weeks of the season, including Robshaw's Harlequins.</p><p>The squad will assemble in Leeds next Monday after this weekend's Heineken Cup games for a pre-series camp.</p><p>Speaking at Lloyd's of London, Lancaster said: \"We have been looking forward to this QBE Internationals series ever since we got back from Argentina. As a coaching group we have watched a lot of rugby and we are pleased with the form of the squad. The camp is an important part of our preparation and we are looking forward to meeting up.</p><p>\"Inevitably there have been some injuries and there is still a big European weekend ahead. But injures always create opportunities and we are pleased to call up Tom Johnson, Joel Tomkins, Henry Trinder and Luther Burrell into the senior EPS, with Luther joining us as injury cover. We have three major Tests ahead of us and we are looking forward to the challenge.\"</p><h2>England's EPS squad for the QBE autumn internationals</h2><p><strong>Forwards</strong> David Attwood (Bath), Dan Cole (Leicester), Alex Corbisiero (Northampton), Tom Johnson (Exeter Chiefs), Dylan Hartley (Northampton), Matt Kvesic (Gloucester), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Ben Morgan (Gloucester), Geoff Parling (Leicester), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Billy Vunipola (Saracens), Mako Vunipola (Saracens), David Wilson (Bath), Tom Wood (Northampton), Tom Youngs (Leicester )</p><p><strong>Backs</strong> Chris Ashton (Saracens), Mike Brown (Harlequins), Freddie Burns (Gloucester), Luther Burrell (Northampton), Danny Care (Harlequins), Lee Dickson (Northampton), Kyle Eastmond (Bath), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Toby Flood (Leicester), Ben Foden (Northampton), Alex Goode (Saracens), Henry Trinder (Gloucester), Joel Tomkins (Saracens), Billy Twelvetrees (Gloucester), Christian Wade (Wasps), Marland Yarde (London Irish), Ben Youngs (Leicester)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420117519|2013-10-16T18:19:29Z|5494f1e2313be9e32ec78682260b59d9670270ac -->",
