        "trailText":"Sebastian Vettel's hard-fought victory in the Japan Grand Prix put him on the verge of his fourth consecutive world championship",
        "headline":"Sebastian Vettel's Japan win earns glowing praise from Christian Horner",
        "body":"<p>Sebastian Vettel once again revelled in the glorious, precise curves of Suzuka, a circuit that favours risk with reward, whose dips and climbs offer elation and danger in equal measure, where errors are costly. The drivers know it. The drivers love it – not least Vettel, who has four wins from five visits here and a victory that has put him on the edge of claiming his&nbsp;fourth consecutive world championship.</p><p>The win, a hard-fought, tense and, in Vettel's and his team's case, clever race, was a thriller and a long way from the recent processions that have turned off so many fans.</p><p>Fernando Alonso finished fourth, which denied Vettel the title on the day, but the German goes to the next round in India knowing that he will be champion with a finish in the top five – almost a certainty, barring a failure.</p><p>It will put him on a par with the only two drivers to have won four world titles in a row – Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher. On the evidence of this race, a combination of speed and subtlety, it will be deserved.</p><p>Vettel and his team-mate Mark Webber were mugged off the start by the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, who quickly showed he had the measure of the track and led with skill. It meant Red Bull, accustomed to managing races from the front, had to think on their feet on this occasion.</p><p>Webber worked his tyres hard in the opening stint and had to come in on lap nine, too soon to make a two-stop strategy work, but Vettel had conserved his rubber, opening up the chance to make fewer stops and presenting the possibility of a showdown with his team-mate at the end of the race. It also left Grosjean struggling on the harder tyres, sandwiched between the two and unable to cover both options. Red Bull were playing chess with their drivers and Vettel's moves gave him checkmate.</p><p>Staying out for 23 laps on his second stint and eking out the last vestiges of grip from his tyres brought Vettel out behind Grosjean, also two-stopping, and the German overtook in a decisive move down the main straight. But when Webber exited from his final stop with fresh tyres he could not overtake the Frenchman until the penultimate lap, enough for a Red Bull one-two but too late to catch his team-mate.</p><p>The German had won, not with the sledgehammer of raw pace but with the scalpel of race craft, staying out longer in his stints on worn rubber and, despite several lock-ups, managing to control the gaps to his rivals to have the advantage at the end.</p><p>Red Bull's team principal, Christian Horner, said the race was \"one of the best races strategically we have ever operated\". That is praise indeed from the head of a team that has won the past three constructors' championships.</p><p>His driver concurred. \"I really tried to manage the gaps in the beginning of the stint and then close the gap, which worked brilliantly, especially with Romain,\" Vettel said. \"Great strategy. It obviously worked. We didn't lose patience early on and tried obviously to make the stints as long as&nbsp;possible to help us at the end of the race.\"</p><p>Horner, again, was generous in praise of Vettel, keen to stress that when the German takes his fourth title it will be because there is more to him than raw pace. \"He manages to adapt. He played the thinking game today; he watched and waited in that first stint, he preserved his tyres,\" Horner said. \"He knew he wasn't going to get priority in the first pit stop because we had discussed it before the race. But he was very smart in the way he handled the race and created the options.\"</p><p>It is a combination of seat-of-the-pants skills and driving intelligence that has seen Vettel put together five consecutive wins, with four races remaining this season. Jim Clark achieved a run of six, Schumacher of six and seven and Alberto Ascari seven (nine counted across 1952-1953). Vettel's form and the pace of his car suggest he could challenge their totals. Certainly Horner has not ruled it out.</p><p>\"Sebastian has won every race since the summer break,\" he said. \"There are still four to go and we will try to carry this momentum into the last four. We couldn't have imagined he would have this run of success but the way he is driving is quite supreme.\"</p><p>Yet Webber, too, was happy with the result in his last F1 appearance at Suzuka. It was his best finish since the British Grand Prix and, despite being frustrated as Grosjean held him off at the end, he was magnanimous towards the Frenchman whom last year he described as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/07/f1-sebastian-vettel-japanese-grand-prix\" title=\"\">\"first-lap nutcase\"</a> after he punted him off at the second corner. \"I think it's very clear that Romain has a very different mental approach to the job at the moment this year,\" Webber said. \"He's driven some quite strong races, putting together the whole weekend, which is a sign of a driver starting to get a bit more relaxed and confident.</p><p>\"You know, we're not here to blow smoke up his arse but in the end he's doing a very good job this year.\"</p><p>As for Alonso, the Spaniard knows \"it's only a matter of time before he [Vettel] will be champion\".</p><p>Alonso, who finished 45 seconds down, added: \"We have different goals now. We will continue to try to do our best on Sundays and, when it is mathematically settled, we will congratulate him.\"</p><p>As for Vettel, his pleasure at the win and admiration for the fans (whose numbers and warm embrace for everything about F1 is something many circuits can only dream of - needless to say there was, rightly, no booing) came through in his enthusiasm and his honesty on what has been a considerable journey to almost becoming a four-time world champion.</p><p>\"When I was small, I was dreaming about Formula One and honestly never thought that one day I would be able to test one of these cars,\" he said after the race. \"First time I tested the car I shit myself the first couple of laps and I thought, all right, that's for real men, not for me. Then I got used to it and obviously wanted to do more.\"</p><p>His rivals may wish he had stuck with the original assessment.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419834166|2013-10-16T10:54:19Z|15650b0bd467f486875387f36006bc722b519475 -->",

The 26-year-old was in a Porsche 996 as a passenger when it hit the barriers at the circuit on Tuesday. He had been leading the drivers' championship of the Porsche Supercup series, all of the races for which take place at Formula One events.</p><p>Edwards is understood to have been killed instantly when the car left the track and impacted with a tyre wall on the outside of turn six at the track in Ipswich, 25 miles west of Brisbane. The driver was extracted from the wreckage, which had caught fire, by emergency services and was taken to intensive care with life-threatening injuries.</p><p>It is understood it took three hours to remove the driver from the car. Inspector Dave Preston of Queensland police said it had been a difficult operation to get the man out of the mangled wreckage: \"The fire and rescue had to do extensive work in relation to extracting and opening the vehicle up sufficiently to remove him. He was trapped for some time.\"</p><p>The driver, who has yet to be named, was a 20-year-old Brisbane man. His family were understood to be trackside at the time. He was pinned from the waist down in the wreckage for three hours after the crash took place at 11.30am, after which he was airlifted to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.</p><p>Edwards was the son of Guy Edwards who competed in Formula One and the 24 Hours of Le Mans during the 1970s and 1980s and was one of the drivers who helped remove <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/14/james-hunt-niki-lauda-summer-of-speed\" title=\"\">Niki Lauda from his burning car at the 1976 German Grand Prix</a> at the Nürburgring.</p><p>Sean Edwards won the European GT3 Championship in 2006 and gone on to race in the FIA GT Championship, the American Le Mans Series, the Le Mans 24 hours and the Porsche Supercup and Porsche Supercup Germany series. He finished third  in a Porsche in the GT2 class at his very first 24 hour race, at Spa in 2007.</p><p>Having won the Dubai 24 Hours last year he did so again in 2013 and was also a winner for the Black Falcon team at the Nürburgring 24 this year and took the Long Beach round of the American Le Mans series in the GTC class.</p><p>Racing for the Allyouneed by Project 1 team in this year's Porsche Supercup, he had victories in Spain, Monaco and Hungary and was leading the championship by 18 points with two races at Yas Marina due to have taken place on 2-3 November.</p><p>He had also recently taken part in the making of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/15/rush-review-kermode\" title=\"\">film Rush</a>, recounting the 1976 F1 battle between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, advising on the racing scenes and in some parts portraying his father.</p><p>The crash comes just five months after another death at Queensland Raceway. In June a 23-year-old motorbike rider was killed when he hit the back wheel of another rider.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419989015|2013-10-16T10:54:19Z|9b5214757b70fe73268b43381e324351035b54fa -->",
