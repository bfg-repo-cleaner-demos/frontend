Bailiffs forced entry while the tenants were at work and changed the locks. The lettings agent had failed to verify that the landlord had the authority to rent out the property and it turned out she was being evicted by her mortgage lender. The couple were not even allowed back in to remove their belongings. <em>Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheTenantsVoice.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>The Tenants Voice</em></a></p><p></p><h2>The agent who failed to call the police</h2><p>A lettings agent in Holland Park arrived at a property with a prospective tenant to find the front door hanging on its hinges.

We were on the third floor of a five-storey block.\" <em>Source: Rightmove.co.uk</em></p><p></p><p>First-time buyers are particularly vulnerable to incompetent agents, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says, claiming most are forced to \"fly blind\" through the \"biggest purchase of their lives\". But sellers also need to know they are not paying huge fees to someone who is sleeping on the job – maybe even literally if the tales above are anything to go by. Here are a few things you can do to reduce your chances of encountering a hapless estate agent:</p><p></p><p>1) Only deal with agents supervised by the property ombudsman. These agents must follow the ombudsman's code of practice and you can get up to £25,000 compensation if they break the code. Find participating agents from <a href=\"http://www.tpos.co.uk\" title=\"\">The Property Ombudsman</a>.</p><p></p><p>2) Get recommendations from friends who have both bought and sold in the area. If you are selling up you will want to know the agent is polite to would-be buyers and turns up on time for appointments, as he or she will be representing you.</p><p></p><p>3) Value the property yourself. You can do this online for free at <a href=\"http://www.Zoopla.co.uk\" title=\"\">Zoopla.co.uk</a> or pay <a href=\"http://www.Hometrack.co.uk\" title=\"\">Hometrack.co.uk</a> £19.95 for a detailed property valuation report based on the same database used by mortgage lenders.</p><p></p><p>4) Deal directly with sellers and buyers using <a href=\"http://www.Tepilo.com\" title=\"Tepilo website\">Tepilo</a>. The property search engine, set up by Channel 4 TV presenter Sarah Beeny, allows homeowners to advertise directly to sellers, avoiding the need for estate agents completely. The site is free with no commission fees to pay. Alternatively, try fee-charging sites like <a href=\"http://www.emoov.co.uk\" title=\"emoov.co.uk\">emoov.co.uk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.housesimple.co.uk\" title=\"House Simple\">House Simple</a>.</p><p></p><p>5) Contact potential sellers in person. Visit your chosen area and contact the sellers of properties you like directly, perhaps by popping a card through the door. Tell them you are interested in buying their home and give your contact number. They may be considering selling up and be glad to bypass agency fees.</p><p></p><p>6) Look at how the agent markets other properties. If the descriptions on its website tend towards the jocular, and you seek seriousness, or the pictures look like they were taken through a dirty window, you might want to steer clear – even if the agent is charging the lowest commission.</p><p></p><p>7) Check any agent you hire is a member of the National Association of Estate Agents. They must undergo professional development training each year and follow a voluntary code of conduct. There is a disciplinary process which includes penalties up to £5,000 for each rule broken. Search the directory of members at <a href=\"http://www.naea.co.uk\" title=\"\">NAEA.co.uk</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421301439|2013-11-05T11:03:48Z|ed4aa36475e83a9b743cfaf858c8fea069cefaa1 -->",
